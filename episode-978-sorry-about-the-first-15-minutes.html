            <span class="text">into the rental system and expect that rents will stay low instead of landlords jacking up their rents to match the new money coming into the system. Rents go up. Supply and demand is really what drives our economic system. And it&#39;s surprising to me that some of these right-wing politicians who are so devoted to capitalism seem to miss the very first step of it. And that is that supply and demand will equalize at a set price depending on where the demand and supply slopes meet. So this isn&#39;t a simple problem with a simple solution. But I tell you, it&#39;s not as simple as Scott Morrison makes it. And isn&#39;t it just like the 10,000th time that guy&#39;s put his foot in his mouth? Like he is just tragic.

That was announced, and that&#39;s being floated out. This, of course, coming just before the federal budget, which I also want to talk about shortly. But Carter, when you saw it, let&#39;s start with you here. When you saw the announcement here, where did you kind of lean? Were you thinking this was right on schedule, the lane that the liberals would occupy? Did you feel like this was a bit ambitious?

I mean, just even the hailstorm that happened here in Calgary, up in northeast Calgary a couple years ago, you can still see the damage that that hailstorm caused and the impact that it had on real people&#39;s lives so when when everybody is out screaming about how this uh this change will have impact on real people&#39;s lives i always try and figure out what the balance is because the balance should be the impact from the actual climate change that is occurring and the impact um that</span>

And so when you look at some of these goals, right, like I mentioned, the one off the top regarding the 42% reduction from the 2019 last inventory on emissions, the Liberal government also saying that by 2026, they want 20% of all new passenger vehicles sold to be electric. By 2030, 60% that, you know, by 2030, they&#39;re kind of aiming for these goals that the carbon tax would be at 38 additional cents a liter.</span>

And I think one of the things that you have to sort of grapple with when you are in particular in a jurisdiction like Alberta, but I think really anywhere where you&#39;re more carbon dependent is, what the hell does this look like for you in 10 years? What are we going to be doing in 10 years? And how are we getting on this bus? Because otherwise, it&#39;s going to run us right the hell over.</span>

But I think that we don&#39;t understand, like the transportation industry, when we start to see those zero emission vehicles come across in the, you know, the large trucks, the transport trucks, that coupled with vehicle autonomy, the ability for them to drive themselves is going to be a significant change. And when that happens, the cost advantages are going to be so dramatic that we will see really big shifts to that type of technology in a very short period of time. You know, that auto driving technology, when it happens, suddenly those trucks can run 24-7 and they just get to where they&#39;re going. and</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m curious to get your take, starting with you and then jumping off to Corey, around the conservative response here, specifically to how they&#39;ve been positioning this. So in the past, the conservative response, you know, might be to scoff at, might be to reject the premise of a climate plan. They haven&#39;t done that this time. They say they support emissions reductions, but not Trudeau&#39;s goal, Harper&#39;s 2030 goal, which is a much lower percentage. It&#39;s that 30% below 2005 levels versus that 40% to 45% that the Trudeau goal is going for. What do you make of the conservative strategy here and the conservative message? Are you in on what they&#39;re trying to do here by going back to Harper, not rejecting it entirely, maybe trying to come across as a little bit reasonable as they try to paint the liberals as a more radical left agenda, so to speak? Does this kind of give them room to appear reasonable with their previous goal that Harper kind of put on the table?</span>

The system itself might change fast enough without many market interventions to get to the conservative&#39;s point of view but there&#39;s also one more problem so and the other problem is what&#39;s the difference between 30 and 40 percent right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">this 42% was a non-solution, a fantasy. You know, she pointed out that there&#39;s an inherent unfairness in the scheme, that the oil and gas sector produces 26% of emissions, transportation produces 25%. Oil and gas has to hit this 42% cut while it&#39;s just 11% for transportation. How is that fair? I&#39;m curious to get your strategic and message mind to her opposition to Trudeau&#39;s climate plan, of course, with the obvious caveat and then the point to be made clearly that, you know, she&#39;s on the progressive side of the political spectrum here. So interesting to see her remarks on something like this.</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m very much of two minds on it, I have to say, because my first reaction was, oh, for fuck&#39;s sake, are you kidding me? because we all know fundamentally that even 42% is not enough. Like the world is on fucking fire and it&#39;s time to do something about it. And the foot dragging that we&#39;ve been doing is too much. I&#39;m so sick of every summer there just being another forest fire somewhere that I love just burning down and polluting my cities, just choking them. If you live in the West, you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about. We can&#39;t hand wave it away anymore. You know, it&#39;s gone from, well, this is a one in a hundred year event to our next one in a hundred year event to our third, to our fourth. Guess what? Just events now. The world is in trouble and we need to do something about it.</span>

            <span class="text">It&#39;s hard, however, to dispute the specifics of what she said in terms of like the equity of dealing with it between the various industries. And of course, there is also the practicalities of how in the world are we going to do this because a climate plan that ignores working people or a climate plan that is not attainable is one that&#39;s going to have a backlash to it. And so I do take her point on that. But I think a more constructive approach would have been not rebutting the reductions to oil and gas, but instead saying, well, it&#39;s also important that transportation does its part. And that&#39;s what I would have been looking more for than the suggestion that we just can&#39;t do it and throwing up our hands. Because, you know, we</span>

And I have a lot of confidence in the technical capacity of our industry. They are looking for the incentives that are coming from the federal government. They are looking for the opportunities that are coming from the federal government and they will rise to the task of achieving this goal and in fact, exceeding this goal as they have every other step of the way when we&#39;ve asked them to achieve something environmentally. The Canadian oil and gas industry is amongst the best in the world. and we need to they know the challenge they&#39;ve all written the challenge into their strategic plans into their 10-year plans into their 20-year plans they know where they&#39;re going and i want them to lead so and they</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">your... Well, Carter said so much of what I want to say, and I agree with it emphatically. One of the things that I think the NDP really erred on in 2019 was how all in they went in the preceding year on oil and gas. And it&#39;s not because they they were wrong about the importance to the economy for some of this market access. And the oil industry was really, really challenged by our lack of what we call takeaway capacity and our ability to get product to market because it&#39;s a commodity and the marginal barrel sets the price. And when you&#39;ve got oil that people literally cannot get rid of, the price of oil will plummet and the effect will be severe. Because here in Alberta, we use that to pay for road schools and hospitals, all of the good things that, you know, the public services we rely on. But by raising the issue of oil and gas so much, by continually talking about it, by fighting about it, by making it the big scene, and by, you know, having the big conversation about this with the UCP, you played right into them, right? This is kind of ballot box 101. You don&#39;t set your ballot question on the other guy&#39;s strong turf. And if your big issue is supporting oil and gas, you&#39;re not going to vote vote NDP.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You&#39;re not going to vote NDP. So you&#39;ve got to change the big issue. You&#39;ve got to change the conversation. And in 2023, election looming here in Alberta, the big issue can&#39;t be support for oil and gas, or the NDP are not going to win. It&#39;s as simple as that, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the other thing is, it&#39;s very easy, because of the amount of money oil and gas has, and the amount of influence oil and gas has in a province like Alberta, to believe that there is a a certain omnipotence to the industry, it&#39;s not really there. The Alberta economy is not as undiversified as people think or as people act. And when you look at the number of people who work directly in oil and gas, it&#39;s a smaller percent of the workforce than work directly in the finance sector in Ontario. It&#39;s not discounting its economic impact.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But there&#39;s fewer all the time. Fewer and fewer Albertans think of themselves as oil and gas dependent, even those that frankly probably are because they work adjacent to the industry. So you can&#39;t the other reason not hit your start of this wagon is that&#39;s not what people think is next. It&#39;s not even what people think is now for most of this province. So give them a now give them a next and acknowledge that if you&#39;re now and next is oil and gas, you&#39;re not an NDP voter and you&#39;re not accessible to the NDP.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I want to talk to you about something that you actually brought up, which was the carbon tax tax elements here. You brought it up in the confines of the NDP, their climate leadership plan. Talk to me about the federal carbon tax. I think the most intriguing element to me about this announcement on the federal side, we&#39;re going to kind of zoom back out to the federal, was their desire</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">desire to enshrine it regardless of who&#39;s in government, a price on carbon, that they wanted to kind of keep this guarantee to see the carbon tax climb to the levels the the government has forecast, regardless of who&#39;s in government with this approach, that it would be a fixed price over a time period known as carbon contracts for differences. The federal emission plan would enshrine future price levels and contracts between the government and low carbon project investors, thereby de-risking, you know, the low carbon investments. What do you kind of think about this in terms of trying to future, quite literally future-proof, a very controversial piece of policy, as we&#39;ve talked about in previous episodes, So it&#39;s in a time where, yes, you may have an agreement with the NDP about your future governance, but people will shift, governments will shift, and there&#39;s a popularity on the other side of the house, on the conservative side, that will more than likely want to reject this. I&#39;m curious to get your take on this political maneuvering and thereby the policy maneuvering that will be certainly required thereafter. Your thoughts on this?</span>

            <span class="text">right? And so even when governments – so in my lifetime, we&#39;ve had two controversial taxes introduced, the GST brought in by the conservatives and the carbon tax brought in by the liberals. And we can just use Alberta as a microcosm because, of course, Rachel Notley&#39;s NDP government brought in a carbon tax prior to the federal carbon tax taking effect. And so we had our own carbon tax. So the federal one didn&#39;t apply. Jason Kenney came in and promptly repealed the</span>

            <span class="text">He didn&#39;t. I mean, the only tax change that we saw was Stephen Harper giving up 2 percent, which was, you know, in most jurisdictions occupied by the provincial government. So, I mean, it&#39;s tricky. It&#39;s a tricky thing to enshrine a tax, but it&#39;s also a tricky thing to walk away from a tax because ultimately the urge to spend is significant and the ability to increase revenue or create revenue is hard. So when these taxes are essentially, if you will, bought and paid for by the previous governments, we tend not to undo that. So enshrining it through contracts and enshrining it through some sort of business predictability, it&#39;s actually – sure,</span>

Because they would rather make the point than make the profit or sort of make policy sense if you want to broaden it. And so, I don&#39;t know. No, I mean, I&#39;m nervous.

No, probably not, because they still end up getting money in their jeans. And if you happen to be the concrete industry, that means in the short term, you&#39;ll pay less or middle term. And when the world turns back around and continues to reduce carbon, you will have had much of that paid for as you started making transitions during the liberal times.

You know, some of that narrative that we&#39;ve heard is that anything good that happens, the government takes credit for. This is one of the lines, right? Anything bad that happens or that doesn&#39;t seem in the plan, the NDP couldn&#39;t get it in there. And they&#39;re already starting to face some of that criticism. Well, why isn&#39;t this more ambitious? Why are some of your policy points, NDP, not found in here? This is a liberal copy and paste of their platform. Where are you to the table? I&#39;m curious to view it through, of course, the political strategy lens, which is what we do, but also talk about it from the crisis perspective.

You&#39;re welcome. You&#39;re welcome. You&#39;re welcome. Like just that victory lap, you&#39;re welcome over and over as the numbers get bigger and they start with B rather than M in terms of billions rather than millions.

Guys, I want to talk about the budget coming up next Thursday. Krista Freeland, our Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister, will get up and introduce the budget. To get us started on this, Corey, I want to actually get both your perspectives and just your honest, hot takes on this. We&#39;ve heard two versions of what this budget could look like. Prior to this NDP liberal agreement, we heard some ground softening during the height of the initial first days of the Russian invasion into Ukraine that we might be looking at, I shouldn&#39;t say this word because it wasn&#39;t necessarily repeated, but a version of liberal austerity here, right? Back to basics is what we heard. We heard the back to basics budget. Now with the agreement, people are expecting, at least in the other school of thought, jaw jaw-dropping numbers, that this gives them runway, license, opportunity to spend, spend, spend, ambitious, ambitious, ambitious. Corey, boring your phrase from last time, perhaps help Justin Trudeau pave the way for the most consequential prime ministership in a generation. Corey, from your hot take perspective, just a sentence or two, do you expect column A, back to basics, or column B, ambitious budget now that the liberal NDP partnership is solidified? I</span>

            <span class="text">well here&#39;s the thing and this is where i want i i kind of titled the segment, branding a budget, and Corey&#39;s already gotten into this a bit, which is, if this is expected to be a budget that is in that liberal NDP, you know, alliance, sort of spend big ambition game, I want to ask you guys about two things, ambition and brand, what would you do? Now that this agreement is under your belt? What would you think about? How would you brand this thing? Corey&#39;s already kind of given me the redefinition of basics. But we&#39;ve talked often on this podcast, in both general strategic terms, but also with specific budgets, provincially, federally, that it&#39;s a branding exercise. I find this moment to be very interesting for the liberal government, because the cloud cover of COVID is potentially over. They might be trying to extend it, trying to ensure that we&#39;ve forever changed because of COVID. We&#39;re now redefining what this country looks like. But you also need to sell that. And so, Carter, I want to get your thoughts on this first before I go to Corey and maybe have him expand on his that he laid out earlier. If you had carte blanche and strategic advisory right now to the Prime Minister and perhaps even Jagmeet Singh, give</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">give me the sense of the brand and the ambition that you would look at right now. And let&#39;s be like a strategy whiteboard here. What would you talk to them about? And what would you think about in terms of how they would present this thing to the Canadian public coming up next Thursday, a week from today?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that it&#39;s going to be like the one-time fix, right? Like, we are going in and we are fixing that which is wrong. And we are going going to tackle it head on right now. And we&#39;re not waiting for different economic opportunities. We&#39;re not waiting for different times. This is it. This is the time when we need to actually see significant change for our country. And that&#39;s why this budget is as far reaching as it is. It is designed to create opportunity.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">opportunity. And it&#39;s designed to fundamentally change the way that uh our country operates and that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing it all in one fell swoop we&#39;re not waiting to drag this out over the course of four years we&#39;re going boom this is what&#39;s going to happen and uh canadians are going to be thrilled with the outcome so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">mean forgettable, just so I&#39;m clear on this, do you mean forgettable by design? Or do you mean forgettable because it won&#39;t be material enough and as ambitious as some of the speculation around it suggests?</span>

I think it&#39;s going to have an awful lot of things that we already knew were in it. And even what would be sticker shock if we were comparing it to 2015 is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

We know that&#39;s coming because of various taxes on wealth that are being projected, but also just resource</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">resource revenue in the trajectory that we&#39;re already on here. And so they&#39;re not going to need to change a lot of what they need to do. And what I imagine they&#39;re going to want to do is paper their current suite of policies as basics, right? Like I agree with Carter. I don&#39;t actually think we&#39;re saying very different things here. So</span>

Because your point about sticker shock could open up a theory that says, we&#39;ve climatized to some insane numbers. Now&#39;s the time to throw out an even more insane number because we&#39;ve got the appetite for it. Do it all at once. Be majorly ambitious. I&#39;m not pushing this. I&#39;m just trying to</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;d be, of course, more concerned about deficit as percent of GDP, overall debt levels, debt as percent of GDP, whether we have the ability to burden it. But because any company is going to have a certain amount of debt because debt allows you to grow, make investments in the thing you want to make. Alexander Hamilton thought deficits should be eternal, right, because you&#39;re always just investing in the next things to come. But you can&#39;t just ignore the number, I guess, is the point. You can&#39;t let it run up forever. forever. If you&#39;re basically my age or older, you&#39;ll remember the backlash austerity of the 90s when it looked like our debt to GDP ratio was way out of control. It was out of control relative to other countries. And it was really affecting our economy more broadly. It was affecting people&#39;s confidence in the Canadian government. It was affecting our ability to do the things we wanted to do and have the ambitions we wanted to have. And the 90s were ultimately a a pretty unambitious time and you got to kind of find yourself a moderator like you got to hit the gas at the right level there if you want to be able to proceed with this if you truly believe in this agenda that&#39;s here now if it&#39;s just all cynical politics is just looking to get through the next couple of years and have people like you yeah run whatever number you want but you know there&#39;s a country underneath that okay</span>

Corey mentioned statistics about what the taxation rates were like in the 1950s, a period, I might add, where we did not suffer from growth challenges. And it wasn&#39;t just the United States.

Which is why we&#39;ve made childcare so much more affordable. That&#39;s why we&#39;re now tackling the cost of housing through these various programs. This is why we are, we&#39;re making gasoline more affordable. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll go that far. That seems to cut against their climate plans, but you get my point. It allows you to speak to the audience in that way. It allows you to speak to a more opinion class audience in terms of the deficits going down. We&#39;re just taking care of the fundamentals of government. We know that we need to balance these books. books and so it works uh works for a couple of distinct audiences that have anxieties that are not the same but have enough overlap and that overlap is fundamentally about a government that is that</span>

This is a budget that is 100% focused on making it easier for Canadians. We want to remove the threat of climate change actions around your house, right? We want to make it so that you don&#39;t have to worry about whether the forest that you you go to to camp during the summer, it&#39;s going to burn to the ground. We want to make it so that floods don&#39;t take out all of the means into one of our great metropolitan areas in the lower mainland, British Columbia. We want to make it so food is cheaper and is not going to be impacted by massive floods. We want to make it so that child care, I mean, right now we have a $10 a day child care deal across the country. across the country for people with children that is their number one expenditure says cory hogan so</span>

            <span class="text">Couldn&#39;t be more, Ian. Over the last 10 years, I have become more and more committed to climate change as an issue. And, you know, watching conservatives like Ken Bozenkul jump onto it as well, I think that there&#39;s tremendous opportunity to make real change in the climate climate and emissions part of the Canadian identity.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we need to do as much as we can. And yes, we need to do it in a way that protects Canadians from the significant burden that would otherwise fall on them. And so let&#39;s have the burden of action on climate change fall on the people who are benefiting most from the current action on climate change. And I think that we&#39;ve got to have a combination of wealth taxes and progressive income taxes, and we need the people who are able to pay more to pay more, and we&#39;ve got to switch hard. We&#39;ve got to pivot hard because we&#39;re in trouble here.</span>

That&#39;s what we do for Pierre Polyavra asking his supporters for defunding of the CBC. Are you in or out on the strategy here where he&#39;s going after the CBC? It&#39;s been tried and true for conservatives. He&#39;s back at that well right now, raising a shitstorm on it. In or out on the strategy?</span>

            <span class="text">increase spending almost across the board. The only exception is the CBC for conservatives. Conservatives, honest to God, want it cut. So Pierre is giving them what they want. And in general, that&#39;s a good strategy, as I&#39;ve articulated quite a few times through this podcast today.</span>

And, you know, this is right on the heel of some big climate announcements and a big deal with the NDP. So there&#39;s going to be some things in it that are going to fundamentally change the way we operate.</span>
