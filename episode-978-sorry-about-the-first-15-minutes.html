          <div class="said">into the rental system and expect that rents will stay low instead of landlords jacking up their rents to match the new money coming into the system. Rents go up. Supply and demand is really what drives our economic system. And it&#39;s surprising to me that some of these right-wing politicians who are so devoted to capitalism seem to miss the very first step of it. And that is that supply and demand will equalize at a set price depending on where the demand and supply slopes meet. So this isn&#39;t a simple problem with a simple solution. But I tell you, it&#39;s not as simple as Scott Morrison makes it. And isn&#39;t it just like the 10,000th time that guy&#39;s put his foot in his mouth? Like he is just tragic.

That was announced, and that&#39;s being floated out. This, of course, coming just before the federal budget, which I also want to talk about shortly. But Carter, when you saw it, let&#39;s start with you here. When you saw the announcement here, where did you kind of lean? Were you thinking this was right on schedule, the lane that the liberals would occupy? Did you feel like this was a bit ambitious?

By 2030, 60% that, you know, by 2030, they&#39;re kind of aiming for these goals that the carbon tax would be at 38 additional cents a liter.</div>

And when that happens, the cost advantages are going to be so dramatic that we will see really big shifts to that type of technology in a very short period of time.

          <div class="said">Carter, I&#39;m curious to get your take, starting with you and then jumping off to Corey, around the conservative response here, specifically to how they&#39;ve been positioning this. So in the past, the conservative response, you know, might be to scoff at, might be to reject the premise of a climate plan. They haven&#39;t done that this time. They say they support emissions reductions, but not Trudeau&#39;s goal, Harper&#39;s 2030 goal, which is a much lower percentage. It&#39;s that 30% below 2005 levels versus that 40% to 45% that the Trudeau goal is going for. What do you make of the conservative strategy here and the conservative message? Are you in on what they&#39;re trying to do here by going back to Harper, not rejecting it entirely, maybe trying to come across as a little bit reasonable as they try to paint the liberals as a more radical left agenda, so to speak? Does this kind of give them room to appear reasonable with their previous goal that Harper kind of put on the table?</div>

Oil and gas has to hit this 42% cut while it&#39;s just 11% for transportation. How is that fair? I&#39;m curious to get your strategic and message mind to her opposition to Trudeau&#39;s climate plan, of course, with the obvious caveat and then the point to be made clearly that, you know, she&#39;s on the progressive side of the political spectrum here.

Like the world is on fucking fire and it&#39;s time to do something about it. And the foot dragging that we&#39;ve been doing is too much. I&#39;m so sick of every summer there just being another forest fire somewhere that I love just burning down and polluting my cities, just choking them. If you live in the West, you know exactly what I&#39;m talking about. We can&#39;t hand wave it away anymore.

And of course, there is also the practicalities of how in the world are we going to do this because a climate plan that ignores working people or a climate plan that is not attainable is one that&#39;s going to have a backlash to it. And so I do take her point on that. But I think a more constructive approach would have been not rebutting the reductions to oil and gas, but instead saying, well, it&#39;s also important that transportation does its part.

I actually would have much preferred it if she said, you know what, we stood up on a stage here in Alberta with industry leaders. and we instituted a real carbon tax because the industry knew that it was the right thing to do. And I have a lot of confidence in the technical capacity of our industry. They are looking for the incentives that are coming from the federal government. They are looking for the opportunities that are coming from the federal government and they will rise to the task of achieving this goal and in fact, exceeding this goal as they have every other step of the way when we&#39;ve asked them to achieve something environmentally.

          <div class="said">your... Well, Carter said so much of what I want to say, and I agree with it emphatically. One of the things that I think the NDP really erred on in 2019 was how all in they went in the preceding year on oil and gas. And it&#39;s not because they they were wrong about the importance to the economy for some of this market access. And the oil industry was really, really challenged by our lack of what we call takeaway capacity and our ability to get product to market because it&#39;s a commodity and the marginal barrel sets the price. And when you&#39;ve got oil that people literally cannot get rid of, the price of oil will plummet and the effect will be severe. Because here in Alberta, we use that to pay for road schools and hospitals, all of the good things that, you know, the public services we rely on. But by raising the issue of oil and gas so much, by continually talking about it, by fighting about it, by making it the big scene, and by, you know, having the big conversation about this with the UCP, you played right into them, right? This is kind of ballot box 101. You don&#39;t set your ballot question on the other guy&#39;s strong turf. And if your big issue is supporting oil and gas, you&#39;re not going to vote vote NDP.</div>

          <div class="said">You&#39;re not going to vote NDP. So you&#39;ve got to change the big issue. You&#39;ve got to change the conversation. And in 2023, election looming here in Alberta, the big issue can&#39;t be support for oil and gas, or the NDP are not going to win. It&#39;s as simple as that, right?</div>

          <div class="said">the other thing is, it&#39;s very easy, because of the amount of money oil and gas has, and the amount of influence oil and gas has in a province like Alberta, to believe that there is a a certain omnipotence to the industry, it&#39;s not really there. The Alberta economy is not as undiversified as people think or as people act. And when you look at the number of people who work directly in oil and gas, it&#39;s a smaller percent of the workforce than work directly in the finance sector in Ontario. It&#39;s not discounting its economic impact.</div>

          <div class="said">But there&#39;s fewer all the time. Fewer and fewer Albertans think of themselves as oil and gas dependent, even those that frankly probably are because they work adjacent to the industry. So you can&#39;t the other reason not hit your start of this wagon is that&#39;s not what people think is next. It&#39;s not even what people think is now for most of this province. So give them a now give them a next and acknowledge that if you&#39;re now and next is oil and gas, you&#39;re not an NDP voter and you&#39;re not accessible to the NDP.</div>

You brought it up in the confines of the NDP, their climate leadership plan. Talk to me about the federal carbon tax.

          <div class="said">desire to enshrine it regardless of who&#39;s in government, a price on carbon, that they wanted to kind of keep this guarantee to see the carbon tax climb to the levels the the government has forecast, regardless of who&#39;s in government with this approach, that it would be a fixed price over a time period known as carbon contracts for differences. The federal emission plan would enshrine future price levels and contracts between the government and low carbon project investors, thereby de-risking, you know, the low carbon investments. What do you kind of think about this in terms of trying to future, quite literally future-proof, a very controversial piece of policy, as we&#39;ve talked about in previous episodes, So it&#39;s in a time where, yes, you may have an agreement with the NDP about your future governance, but people will shift, governments will shift, and there&#39;s a popularity on the other side of the house, on the conservative side, that will more than likely want to reject this. I&#39;m curious to get your take on this political maneuvering and thereby the policy maneuvering that will be certainly required thereafter. Your thoughts on this?</div>

I mean, the only tax change that we saw was Stephen Harper giving up 2 percent, which was, you know, in most jurisdictions occupied by the provincial government. So, I mean, it&#39;s tricky. It&#39;s a tricky thing to enshrine a tax, but it&#39;s also a tricky thing to walk away from a tax because ultimately the urge to spend is significant and the ability to increase revenue or create revenue is hard. So when these taxes are essentially, if you will, bought and paid for by the previous governments, we tend not to undo that.

          <div class="said">the crisis elements of this, I think, is the most interesting. Does this do enough for the crisis that we are in versus the politics that we can digest? And I&#39;m curious to view that through the lens of the NDP in your mind, which is they&#39;ve come to the table with this deal. Their criticism is already there. You know, some of that narrative that we&#39;ve heard is that anything good that happens, the government takes credit for. This is one of the lines, right? Anything bad that happens or that doesn&#39;t seem in the plan, the NDP couldn&#39;t get it in there. And they&#39;re already starting to face some of that criticism. Well, why isn&#39;t this more ambitious? Why are some of your policy points, NDP, not found in here? This is a liberal copy and paste of their platform. Where are you to the table? I&#39;m curious to view it through, of course, the political strategy lens, which is what we do, but also talk about it from the crisis perspective. If you&#39;re the NDP right now, how are you positioning yourself and talking about this with the moral compass that you kind of have now occupied in a more formal and official sense?</div>

To get us started on this, Corey, I want to actually get both your perspectives and just your honest, hot takes on this. We&#39;ve heard two versions of what this budget could look like. Prior to this NDP liberal agreement, we heard some ground softening during the height of the initial first days of the Russian invasion into Ukraine that we might be looking at, I shouldn&#39;t say this word because it wasn&#39;t necessarily repeated, but a version of liberal austerity here, right? Back to basics is what we heard. We heard the back to basics budget. Now with the agreement, people are expecting, at least in the other school of thought, jaw jaw-dropping numbers, that this gives them runway, license, opportunity to spend, spend, spend, ambitious, ambitious, ambitious. Corey, boring your phrase from last time, perhaps help Justin Trudeau pave the way for the most consequential prime ministership in a generation. Corey, from your hot take perspective, just a sentence or two, do you expect column A, back to basics, or column B, ambitious budget now that the liberal NDP partnership is solidified? I</div>

Now that this agreement is under your belt? What would you think about? How would you brand this thing? Corey&#39;s already kind of given me the redefinition of basics. But we&#39;ve talked often on this podcast, in both general strategic terms, but also with specific budgets, provincially, federally, that it&#39;s a branding exercise. I find this moment to be very interesting for the liberal government, because the cloud cover of COVID is potentially over. They might be trying to extend it, trying to ensure that we&#39;ve forever changed because of COVID. We&#39;re now redefining what this country looks like. But you also need to sell that. And so, Carter, I want to get your thoughts on this first before I go to Corey and maybe have him expand on his that he laid out earlier. If you had carte blanche and strategic advisory right now to the Prime Minister and perhaps even Jagmeet Singh, give</div>

          <div class="said">I&#39;d be, of course, more concerned about deficit as percent of GDP, overall debt levels, debt as percent of GDP, whether we have the ability to burden it. But because any company is going to have a certain amount of debt because debt allows you to grow, make investments in the thing you want to make. Alexander Hamilton thought deficits should be eternal, right, because you&#39;re always just investing in the next things to come. But you can&#39;t just ignore the number, I guess, is the point. You can&#39;t let it run up forever. forever. If you&#39;re basically my age or older, you&#39;ll remember the backlash austerity of the 90s when it looked like our debt to GDP ratio was way out of control. It was out of control relative to other countries. And it was really affecting our economy more broadly. It was affecting people&#39;s confidence in the Canadian government. It was affecting our ability to do the things we wanted to do and have the ambitions we wanted to have. And the 90s were ultimately a a pretty unambitious time and you got to kind of find yourself a moderator like you got to hit the gas at the right level there if you want to be able to proceed with this if you truly believe in this agenda that&#39;s here now if it&#39;s just all cynical politics is just looking to get through the next couple of years and have people like you yeah run whatever number you want but you know there&#39;s a country underneath that okay</div>

It&#39;s about affordability at this time, because that&#39;s the concern that the general population has in this moment. if you do the kind of sweeping change that that you&#39;ve asked us to do zane um then you have to recognize the pressures that the population feels themselves under and those pressures and you sell it you</div>

Which is why we&#39;ve made childcare so much more affordable. That&#39;s why we&#39;re now tackling the cost of housing through these various programs. This is why we are, we&#39;re making gasoline more affordable. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll go that far. That seems to cut against their climate plans, but you get my point. It allows you to speak to the audience in that way. It allows you to speak to a more opinion class audience in terms of the deficits going down. We&#39;re just taking care of the fundamentals of government. We know that we need to balance these books. books and so it works uh works for a couple of distinct audiences that have anxieties that are not the same but have enough overlap and that overlap is fundamentally about a government that is that</div>
