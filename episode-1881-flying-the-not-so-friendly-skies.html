Carter, Shannon, there&#39;s a lot of things to discuss, but I want to start at the beginning, which is we don&#39;t actually know the terms of this tentative deal just yet. We know a lot of it is surrounding this concept of this political flashpoint of work for no pay, which is, I think, revelatory to a lot of Canadians, which is that airline flight attendants do not get paid until the plane pushes back unless it is, quote unquote, in the air. So even service demonstrations, the time traveling in the airport, any of that stuff, they do do not get paid for, which has intensified the narrative and has gained them a lot of public support.</span>

And maybe this is a, using a West Wing reference, you kind of squint and you tilt your head and maybe this looks like a deal of some sort. That Carney the dealmaker, Carney the guy who gets shit done, Carney the guy who expedites things, got something done here. Domestically, sure. With a union, sure.

            <span class="text">of course, of course, defying a back to work order is a huge fucking deal in the labor movement. In this case, it helped the union show the public that the government was on the side of people who wanted you to work for free. This was an easy concept to understand. Over time, that may have changed. But the whole point here is that when the government gets out of the way and bargaining just moves along, the situation does become untenable for both sides and the teeter-totter evens out and they come to an agreement.</span>

The good news is they had the rest of the labor movement behind them in terms of the financial resources to be able to do this and the legal resources and all the rest of it.

I think that Air Canada accepted the same reality that the flight attendants accepted. And they were already negotiating on things like getting paid for their full working time, not for, you know, getting paid just for time in the air. There was already some big concessions on the table from the airline recognizing that they were in some sort of joint reality that they could both see that there was going to be an endgame at. I think that with the postal workers, there is not a joint understanding of what the future of Canada Post looks like. I think the future of Canada Post looks much different in 10 years than it does 10 years ago. go. I think that my reliance on my mail delivery has dramatically dropped over the course of the last 20 years, right? And I used to get all my checks in the mail. That was fun.

I think there&#39;s an unshared reality with the Postal Service, and I think that that&#39;s going to create much harder negotiations, much longer period of time, and ultimately, I think, will result in a strike and Christmas time this year. The fact that they&#39;re not striking until Christmastime tells me an awful lot about how they wish to achieve a deal. Maximum pressure, which is fine, but also maximum consequence. Maximum consequence meaning that they will probably be ordered back to work. Whereas if they struck right now, I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re going to be ordered back to work in nearly the same amount of time.</span>

            <span class="text">Do you want to, Shannon, add anything or take anything away in terms of why CUPE in this case was so successful? Of course, we&#39;re pending the deal and its ratification, but at least winning hearts and minds why it was so successful.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, one of the big reasons is that Canada Post is a crown and Air Canada is a private corporation. It&#39;s only like super old people like us that might remember that our Canada was once a crown. But so when people see it as sort of a for profit entity, you know, they see, OK, well, you have the money to be able to pay people for their time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And it&#39;s a much easier public relations exercise than, you know, Canada Post is a crown corporation and it, you know, might own associated entities like PeerLater, for example. It owns 90 percent of Pure Later. But it&#39;s a much more difficult, thorny kind of negotiating entity. Right. So right there in terms of the public perception. Number two, almost every Canadian has an experience with one of the two major airlines of like delays or reasons, you know, ways that they&#39;ve pissed them off. Right. Right. And so it&#39;s easy to kind of get public sympathy vis-a-vis the airline. Whereas, you know, I can&#39;t really think of outside of snowstorms and other things why my mail didn&#39;t show up. Right. It&#39;s a reliable letter.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s a reliable public service in that way. It&#39;s not something that that, you know, like I have to go through a 1-800 line and like, you know, wait for four hours on the phone to talk to a person to find my luggage. it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And so it&#39;s much harder to garner public sympathy.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And number three, the government has for years now taken the same view of things that Carter just articulated, which is that this is sort of a phase, a service that has to be somehow phased out and the public kind of sees it that way.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Right. And so that&#39;s the negotiating position at the table as well, which is why you&#39;re seeing such frequent labor disruptions because employer is stuck within a bit of a, it&#39;s not necessarily so much a bargaining mandate, but a bargaining position that essentially means that they have to be pretty intransigent at the table, right?</span>

            <span class="text">um so they&#39;re kind of managing that crown into some sort of decline and that&#39;s the problem here right they&#39;re going to have to decide is this an essential service how are we modernizing it and how are we doing so in a way that that guarantees uh you know sort of labor peace you also have two different types of unions right again back to the point about, you know, sort of democratic control of unions. The QP Air Canada component has a large presence in Quebec, a large presence out of Pearson, obviously, in Ontario. And they have a different just sort of ethic and vibe than CUPW, which has always been a much more vigilant, militant type of union. So you&#39;re just going to have a different bargaining mandate Coming up from the workers of what&#39;s going on at the table. And I think the final point is just like the Air Canada component blew</span>

Pretty rare that the public agrees with you on that, but they clearly read the moment correctly in terms of that particular piece acutely. But what lessons would you take? And this is to both of you. I&#39;ll start with Shannon. If you&#39;re other labor unions, other progressive groups, other groups trying to win hearts and minds from what CUPE just did.</span>

I mean, it was a professional communications plan that was implemented in advance so that people understood exactly uh the terms on on the union&#39;s you know on the union&#39;s side um that made it a much more professional dispute it made it harder for air canada to walk away from it it made it harder for the government to ignore it uh that is one of the consequences though of of of doing a really good communication structure is you&#39;re going to have uh more</span>

            <span class="text">doing the communications early, it&#39;s something that we talk about all the time, setting the table. That is the number one push for any organization, either side, right? If you want to be taken seriously, you&#39;ve got to do your communications in advance. You&#39;ve got to do your homework. If Air Canada wanted to do this better, they would have been talking about their existing offers and taking the free work, the unpaid labor right off the table, right off the bat. And they just didn&#39;t. They were caught completely flat-footed. I</span>

We kind of ignore talking about that as a daily concept in this country. Certain political parties do it. But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by my fellow Canadians being so on side with the flight attendants.

So I would have liked to, I mean, I&#39;d like to believe that the empathy that was exhibited over the course of the last week towards flight attendants was something that would last. I have a sense that as soon as someone gets onto an airplane and doesn&#39;t getting a cup of coffee that is uh that is tolerable um that empathy will evaporate and disappear uh because i i suspect that that that empathy exists more in in uh in in the abstract that it does in the actual reality of our of our class warfare um you</span>

            <span class="text">I think the danger for the left is, again, to my accusation of people being old timey, is to go back to the 70s and think about this in terms of, you know, old-timey class politics or class solidarity. This is always the danger for the left as we&#39;re living in the fucking past. There is not to say that there aren&#39;t progressive arguments, solutions, and campaigns and, you know, that can meet this moment for people, but it&#39;s not either anchored in someone else&#39;s experience. Like, let&#39;s say, I don&#39;t know, the mayor of fucking New York You know, what has that got to do with the politics in Brantford, Ontario, right, or in Calgary, Alberta or wherever else? The danger for the left is we look at, oh, there was success over here or there was success in the past, right? So, you know, they&#39;re making mistakes of geography and, well, time and space, basically, is what they&#39;re doing. So that should not be the lesson that we take here. But the lesson that we should take is that the economy is a lived experience, and</span>

            <span class="text">a pretty good antenna for fairness? And do you feel like that was maybe at the heart of this, like both in the comms with the union, but also just overall? Like Canadians don&#39;t look at this as, oh, I&#39;m on side of the union this time and I&#39;m not this time. It&#39;s just like, oh, just like quickly analyzing this in three seconds. Like that doesn&#39;t seem fair. Moving on, making a judgment. What do you think, Carter?</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s one of the poles of decision of values that I think really defines Canadians, their Their sense of fairness versus, you know, the United States where selfishness, I think, takes a little bit different view on fairness. What is fair for me is seen as more fair in the United States, whereas there is a definite fairness vibe in Canada. It&#39;s one of the polls that I try to work on as much as possible in politics. politics um so i i think that fairness versus unfair absolutely canadians have a strong sense of it and a simple story of i don&#39;t get paid for 90 minutes of my work is a simple is a as an easy story uh to tell now air canada you know is in a tougher spot because they were they would have been in a spot where they were trying to communicate but we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to rectify that we&#39;ve already promised that but um and and when you watch their press conference when they&#39;re trying to actually articulate that that was pretty horrible right like they their communication structures were um very</span>

            <span class="text">The danger for unions and union comms that I&#39;ve noticed over the years is that they will, because fairness does pull well to Carter&#39;s point. And when you do, you know, focus groups, when you do more qualitative research, that&#39;ll pop out to you. And so then they&#39;ll, you know, put out billboards or take out ads that are like, this is not fair. It sounds like fucking whining. Right. And so you have to find a way that is more compelling for labor communicators, I think. And what this piece showed me is that they&#39;re figuring it out.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Right. And when you move above kind of the sort of drumbeat of of labor comms and into a really well resourced campaign, you get what just happened with Air Canada component, which is popping above just fairness, which is a kind of a milquetoast argument and into like somebody is getting something that I&#39;m not getting. and what is going on here, like raising the stakes a bit.</span>

They&#39;ve ditched all of their old super anti-union, like the union audit, legislation commitment, all of those kinds of stuff. They&#39;ve pulled all that from platform.
