Younger people don&#39;t listen to the news in the same way. They don&#39;t consume news the way that older people consume news. That&#39;s factually correct. Correct. Now, they do consume news in a different way, which is why John Horgan got his ass bit, because as soon as things started to spread on social media and within the social networks of the younger people, you know, Horgan had a price to pay and he had to apologize for it.

You would have loved doing an entire segment on the governor. Let&#39;s move on to our next segment, Kmart in the curriculum. Yes, indeed, the Alberta curriculum. We&#39;re going to talk about it. Kmart, for those who don&#39;t know, is my new nickname for Mark Kenny. And we&#39;ll talk about Mark Kenny in a second. Yes, indeed, there is a relation. After inheriting the curriculum redevelopment process from the NDP, the UCP government brought in handpicked advisors to rework some of the existing materials, and they&#39;ve now introduced their draft curriculum. And let&#39;s just say things are not going so well. The document is being criticized for its Eurocentric perspective, its dismissive of indigenous perspectives, and not based on research on how to best teach young children. In fact, in recent days, or in recent hours, I should say, since the curriculum has kind kind of come out into the public zeitgeist. It has been criticized for being A, lifted from Wikipedia, B, copied from a Common Core curriculum in Virginia, and C, now being endorsed by Jordan Peterson. Yes, indeed, that Jordan Peterson. Corey, I don&#39;t even know where to start here. You mentioned the term culture war. So let&#39;s start there. Because I think that&#39;s probably the best part to start in. The curriculum is something Jason Kenney has talked about when he was running for leader, when he was running in the election. This seems to be a cornerstone of ideological Kenny, that side of him that wanted to remake this province in a meaningful way. Education seemed to be one of the big things, and it seems like the healthcare was the other one. We&#39;ll talk about doctors in a second. But is this a fight Jason Kenny actually wants to have in public as it&#39;s happening right now? Or was this a slip up in your mind of a a of a curriculum that was half-baked and perhaps misaligned with where albertans kind of were with with what they expected in their education system well</span>

            <span class="text">and I hate to interrupt you so quickly, but do you think he actually believes that? Because all the evidence stacks, this is like, we keep saying this, that Jason Kenney has a miscalculation of Albertans, like he doesn&#39;t understand us. like and i think the evidence is so clear about that do you feel like he still doesn&#39;t understand who albertans are or do you feel like he&#39;s just like fuck it i&#39;m gonna take you here and you can come kicking or screaming but this is where we&#39;re going and it&#39;s that sort of perhaps even political arrogance that&#39;s that&#39;s pegging him to to do something like this i</span>

            <span class="text">i think he believes this is who we are and if you surround yourself with people who are just like this who believe these these things and they always say these things then these are the types of mistakes you make right this is the type of mistake that jim prentice made when he misread the entire uh population of alberta and brought in was it bill 10 i can never remember which numbers uh it was bill 10 bill 10 uh which was seen largely to attack the lgbtq community and did and created massive rifts for him because he misread who we actually are, because we don&#39;t know who we are. And this is not an unusual situation. We say we are conservative, but when we dig in and we actually answer the questions about what our values are, our values are far more liberal. And then when you add on top of that, this ideological divide that has developed where ideology now means that that tradition is pitted against science or that the future is pitted against the past or that like anti-mask is pitted against masks this is now ideological instead of kind of societal if you will so my ideology says that if that group likes you know the new math then i can&#39;t i have to hold on to the old the old math and the old way that math was done and let me tell tell you something as someone who was around when democracy was formed in ancient greece it wasn&#39;t that great of a thing so</span>

And that&#39;s happening, right? Carter made the Bill 10 comparison. One thing about Bill 10 here in Alberta was that groups on a grassroots level mobilized quick, without some sort of central institution. We&#39;re starting to see that now.

I kind of reintroduced it about, like, that also saw a tremendous groundswell. Your perspectives on what that could mean for Jason Kenney, and from a strategy perspective, do you feel like this will open up people&#39;s eyes more to what this government is doing overall, Or do you feel like this is parents for their kids and that&#39;s the issue here? And how does, for example, let me insert the opposition NDP here, play their cards with this situation? They know this is extremely polarizing. They know there&#39;s a groundswell forming. They probably also know that, hey, we probably want some of these parents in our fold. Is that way too opportunistic? Or is there something that they can do as a political party? So I&#39;m asking you a triple-barrel question, as I commonly do on this podcast, but any thoughts on anything I&#39;ve kind of put out there?</span>

All they have to do is go around and say, you know, this new curriculum prepares your child to be an expert in trivial pursuit, but not to take place in the technology economy. economy and and realistically we don&#39;t even fucking play trivial pursuit anymore it&#39;s a dead game i gotta tell you like</span>

If the emphasis is on the word abstinence instead of on the words, you know birth control choice even when we&#39;re looking at the word consent consent has been shifted from being consent where both parties are responsible to a kind of a women are responsible for providing or or not providing consent it is now a one-party type of transaction and that those are the types of things that that will play to people that people can understand that the NDP can make massive hay about this this is the wrong curriculum for the wrong time and it&#39;s coupled Coupled with the,</span>

So, you know, don&#39;t fall into the trap where all of a sudden it looks like you&#39;re trying to politicize the curriculum the other way. Really reinforce like, hey, this should be built by experts. This is the overriding point here. We don&#39;t want your children to be experiments in culture wars. We want to trust the people who go to school for these things, the people who get PhDs in the development of curriculum. We want to look at what other provinces are doing. You know, I also worry about the kind of the comps and what&#39;s going to happen if all of a sudden Alberta is this weird outlier where your education here was so different from an education elsewhere. And just imagine your son or daughter wants to go to McGill or University of Toronto. Doesn&#39;t even matter. But like a grade 12 education here is not seen as the same as a grade 12 education elsewhere. And Carter, I remember when you and I were in Washington, D.C., talking to a friend of ours who worked at Hill &amp; Knowlton with us, and he was there with his, I believe, girlfriend at the time. And she grew up in the South, and she was talking about how when she went to university, like, she was surprised even by the talk of the Civil War, which was known as the War of Northern Aggression, where she went to school.

Those people are already with you, and you don&#39;t need to politicize this. You don&#39;t need to risk an own goal at a time like this. Just let this thing sort of play out with that group. Let other people carry your water on things like Mark Kennedy and any of the other things, the myriad of things that we&#39;ve already talked about. But consider how you can start to erode the confidence of that next group out in this curriculum sense. Now, Carter mentioned jobs. jobs don&#39;t mind me just searching ads right now job ads for like words like decision making and critical thinking which are in the existing curriculum and then comparing that to accounts of job ads with words like roman empire silk road right like</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">again switching back to ndp advice here the existing curriculum was very old right you know our understanding of these things advances and we don&#39;t want to be teaching people a 20 year old curriculum from a 20 year old curriculum but if i&#39;m the ucp i&#39;m pointing to this is not different than what we had before uh look at this here look at this other province finding all of those comps but also showing a certain reasonableness and willingness to move move on all of that there.</span>

But a lot of that things behind the scenes, you don&#39;t actually need to change that much if you want to keep it. Again, flipping back to the NDP, you&#39;ve got to make sure people are aware of that. You&#39;ve got to say, hey, listen, look at the full source documents here. Don&#39;t let them get away with the headlines. But yeah, I mean, I am just trying to make this seem like Like, not a very big deal, business as usual, same as other provinces, same as we&#39;ve done in the past. People would like you to think this is outrageous, but this is how things are done. That&#39;s my advice. In terms of, like, Carter&#39;s advice of, like, doing cabinet shuffles, maybe pulling LaGrange off this, I don&#39;t think that makes sense. I think that would just torpedo the curriculum.

Carter, I&#39;ll ask you a broader question before we get into the specifics of this. Is this an extension, another proof point, another chapter of Corey&#39;s culture war conversation? As Jason Kenney said, I said I&#39;m going to do this. I&#39;m doing it. I said I&#39;m going to do this. I&#39;m doing it. Does this fall into that same category?

I know that when First Ministers conferences have occurred in the past, the First Ministers will kind of come up to the other premier, you know, the premier of Alberta and say, you guys got to get your doctors under control because we can&#39;t afford what you&#39;re doing. So right now, but one in every $10 of spending goes to physician fees. fees. Those fees, let&#39;s not call them salaries, okay, because that&#39;s clearly not what they are, but it&#39;s a tremendous amount of money that go to 11,000 Albertans.

Carter, your instinct was very interesting, not where my head would be at. But so maybe, Corey, I&#39;ll start with a different question was when you saw this 53 to 47 vote, they called it a you know, part of that was an erosion of trust. Others have called it in the medical community as they saw a pathway to privatization of health care, which is why they said no. What was your takeaway and headline when you saw this headline quite literally come out earlier this week?</span>

Here&#39;s my 12 points. points uh and these are these are how these 12 points should be addressed by the government before i&#39;d be willing to consider voting this way you mentioned the the opens the door to private health i&#39;m not you know i don&#39;t know i i read some but not all of some of that correspondence that was floating around i don&#39;t know if that was really the thing there was also like there was not like a resolution clause uh it all ultimately came to the minister there were just there were many concerns and i mentioned all of this because it</span>

He was doing his job, and it wouldn&#39;t necessarily be, quote unquote, fair to punish him for doing his job. But I think now is the time to shuffle Tyler Chandru out of health and say, we do need a fresh start on this. And then give the smallest give that you think could possibly be given in order to make this look like even a modestly new deal. I&#39;m not even sure I would do the resolution clause. I would maybe look at one of the other ones there. You&#39;re talking about 3% flipping at this point. And it just allows you to reset, get another vote and try to drive this thing through. I don&#39;t know that I would start looking to split the AMA because then, based on a 53-47 vote, you might have trouble with big pockets of the healthcare system all over the place, right? You might be able to sort of pick off group by group, but right now your challenge would be what if you have total chaos with the family docs, that very front line, and the specialists you sort of make peace with one at a time. I just think that that way is actually too uncertain, and you&#39;re better off negotiating with the AMA, especially given how close it was. We&#39;re</span>

To be the leadership of an association and not be able to pull your association along on this deal, that&#39;s tough. And I think that there&#39;s going to be some hard conversations about what they do. At the very least, I think they&#39;re going to need to in that next – in whatever negotiation is bring in some of the more prominent critical voices and say, okay, well, let&#39;s try to figure this out. We&#39;re not saying you&#39;re going to get everything you want, but you&#39;re going to need to bring a couple people in the tent because if the sides are the same the next time this goes, why would you expect a different result? So you&#39;re going to have to work with some members and show that you tried to incorporate some of their concerns in whatever the next deal is with the government. Again, I think you&#39;re probably – if you&#39;re in the leadership position, if you&#39;re in the bargaining team, you&#39;re probably pretty – and like the AMA, when they bargain, is wild.

There&#39;s 25,000 homeschool students right now in the province of Alberta, and I worry about them every day because they&#39;re not necessarily, they&#39;re supposed to be taught the same curriculum. But I worry that if you&#39;re not taught the curriculum, if you&#39;re not given the opportunity to learn, you fall backwards. And that&#39;s why we&#39;re so worried about this new presentation that&#39;s come from the from the Kenney government.</span>

            <span class="text">Underrated. I mean, this is one in ten dollars of spending. If you can&#39;t figure out how to control it, if it&#39;s uncontrollable, then your government spending is uncontrollable. Healthcare eats up, what, 45% of most operating budgets for provinces. It is massively important. And it&#39;s just been growing and growing. Keep in mind, it was 0% in 1969 when Peter Lougheed took over the PC party. Zero. And now it&#39;s 45%. I mean, it just, it keeps growing because, you know, it&#39;s uncontrollable. It turns out that everybody fails at keeping people alive forever.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter said it all. He&#39;s 100% correct. The fact that we spend so many billions of dollars on these contracts, like this is by far the most consequential contract within any of this public sector bargaining that&#39;s going on. It is the difference between balanced budgets and not. It&#39;s the difference between contained costs and not. And it also, as Carter alluded to, is one of these things that is deeply personal for people. They like their physicians, generally speaking, even if they worry about the health care system at large. They don&#39;t want to think that because of a decision the government makes that their care could be at risk or a loved one&#39;s care could be at risk. This is a big, big discussion. And in many ways, I think it&#39;s, candidly,</span>

There&#39;s tensions within the NDP on Israel-Palestine issues. The party has their upcoming convention, which runs April 9th to 11th. And there&#39;s a list of resolutions, I should say, with half a dozen that articulate solidarity with Palestine and causes for greater sanctions and condemnation for Israel. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being this is not a problem at all. There&#39;s no zero on the scale, Corey, as you know, because the scale starts at one. The 10 being this is a huge, disastrous issue for the NDP. Where do you kind of peg this particular one?</span>

Like you&#39;re creating essentially more friction to choose an answer that the government doesn&#39;t want to hear. and and basically that means you&#39;ve got your thumb on the scale in a big way and the way the entire thing was written was basically you don&#39;t understand the coal policy the coal policy doesn&#39;t affect you anyways get the fuck out of here with your opinions and oh if you actually feel like you still want to provide your opinion let me put all of these hurdles in front of you and that to me yeah well that to me talks about what the intent is and what the long-term goal is with this with this con you know quote unquote consultation and so i don&#39;t think this is a dead issue at all. I think if we take our eyes off this ball for a moment, Alberta, you&#39;re going to find the tops of mountains stripped off and coal mining going on around waterways, all sorts of things that you will not like.

But they&#39;ve gotten deep into policy and giving opinions about whether something is a good idea or a bad idea, which is really the role of elected officials. And I think it&#39;s problematic. You know, many Canadians would disagree it&#39;s problematic. Let me tell you why it&#39;s problematic. Because it is seen as a neutral gospel.

There are no shortage of voices as to whether a policy is a good idea or not.
