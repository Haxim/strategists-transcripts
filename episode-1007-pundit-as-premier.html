I could see that vibe. I could see that shock, shock vibe from her in this first week. To your earlier point that both of you have made, we haven&#39;t really seen her lead anything.

            <span class="text">right? And not getting distracted by the thing that is ultimately the petty grievance rather than the major grievance. Like her apology not being good enough is a petty grievance. And I saw Rachel Notley was talking about it today. I don&#39;t have a problem with that. Obviously, she should demand a sincere apology for one day. But if she&#39;s still talking about this two days from now i think that&#39;s a bit of a mistake by the ndp if you&#39;re not talking it in you know laddering it into a bigger attack on daniel smith&#39;s character or or something along those lines because like it&#39;s</span>

That all the work that Jason Kenney put in, that all the work that has been done by Stephen Harper to build inroads with what was traditionally seen to be a liberal demographic has been undone by the by tossing Patrick Brown out. So that&#39;s what, and being close to, you know, being in Surrey right now and being close to the Sikh population here, there&#39;s an awful lot, you know, of people that used to be conservatives that have moved towards the liberals. So I think that this is going to be something that it may have only been a three-day news story, but it may have impacted the people who bought the memberships, the people who were politically active, much, much deeper.
