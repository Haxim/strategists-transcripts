        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan discuss the Liberal retreat, expense scandals and how the federal parties are preparing for the fall. What goes into planning a government retreat? Are lounge passes and limousines going to tarnish the Trudeau brand? And why won't Stephen Carter stay at a Best Western? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

So regardless of what my question is, you&#39;re going to say it bridging and flagging. No, Carter, they have decided they as and we&#39;ll get to the specifics of this one. They, as the liberal cabinet, have decided to stay in campus dorms for the purpose of optics. Yay or nay on that?</div>

It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s like a dorm is where you go to pass out after a night of heavy drinking. It just plays into that narrative of summer camp, in my opinion.

That maybe needs to be done. So you look at the NDP government in Alberta, right? They get elected and they do things, right? Some people will be pissed off by those things, but they are done and they have put them in the bank and now they can recover from those things and take us into the next election because they believe those things were right. Do I agree that those things were right? Some of them, others not so much. But the point is they believe that they were right. What has this Trudeau government done that they believed was right that needed to be put in place to undo the previous conservative legacy or the previous government&#39;s misuse or, you know, they railed against certain things when they were in opposition. But we&#39;re not seeing them undo these things as quickly as they need to if they&#39;re actually going to have impact because our cycles are shorter and shorter and shorter. Yeah.</div>
