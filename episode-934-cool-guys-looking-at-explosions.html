No, Carter, I&#39;m not going to be talking about Trey Young. I&#39;m not going to be talking about the Hawks. I know you&#39;re a big fanboy of said Trey Young and Atlanta Hawks. No, I&#39;m going to talk about Annamie Paul. I&#39;m going to be talking about her remarks against Justin Trudeau. She came out in multiple, two, press conferences after her former MP, Jennica Atwin, crossed the floors to the Liberals, coming out against the Prime Minister in a press conference, saying that he&#39;s undermining strong women capable at the height of their careers. He&#39;s pushing strong, competent, capable women out of politics. He is no feminist. She also, you know, went after Christopher Freeland, saying that, I&#39;m also going to say shame on Christopher Freeland for her complicity in this, for being his female shield amongst all of that. Guys, I want to talk about this from a strategy perspective. You know, to set the table a bit, Annamie Paul is fighting an uphill battle. She&#39;s got a vote of non-confidence from her councillors, her party councillors, that has been delayed, if I&#39;m not mistaken. She&#39;s trying to come out on the offensive about what happened with the foreclosing of Jennica Atwin. I want to talk about the strategy here. Is it a good strategy what she&#39;s done in this past week, going so aggressively against the prime minister, going so aggressively against Christopher Freeland, or is this a tactic of desperation? So that&#39;s the framing I want to kind of start this conversation with Carter. And maybe we&#39;ll start with initial thoughts from you around surprise. When you saw these first and then second press conferences, the first one where she cut off and the second one she came back and delivered some more, were you surprised by the tact that Green Party leader Annamie Paul took against Justin Trudeau? And was he the right target from a political strategy perspective? Let&#39;s start here and then we&#39;ll do our thing and move on from there. Yeah.</div>

And in terms of your second part of your question, was it was it strategically wise? Yeah, it was. It changed the channel. It was a channel changer. Didn&#39;t completely change the channel.

I&#39;m not sure I would have recommended it, but I certainly see why she strategically chose it. It was a great channel changer. It it it showed us something that we didn&#39;t expect. And it gave gave her a news cycle, which is something, frankly, the Green Party hasn&#39;t been doing on a positive sense. And we could argue about whether or not this is totally positive. I, I see the negatives of the tactic as well. But strategically, this made sense. It was a channel changer. And she changed the channel if she didn&#39;t change it quite as much as she wanted to.

We have to develop strategies when things are in the shitter, too. And she&#39;s in the shitter. So developing a strategy to get out of it and hold on to her leadership was required. And, you know, Corey makes a good point about having two people to go after instead of one. It would have been much tighter if it was just the prime minister. He does have issues that have dogged him around women and his approach to working with women as a quote-unquote feminist prime minister.</div>

And I think that if the Green Party were to pick a few 35% issues, I mean, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d go with 15 because I want to be strong enough, but none of the big parties take 35% issues. And I mean, arguably, that was the foundation of what the Green Party used to be, right? The Green Party used to be fighting for an issue that maybe 30 or 35% of the population thought was important.</div>

So how do you give it back to them is the opportunity or the challenge if you&#39;re the Green Party leader when you&#39;re trying to figure out where you fit.

It is a new feminism of people that are going to stand up and kind of make more stringent demands, kind of pushing us further than where we are today, this kind of comfortable feminism that Justin Trudeau represents. I think that this could be an opportunity for her. I think this is a thing that she can take that is not available to Jagmeet Singh, who may want other pieces of like AOC&#39;s legacy. But this is also part of that legacy, you know, women standing up and saying, this is what we&#39;re going to do. And I think that she can own that in a way that none of the other party leaders obviously can. So I think that this is probably an opportunity for the Green Party if they wish to go there. I think there&#39;s an open question as to whether or not the governors of the Green Party or the board of directors of the the Green Party want to go there. But as the leader, this is an interesting opportunity that does kind of represent, I don&#39;t know what the numbers on it are, 25%, 30%, 35%, 4%. I don&#39;t know.

They can fight on BIPOC. They can fight on social issues as well as own the green and push the green agenda for all political parties.

I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re fundamentally discussing here, which is, is this a clever band-aid? And I think both of you have said yes-ish to that. Or does this have legs beyond that as a positioning that she may have just accidentally discovered while trying to issue these haymakers to survive? And I think that&#39;s what I&#39;m intrigued about as she continues with the upcoming weeks and days. And maybe what I&#39;ll position to you, Carter, is will this work? Will this work on the short-term goal of saving her leadership? I mean, the knives are out. The vote has been delayed. The former leader hasn&#39;t vocalized her support for enemy Paul. What do you think? From what you&#39;re seeing right now, does enemy Paul survive as leader of the Green Party?</div>

            <div class="said">i&#39;m a i&#39;m a child of the 80s right so you guys know that you know back in the 80s we had these merger and acquisition poison pills where companies would put a poison pill into their you know into their structure and if someone tried to take them over essentially it would destroy the value of the company this feels to me like it has the ability to be a bit of a poison pill um that if they continue to come after anime paul now uh they are running you know they being the Board of Governors or the Board of Directors of the Green Party, they&#39;re running into a potential trap because they&#39;re going to be accused. I mean, and I think rightfully so. I don&#39;t remember. I mean, I don&#39;t remember Elizabeth May&#39;s leadership being all that great. Call me crazy if you want, but I think that she was an absolutely passable leader. And the moment that Anna May Paul comes in or like less than a year later, they&#39;re already gunning for her through her leadership. I&#39;m not a big fan of it. And I don&#39;t think that they should just get away with it. So this is a an opportunity to go after the liberals for something that may in fact be happening to her. And I think that this is a, you know, a poison pill that the Green Party needs to be very careful about. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s going to work in the long term. I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s going to work in the short term. But I do think that there&#39;s a little bit of strategic genius to it. Nonetheless, nonetheless.</div>

And there is a future that is possible of coronavirus where it&#39;s a cold. In fact, many colds are caused by coronaviruses. And I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a cold. Let me be really clear here. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the sniffles. You got COVID and you go back to work. But we may be at a point where it becomes less lethal. It becomes more managed. Many of us, as we get our doses and second doses, will have immunity to it. it. And just as with the flu every year, even though you get your flu shot, you got to get another flu shot. The flu is not likely to kill us. We may end up in a situation like that. And there&#39;s some data that suggests that. But the thing I really want to make sure we get on the table here is,</div>

Carter, let&#39;s talk about Kenny here and the political gamble, because last time we talked about this, which I think was two to three weeks ago, we said that Kenny was waging a lot on this, that this was, you know, a leader who didn&#39;t do great, at least according to the polling numbers during the pandemic, but putting a lot of his chips on the reopening, the first to reopen, wearing that badge, wearing that medal across the country seem to be a critical part of his brand and what he was waging. It seems like he&#39;s going to be, all things considered. Do you feel like that political bet&#39;s about to pay off here for Jason Kenney?</div>

We saw opposition MPs vote to censure Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan. Liberals are filibustering the House of Commons Defence Committee. Opposition parties are stalling the government&#39;s Broadcasting Act, C-10. The Conservative leader has pulled his MPs from a special national security committee, accusing the government of using it as a cover-up incident that caused two scientists at Canada&#39;s high-security laboratory to be fired. And just this week, Trudeau accused opposition parties of engaging in toxicity and political games, not to count the two press conferences by Annamie Paul this week, as we discussed. Things are getting stupid at the House of Commons. Things are getting silly.</div>

What is the strategy for political parties in these last weeks of summer in the House as it relates to setting up a good trajectory for the upcoming, let&#39;s just assume it&#39;s coming, the upcoming election. Is the House do anything for that? Like, are these political games actually helpful in setting up, you know, as I say, the trajectory for how you position yourself there on? And that&#39;s the main thing I want to focus on. We can get into each of the items at some point if you&#39;d like. But I&#39;m just really wondering, which of these political games, if we want to call it that, work and which don&#39;t work to try to set up a better position for yourself come this August slash September, October?</div>

We should step back, though, and remind ourselves of what the conversation was like in January, in February, how it just seemed like we were not going to get everybody. Well, some people were saying, I will remind you that I was not saying this, but many people were saying, we&#39;re not going to get everybody vaccinated into well into next year at the pace we&#39;re going at the trajectories that we can anticipate in terms of both the public health apparatus to get people injected, but also the delivery schedule.
