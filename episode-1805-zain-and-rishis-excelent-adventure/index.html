        <p>The gang has <a href="https://www.pollara.com/nenshi-continues-to-excite-largest-number-of-albertans-among-ndp-leadership-candidates/" target="_blank">new numbers on NDP leadership hopefuls from "Zain Velji for Leader" pollster Dan Arnold and Pollara</a>. Rishi Sunak has called a snap election in the rain. Stephen Carter continues to think fondly of his time with the Prime Minister.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter briefly discuss the latest numbers from the "Zain Velji for Leader" campaign from Pollara before turning their attention to Rishi Sunak's snap election call in the UK and the strategy of early debates. Why do the UK Conservatives look more surprised by the election call than Labour? Would Trudeau benefit from stealing Joe Biden's early debate strategy? And will Stephen Carter make 32:49 his ringtone? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

One of the main considerations in any war is logistics and how are you going to make sure your troops have what they need when they need it. truly surprising somebody gives you a massive advantage. They&#39;re not going to have those things. And they&#39;re not even going to have kind of the human capital ready to go because you&#39;ve got to train up volunteers.

Is it the fact that, you know, modern day campaigning no longer has an element of catching anyone off guard in a four-year continuous campaign cycle, that that&#39;s not possible? Is it the fact that getting over government—I&#39;m just throwing a few propositions at you, you guys take this wherever—is it that getting over government-itis actually takes a lot more time and energy to fully convert your mind and your body and your sense of campaigning from government to—what do you think it is? Because as much as, like, we want to poke at Sunak and and say that Labour was ready, Conservatives were ready. They were ready in 2021. O&#39;Toole had, let&#39;s remind ourselves, a policy platform book, fully done, baked, cover shot, and ready to go with digital and online.</div>
