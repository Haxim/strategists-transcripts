        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the New York Times coverage of Donald Trump's tax returns, the start of the BC election and the federal throne speech. Does the release of Trump's taxes change the campaign? Will John Horgan be punished for calling a "Seinfeld election"? And what does Corey have against suits from Sears? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">that he doesn&#39;t – or at least in his taxes. Can we start there? Donald Trump is not as wealthy as he&#39;s often purported to be. Now, there&#39;s a big caveat on that, and the New York Times does address it a number of times throughout their very long and comprehensive article. But the reality is taxes are what you tell the government you made, and they are not necessarily reality. And a fellow like Donald Trump, who I suspect many of us would say perhaps lacks the moral fiber that many others out there do, may not be inclined to make it look like he&#39;s gotten a ton of money if that means he&#39;s going to be paying a ton of taxes. So let&#39;s just sort of start there as a bit of a foundational point. But if</div>

And that is not really in depreciation, despite what he often claims. It is just he&#39;s lost a lot of money in the last bit. So Donald Trump perhaps was not in great financial straits before he became U.S. president. I mean, let&#39;s be clear, not in great financial straits is he&#39;s not the billionaire he pretends to be, not that he actually has any real problems in the world. He&#39;s still got an awful lot of money and an awful number of assets. But yeah, the emperor&#39;s clothes, you</div>

You know, there&#39;s there&#39;s been already calculations on on on federal income tax for truck drivers, 10K, ER nurse, 8K, teacher, 6K, right? Grocery store cashier, fifteen hundred bucks. Right. So paying more tax federal income taxes than a grocery store cashier in the United States on average. Corey, do you agree with Carter? Is that the focal point of this exhaustive document?

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the biggest takeaway for me personally, but certainly it&#39;s the one that most lends itself to being in an advertisement, in being a line in the debates coming up this week. $750, Stephen&#39;s exactly right. That&#39;s the kind of money you can wrap your head around fairly easily. And by the way, we sort of blew past it, but Trump paid $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017. Those were, you know, years he was running and year he was president, respectively.</div>

          <div class="said">The thing about that number, too, is it could have been zero. So if you read through the reporting, he effectively just paid taxes so that he could say, I paid taxes. I think that&#39;s one of the more interesting things here. He&#39;s obviously aware of what it looks like, and he was trying to make sure that under oath, I guess, for lack of better. he could say, I pay taxes, I pay taxes as president. And, you know, I made a huge amount of money, both things true, maybe missing the fact that he also spent a huge amount of money. And he paid very little tax.

Insights West had them up 47.29 in June, late June. I guess my point is, why didn&#39;t they go over the summer before all of the kids were going back in school? Why didn&#39;t they take a similar time into New Brunswick and run this election basically hitting the polls now or slightly before now before these numbers start getting away in a big way? Because that&#39;s the real risk. And I guess that&#39;s the real probability is more to the point. It&#39;s always the risk. It was the risk if you were to call it in June, July</div>

Absolutely, we are only in this because of Horgan&#39;s vanity and his desire to get to a majority. But there are a number of other areas where the government is potentially exposed. And maybe you have to say, well, John, if you want to have an election about what&#39;s to come, let&#39;s have an election about what&#39;s to come. and start putting a bit more of the economic twist on it because there is a reality here, which is that there is going to be a lot of hurt.

And I want to broaden this point and just say this has not been a good first week for the BC NDP. Their launch was kind of a little awkward looking. Many of the tactics, you know, Horgan calling, you know, the one a day he&#39;s going to call some random supporter is already starting to run a little thin. And I guess this is the other layer that we&#39;re almost sort of just taking for granted. But let&#39;s talk about it at least briefly and maybe talk about it longer another day.</div>

We&#39;re going to do up, down, delta. Now, you may not remember this, but here&#39;s what it simply is. I will give you a figure or a party, in this case, Trudeau. What did you see from the speech? And what you will do is you give me a thumbs up, a thumbs down and a delta as in what you would have changed. So, you need to give me an up or down and what you would have changed. So, either way, it&#39;s up or down and what you would change. So, Corey, let&#39;s start with you. We had a ton of speculation into this speech. Was Trudeau going to take the practical bucket? Was he going to take the ambitious bucket? At the end of the day, from what you heard, the speech alone, because I know there&#39;s another element I want to discuss about Trudeau, but from the speech alone, up or down, and then what you would have changed.
