We&#39;ve already gone through 47 acronyms in the first, just waiting for you to show up, Zain. Just waiting for you. It was brutal.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know, because I assumed a level of facility of the language of politics that perhaps I was overestimating. And so I will take that under advisement and govern myself accordingly. Thank</span>

            <span class="text">Oh, First Minister&#39;s Meeting. She&#39;s tipping away the punchline like that. I just need to get us out of this extremely painful introductory segment, you guys. You</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You know what I like about Shannon is that she&#39;s also producing. Corey never produced when he was on. Yeah, Corey just fucking went with it. He just kept going. I like this, Shannon. This is good. Okay, we&#39;re going to chat about a lot of things, including the fact that we have some new numbers regarding separation in Alberta. I want to talk about the by-elections in Alberta, And then I want to talk very quickly on the federal scene, what we make of this past week with Carney and the King. How did that visit go? Was there anything material you took out of it? Let&#39;s start with the separatist question, because that is what we did spend a significant amount of time last time the three of us were together discussing. In fact, I think it&#39;s the only thing we discussed when we walked through what our prospective</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">prospective strategies would be. What I&#39;d like to do is talk about the number. We now have a number. Janet Brown polling CBC have produced a number. it&#39;s 28%. That&#39;s where the separatist number stands. That number is not increasing from previous polling that Janet has done. But Carter, I&#39;ll start with you on this. The intensity of those that want to separate is deepening, intensifying. Yep.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">How are you reading this?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m reading it that when you have a group of people who already believe something, and then you decide to start pumping it up and making it more and more real, the intensity will change um you know this is the uh one of the principles of advertising is that in someone&#39;s open to the idea if you advertise with increasing frequency they&#39;ll become more and more open to the idea and i think that this is what danielle smith has enabled and and promoted by essentially advertising the idea of confederation or separation is that uh the more people who are those people who are open to the idea are going to become more ingrained uh as the as Daniela Smith makes it more and more real and opens up the pathway for it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Shannon, I&#39;ll get to you in a second, but I want to follow up with Carter for a quick moment here. Are you more concerned? Would you be more concerned if 28 became 32 or would you be more concerned to hear the intensity of the group is getting bigger? As an organizer or strategist,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is it simply the top line that worries you or are you actually worried that this is intensifying?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The intensity will ultimately move the number, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? The intensity will ultimately move the number from 30% to 40%. That intensity, because what we&#39;re doing is now we&#39;re activating social networks and people within those social networks are going to be more and more likely to be talking about separation. They are emboldened. They are seeing their premier talk about it. They are willing to talk about it publicly. Whereas before, if it was kind of a two or three on the Likert scale, it wasn&#39;t really something that they were going to talk about. uh now that it&#39;s number one they are absolutely going to talk about it uh they&#39;re going to talk about it within their own groups where it&#39;s which are easier to find because people are more engaged and more you know excited about it if you will and they will talk about it within groups that are not necessarily uh separatist leaning shannon</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">shannon 28 intensifying what do you think</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, Carter has got it right in terms of how the ball keeps rolling, is that you increase that intensity. I would say, though, that there&#39;s still a good chunk of those folks, even in the intensity of it. It&#39;s really hard to tell whether the intensity is I&#39;m pissed with the federal government, or I&#39;m out of here, right? Because there&#39;s still a lot of separatist, curious, kind of half-formed ideas out there. Uh, you know, of, and, uh, the biggest one of which is, um, we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">we need to be talking about this because we need to get our fair share, whatever that looks like, right? Fill in the blank on what that means. Um, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">you know, we need to be able to produce oil with wild abandon when in fact our production is as high as it&#39;s ever been. Uh, we need to be able to build, uh, you know, linear infrastructure in whatever direction we want, even though, you know, there are no private sector proponents for new projects uh so i think um it&#39;s part of that right like people are seeing it in this moment as a chip as a negotiating ploy that is how it is viewed out there uh on the landscape and it&#39;s possible that some of this intensity is just well actually we have to now because we&#39;re dealing with you know there&#39;s another few years of of uh liberal uh majority A de facto majority. I think what it also means, though, on that intensity is there are more and more folks, if you can go find them, willing to sign a citizen initiative to put that question on the ballot. That&#39;s where the danger lies. also with as as soon as that intensity goes up even if you have even if you&#39;re stuck in in around 28 that&#39;s money right</span>

          <div class="turn">

And that&#39;s where Danielle&#39;s response to this really matters. She&#39;s got a fine line to walk, you know, how much she caters to this. uh but you know also uh skirts around it so that she can keep her caucus and her governing majority together shannon&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a full fracture and we do have to deal with it it is it is going going to be more important than anything else that we deal with because 30% is enough to start driving people away. It&#39;s enough to start driving uncertainty. And as soon as you start driving uncertainty, you have to deal with it. You have to make things certain again. The best case scenario is that no one&#39;s able to get 170,000 signatures and everything kind of bogs down before we we actually get to a 70-30 outcome. Because the other problem, Zane, is it&#39;s quite a push to assume that we wind up in the exact same spot again.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">is that we are looking in this province at at least 20 percent who have since ralph klein since the firewall letter at least like base of 20 percent who have been all in for, you know, a pension plan, tax collection, police service of some kind, right? Equalization, whatever that means, reform in some way, shape or form. Since at least that time, Klein had to, you know, make himself a little traveling roadshow and put together a little panel because he was worried about the fracture. And that was in like 04, or actually it was before 04 it was before the 04 election that he had to do that so this is not in that sense new right that like okay what&#39;s not new is the 20 percent like hard kind of you know outside of the conservative mainstream views that&#39;s how you got the wild rose it&#39;s how you got uh you know some of the people like kicking kenny out right they were able to mobilize themselves a lot better in the last decade, I would argue, than they could in the decade before that. But they were always there, is what I&#39;m trying to say, at 20.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">you still have them, like, to be clear, in the 20s. And so you do have an ability for them to grow, to Carter&#39;s point, but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">but you are also dealing with very similar political, Alberta political dynamics that you have dealt with for a very long time now the fact is is that the conservative coalition could keep that 20 somewhat quiet uh before right because the sort of red tories could kind of tamp them down or mollify them in some way that is no longer the case number one because red tories don&#39;t really exist anymore or number two they suck they are terrible politically they don&#39;t know how to manage the coalition or they&#39;ve disappeared or they&#39;re weak or they&#39;re doing whatever right and so they&#39;re kind of floating out there in the ether um</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">um and so that you know that that harder base has taken over the conservative party they&#39;ve been eaten by that side that is the new political dynamic which is probably why you&#39;ve seen that move from 20 to 28 right at to carter&#39;s point about intensity and about momentum so as a strategist i&#39;m looking at that and going okay i&#39;m going to light my hair on fire here um</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s not i mean you know like worry about everything panic about nothing right uh so there it&#39;s still a worry you still have a political problem in front of you uh and you still have an issue of being able to keep the 70 and it&#39;s a race for the 70 uh or at least enough of the 70 to be able to win an election in this province and And because it&#39;s not just separation we&#39;re talking about here, right? It&#39;s all these other issues that are, you know, seen as somewhat, and those ones are even worse, seen as somewhat wackadoodle by the electorate, right? The, you know, the police stuff, the CPP stuff, less so equalization, leave that one off to the side. But some of these other specific policy solutions that come with separation are still in the same neighborhood, right? They just of 20 percent ish. So you need to be able to reach enough of the 70 to cobble together a coalition. That&#39;s the political problem in front of people.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, thank you. Yeah, I&#39;m glad. I&#39;m glad you still have no idea. Listen, I&#39;m going to give you a political strategy theory. Poke a hole in it for me. Daniel Smith supports the referendum. It ultimately ends up on the ballot. We end up somewhere between 30 and 40 40%. She campaigns on the no side of the question to stay in Canada. She then uses the results of the referendum to trigger an election in which she&#39;s defending Canada and takes that poll position, so to speak, and saying, you know, we can&#39;t have this, I need to settle this once and for all. She triggers an early election based on that. Poke the strategic holes in what I&#39;ve just suggested, because this is how I want to transition into the current sort of horse</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that the only strategic problem I see in that is that instead of doing a referendum, then general election, I think she calls the general election right on top of it with the referendum attached. And then she&#39;s able to use her momentum to push for both. She gets the general election, and she&#39;s able to push for the middle and take advantage of</span>

Not saying what I&#39;ve laid out there is like my chosen option, it&#39;s just a scenario, but what&#39;s the wisdom of doing it all together when you&#39;re trying to almost compete against a faction of your own party versus go back to the public, be clear around where you were with your campaigning on the referendum, and then take it to the electorate</span>

And they were starting to get restive in February, as the, February-March, as the Liberal numbers came up. And then through the campaign, when it became increasingly evident that Pallieva was going to with it. So what does she do? She brings in these changes at the late stage of the session. It&#39;s like Bill 54 or whatever, which is, you know, a lot of bills came before it. And to change the threshold. Because essentially what she&#39;s saying is in you know it as this is moving in the months of february and march okay guys i&#39;ll make it easier for you i&#39;m gonna let the air out of the balloon you can go off and try to get your signatures right i&#39;m gonna make it easier for you to do this meanwhile then she does her televised address thingy right in which she says i&#39;m also going out to do a dog and pony show on this topic and if interesting ideas come out of that i&#39;m putting them on the ballot in 2026 that&#39;s what what she said okay</span>

I&#39;m going to go around and also let the air out of the balloon with a sort of government funded, like we&#39;re all going to pay for this exercise of her to go out and like meet people in, you know, Kowsnee, Alberta, to talk about how we&#39;re going to pay, you know, at least another, I don&#39;t know, like several billion dollars more to collect our own taxes for, you know, reasons. reasons um and uh and so that&#39;s all going to happen and</span>

I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to get it done for the Muni election, but part of this is her saying to them, fine, go see if you can get it on the 2025 Muni ballot, right? In 120 days or whatever. it is let me see yeah see what you got right uh they&#39;re gonna watch closely i think what happens with those by-election results but in particular in old stittsbury i don&#39;t think they&#39;re terrifically worried but uh you know we&#39;ll see if there&#39;s a bit of a rolling snowball to the momentum uh</span>

As we kind of transition to the set of what the B side of this polling, right, this polling also suggests that that if an election were held today, 60 plus seats for the UCP, but focusing in on the question we&#39;ve been discussing for the last 20 or some odd minutes, how does Nenshi get into this conversation? If a version of what we&#39;ve been discussing, that Smith is, you know, could or could not be a separatist herself, but will ultimately use this to try to tamper the virus within her party, or maybe take the pro-Canada side, how does Nenshi preempt this, get into the conversation, own the moment, you know, know insert any other descriptor that you&#39;d like uh to to to make himself and the ndp relevant on this particular question uh hopefully for political gain in in their case well</span>

            <span class="text">well in this current information environment unless you are sending out a photo of yourself with literally donald trump at mar-a-lago and or standing up on the national stage and uh threatening separation you are not getting attention, right? She&#39;s gotten attention because she has been able to essentially hit, like, ally herself with very, very attention-getting headlines and issues, okay? So how does Nenshi do this? Number one, he has to buy it. You have to buy your way in in this attention economy you just have to uh it does not matter how compelling your one-liners are your delivery even your substance the issue set none of it really matters i think we&#39;ve seen this uh through the health care procurement scandal it doesn&#39;t matter unless you were beating people over the head with it you know there was a wise guy i once saw on a panel last fall who made the case that you have to uh barge in on people you can&#39;t even ask their permission anymore and i think it was you zane uh who was sitting there saying feel right look like you have to buy your way in to the conversation so that&#39;s number one meaning that you better be out there uh fundraising your ass off and i hope the uh uh the incumbent mlas and the new democrats are doing that because that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to take like over and above anything of what you&#39;re saying how you&#39;re saying it you know uh vibes substance whatever you know issue set i i think think that&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re not going to quote-unquote break through unless you are buying your way through number one number</span>

And so that has got to be, you know, we&#39;ve had lesson after lesson after lesson, that voters are looking for that strength, right? I&#39;m mad about something. And I want somebody who I know is going to go in there and either burn it down, or fix it, or stand up to Ottawa or whatever the case may be. And so it&#39;s not, you know, I really care about public education. It&#39;s not that, right? Right. That&#39;s not what voters are looking for. And there&#39;s a space there within the 70 percent, to my previous point, to, you know, absolutely not. I&#39;m not going to put your retirement security at risk. I&#39;m not going to put your health care at risk. When you go into that emergency room because I fought for you and stood up for you, you&#39;re going to get the care you need.

In fact, I think they&#39;ve bought more stuff than the NDP. But she hasn&#39;t bought even some of the moments that Shannon kind of outlined. Mar-a-Lago, she hasn&#39;t bought the separatist bust. Exactly, to your point. I&#39;m not undercutting what you&#39;re saying because I agree with it. What is the NDP version of that? Like, I think the buying thing is interesting, and I think we&#39;ve discussed it on previous iterations, and I agree with it, and I think it&#39;s a natural next step. But what does the NDP earned game need to look like? This is something that I&#39;m fascinated by because they are producing content, and it is largely good looking, and it does, you know, talk about stuff.

I mean, all the procurement scandal stuff is, with like one or two exceptions, is not coming out of NDP oppo, it&#39;s coming out of the media, right? So they need to create their own weather on this, and you do that through oppo. I mean, in the first instance, who do you have to be willing to piss off, to Carter&#39;s point? The opponent.

But there has to be a component of it. Or you&#39;re just following stories at best. And stories, you know, like if it&#39;s going to appear in the Globe and Mail to use the procurement scandal, it&#39;s paywalled. It&#39;s not necessarily being followed by the rest of the media because there&#39;s not as much of a herd as there used to be on on on earned again to the question of the fractured information environment. environment so</span>

And of course, they need to, you know, show that everybody&#39;s behind the leader. uh the the piece that i&#39;ll be looking for in strathcona and it&#39;ll come later is um</span>

            <span class="text">right as beyonce said best revenge is your paper uh so i i am it is the the one place where they can raise money like stank uh in uh through that by election right uh to show momentum behind the leader that the leader can uh use this as an opportunity to really put uh uh money in the the machine so uh that is uh the outcome there you know the margin uh is likely to remain similar uh and if it doesn&#39;t to i don&#39;t think it will yeah</span>

            <span class="text">what i&#39;m looking for is you know what are we like and the way the new democrats report their finances we won&#39;t exactly know but uh if there&#39;s a bump in this by-election period on the finances, that will show us that they&#39;ve actually used, leveraged the by-election for what it</span>

            <span class="text">I like that answer. Shannon, can I stick with you on Edmonton-Elderslie? This is the riding in Southeast Edmonton. This is the Rod Loyola riding, longtime MLA, who left to go run federally in the last federal election. It has now opened up. we&#39;ve got a by-election happening there at the same time what are you looking for an</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">i don&#39;t know uh but like here&#39;s the thing right like if you don&#39;t know uh then um you better treat it like it&#39;s not going to be and uh get going right it&#39;s it&#39;s too tough to have riding level polling particularly uh in that corner of the world But like just in general, you know, even in a place where like people would have landlines, it&#39;s hard to get writing level polling. Like</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Or like Lethbridge West. And so like you can&#39;t rely on that. Your polling has to be your ground game.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And so I would behave as if I&#39;m five points behind. It&#39;s possible they are. It&#39;s possible they&#39;re five or ten points up. Who knows? And so when you don&#39;t know, you really have to take it seriously. So the New Democrats need to act like they&#39;re going to lose it. and that&#39;s always the best strategy for almost any seat that isn&#39;t Edmonton, Strathcona, Glenora, or Centre.</span>

            <span class="text">20 or higher makes them in play. Because you know how hard it is to get, like, we&#39;ve seen the fledgling parties before, right? The fledgling parties usually wind up in 5, 6, 10. If you&#39;re able to go over 20%, then you can start to make a case that you&#39;re real.</span>

            <span class="text">We have a province-wide number, Shannon, and I&#39;m going to come to you on this, but maybe react to Carter&#39;s point if yours is different around what you&#39;re watching for there. We have a province-wide number of 28. I&#39;m just doing the basic sort of match. Would they not be performing around 28 to 30 in rural? Should they not be hitting a bit higher? Are we setting the bar too high? But the question I reframe back to you, what are you looking for there?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, that&#39;s exactly what they should be aiming for. And anything less than that, I think, sort of, you know, shows that it&#39;s a bit of a fizzle. I&#39;m less bullish than Carter, maybe. I&#39;d be shocked if they put 15 points on the board, but maybe I&#39;m just being too chill on this. um i just uh i have to wonder you know the timing right of june uh the level uh you know people so people are pretty you</span>

            <span class="text">looking ahead to, and so we&#39;re not thinking, oh, I&#39;m going to go and, you know, mark a ballot. So it is hard to get people&#39;s attention. And in rural communities, too, people are starting to do, you know, like, they&#39;re just starting to do other things, right? And so I don&#39;t think that the momentum is there for these Republicans. I could be surprised, But if they&#39;re hitting more than 15, that&#39;s where, you know, I think that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">that would be significant for them. The other number I&#39;m looking for there is what does the NDP do? Because even in some of these more rural areas, you saw a decent liberal performance in the federal election. Like by which I mean, you know, like 20 odd. Right. Like, you know, coming up into the 20s. Right. That&#39;s that&#39;s not bad for those areas. is right especially if you&#39;ve got separatist sentiment on the other side uh bubbling and it&#39;s like you know rock ribbed conservative otherwise uh they&#39;ve got a decent candidate there so i&#39;m looking for like what happens within you know at least in old for example where you&#39;ve got post-secondary you&#39;ve got you know you&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s got uh the person on the ballot has a bit of you know uh cred like are they able to ride some of the nenshi momentum of you know know a sort of like centrist offer with a bit of momentum uh like he did within the um within the leadership race right that was just a year ago when he was you know i attended a thing in claire&#39;s home uh where you know there were hundreds of people uh in the room right for that leadership exercise in like i don&#39;t know i think it was in may or something of last year so is that there do we see uh uh that uh also happening uh for the party even though like obviously it&#39;s not going to be a win carter</span>

Like, oh, look at these nice Canadians standing up for themselves, right? You know, like kind of perpetuating some of our national narratives and myths and stories about ourselves. And, you know, it keeps riding that honeymoon a little bit, which he absolutely needs. To my previous point, going into the First Minister&#39;s meeting where they&#39;re going to be putting some of this, you know, national projects legislation in the window, you&#39;re going to start to see some of the fissures of Canadian federalism bubbling up. So he needs more of those moments of like, hey, remember why you sent me here? Remember why you were elbows up? Remember why you were mad? As we get into the more choppy waters of domestic politics.</span>
