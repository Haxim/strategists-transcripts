        <div class="desc"><p>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter dive into the latest polling numbers on Alberta separation sentiment, discussing their intensity and impact. Then they discuss the strategy and importance of managing separatist sentiment within Alberta politics. Is the current separatist situation in Alberta a unique one? What are the things to look for in the upcoming provincial by-elections? And what does FMM actually stand for?

I like this, Shannon. This is good. Okay, we&#39;re going to chat about a lot of things, including the fact that we have some new numbers regarding separation in Alberta. I want to talk about the by-elections in Alberta, And then I want to talk very quickly on the federal scene, what we make of this past week with Carney and the King. How did that visit go? Was there anything material you took out of it? Let&#39;s start with the separatist question, because that is what we did spend a significant amount of time last time the three of us were together discussing. In fact, I think it&#39;s the only thing we discussed when we walked through what our prospective</div>

          <div class="said">prospective strategies would be. What I&#39;d like to do is talk about the number. We now have a number. Janet Brown polling CBC have produced a number. it&#39;s 28%. That&#39;s where the separatist number stands. That number is not increasing from previous polling that Janet has done. But Carter, I&#39;ll start with you on this. The intensity of those that want to separate is deepening, intensifying. Yep.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I&#39;m reading it that when you have a group of people who already believe something, and then you decide to start pumping it up and making it more and more real, the intensity will change um you know this is the uh one of the principles of advertising is that in someone&#39;s open to the idea if you advertise with increasing frequency they&#39;ll become more and more open to the idea and i think that this is what danielle smith has enabled and and promoted by essentially advertising the idea of confederation or separation is that uh the more people who are those people who are open to the idea are going to become more ingrained uh as the as Daniela Smith makes it more and more real and opens up the pathway for it.</div>

          <div class="said">right? The intensity will ultimately move the number from 30% to 40%. That intensity, because what we&#39;re doing is now we&#39;re activating social networks and people within those social networks are going to be more and more likely to be talking about separation. They are emboldened. They are seeing their premier talk about it. They are willing to talk about it publicly. Whereas before, if it was kind of a two or three on the Likert scale, it wasn&#39;t really something that they were going to talk about. uh now that it&#39;s number one they are absolutely going to talk about it uh they&#39;re going to talk about it within their own groups where it&#39;s which are easier to find because people are more engaged and more you know excited about it if you will and they will talk about it within groups that are not necessarily uh separatist leaning shannon</div>

It&#39;s really hard to tell whether the intensity is I&#39;m pissed with the federal government, or I&#39;m out of here, right?

I think what it also means, though, on that intensity is there are more and more folks, if you can go find them, willing to sign a citizen initiative to put that question on the ballot. That&#39;s where the danger lies. also with as as soon as that intensity goes up even if you have even if you&#39;re stuck in in around 28 that&#39;s money right</div>

It&#39;s enough to start driving uncertainty. And as soon as you start driving uncertainty, you have to deal with it. You have to make things certain again. The best case scenario is that no one&#39;s able to get 170,000 signatures and everything kind of bogs down before we we actually get to a 70-30 outcome. Because the other problem, Zane, is it&#39;s quite a push to assume that we wind up in the exact same spot again.</div>

          <div class="said">is that we are looking in this province at at least 20 percent who have since ralph klein since the firewall letter at least like base of 20 percent who have been all in for, you know, a pension plan, tax collection, police service of some kind, right? Equalization, whatever that means, reform in some way, shape or form. Since at least that time, Klein had to, you know, make himself a little traveling roadshow and put together a little panel because he was worried about the fracture. And that was in like 04, or actually it was before 04 it was before the 04 election that he had to do that so this is not in that sense new right that like okay what&#39;s not new is the 20 percent like hard kind of you know outside of the conservative mainstream views that&#39;s how you got the wild rose it&#39;s how you got uh you know some of the people like kicking kenny out right they were able to mobilize themselves a lot better in the last decade, I would argue, than they could in the decade before that.

It&#39;s all these other issues that are, you know, seen as somewhat, and those ones are even worse, seen as somewhat wackadoodle by the electorate, right? The, you know, the police stuff, the CPP stuff, less so equalization, leave that one off to the side. But some of these other specific policy solutions that come with separation are still in the same neighborhood, right? They just of 20 percent ish. So you need to be able to reach enough of the 70 to cobble together a coalition. That&#39;s the political problem in front of people.</div>

Daniel Smith supports the referendum. It ultimately ends up on the ballot. We end up somewhere between 30 and 40 40%. She campaigns on the no side of the question to stay in Canada. She then uses the results of the referendum to trigger an election in which she&#39;s defending Canada and takes that poll position, so to speak, and saying, you know, we can&#39;t have this, I need to settle this once and for all. She triggers an early election based on that. Poke the strategic holes in what I&#39;ve just suggested, because this is how I want to transition into the current sort of horse</div>

It&#39;s like Bill 54 or whatever, which is, you know, a lot of bills came before it. And to change the threshold. Because essentially what she&#39;s saying is in you know it as this is moving in the months of february and march okay guys i&#39;ll make it easier for you i&#39;m gonna let the air out of the balloon you can go off and try to get your signatures right i&#39;m gonna make it easier for you to do this meanwhile then she does her televised address thingy right in which she says i&#39;m also going out to do a dog and pony show on this topic and if interesting ideas come out of that i&#39;m putting them on the ballot in 2026 that&#39;s what what she said okay</div>

I&#39;m going to go around and also let the air out of the balloon with a sort of government funded, like we&#39;re all going to pay for this exercise of her to go out and like meet people in, you know, Kowsnee, Alberta, to talk about how we&#39;re going to pay, you know, at least another, I don&#39;t know, like several billion dollars more to collect our own taxes for, you know, reasons. reasons um and uh and so that&#39;s all going to happen and</div>

If a version of what we&#39;ve been discussing, that Smith is, you know, could or could not be a separatist herself, but will ultimately use this to try to tamper the virus within her party, or maybe take the pro-Canada side, how does Nenshi preempt this, get into the conversation, own the moment, you know, know insert any other descriptor that you&#39;d like uh to to to make himself and the ndp relevant on this particular question uh hopefully for political gain in in their case well</div>

She&#39;s gotten attention because she has been able to essentially hit, like, ally herself with very, very attention-getting headlines and issues, okay? So how does Nenshi do this? Number one, he has to buy it. You have to buy your way in in this attention economy you just have to uh it does not matter how compelling your one-liners are your delivery even your substance the issue set none of it really matters i think we&#39;ve seen this uh through the health care procurement scandal it doesn&#39;t matter unless you were beating people over the head with it you know there was a wise guy i once saw on a panel last fall who made the case that you have to uh barge in on people you can&#39;t even ask their permission anymore and i think it was you zane uh who was sitting there saying feel right look like you have to buy your way in to the conversation so that&#39;s number one meaning that you better be out there uh fundraising your ass off and i hope the uh uh the incumbent mlas and the new democrats are doing that because that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to take like over and above anything of what you&#39;re saying how you&#39;re saying it you know uh vibes substance whatever you know issue set i i think think that&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re not going to quote-unquote break through unless you are buying your way through number one number</div>

He&#39;s got the strength to stand up to Trump. I&#39;m not sure about this other guy. Seems like he&#39;s crawled up Trump&#39;s ass. us. And so that has got to be, you know, we&#39;ve had lesson after lesson after lesson, that voters are looking for that strength, right? I&#39;m mad about something. And I want somebody who I know is going to go in there and either burn it down, or fix it, or stand up to Ottawa or whatever the case may be. And so it&#39;s not, you know, I really care about public education. It&#39;s not that, right? Right. That&#39;s not what voters are looking for. And there&#39;s a space there within the 70 percent, to my previous point, to, you know, absolutely not. I&#39;m not going to put your retirement security at risk. I&#39;m not going to put your health care at risk. When you go into that emergency room because I fought for you and stood up for you, you&#39;re going to get the care you need.

In fact, I think they&#39;ve bought more stuff than the NDP. But she hasn&#39;t bought even some of the moments that Shannon kind of outlined. Mar-a-Lago, she hasn&#39;t bought the separatist bust. Exactly, to your point. I&#39;m not undercutting what you&#39;re saying because I agree with it. What is the NDP version of that? Like, I think the buying thing is interesting, and I think we&#39;ve discussed it on previous iterations, and I agree with it, and I think it&#39;s a natural next step. But what does the NDP earned game need to look like? This is something that I&#39;m fascinated by because they are producing content, and it is largely good looking, and it does, you know, talk about stuff.

And what I want to ask you guys to do is they&#39;re happening in concert. There&#39;s three of them, Edmonton, Ellerslie, Edmonton, Strathcona, and the old Didsbury Three Hills, formerly the latter, the formerly of the former speaker who&#39;s now been in DC tell me about one potentially unique thing you&#39;re looking for excited to see outcome based excited to learn about in each of these and I ideally like them to be different we often talk about they&#39;re all happening at the same time but what are you looking for each and let&#39;s start with Edmonton Strathcona Carter I&#39;ll start with you What are you looking for in Edmonton Strathcona? This is, of course, a formal Rachel Notley seat. Nenshi&#39;s running here to become the MLA there, to get his seat in the house. What are you looking for there? What are you interested to see? This could be strategy. This could be tactics. This could be ground game. This could be outcome. This could be anything. I&#39;m giving you a wide berth.</div>

          <div class="said">that would be significant for them. The other number I&#39;m looking for there is what does the NDP do? Because even in some of these more rural areas, you saw a decent liberal performance in the federal election. Like by which I mean, you know, like 20 odd. Right. Like, you know, coming up into the 20s. Right. That&#39;s that&#39;s not bad for those areas. is right especially if you&#39;ve got separatist sentiment on the other side uh bubbling and it&#39;s like you know rock ribbed conservative otherwise uh they&#39;ve got a decent candidate there so i&#39;m looking for like what happens within you know at least in old for example where you&#39;ve got post-secondary you&#39;ve got you know you&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s got uh the person on the ballot has a bit of you know uh cred like are they able to ride some of the nenshi momentum of you know know a sort of like centrist offer with a bit of momentum uh like he did within the um within the leadership race right that was just a year ago when he was you know i attended a thing in claire&#39;s home uh where you know there were hundreds of people uh in the room right for that leadership exercise in like i don&#39;t know i think it was in may or something of last year so is that there do we see uh uh that uh also happening uh for the party even though like obviously it&#39;s not going to be a win carter</div>

          <div class="said">exactly i mean he did it with the john stewart thing uh and uh the overall oval office visit you know uh the day after the election campaign who&#39;s he doing an interview with the bbc right uh he obviously has a lot of these contacts like literally himself and a lot of his comms people but again it was one of those moments where it&#39;s like we are proud of ourselves because other people are talking about us in a way that is defending us, is reinterpreting our own values for us. Like, oh, look at these nice Canadians standing up for themselves, right? You know, like kind of perpetuating some of our national narratives and myths and stories about ourselves. And, you know, it keeps riding that honeymoon a little bit, which he absolutely needs. To my previous point, going into the First Minister&#39;s meeting where they&#39;re going to be putting some of this, you know, national projects legislation in the window, you&#39;re going to start to see some of the fissures of Canadian federalism bubbling up. So he needs more of those moments of like, hey, remember why you sent me here? Remember why you were elbows up? Remember why you were mad? As we get into the more choppy waters of domestic politics.</div>
