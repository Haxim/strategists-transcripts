            <span class="text">Good analysis. I would say that Carter&#39;s analysis is much sharper than Corey&#39;s on that. Corey, hopefully you&#39;ll have to make up for it. Many quarterbacks coming in the clutch. Did someone say clutch, by the way? God, we hope not. Flair Airlines. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, the law of large numbers. Guys, I want to actually focus the attention to our home province here in Alberta. And that law is one Casey Madu. And that large number is $300 because we have</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">have now learned that and we didn&#39;t get to cover this earlier this week because, you know, the coin flip just didn&#39;t land our way. But we&#39;ve learned that Alberta&#39;s Justice Minister Casey Madu was fined $300 for distracted driving in a school zone last March. To put calendar dates on it, if you don&#39;t know what year it is, that was March of 21. We&#39;re now learning that Premier Jason Kenney knew about his Justice Minister&#39;s distracted driving ticket last year, and is now throwing this to a third party investigation. Why is this a big deal? Well, it&#39;s a big deal because Minister Madu at the time got the ticket and then immediately called the police chief of the Edmonton Police Service, not to talk about the ticket, but called him regardless to talk about racial profiling, et cetera, et cetera.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, you know, there&#39;s a lot to unpack here, and I want to unpack the political consequences. But let&#39;s talk about Madu before we talk about Kenney, because I think the focal point is on kenny sure how bad was this bad judgment in the series of badly judged political plays or political ineptitude that you&#39;ve seen in your years analyzing politics in alberta for the minister of justice to call the police chief about</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah conveniently to talk about racial profiling at a time where he got this ticket well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it was racial profiling and the fact that badu was saying that he did not have his phone out of his breast pocket the phone remained in his breast pocket and therefore the The ticket was all about racial profiling as opposed to, you know, someone putting their— That is correct.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">same question remains in terms of bad judgment. How bad was the bad judgment?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Ridiculously bad. I mean, I think that, first of all, let&#39;s not sweep the idea of systemic racism under the carpet here. There are issues of systemic racism that exist in Canadian policing. That</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is something that police chiefs across the country are trying to deal with, some successfully, some less successfully. But systemic racism is the time to pick up the telephone and call about systemic racism is not when you&#39;ve got the $300 ticket. Keeping in mind that you&#39;re the minister of the crown here, the amount of power that a justice minister has in the system, you&#39;re not supposed to be picking up the telephone and calling the police services at all. The Police Act is really clear about that and the idea that you&#39;re going to lobby, keeping in mind that the police chief doesn&#39;t report to the Justice Ministry, he reports to the Edmonton Police Commission, and this is totally out of line. So I think that this needed to be done.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The conversation can still exist, you know, where Casey Maddow brings his own experience to the table and says, listen, I think I have experienced systemic racism. Here are my examples. I think that conversation can exist. But when you have the ticket, which is only $300, pay</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">pay the damn ticket and then use it as a story. Use it as an example of things that you think might be rotten in the state of Denmark. Don&#39;t instead just come to the table and say, I&#39;ve</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ve got this ticket and now I&#39;m angry. And that&#39;s, I think, it shows two mistakes. Number one, acting when you&#39;re emotional. Number two, actually picking up the phone and calling the police chief.</span>

And that&#39;s something I think that weighs on a lot of staffers&#39; minds. So there&#39;s two things on that, that I think that, you know, staffers have to wrestle with in their mind in advance and understand where their lines are in advance, right? One is, what</span>

            <span class="text">what is your line? What are you willing to say? I&#39;m not willing to do that. You know, everybody gets into politics for one reason, and then they become a staffer and that becomes about the team and the people, you know, and the camaraderie and all of that. And it&#39;s just these pressures on your moral compass that you just need to be aware of when you have a job like that and you need to manage them and you need to regulate them the other is so there&#39;s that component like what is your line in the sand think about it in advance don&#39;t find yourself in a situation where you&#39;re just moving it and retroactively making an excuse for where it is after the fact as time goes on and then the other one is and this is advice for anybody in any job make</span>

But intent does matter here, and it will be interesting to see what the report comes out in some ways the actions after once people became aware of it to me are the ones that twist out there i think with less less justification if that makes sense because you know that&#39;s not in defense of like you know the bigger societal challenges that you know the you know the reality that visible minorities are treated differently in this country than white people so um but you know when then there&#39;s all of a sudden there&#39;s nine months of cleanup and people being aware of it that raises further questions for me yeah</span>

And Carter, we often talk about issues management as a vital role, as something we&#39;ve, you know, on this podcast have said in the past, the liberals, especially around the WE scandal, etc., haven&#39;t done super well, that this government here in Alberta has made certain lapses on. Before we jump into what should a premier&#39;s office do if and when they find out, talk to me about what issues management actually is, Carter. Like, talk to me about it as a function, because many people would be like, issues managers, A, they&#39;ve either seen people yell loudly on Twitter and have said, is that what an issues manager does? And B, people might have a very simplistic understanding of, Isn&#39;t it just spin? Isn&#39;t it whatever just comes in, they&#39;re just constantly spinning? So can you give us a sense from like almost a nonpartisan level, or like, you know, probably even removed from this premier&#39;s office, what the role of issues management is, because every government has them, regardless of what jersey color they wear or have worn coming into leadership of a province. Explain to me what that is. And then let&#39;s jump into issues management related to this specific issue with Minister Madhu. do?</span>

            <span class="text">Issues management is primarily about taking the complexity of a particular situation and breaking it down into its various risks and opportunities. So the risks and opportunities aren&#39;t necessarily the same, nor are they necessarily different. So you can take any issue and whatever that issue might be brings with it certain complexities. So if we stick with the Madhu incident, you know, Corey mentioned that maybe he was trying to do the bigger discussion, right? And it comes to him and everything. When broken down on its simple face, it&#39;s obviously a mistake. But when it comes to you as an issues manager, it comes to you with all the degrees of complexity. And the issues manager job is to try and figure out how to present something so that all those layers of complexity</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I want to get to you in one second. I&#39;ve got one clarifying question for you, Carter. You talked about their role in terms of win or losses. To extend our football analogies, does an issues manager primarily play on the offensive line or the defensive line? Are they an offensive player or a defensive player in that sense? How How would you characterize their positionality? Or would you say that they&#39;re like special teams, they&#39;re on both?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that the truth of the matter is when things are going well, you don&#39;t need an issues manager quite as much. I mean, certainly you do sometimes just to make sure the ball gets across the line if you&#39;ll allow the football analogy to be carried. Because, you know, you want to get that actual win, right? So you&#39;ll be working on something that&#39;s got a positive piece and you want to push it across the line. But the truth is, even something you think is incredibly positive, the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the general population can turn it into something very negative with just a couple of different tweaks, right? Because you&#39;re playing an adversarial game, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? So you might be bringing across something you think is really popular. And all of a sudden, the whole population turns on you or a subset of the population that you really care about turns on you. So I think that 80% of the time, you&#39;re in the defensive zone and you&#39;re trying to do a couple of different things. you know and we&#39;ll stretch the we&#39;ll stretch the uh the the football analogy as far as we can you&#39;re trying to get a turnover so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, so issues management as a function has has been around forever. There&#39;s no question about that. We used to call them political fixers, you know, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it was a little bit less of a formalized function back then. The issues manager, though, when you say every government has them, I want to be clear, partisan issues managers is a relatively new function. You know, in the past couple of decades here, they&#39;ve been in political in departments for ages, there&#39;s been political staff who have had the role of trying to tamp down issues, since there&#39;s been politics, I&#39;m not suggesting otherwise. But this operationalization of a group of people called issues managers who work within premier&#39;s offices and prime minister&#39;s offices and whatnot. That&#39;s that&#39;s relatively new. Now, like I said, has it been around before? Yeah. Has it been around in this format? I would say not really.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And in some ways, issues managers, there&#39;s two different ways you can think about them. There&#39;s two different versions of issues manager. And depending on where you are as a government, you may lean more on one than the other.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The simple one is to see it as reactive comms. It&#39;s to deal with the incoming, right? And you separate your stream so you have your comms people dealing with proactive stories. Obviously, they&#39;re still leaning in on messaging heavily, but the heavy lift is done by the issues managers managers to get ready to have all of the right messages. But that&#39;s much narrower than an issues manager generally is, right? I think another way to think about it is that whenever there&#39;s something that comes up in terms of an issue, the frame I like to think of it is, you&#39;ve got a couple of roads in front of you. And maybe roads isn&#39;t even the right metaphor, because you can walk both at the same time. You&#39;ve got a couple of levers you can pull. I always say that. There&#39;s mitigation, which</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">which is you go and you change something, you know, from a policy or implementation point of view, maybe stakeholder relation point of view, where you&#39;ve gone in and you&#39;ve actually addressed the root issue there. And then there&#39;s messaging. And that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to talk about the issue when it eventually comes out. And issues managers deal with both. But mitigation is often better, because then it&#39;s not an issue you&#39;ve got to talk about in the public at all. And so... Sorry,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">just so I&#39;m clear, is it a balance of mitigation and messaging generally?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">generally? No, it&#39;s not. No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s a choice. It&#39;s knowing that both levers are they&#39;re available to you. So what I, for me, what makes issues management distinct from just communications and it being reactive communications is that they actually work with the department. They try to find solutions to things. They work with the stakeholders. They try to make it so it&#39;s not an issue at all. And you know, the issues management teams in every premier&#39;s office that I&#39;ve worked with are so, I mean, they get there so bloody early in the morning and they&#39;ve done half their day, it feels like before the morning meeting. And most of the stuff when they&#39;ve really done their job just never comes up at all you know it&#39;s like random thing like we got this letter this person who&#39;s accusing this other person of this horrible thing i&#39;ve looked into it there&#39;s no evidence of it here&#39;s what we&#39;ve identified right or there&#39;s this you know early warning system radar that we might have a problem over there i&#39;ve talked to the department we&#39;ve managed to correct the thing the department was going to do that was fucking everybody out right they&#39;re</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">take the early warnings, deal with them as they come, have messaging, narrow the issue in general. But the narrowing of the issue I think for me is what makes it distinct, right? That&#39;s the mitigation part. If it&#39;s just comms – like I&#39;ve been a professional communicator my whole life. I can tell you one of my great frustrations in communications is when people are like, oh, we&#39;re going to need some great messaging for this, right? We&#39;re going to have to comms the shit out of this. Okay, that&#39;s one option. The other option is you fix the fucking problem that&#39;s leading to</span>

            <span class="text">what I think is very valuable about issues management is that they&#39;re a little bit more empowered to work with the people who are actually executing throughout the government to resolve before it becomes a messaging challenge. So</span>

This kind of makes it to one of the issues managers. Actually, let me stop myself there. Sure. Corey, would this be, from your experience, Carter, from your experience, would this be something that hits the issues managers play? It would, right? So here&#39;s the thing, right? Our listeners may not know, both of you have worked in government. I have not worked extensively on the campaigns that have helped some of these governments. So I just want to be clear, right? So it would land on issues managers play.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Take it from there. What would, if you were kind of mocking up that role, if you were, Carter, simulating that position, let&#39;s say the two of you are a team of two issues, senior issues managers. It&#39;s a morning meeting. You&#39;ve heard about this through the grapevine, which is partially your job, right? Is to have tabs on stuff. What are you talking about? And which pathway are you choosing of mitigation, messaging, et cetera? And then what&#39;s the downstream advice that kind of then follows for the principal? Corey, you got your hand up. I&#39;m going to go back to you first. Is that okay, Carter? And then I&#39;ll jump to you. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, step one is figure out exactly what the hell happened, right? So fact gathering is job number one, okay? And so especially if you&#39;re like the director of issues management, you are probably calling the minister and saying, you are telling me everything that occurred in that phone call, what the hell happened, trying to understand that as much as possible. We&#39;ll also try and understand as much as you can without blowing up the issue further, because, of course, your job is issues management, not issues explosion, right? You want to see if you have any other sources of information as to, for example, how Chief McPhee feels about the phone call. That would be very useful to understand, right? So people in his orbit. And I say it all the time, words to live by, folks, good strategy comes from good analysis. So if you want to manage an issue, you first need to understand the issue. where everything is who&#39;s doing what and so this is i think where um things get a little bit gray and why issues managers sometimes get like this view as like a dark arts uh proficient uh folks is that you&#39;re not going to sit there and have the highly moral conversations about was this right or was this wrong that&#39;s somebody else&#39;s job in the department your job as an issues manager is to understand the facts bring the options have the mitigations have the messaging ready carter</span>

Number one, the question of if you burn him, but let&#39;s go to the more fundamental question. Are you implicating the principal, i.e. the premier in this case for, you know, folks at home? Are you bringing this to the premier so that he or she knows? In this case, he, but like, are you bringing it to Kenny? Let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s be super clear. The number of bullshit rumors that float around in any given day about elected officials and what they may or may not have done or be doing is significant. And so there is a filtering that has to go on. And it is important that the issues manager doesn&#39;t bring everything to the premier that they&#39;ve heard out there for all sorts of reasons. But let&#39;s start with a couple of the obvious ones here. One might be bullshit and you wouldn&#39;t want the boss to go off on a hair trigger and do something crazy, right? On information that has not yet been vetted. So this is, again, good strategy comes from good analysis. You don&#39;t come until you have a better understanding of the issue. you. But number two, there is a plausible deniability question here. Again, let&#39;s keep in mind, we&#39;re working in a world where nobody knows things a hundred percent. There&#39;s no perfect knowledge out there, right? So as an issues manager, you are trying to gather facts. You are going to put things together. Your best is your understanding of the matter for an issue like the Madhu case. You know, other issues manage differently, different considerations. And if you go and you tell the boss, okay, you hear about a phone call on Tuesday, You tell the boss on a Wednesday, two weeks pass as you&#39;re gathering information, and ultimately you decide, yes, I need to do something.</span>

Corey, you know, you&#39;re analyzing, figuring out what&#39;s true, getting a sense of the terrain. You&#39;re then taking, you know, probably a bunch of suggestions to the premier. We know the choice that, whether it was the premier, the chief of staff, but that this collective unit in the premier&#39;s office made, which was not to make this a public thing, right? They chose not to make this in March, April, whenever they found out, not to make this an announcement, an FYI, a footnote somewhere, not to take out the trash. Why do you think that was was perhaps the choice made? And I&#39;ll kind of go on a second question thereafter, which is, if that was the choice, okay, we will take out the trash, how would you have done it? So give me your analysis. And then let&#39;s talk about strategy of if you wanted to take out the trash on this, how would you have done it knowing that that was a decision made by the team?</span>

The system that Stephen described is actually quite congruous with jason kenney saying i don&#39;t i this was the first i heard about these specifics of the matter right because it&#39;s not inconceivable to me in the least that there was this hey we&#39;re hearing this thing mad who called the police chief after that ticket we all knew about the like the fact the premier knew about the ticket you get a ticket you got to tell the premier that&#39;s the reality in fact if you work in the public service at the senior levels you you get a fine any of those things you got to tell your boss about them because there are considerations that come with all of that stuff uh so yes he would have heard about the ticket that&#39;s protocol you got to hear about the ticket now somebody says hey i</span>

            <span class="text">i hear he called mcphee about this and then there&#39;s a bit of a conversation investigation whatever happens and perhaps the chief of staff is talking to that issues director and saying to that issues director at the end of the day we don&#39;t know anything and the way that madu describes it describes it as not even talking about the ticket right because Because again, like, we&#39;re assuming a certain amount of information is perfect out there, and that everybody knows exactly what&#39;s going on. And if there&#39;s even a little bit of doubt, I mean, you better be right about something like this, right?

And then as time passes, it&#39;s not an issue, and it just falls off everybody&#39;s radar. And nobody thinks about it for six months until a disgruntled staffer decides to tell a CBC journalist. And then, voila, all of a sudden, there we are. And it&#39;s a big news story. So I can understand, based on the rhythm of offices, how that happened.

            <span class="text">I mean, he looks pretty strong right now. I mean, he essentially moved the minister out. He skipped over a bunch of lawyers. They&#39;re still sitting in the back bench and gave it to an existing minister. You know, I think that, you know, not Tyler Shandro and not Doug Schweitzer, who are both, you know, lawyers as well. I mean, this was kind of an interesting solution that he&#39;s created for himself. And I think that as problems go, if he couldn&#39;t drop it on a Friday before Christmas or between Christmas and New Year&#39;s, which might have been, you know, if you were to go back in time and make this happen, that might have been a better solution. If this is the way that this was going to go, he acted decisively. He so far ignored and managed to cross off the what did you know and when did you know it questions. And it feels like, you know, he&#39;s going to skate, keeping in mind that our collective attention span is not much more than a week. And we&#39;re on the tail end of it, which will drive our huge listener numbers even better because we&#39;re talking about an issue that&#39;s over a week old. But this is this is great.

Or a group of people are talking, and it seems strategically timed that they&#39;re talking, you know, causation correlation. But Carter, how are you preparing for other sort of bombshells leading up to your leadership review, right? Knowing that people are going to go for strategically timed missiles against you, knowing that you&#39;ve made a bit of a rebound and you&#39;ve created the conditions to secure your leadership quite nicely heading into April. So talk to me about that broader notion. And I&#39;m not, and once again, this is speculation. We don&#39;t know if this story is related to that, but the timing is quite interesting when you look at it. So talk to me about that, Carter.</span>

And I mean, like, this is one of those things where everybody all of a sudden becomes Sherlock Holmes and tries to put these pieces together in their own respective mind palaces and come to conclusions here. My experience on this matter is people will jump quickly to conclusions. They will have trouble sort of expanding beyond the suspects they immediately predict. And they&#39;re rarely able to actually prove it, right? There&#39;s just, there&#39;s not a lot of tools that allow a government to understand that, particularly if the call is coming from outside the house right like it&#39;s not from a government email account access to documents in a situation like this it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to see somebody downloaded that document eight months ago yeah just like it&#39;s not going to be in a system like that so yeah people will look for what&#39;s the slant on the story who&#39;s the hero who&#39;s the villain do the facts show that the story like are they frozen at a certain point in time when x number of people knew but not y number and you know you look for all of that was there a recent termination a recent aggravation from the the list of people who knew and you make strong educated guesses but it&#39;s again it&#39;s very difficult it&#39;s very difficult to concretely definitively say in most cases right in most cases very difficult carter</span>

Is it tying it into an existing narrative? Is it putting it on the feet of Jason Kenney? What would you be doing if you&#39;re the NDP looking at what&#39;s come out thus far on this particular story and trying to drive a clear pattern that&#39;s resonant home?</span>

Now move on to the next thing, which is making sure that people remember that the healthcare system is suffering, the education system is suffering. You can get distracted by these things in the moment and run around like you&#39;ve scored the winning touchdown to further the overtime touchdown when you had the ball, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you&#39;re going to win the next round of the playoffs.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for me the simple case also needs to have the right target and the right target has to be the premier, not Casey Maddow, who is almost certainly going to lose his seat if polls are going to be believed. He&#39;s the only Edmonton UCP MLA. He&#39;s in a sea of orange. It seems unlikely to me he maintains that position. So like, what are you going to do? You don&#39;t need to giant slay Casey Maddow here. That&#39;s not necessary.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So think about that. Think about how in one sentence, you can effectively lay this at the feet of the premier and call into question the premier&#39;s judgment, not Casey Maddow&#39;s judgment. Uh, Casey Maddow&#39;s judgment is only relevant insofar as it reflects on the premier. So maybe something along the lines of no matter what his reasons, the base facts are a minister of the crown called a police chief to complain about a ticket and the premier&#39;s office decided to cover it up.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That is your point. It is not Casey Maddow has bad judgment. It&#39;s nothing like that. It&#39;s the premier&#39;s office decided to cover it up. What else are they covering up and calling the question, the premier&#39;s office, not, not the the minister, who is not your target at this particular moment.</span>
