          <p>The gang assemble to discuss political party name changes through a new group's crusade to get the Alberta NDP to change their name. Does that idea has any merit? And regardless of that - how it could be done?</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter deep diver on whether the Alberta NDP should consider a name change and how - if that was somebody's desire - it should be done. How important is the name of a party when it comes to brand perception? What's the optimal timing for such a move? Is this something a leadership candidate could or should take on? And is "Curse of Strategy" taken as a podcast name? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">there&#39;s a new group, albertasprogressivefuture.ca. They are making a case. It seems like a one-issue organization, at least thus far, that has sprouted up, exploring the idea of rebranding the Alberta&#39;s NDP. They provide some polling, some isolated questions from some Janet Brown polling. They make an argument for many center-left voters not choosing the Alberta NDP because of its affiliations with the federal NDP. And then they give about five points about why it&#39;s time to change the name of the Alberta NDP. The NDP lost an election they should have won. The party&#39;s evolved. They need to be in control of their own brand. A progressive government is more important than nostalgia for a brand. And finally, progressive voters will not stay united if we, as in the NDP, don&#39;t win.</div>

But it&#39;d be weird for me to jump straight into that without asking you. Carter first. From where this stands, from when that election was in May, to where we are in November, to to where you see things going, to the rumors you hear about leadership, give me your top line answer on the question that this group is posing. Should the Alberta NDP be strongly considering a rebrand slash name change?</div>

If the goal, and this is like, and I&#39;m not putting you in a different mode, here&#39;s the question. If the goal is to at some point, whether it&#39;s Corey&#39;s point of ultimately, which you might agree with, or initially, two years out, three years out, four years out, like we are right now, change the name, what would you advise the process be?

            <div class="said">you know what is it we we&#39;re we mean when we talk about brand change and let&#39;s go back to what Corey and I both said and that is that changing a brand is about changing the kind of the the entire experience of the of the party party, if you will, what is it that we stand for? Who are we? What are we known for? And I think that that doesn&#39;t start with something like, like, let&#39;s say that Rachel Notley is planning to, you know, to resign as speculation is rampant, and she&#39;s going to leave the leadership. Well, don&#39;t change the name of the party on your way out the door, because the name of the party on the name of on the way out the door isn&#39;t actually going to change the brand relationship. Instead, Instead, a new leader comes in, a new leader comes in. But it&#39;s not just that there&#39;s a new leader in town. What it is, is there&#39;s a new leader who&#39;s going to run the party with different values, different morals, different ideas, different thoughts, different priorities, different ideas. You know, all the all the things that we think of when we think of a political party, that&#39;s going to change because there&#39;s there&#39;s new leadership. and it reflects the values of the potential voters that we wish to attract in a different way. So don&#39;t begin at the end. Don&#39;t say we&#39;re going to change the name because this is different. Instead, begin at the beginning and say, what is it that we&#39;re trying to create? What is it that we&#39;re trying to create? And if it is a different relationship with different voters, then start to make that change. Make all of that change before you even think about changing the letterhead,</div>

Corey, you called it a day one problem. You also said there&#39;s a chance that someone could run it as the holistic change candidate and win, but that&#39;s a political gamble, so to speak. And then on the back end, I&#39;ve got this is like a thing that you flip over, right? Like six months before I introduced a new brand, here it is.

Carter&#39;s saying that the line at the top of this document that we are creating through just our voice should have a, you know, a different question to ask rather than the strategy to change the Alberta NDP name. It should be titled, this memo that we are writing should be titled something different. Do you agree?</div>

            <div class="said">I do. And I think that maybe you don&#39;t call it the distancing strategy, but like, a name change is a means to an end. And actually, this group, this Alberta&#39;s Progressive Future, This talk has a question about like, oh, too close to the federal NDP. Not the only way you can resolve that problem. Like one of the things we heard a lot during the election was a standard talking point of the NDP constitution says the federal constitution takes precedence, right? So Jagmeet Singh is Rachel Notley&#39;s boss. Okay, well, change the NDP constitution,</div>

And Corey&#39;s trigger is interesting, because many folks would know the problem, but people aren&#39;t paying attention to this day to day. You need a proof point, an example, a live wire to trigger a particular move and saying this is a pattern of behavior that we can no longer stomach. I appreciate that, Corey.

You&#39;ve got T-minus sort of like six months, but it&#39;s not a date on the calendar. You say we&#39;re going, do or die. No, you look for an organic moment to kind of make this happen. You try to orchestrate a bit of that. You include policies, constitutional changes, other relationships throughout this period that make it very clear. Corey, I have to push a little bit on policies, and then I want to push on third party groups. Those are the two things on my mind. Do you need a big signature trigger policy policy to create distance it doesn&#39;t have to be in that same time horizon just before you do it but do you need something to create space and then what is that for you you talk about orchestrating what would you orchestrate from like a policy perspective that could create that distance we&#39;ve talked constitution we&#39;ve talked brand we&#39;ve talked name etc policy does paul where does that kind of fit in yeah</div>

Does that make sense to you? Because I think at the end of the day, the viability of this party is due to pretty much one woman And what she was able to do with it, one would argue, or there is an argument to be made. You may want to disagree with it, either of you. But I&#39;ll put that on the table as a consideration for the broader rebrand change the relationship project that this memo is about. out?</div>

Is there a point in this time horizon that we&#39;re talking about where Corey&#39;s kind of anchored us to T minus six months with eventual potential name change? Is there a period at any point that having a third party, whether it&#39;s this group, different groups, formal, informal, informal. We talk about generating the parade of the enthusiasm for something like this to happen. Is that helpful? This group is saying they want to start the conversation, right? That&#39;s their mantra.

            <div class="said">Well, look, I have a good friend. His name&#39;s Justin Archer. He had analysis after the 2015 election about why the Alberta NDP won, which I kind of fundamentally agree with here in terms of not so much why the Alberta NDP was ahead of the wild rose, but why the Alberta party became nothing, the Alberta liberals became nothing, and the Alberta NDP sucked up all of that vote, right? It&#39;s because those other two organizations were so internally focused and trying to figure out the perfect mechanism through which this vote could be delivered instead of actually doing the work that&#39;s required. And the way Justin&#39;s put it, and I&#39;ve stolen and I&#39;ve used this phrase a bunch of times, is they are the only ones who were dressed when the bus came, right? Like everybody else was fucking debating about what clothes they&#39;re going to wear that day. And so, yeah, I mean, these things can be poisonous, distracting arguments. And lest we forget, in 2015, in Edmonton Centre, in a Liberal-held seat, the Alberta Liberal Party held the seat, Lori Blakeman lost. I think she might even come in third, but I might be wrong about that. Remember this, yeah, sure.</div>

As Corey said in the very first sentence that he spoke in this episode, You don&#39;t change the relationship with the voters simply by changing your name. Give the voters more credit. They&#39;re not just looking down and saying, well, I don&#39;t like that. That&#39;s the reason they&#39;re giving. That&#39;s not the reason why they&#39;re not voting for you.</div>

He&#39;s in a different time zone. That&#39;s my first prediction. He is in a different time zone where he had dinner with people who were very casual about the timing of dinner, which, by the way, is a very roundabout way of saying he was with brown people. And thirdly, he estimated, he said, listen, it&#39;s 10.30, I&#39;m going to definitely make it. That&#39;s when we record 10.30 p</div>
