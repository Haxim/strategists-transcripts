We&#39;re going to talk about the rebranding of the Alberta NDP. Why are we talking about this? Because, guys, there&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a new group, albertasprogressivefuture.ca. They are making a case. It seems like a one-issue organization, at least thus far, that has sprouted up, exploring the idea of rebranding the Alberta&#39;s NDP. They provide some polling, some isolated questions from some Janet Brown polling. They make an argument for many center-left voters not choosing the Alberta NDP because of its affiliations with the federal NDP. And then they give about five points about why it&#39;s time to change the name of the Alberta NDP. The NDP lost an election they should have won. The party&#39;s evolved. They need to be in control of their own brand. A progressive government is more important than nostalgia for a brand. And finally, progressive voters will not stay united if we, as in the NDP, don&#39;t win.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s a lot to talk about, and I want to spend the majority of this episode talking about the how, irregardless of what you guys think of an Alberta NDP rebrand. But it&#39;d be weird for me to jump straight into that without asking you. Carter first. From where this stands, from when that election was in May, to where we are in November, to to where you see things going, to the rumors you hear about leadership, give me your top line answer on the question that this group is posing. Should the Alberta NDP be strongly considering a rebrand slash name change?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you can&#39;t say rebrand slash name change. That&#39;s not the same.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Because it&#39;s not a rebrand. Brand is not about name. You know, if you go to, you know, a discount airline like Flair Airlines, you know, you&#39;re you&#39;re it&#39;s not just the name Flair Airlines.

I&#39;m not convinced that they ever need to change the name of the organization. And I am entirely convinced that conversations about changing the name of an organization are a waste of time.

            <span class="text">you know what is it we we&#39;re we mean when we talk about brand change and let&#39;s go back to what Corey and I both said and that is that changing a brand is about changing the kind of the the entire experience of the of the party party, if you will, what is it that we stand for? Who are we? What are we known for? And I think that that doesn&#39;t start with something like, like, let&#39;s say that Rachel Notley is planning to, you know, to resign as speculation is rampant, and she&#39;s going to leave the leadership. Well, don&#39;t change the name of the party on your way out the door, because the name of the party on the name of on the way out the door isn&#39;t actually going to change the brand relationship. Instead, Instead, a new leader comes in, a new leader comes in. But it&#39;s not just that there&#39;s a new leader in town. What it is, is there&#39;s a new leader who&#39;s going to run the party with different values, different morals, different ideas, different thoughts, different priorities, different ideas. You know, all the all the things that we think of when we think of a political party, that&#39;s going to change because there&#39;s there&#39;s new leadership. and it reflects the values of the potential voters that we wish to attract in a different way. So don&#39;t begin at the end. Don&#39;t say we&#39;re going to change the name because this is different. Instead, begin at the beginning and say, what is it that we&#39;re trying to create? What is it that we&#39;re trying to create? And if it is a different relationship with different voters, then start to make that change. Make all of that change before you even think about changing the letterhead,</span>

There&#39;s a lot of value to that in a political party. I mean, I think there&#39;s a lot of political parties that would kill to have that kind of loyalty and relationship with their individual voters. That&#39;s a great idea. But if you want to win an election, being a small clicky party is not necessarily the way to win an election. Right. You you have to recognize that the brand that you want isn&#39;t necessarily the brand that you have. So, you know, even Corey&#39;s putting the time frame on it. Like my view would be, what</span>

Is there any part of you that would challenge Corey on the ordering of when this would go? Let&#39;s start here and clean up some of this stuff.</span>

Corey, you called it a day one problem. You also said there&#39;s a chance that someone could run it as the holistic change candidate and win, but that&#39;s a political gamble, so to speak. And then on the back end, I&#39;ve got this is like a thing that you flip over, right? Like six months before I introduced a new brand, here it is.

Carter&#39;s saying that the line at the top of this document that we are creating through just our voice should have a, you know, a different question to ask rather than the strategy to change the Alberta NDP name. It should be titled, this memo that we are writing should be titled something different. Do you agree?</span>

            <span class="text">I do. And I think that maybe you don&#39;t call it the distancing strategy, but like, a name change is a means to an end. And actually, this group, this Alberta&#39;s Progressive Future, This talk has a question about like, oh, too close to the federal NDP. Not the only way you can resolve that problem. Like one of the things we heard a lot during the election was a standard talking point of the NDP constitution says the federal constitution takes precedence, right? So Jagmeet Singh is Rachel Notley&#39;s boss. Okay, well, change the NDP constitution,</span>

Change the NDP constitution, right? uh and then at the end of the day when you&#39;ve done those things if well okay let&#39;s just let&#39;s just throw it all out there you don&#39;t get to a point where it&#39;s six months before an election and say okay everybody i fucking got you here we are i&#39;m changing the name correct no you wait until jigmeet singh does something really dumb i mean set your second hand to it it&#39;s not going to be that hard and then you say you know what we&#39;ve had enough we&#39;ve tried to make it clear that we&#39;re we&#39;re not there because of the NDP constitution changes we did. We have certainly staked out some territory that&#39;s a little bit different than this. And now we&#39;re just, this is just too much.

She&#39;d say one of the biggest mistakes that politicians make is that they try to solve problems that they don&#39;t necessarily define, right? They don&#39;t define the problem. And Corey&#39;s trigger is interesting, because many folks would know the problem, but people aren&#39;t paying attention to this day to day. You need a proof point, an example, a live wire to trigger a particular move and saying this is a pattern of behavior that we can no longer stomach. I appreciate that, Corey.

            <span class="text">interesting, right? So you&#39;ve got new leader, not necessarily doing it as part of the leadership race. You&#39;ve got trigger points. You&#39;ve got T-minus sort of like six months, but it&#39;s not a date on the calendar. You say we&#39;re going, do or die. No, you look for an organic moment to kind of make this happen. You try to orchestrate a bit of that. You include policies, constitutional changes, other relationships throughout this period that make it very clear. Corey, I have to push a little bit on policies, and then I want to push on third party groups. Those are the two things on my mind. Do you need a big signature trigger policy policy to create distance it doesn&#39;t have to be in that same time horizon just before you do it but do you need something to create space and then what is that for you you talk about orchestrating what would you orchestrate from like a policy perspective that could create that distance we&#39;ve talked constitution we&#39;ve talked brand we&#39;ve talked name etc policy does paul where does that kind of fit in yeah</span>

            <span class="text">yeah i i think that&#39;s exactly where we need to go next and one of the things that a a next leader of the NDP is going to have to deal with, if there&#39;s a next leader of the NDP, if Rachel Notley, I mean, there will be some day, but like in</span>

            <span class="text">bit, is they&#39;re going to need to say why their party is different than the party that was. And ultimately, there are some pretty showy things you could talk about if you were an NDP leader, one of them being the carbon tax. Coming out in opposition to the carbon tax doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re against environmental action. we&#39;ve talked about this on this podcast a lot you could say you know what it</span>

            <span class="text">it was it was a well-intentioned idea it was probably a mistake for us to put trust in this in this like weird market mechanism uh which was going to ultimately hurt people and instead we&#39;re going to make sure that it&#39;s it&#39;s large corporations and you know the the super wealthy flying around in jets and the people who are causing this pollution are going to pay for it not you and we&#39;re going to shield it and we&#39;ve got this new regulatory approach we&#39;ve got this way that we can address it at kind of the institutional level it&#39;s not going to be you anymore so i think that a policy like that that it doesn&#39;t need to be that i want to be clear but where you&#39;re actually taking on what has been at least for the past five plus years a sacred cow of the alberta ndp is something you&#39;ve got to do uh it&#39;s got to be something of that size of that magnitude something that you you could say the alberta ndp would never do that right i think one of the ones that really makes a lot of sense to me is</span>

But you don&#39;t need to do a carbon tax to have a bunch of money to spend on changing the economy. I mean, if you you look at what&#39;s happening in the united states you could steal straight out of joe biden&#39;s bucket of okay we&#39;re going to reinvest money into the economy to enable it to become a green economy and that puts people to work puts creates you know great green jobs and whatever the hell he his his talking point is um that i&#39;m not sure what</span>

You&#39;re going to stay committed to post-secondary education, but there&#39;s different ways of delivering all of these things too. So maybe you, you talk about changing the focus of the government on a couple of those But I think that right now with environmental politics being as powerful as it is, that&#39;s a place to just really define yourself as different from from Rachel Notley. The other would be just action.

And then you go, yeah, that&#39;s Alberta NDP. We&#39;re different. And if they say, well, then Alberta NDP isn&#39;t NDP, then you&#39;ve ended up in a place where you say, well, maybe you&#39;re right, right? Like to Stephen&#39;s idea before.

Why would you do that? Why would you give up a known set of voters? Because there&#39;s another known set of voters that didn&#39;t vote for you last time.

I want to be talking about the ways that we can reflect the concerns of Albertans that don&#39;t currently feel like we reflect those concerns.

Walking, you know, changing the way that we impose taxes on Albertans so that the people who have the most resources pay their fair share and we close the income gap in this province, which has become so unbelievably crazy.

Is there a point in this time horizon that we&#39;re talking about where Corey&#39;s kind of anchored us to T minus six months with eventual potential name change? Is there a period at any point that having a third party, whether it&#39;s this group, different groups, formal, informal, informal. We talk about generating the parade of the enthusiasm for something like this to happen. Is that helpful? This group is saying they want to start the conversation, right? That&#39;s their mantra. That&#39;s what they&#39;re asking. But is there a point anywhere in the process that a group or groups or individuals chattering about this at any given volume is helpful to the outcome that you want, which in this case for the exercise we&#39;re doing is to change the name? Carter, to your thoughts and then Corey you absolutely</span>

All this is doing is making it less likely that the Alberta NDP winds up being in a position where it can change its name.</span>

And ultimately, I believe it was so bad for the party. It was such a distraction. Party couldn&#39;t get its pants on. There was so much internal strife over the particular matter, right? So I&#39;m somewhat informed and somewhat scarred, frankly, by that particular experience. experience here&#39;s the thing should the albert ndp do this i don&#39;t think so but i&#39;ll entertain debates on it is the conversation helpful fuck</span>

Like, is that what you&#39;re ultimately trying to say? They could do it strategically behind closed doors, be part of a plan, sort of thing, be involved in the process, sort of thing. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, look, I have a good friend. His name&#39;s Justin Archer. He had analysis after the 2015 election about why the Alberta NDP won, which I kind of fundamentally agree with here in terms of not so much why the Alberta NDP was ahead of the wild rose, but why the Alberta party became nothing, the Alberta liberals became nothing, and the Alberta NDP sucked up all of that vote, right? It&#39;s because those other two organizations were so internally focused and trying to figure out the perfect mechanism through which this vote could be delivered instead of actually doing the work that&#39;s required. And the way Justin&#39;s put it, and I&#39;ve stolen and I&#39;ve used this phrase a bunch of times, is they are the only ones who were dressed when the bus came, right? Like everybody else was fucking debating about what clothes they&#39;re going to wear that day. And so, yeah, I mean, these things can be poisonous, distracting arguments. And lest we forget, in 2015, in Edmonton Centre, in a Liberal-held seat, the Alberta Liberal Party held the seat, Lori Blakeman lost. I think she might even come in third, but I might be wrong about that. Remember this, yeah, sure.</span>

And everyone&#39;s like, and she&#39;s the sitting MLA, and everyone&#39;s like, that&#39;s great. I&#39;m going to vote for those guys.

I&#39;m committed to this project. I don&#39;t know who this person is. I don&#39;t have anyone in my mind. But I&#39;m just saying like, someone&#39;s like, yes, motivated by this.</span>

What cautionary advice would you have for them around implementation? Because a plan is great, but if you can&#39;t implement it properly with folks that know how to execute it, it can turn into shit. So give me your take, Corey, your take, and then then we&#39;ll close this thing out.</span>

            <span class="text">There are no shortcuts in politics. Politics is about hard work and changing your relationship with the electorate. So whenever someone proposes some sort of a get-rich-quick scheme of how you can gain electoral success without having to put in the effort, be skeptical, because the reality is you&#39;re not going to be able to just change your relationship with the voters. As Corey said in the very first sentence that he spoke in this episode, You don&#39;t change the relationship with the voters simply by changing your name. Give the voters more credit. They&#39;re not just looking down and saying, well, I don&#39;t like that. That&#39;s the reason they&#39;re giving. That&#39;s not the reason why they&#39;re not voting for you.</span>
