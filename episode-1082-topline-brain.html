Well, unless you&#39;re in Daniel Smith&#39;s world, Corey, Daniel Smith was caught, if you can call it that. I&#39;m going to put it in air quotes because I want to I would. Yeah. Was she busted, Corey, for taking a photo during the Calgary Stampede where politicians of every and any political stripe, if they have a fan base or if they are notable, are probably taking dozens, if not hundreds of pictures. Fair to say she</span>

            <span class="text">she was seen in a picture, as was Pierre Poglia. But we&#39;ll start with a conversation with Danielle Smith, with the gentleman who had a very bright green shirt that was talking about straight pride. Corey, before I get into her response, et cetera, was this a charge that we can fairly wage against Danielle Smith? So maybe let&#39;s take off any sort of, you know, let&#39;s remove the jersey collar from her if this was something on the other side. But is this a fair charge against Daniel Smith? And then we&#39;ll get into the cleanup and her attempts on that, which I think are more interesting to me. Right.</span>

            <span class="text">Right. So on the selfies, I was talking to a politician last week, and she was telling me that what we really missed in our Stampede episode is how selfies have changed the game. It&#39;s just like selfie after selfie after selfie, and you don&#39;t get these conversations you used to because they&#39;re interrupted every 60 seconds by somebody asking for a selfie.</span>

It&#39;s, you know, you can create a scenario if you really want to stretch that, you know, that, yeah, you didn&#39;t see what was on the shirt. And I buy that Danielle Smith did not see what was on the shirt, right? You do buy that. I do not buy that her staff did not see what was on the shirt. And the mental exercise I want our listeners to go through through here is do you what do you think the odds are of the selfie being snapped if that neon green shirt with large black lettering had said boycott the tar sands hey</span>

And I&#39;m like, if I was in the photo, I would have failed to do my job, and I would have had my ass kicked. and the same thing happens here whoever was doing their job did not do their job and uh you know it&#39;s a simple job it&#39;s not complicated to cory&#39;s point it&#39;s look at the t-shirts and see if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s going to cause your boss any troubles i mean um there&#39;s all kinds of people who show up with with with many different things um that they want signed or they want to take a picture with you or you know if a person unfurled a flag would you allow that to happen staffers are are trained for all of these things staff and if they&#39;re not trained then they&#39;re not staffed and they&#39;re just some volunteer who&#39;s standing beside you um but you know if you&#39;re you know you should be trained so that when someone comes up to you with a uh free palestine banner uh or you know i mean there&#39;s there are hundreds of issues right now you could be wearing a pro-russia t-shirt or a pro-ukraine even a pro-ukraine t-shirt someone should be thinking about very strongly i&#39;m pro pro ukraine i think that that would be okay but i&#39;m not sure that i i&#39;m not sure that you necessarily want examples you</span>

            <span class="text">Trudeau. I remember he was kind of at the start of the politician selfie craze, right? Back in 2015, maybe even a little earlier than that. And one of the things that really struck me about his particular technique at that particular moment was he, this was before he was prime minister, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s evolved since then, but he didn&#39;t let people even fumble with their phone. He would grab their phone and do it himself. itself. And part of the reason he did this is he does literally hundreds of these, thousands of these, and he&#39;s just much faster and he can get the shot much better. And there&#39;s not that fumbling and there&#39;s not that time. So, you know, there&#39;s also like an economy of scale thing to what you&#39;re talking about, right? You get someone else to take the photo, you move on, it&#39;s just much faster. It&#39;s the right shot the first time, boom, you get to get out of there.

And so, so clearly, in my opinion, there was a staff failing, and it&#39;s pretty impossible for me to believe that staff didn&#39;t see it, like they made a judgment call, and it was the wrong one, I think is pretty clear. but I want to be clear on the</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, I entirely agree it&#39;s Polyev, and for me, it&#39;s a lot simpler than that. Daniel Smith just had an election, right? That election just occurred. Pierre Polyev&#39;s election is in 2025, if the confidence agreement holds, and it&#39;s sooner if not and he&#39;s also playing for a population that is is much more moderate than the population in the province of alberta right and so those are the simple facts that he&#39;s got to confront it&#39;s both in content and in kind of relevancy slash urgency slash timing it&#39;s just worse for him so um that&#39;s the challenge that he has it also reinforces some views about pierre Polyev, as Stephen said, that, you know, our lingering doubts and anxieties people have out there in Canada about Pierre Polyev, who might even otherwise be predisposed to vote for him.</span>

His track record has not been stellar on LGBTQ2S plus sort of rights here. It just hasn&#39;t been. And you can say a lot of things about Danielle Smith, and certainly she does not have a perfect track record, but the broad strokes of it is she&#39;s a libertarian who takes a real live and let live approach to issues of this matter. matter pierre polliev though not not so much the same and you might even recall a couple of well it&#39;s geez how how time flies but in the leadership race where pierre polliev uh was dinged by some of his opponents for using the hashtag mgtow men going their own way you know this</span>

I&#39;m not saying Daniel Smith can get away with this easier, but to Corey&#39;s point, she&#39;s just had an election. So in some ways, it&#39;s true, she can get away with this easier because she doesn&#39;t have to face the electorate. Are the lessons different for the Polyev team as they try to clean this sort of stuff up or not repeat mistakes like this going forward? presuming, and this is a big presumption, that this is a mistake.

I think that the lesson for Polyev is that he needs to make sure that he is staffed by people who think this is actually a mistake. My fear is that he was staffed by people who didn&#39;t think this was a mistake. They thought this was just fine. Keep in mind that Pierre Polyev is going to have a totally different staff load than Danielle Smith is, especially Danielle Smith, like, a month after she was was elected pierre&#39;s traveling with an entourage he&#39;s got people who who know what he should be doing he&#39;s got a a very big uh cohort of of people in calgary who are loyal to him who who will be there for him when he when he needs them and when he needed them they</span>

            <span class="text">over half the Canadian population wants Trudeau and Pauly ever placed as party leaders. In a new poll by Nanos Research, it indicates that while Pierre Pauly seems to have better cohesion within the conservative movement, 51% of Canadians say, yeah, you know what? I could probably do with someone that isn&#39;t him to lead the conservatives. It&#39;s not much better. In fact, it&#39;s worse for Justin Trudeau, where 53% of Canadians and respondents in this poll suggest that, yeah, he should be replaced. Did this surprise you, Corey? I know there&#39;s a bit of chatter amongst us around this. Let me start with just the pure elements of surprise before we get into the pure elements of strategy and democracy here, and frankly, opportunity, which is where I want to go.</span>

Like, it&#39;s just like, sky is falling, everybody&#39;s bad. You&#39;re seeing this reflected in a lot of Western democracies. Look at the negative numbers for any American leader, right?

            <span class="text">that, again, is not surprising because he&#39;s been leader for so long. Think about, you know, the most recent one would be the late Chrétien era. And there were a lot of liberals who thought that he should move aside and that Martin should become leader. And Martin had slowly been taking over the party apparatus. And that&#39;s just a reality that occurs as people. We&#39;ve said this so many times in so many different contexts, but you don&#39;t get more popular in politics. You accumulate enemies, you accumulate bad decisions, you accumulate hurt feelings. And as a result, your popularity tends to decline. That&#39;s why we always talk about the first 100 days being so magical in a politician&#39;s life, because it&#39;s when they&#39;re their most popular. And that that means that&#39;s when they&#39;re the most powerful. And so after eight years, yeah, Justin Trudeau&#39;s not going to have everybody on side.

But the simple calculation that was wrong by the Martinites was that they could leave all of the baggage with Gretchen and move on, and that somehow the party brand would, you know, proceed unencumbered. When you have the leader fighting with kind of the future leader faction, or this idea, and people are divided into camps, energy is expended internally that should be expended externally. And that&#39;s, that&#39;s kind of the simplest version The other thing is it can cause all sorts of problems. It can cause all sorts of, you know, lacks of authority that don&#39;t allow you to move as quickly or as nimbly because you start thinking about all of these calculations going elsewhere.

And as soon as people start start thinking like that. They start bringing thoughts in like, what kind of party do I want after the leader? Maybe I don&#39;t agree with the leader&#39;s actions in this particular case. Maybe I&#39;m not going to work so hard to get the thing the leader wants. I&#39;m going to get the thing that I want.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">let me actually start with the conservatives, because the conservatives, you know, are replacing leaders at a pace where there&#39;s just going to be no one left at some point. And that&#39;s their pattern. That&#39;s where they&#39;ve gone to. If someone loses an election, they&#39;re gone. There&#39;s no question. There&#39;s no discussion. You know, they may want to stay, but they&#39;re not going to get a second chance. That&#39;s the conservative way. Now, the liberals now are in a very different situation. They&#39;ve had back to back minority governments, which is by some measure very, very good. You know, they&#39;ve been able to hold on and keep their government. But by other measures, it&#39;s not particularly good. And I think that people are measuring up and they&#39;re looking and saying, will we actually win in whenever the next election is, which we may or may not control. And I think that there is a calculation being done by the prime minister&#39;s people that is saying the only way we win is if we, you know, the prime minister stays. The prime minister is has been our magic, magic ticket. He, you know, without him, where would we be? and there&#39;s there&#39;s a case to be made for that he&#39;s he&#39;s certainly um you know grabbed the the third place party and and and dragged them up into a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">How do you accelerate it? Well, you just have more conversations faster. And then the other natural accelerant that often occurs is when there&#39;s a conflict, a flashpoint in caucus. So I can&#39;t remember the context in which we were talking about the Suez crisis. I feel like it was with one of you. Maybe it was even on the podcast. But one of the things that I always think was fascinating about Suez Crisis is one</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">of the reasons it became such a crisis, to grossly simplify it, is the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the British still thought they were a superpower, right? And it took that crisis for everyone to realize, kind of not. Like the United States is the superpower now, and it&#39;s just like in a totally different world. And there&#39;s one superpower. And it just changed everything.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And I mentioned this because sometimes you can&#39;t, like, a crisis is in some ways like a calling of a vote, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? It&#39;s where there&#39;s a presumed power that then gets tested in some way, shape, or form. And we saw this a hundred times with Jason Kenney, where, you know, there&#39;d be this chatter, and does Jason Kenney actually have his caucus? And then there&#39;d be a vote, and Jason Kenney would get that vote basically unanimously, minus like one or two people who&#39;d be kicked out of the caucus. And the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">thing about a crisis and why if you&#39;re looking for an accelerant, if people are actually feeling something that is not like real yet, if you trigger a crisis, and it doesn&#39;t need to be people thinking they&#39;re going to leave, it doesn&#39;t need to be anything so dramatic. It can be an internal caucus dispute where they say, we want this and the prime minister wants that. And the prime minister says, well, let&#39;s call the question in some way, shape or form, or you call the question in some way, shape or form. And then the votes are read, so to speak. And in this case, literally, and you realize, oh, the prime minister actually doesn&#39;t have unanimous support here. That accelerates things, right? Right. So like finding moments where what is presumed becomes real is another natural way to accelerate that kind of thing if you&#39;re looking to poke at it. But I&#39;ll tell you something, Zane, if it&#39;s not real, it&#39;s also a great way to show that it&#39;s not real. But</span>

Stephen Carter, we&#39;re going to talk about this when it happens, but we are hearing speculation speculation that Justin Trudeau is going to go with a cabinet shuffle. We don&#39;t know how big, we don&#39;t know how small, we don&#39;t know when it&#39;s going to happen.

            <span class="text">would probably say go big um you know I think that people you know Rachel Notley was kind of uh well known for kind of shying away from doing a significant cabinet shuffle in fact she didn&#39;t do a cabinet shuffle really at all and I think that that was one of the things that really really hurt her because cabinet shuffles give you an opportunity for ministers to walk away from previously held held positions. And there&#39;s a lot of previously held positions in a government that&#39;s been around for, what is it, nine years yet now or something like that, eight years? Coming on nine, coming on a long time. And I think that you do a big shuffle. I don&#39;t think you, you</span>

            <span class="text">different than if only a couple of people get upped, right? Like, well, only a few people made it in or whatnot. And also, if you perceive your portfolio to be lesser than it was, that can also cause hurt feelings. And that can really be one of the accelerants that we haven&#39;t talked about in terms of what can sow a leader&#39;s fate. So there&#39;s risk with that if you are already starting to lose control of your party in In any meaningful way. Carter&#39;s not wrong that it allows parties to walk away from unpopular positions. And I think that that&#39;s one of the great advantages of doing it that way. I think realistically, what you are going to see is an increase in the size of cabinet, probably small, but you know, it&#39;s easier to just to add people as we&#39;ve seen in our home province of Alberta. Verna, and more</span>

It&#39;ll be very surgical to try to keep that peace and not create a bunch of discord and maybe the expansion of cabinet. That would be my guess is what&#39;s going to happen.

I don&#39;t know what his current swing or stroke is there. I&#39;m just not that attuned to the regional caucuses, but I can tell you, I mean, he certainly was able to and willing to sew up kind of discord and dissent in the Dion days. Not that that took much. There were a lot of dissenting people at the time. But, you know, I just, I don&#39;t think you want that kind of pain. So, yeah, that&#39;s the only thing I&#39;ve got for you. Frankly, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what they have in mind, but the</span>

You&#39;ve got people going through, but that just can&#39;t happen. He&#39;s got to think about the message that he showed. A little bit more of the slightly more pointed version of the message I suggested for the NDP. In terms of having other people carry that message, yeah.

            <span class="text">Hey, Corey, let me end on this, perhaps a meaty question, but I think one that is worthy of asking in this episode as we ended off, selfies. Now, I know neither of the two pictures we&#39;re mentioning here with Danielle Smith nor with Pierre Polyab were actual quote-unquote selfies, but selfies have entered the political fray over the last decade significantly. Have they helped or hindered politics in your mind through a strategist lens? Yeah, I&#39;m curious to get your sense. They&#39;ve clearly had many service level, you know, sort of benefits. You&#39;re now even seeing selfie lines become a mainstay of political outreach. But from your strategist lens, give me your initial take. Have they helped? Or have they hindered politics for you? You don&#39;t have to do the democracy angle. You don&#39;t have to to do that. Give me your ruthless strategy angle, Corey, and just put something on the table.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think having your picture with a politician suggested kind of a level of commitment to a politician far beyond what a selfie means, you know, like 20 years ago when it actually took effort to get a photo. I&#39;m not sure. I think it&#39;s one of those things that people are likely to share or, hey, look at me. I met the prime minister. Hey, look at me. I met the premier. I met Rachel Notley, whoever it is. And so you&#39;ve got that and it helps in this whole social network effect world that we&#39;ve got going on here. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s materially changed the game, Zane. I don&#39;t. I think it&#39;s just kind of the things we always did done a different way. Carter,</span>
