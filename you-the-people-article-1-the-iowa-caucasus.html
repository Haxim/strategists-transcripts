Like, I think that it&#39;s relatively easy to say, you know, he&#39;s running away with it. I think that that&#39;s a relatively probably true statement, just a simply a simple truth. He is, in fact, running away with this. But I also think it&#39;s equally easy to say that for someone who&#39;s running away with it, he&#39;s running away very, very slowly.

            <div class="said">new hampshire is very much like Iowa insofar as it&#39;s about who has operations. And the operation that DeSantis put in place was primarily focused in Iowa. The thinking being that if you come out of Iowa with momentum, you&#39;ll be able to go into New Hampshire and really, it doesn&#39;t matter how much activity you&#39;ve done in advance. It&#39;s this new momentum that carries you forward. And we&#39;ve seen that. We&#39;ve seen that in elections that I&#39;ve done. There&#39;s elections that, well, you haven&#39;t done any that actually generated momentum but you&#39;ve seen momentum and that momentum will pick up and it will it will create something bigger so desantis was a momentum guy well haley was a let&#39;s put in the work gal and she was putting herself in a place where she could win in new hampshire almost regardless of what was actually going to happen in iowa well will she win in new hampshire uh There&#39;s been polls coming out that have her in the, you know, 8 to 10 points behind Donald Trump. And there&#39;s a question. The question is, did he win with enough to give himself the momentum? Or does Nikki Haley have the ability to create some sort of an upset? And I think upset now doesn&#39;t even require a win. It only requires being within five points. and then south carolina where she&#39;s also got a significant operation because that was her home state that becomes the you know the real question is is she able to carry both of those things forward so operation</div>
