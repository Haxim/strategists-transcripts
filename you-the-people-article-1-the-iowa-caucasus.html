Donald Trump was not that much up on, you know, Meatball Ron, as he was lovingly nicknamed by Donald Trump. And Nikki Haley was, I think, in the race, but so deeply speculative where she would end up and certainly not polling in the way Ron DeSantis was or Donald Trump was. By the way, I think the first time we said Ron DeSantis&#39; last name, you know, Ronnie, Meatball Ron. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think deserves is an interesting phrasing. I think deserves is is fascinating because I don&#39;t think he deserves to get more than a couple percent. But here he is. And I think I just bring it up because I think that both sides of this of this coin could be argued, right? Like, I think that it&#39;s relatively easy to say, you know, he&#39;s running away with it. I think that that&#39;s a relatively probably true statement, just a simply a simple truth. He is, in fact, running away with this. But I also think it&#39;s equally easy to say that for someone who&#39;s running away with it, he&#39;s running away very, very slowly. I imagine that has something to do with his girth.</span>

            <span class="text">the best case scenario for Donald Trump. Because you had Nikki Higley getting a bit of a late surge. There was some suggestion, maybe she could consolidate that DeSantis vote behind her, if she could put some distance between her and DeSantis. And she came in third, which was just enough with prevailing narratives to make it look like DeSantis is going to go and fight it out a little bit more. And so Donald Trump, who got, as you mentioned, almost exactly half of the vote, now</span>

You know, especially if she&#39;d beaten him by three or four. does being within one point enable new hampshire to do what new hampshire does which is clean up from iowa right like they seem to think that iowa leaves a bunch of horror you know cow shit all over the cornfield and new hampshire the the grown-up in the field needs to clean it up and actually do the first primary and bring in the the the real winner keeping in mind of course that it&#39;s been a long time since the winner of the the iowa republican primary has actually gone on to win the actual nomination for the republicans maybe this is a great uh a great harbinger</span>

If you happen to be in Iowa, if you happen to live in that state then you have then you have access to the retail or if you happen to be in new hampshire you know and then you get the retail i mean one of my very favorite books about politics is a fictional book called primary colors that kind of kind of covers the the clinton nomination process through new hampshire and you can see you know that level of retail politics man i fell in love with that type of politics but that type of politics doesn&#39;t exist it&#39;s not real run a candidate for mayor and i will tell you that there&#39;s a you know running in a city of one and a half million people is damn near impossible to do retail so even this retail of we&#39;ll go to iowa there&#39;s only a million people that&#39;s bullshit because you still can&#39;t be retail with everybody in the state you can do more retail but you could do more retail if you had a year run up to uh to california you could still do some retail you can still like we do retail in in calgary of million and a half people we do uh you know six months of retail there&#39;s lots of opportunity to do retail it&#39;s about time not necessarily the number of people well</span>

            <span class="text">new hampshire is very much like Iowa insofar as it&#39;s about who has operations. And the operation that DeSantis put in place was primarily focused in Iowa. The thinking being that if you come out of Iowa with momentum, you&#39;ll be able to go into New Hampshire and really, it doesn&#39;t matter how much activity you&#39;ve done in advance. It&#39;s this new momentum that carries you forward. And we&#39;ve seen that. We&#39;ve seen that in elections that I&#39;ve done. There&#39;s elections that, well, you haven&#39;t done any that actually generated momentum but you&#39;ve seen momentum and that momentum will pick up and it will it will create something bigger so desantis was a momentum guy well haley was a let&#39;s put in the work gal and she was putting herself in a place where she could win in new hampshire almost regardless of what was actually going to happen in iowa well will she win in new hampshire uh There&#39;s been polls coming out that have her in the, you know, 8 to 10 points behind Donald Trump. And there&#39;s a question. The question is, did he win with enough to give himself the momentum? Or does Nikki Haley have the ability to create some sort of an upset? And I think upset now doesn&#39;t even require a win. It only requires being within five points. and then south carolina where she&#39;s also got a significant operation because that was her home state that becomes the you know the real question is is she able to carry both of those things forward so operation</span>

That group dynamic may have favored Trump in Iowa. We don&#39;t actually know yet because we haven&#39;t seen whether or not it has impact in New Hampshire. But in general, group dynamics are about peer pressure, right? And peer pressure may find themselves, you know, people may find themselves voting for Trump because their peers are voting for Trump. Now, I&#39;m not saying that 100% of Trump&#39;s vote was peer pressure, but maybe 8% was. I</span>

            <span class="text">first and foremost i mean we&#39;ve grown very tired with our own progressive government uh you know that government of of justin trudeau that was so new and shiny back in in 2015 uh 2016 as donald trump was making his ascendancy to the presidency that that shiny government has changed dramatically it is no longer um this new exciting thing that we all were in love with progressivism at that particular moment in time. And instead, we find ourselves now, you know, perhaps</span>

            <span class="text">conservative populism. We&#39;ve seen the conservative populism take hold around the world. Europe has seen a rise in right-wing populism, which is modestly troubling when one considers the history of Europe. But this is where we are. And the changes that are happening in our society do change the way that we look at other groups. So we are now looking through different glasses at what is occurring in the United States and coming up with a different conclusion. um much the same way that i think that can americans are remembering things a little differently than i remember them and no one is trying to dissuade from that it&#39;s not like justin trudeau is trying to change the way that we think of of donald trump he&#39;s trying just to keep his head above water so who&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Pierre Polyev, he&#39;s bringing in Donald Trump style things. Do you think perhaps there&#39;s a bit of a wagging the dog here, where this has been said enough times, people agree to it, but because they&#39;re supporters of Pierre Polyev, they say, say, well, maybe I like Donald Trump then. Do you think maybe there&#39;s an element to that? Do you think it&#39;s all about the forget? I guess my challenge with the forgetfulness argument or the like we&#39;ve moved on, it&#39;s not like Donald Trump was particularly nice to Canada</span>

            <span class="text">right? We didn&#39;t like conservatives back then. We were opposed to conservatives. We we like the we like the red brand instead of the blue brand. And now we like the blue brand brand, which happens to be the red brand in the US. And isn&#39;t that exciting? It&#39;s it&#39;s a different color. And, you know, like, keep in mind, we&#39;re not making really in-depth decision making on this. This is like if you were to have to vote in some hypothetical election at some point in the future that you&#39;re never, ever going to vote in. who would you choose yeah fuck it trump right like it&#39;s it there&#39;s there&#39;s no consequence to saying these words and i think that that&#39;s why some of these words get uttered from time to time</span>
