They&#39;re going to talk about a world-class facility that&#39;s going to bring the great cultural events to Calgary. And if you phrase the question as, do you think the city of Calgary needs a world-class cultural venue? You&#39;re going to find higher support, right?

It was still the most popular sport in the country, but it was like 30% of adult males as opposed to like 45 in a relatively short period of time. and there is going to be a point if we haven&#39;t already hit it where it&#39;s like you think you are playing to this kind of big populist mass by talking about how much you love hockey and how it&#39;s just not calgary without the flames it&#39;s just not alberta without the battle of alberta and the majority like let&#39;s say it&#39;s two-thirds right now let&#39;s say men and women are watching hockey the same i have no reason to believe otherwise besides just stereotypes well two-thirds don&#39;t give a shit to begin with right and and maybe they&#39;re swayed by kind of arguments around the sides like oh maybe the other third will be really mad or something but you</div>

            <div class="said">so i if i were the ndp i wouldn&#39;t touch that particular comment i would let kind of the canadian taxpayer federations and the conservatives who are pissed off about it throw that in her face but the line the ndp has that they can walk at this point and i think we saw them actually starting to walk that line today pretty much in real time with their you know know statement is they cannot be they can say like we&#39;re sort of okay with public money going into these things but this looks like a bad deal in a way sort of what i was saying along here right like maybe i&#39;m not wild about public money going into it i can get there you can convince me you can drag me there because of some of the benefits but this looks like a bad deal and so the ndp have the ability to say this just looks like a bad deal the problem with them putting those smith comments out there and saying, well, see, can you trust her judgment? All of that is then it starts to look more like you&#39;re opposed to any deal. And that is a dangerous place, I think, for the NDP to be. Because, again, like this is a relatively novel concept. I&#39;m sure polling is not going to be 100% illuminating. And if the NDP get, you know, if it gets the sense like the NDP would kill the flames, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s helpful for the NDP. Now, is it possible kill the flames would be more popular than spend the money? That&#39;s not inconceivable to me. But that&#39;s not not a trade-off you even need to make because the deal is so wildly out there you can say things like most public money ever to a deal like maybe that&#39;s true maybe that&#39;s not someone&#39;s gonna have to run the numbers but you can say things like that and the um you know the ucp are gonna have to sit there and take it like you can say like look we love a deal but they had a deal for 50 50 before what is going on here how did you manage to negotiate from a position of we&#39;ve got a gap of $30 million to, we&#39;ll spend $330 million. Holy cow, do we want you negotiating with Justin Trudeau if that&#39;s kind of your walk-in position? That&#39;s victory to you? That seems like you were raked over the coals. You were put over a barrel. That&#39;s not victory. And I think that&#39;s an opportunity for the NDP. But to outright suggest, like, Daniel Smith&#39;s position that you shouldn&#39;t fund public arenas is in some way valid would be dangerous for the NDP. Yeah,</div>

It seems pretty wild to me that it would be unanimous, especially knowing what we now know about this, unless there are some other terms that are more publicly advantageous than we&#39;ve seen. But sometimes people get whipped up in things. things. And again, I think I firmly believe this is city council saying we are willing to invest this for a good arena. We can invest a little bit more because of all this new money on the table from all these new players to get a great arena. And I ultimately feel like they their eyes got bigger than their stomach and they&#39;re forgetting the fact that this is still an incredible amount of money. And ultimately, yeah, we could spend three billion and have the coolest arena ever built for hockey doesn&#39;t make it a smart bet even if somebody&#39;s like you can have it for 700 million doesn&#39;t make it smart like like there is a certain kind of upper threshold of reason for these particular things and it does start to feel like this is well beyond it so</div>

And that balance is way off. And it wouldn&#39;t take very much to push them over the edge because, you know, keep in mind, counsel is the only source of real information comes from administration. And if you&#39;re not looking for different information, like if you&#39;re watching Jeremy Farkas right now, Jeremy Farkas is apoplectic about this deal.

So on Monday at a news conference, Premier Daniel Smith was asked once again if she stands by a University of Calgary policy paper she wrote recently. It was in 2021 that urges Albertans to pay for services, including visits to a family doctor. so she was asked in front of media she&#39;s previously been asked this question by people on her call and radio show um and she will not disavow her previous stance i i guess the simple question here is like what what do you make of this and why is for someone who often will say well my views change and this and that why not just come out and say that you</div>

And maybe, you know, I&#39;m going to give a charitable read here, right? Maybe Danielle Smith doesn&#39;t want to disavow it because she still believes it, but she has no intention of doing it because she knows it would be unpopular and she just doesn&#39;t want to go there. But she doesn&#39;t want to pretend like she doesn&#39;t think that it would ultimately be a good idea if she could do it. Well, and Albertans can do with that information as they see, because four years of a term is a long time, and you might say in year two, you know what i&#39;m still kind of concerned about the health care system fuck it we&#39;re going to do it i know i&#39;ve made commitments but there are something has happened something always happens right either revenue goes down or there is just you know too many people in the hallways or something happens and then you&#39;ve got to make new decisions based on new information and it&#39;s quite possible that armed with her previous and seemingly current views she would make the decision that okay we&#39;ve got to introduce some co-pays here or do something to that line in</div>

Shame on them. And obviously these are not my views. They&#39;ve never, you know, they&#39;ve not been my views. It was a position paper. It was designed to spark a conversation. I had a very different role at the time. You all know that in the media. This is ridiculous. Of course we&#39;re not doing that. Of course I don&#39;t believe HSA should be used for primary care. Next question. And you act as though you were always clear because this is the gaslighting that all politicians do these these days, whenever they need to clean up a particular message, but you have to do it because I, you know, the thing I really want to underline is it&#39;s, it&#39;s not even just that your campaign is working at odds, like, you know, that, that is wrong and it&#39;s frustrating. It&#39;s confusing when you have your earned strategy over here saying maybe, and your paid strategy over here saying absolutely not, but it&#39;s worse than that because it&#39;s not just that that they are atomizing</div>
