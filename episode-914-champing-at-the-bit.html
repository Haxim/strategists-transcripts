        <div class="meta">February 8, 2021</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the federal NDP's long-term care policy release, the creation of new political parties and the Republicans eating their own in Wyoming. Do Canadians care about public vs. private delivery? Has negative partisanship completely consumed American politics? And why does Stephen have so little regard for everybody's time that he'd bother to talk about the Alberta Party? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, our first segment, long-term gain. Guys, I want to talk about Jagmeet Singh. That&#39;s a phrase I&#39;ve never said before. No. I want to talk about Jagmeet Singh. I want to talk about his election promise on long-term care. And I want to use that as a gateway to talking about election promises, how they&#39;re constructed, when we should construct them. Is there a is there a best practice in this domain, especially in a minority government, especially when there&#39;s a political dynamic surrounding Jagmeet Singh related to does he feel like the liberals are going to be potentially trampling on, you know, traditional NDP ground as it relates to policy? So, Carter, let me start with you and with a very simple question. Why do you think Jagmeet Singh came out with a long-term care policy X months, and I say X because we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the spring or the fall or even beyond that, before an election?</div>

You&#39;re in a position where they&#39;ve asked you to give them a hand. They&#39;re now perhaps more debt-free. They know that this liberal machine has a very progressive tinge and leaning. What are you advising them regarding policy and timing of policy? Also regarding the fact that they currently sit with some semblance of a balance of power? What are you telling them regarding their strategy for the upcoming election as it stands now in early February?</div>

And so I think that&#39;s a relatively sound policy, although I, as always, with a with a situation where you start pushing yourself to kind of the political extremes, you do risk losing voters along the way, too. So it&#39;s a bit of a calibration effort that&#39;s going to be ahead of the NDP.</div>

From a broader perspective, how are you as the incumbent party or a government looking at another party putting out policy?

So there will be some red orange ridings that you&#39;re going to have to keep your eyes on for sure, because the Conservatives aren&#39;t even in them. I&#39;m thinking in areas around Toronto in particular, maybe southwestern Ontario, but it would be a big mistake to start focusing your efforts and your concerns on Jagmeet Singh. That would be taking you away from, I think, where the balance of the conversation during the election with the public is going to happen. So, well, you may find it annoying. You may want to respond. Message discipline isn&#39;t called message discipline because it&#39;s easy. And you&#39;ve got to resist that temptation, and you&#39;ve got to keep your eyes on the prize.</div>

What are some of the tactical things that you&#39;re trying to do with it this week if you&#39;re helping the NDP? I assume you&#39;re going to try to fundraise off of it. Is there anything else you try to do? Do you try to double down and make this an issue over and over, get it into earned media? I know that&#39;s a loaded question, but from your strategist playbook, what are some of the things you do once you have launched a policy into the public sphere? What are some of the things and tools that you can leverage now that it&#39;s out there?</div>

And so that begs the question, can someone actually form that can get elected from who they are in the middle? And this isn&#39;t just about the Alberta Party.

But the next mayor is going to get the most media attention in the province. And that&#39;s going to be the big thing. There&#39;ll be statements about how the mayor is going to interact with the province. There&#39;s not going to be a headline to be had for the Alberta party and the party because it will be so irrelevant. And that&#39;s the same thing that we see time and again with the Green Party. We talked about the Green Party&#39;s leadership. It lasted forever. No one even paid attention. All of these irrelevant parties, like they have to really start thinking differently. They can&#39;t think, oh, the PCs run a six-month leadership program. We should run a six-month leadership program. It&#39;s fucking asinine. That&#39;s not how small business works.

And so you sometimes see by the creation of a new political party, people can really break outside of the mold. You see this, like in France, Macron&#39;s party on Marche did not exist before he just created it. And all of a sudden, there it is, and he&#39;s the president of France. Jesse Ventura, he wasn&#39;t in either political party, and he just sort of comes in, he catches a wave, and there you go.</div>

Because many people would feel like a fledgling party, a party that hasn&#39;t necessarily had much traction or success in about a decade, which I think is just a fair fact. As much as we&#39;ve been ribbing it, I think that&#39;s fair. They haven&#39;t met their potential in that way for nearly a decade. OK, do you feel like political leaders for a party like that can be made and incubated and won over a long haul? Or do you feel like they have to find their, quote unquote, star candidate or star leader who wants to take this on? And that&#39;s the only way some traction is sought for for a party like the Alberta Party or any other.

She, of course, voted to impeach Donald Trump for the for the second time for inciting violence at the Capitol. She has now been censured by the Wyoming Republican Party. They overwhelmingly voted to censure her on Saturday in her role to to cast her vote. vote. Only eight of the 74-member state GOP Central Committee stood to oppose the censure in a vote that didn&#39;t proceed on a formal count. Corey, where do you kind of see this particular thread going? Because I think we, maybe I shouldn&#39;t say we, I find it interesting that one of the stalwarts of republicanism coming from a republican dynasty, the Cheney family dynasty, dynasty is facing such severe rhetoric and now, I don&#39;t know if you call a censure by your state GOP party a repercussion, but is facing some real blowback for her position. Do you feel like this is going to expand the scope of this sort of retribution that the current iteration of the GOP seems to be lashing out on a daily and weekly basis?</div>

They&#39;re saying that they&#39;re contractually not able to release those. Other parts of the world have-ish certain parts being redacted, but the political damage here that you feel like might be up for grabs for the Trudeau government on a scale of 1 to 10, what do you think?</div>

So as part of a report, we saw that the Trudeau government had some of their emails, you know, between Privy Council and the Prime Minister&#39;s office, I should say, reported in the media about the impact that adding details to particular COVID policy would have.

One of the, I shouldn&#39;t say more prominent, but more voluminous attacks against the Trudeau government right now has been our our lack of domestic production of the vaccine. It&#39;s been waged by O&#39;Toole. It&#39;s been waged with a slightly less sharp elbow by Jagmeet Singh and the NDP. But it&#39;s catching steam, this argument that Canada doesn&#39;t domestically produce, which is why we&#39;re at the whims of the EU and why we&#39;re at the whims of global manufacturing. The potency of that political attack on a scale of 1 to 10, what do you think?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think it could have been really good coming from Singh. I think O&#39;Toole is, of course, hampered by the fact that it was Harper that kind of allowed it to disappear under his watch. And if I were Singh, I&#39;d be saying, you know, obviously the conservatives are going to get rid of it. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t want the conservatives, but the liberals will never bring it back.</div>
