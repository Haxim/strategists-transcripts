            <span class="text">I just wanted to be clear. Corey, you&#39;re not even with me on this. I have no alignment from you whatsoever around the fact that you have watched the Super Bowl tonight. So what are we actually going to talk about? There&#39;s no banter up front. I mean, other than the fact that we are trying this podcast live on Clubhouse with Corey, what did you say? With ones of fans? Is that the correct term?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you know, we&#39;ve always been very dedicated to building large audience bases, which is why we decided that we were going to live stream on something that&#39;s still private access. But it&#39;s pretty cool. It&#39;s pretty fun. We&#39;re going to see if this works. Maybe it will, maybe it won&#39;t.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you guys remember that time I invested in the television production stuff so we could broadcast TV stuff to YouTube and Facebook? And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you guys were like, no, I want to wear my toque, and that&#39;s it. We told you that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that was not on brand, Carter. We told you that our whole thing is to not try hard. This, by the way, is very off-brand for us, Corey. We&#39;re bleeding edge here. And it shows. And it shows with the ones of fans that have joined us to listen to this live. All righty, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. We&#39;ve got a lot of stuff to cover. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, our first segment, long-term gain. Guys, I want to talk about Jagmeet Singh. That&#39;s a phrase I&#39;ve never said before. No. I want to talk about Jagmeet Singh. I want to talk about his election promise on long-term care. And I want to use that as a gateway to talking about election promises, how they&#39;re constructed, when we should construct them. Is there a is there a best practice in this domain, especially in a minority government, especially when there&#39;s a political dynamic surrounding Jagmeet Singh related to does he feel like the liberals are going to be potentially trampling on, you know, traditional NDP ground as it relates to policy? So, Carter, let me start with you and with a very simple question. Why do you think Jagmeet Singh came out with a long-term care policy X months, and I say X because we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the spring or the fall or even beyond that, before an election?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I have no idea. I mean, as always, the NDP strategy baffles me and leaves me a little bit confused because there are certain ebbs and flows and a strategic opportunity. And this doesn&#39;t really feel like an opportunity right now. It feels like people in general aren&#39;t really paying attention.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So to jump in with something this significant, and to be clear, I do think that this is significant. I do think this is something that could garner the NDP votes. votes. I think that it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s a good idea from their base to be targeting this.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But I&#39;m a little bit baffled as to why it&#39;s been done now. So normally,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">normally, there&#39;s a reason why we hold until later in an election to be giving away major</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">major policy planks. Most people start to pay attention later on. I&#39;ve talked about this a lot, you know, the give a fuck factor. How much do people care now versus is how much will they care days before they vote and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and this to me um i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i mean if you if you&#39;ve done a little bit harder job maybe to tie it to uh to covid and the lack of vaccinations maybe i could see it now but um the messaging just feels like it&#39;s it&#39;s more focused on private uh private versus public ownership and less focused on the people who actually it impacts which to me does does strike me as a pretty traditional NDP structure.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, before I go to you, Carter, what do you make of the timing? So you don&#39;t understand, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you like the policy. Anything to say about the timing? What do you think they might be thinking? So you don&#39;t understand it, but what do you think internally someone was pitching Jagmeet or leadership within the federal NDP to say, let&#39;s do this now because? What do you feel like the second half of that sentence could have been? What&#39;s the strongest argument in your mind that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">could have been made right now? Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think the strongest argument would be that there&#39;s a vacuum, right? But I&#39;m not even sure that that&#39;s true, because everybody&#39;s been talking about vaccination rates for quite some time, and I&#39;m not sure that it even fits. So I&#39;m concerned that that&#39;s not the way</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">way it should be, but I don&#39;t actually know. I don&#39;t actually know. No, Corey,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you the same question. Why do you think Jagmeet Singh went right now? And if so, a little bit deeper? Why do you think this particular policy?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, do you feel like there&#39;s any merit to the argument that Jagmeet</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Jagmeet and the NDP have given a a lot, so to speak, to the Trudeau liberals who seem to be inching leftward and leftward consistently, culminating with that speech from the throne where they&#39;ve highlighted things like universal pharma care, universal child care, things that are NDP territory traditionally. Do you feel like this is staking the claim, telling the base that this is where we belong and we&#39;re going to take a much more bolder, progressive stance on things so that they can perhaps inoculate against the leftward shift of the Trudeau liberals?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I do think that that&#39;s a problem. I think that that&#39;s an issue that the NDP, we&#39;ve talked about on the podcast before, the NDP has not really got a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, hold on. Corey, I have a question for you. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re helping the federal NDP right now. You&#39;re in a position where they&#39;ve asked you to give them a hand. They&#39;re now perhaps more debt-free. They know that this liberal machine has a very progressive tinge and leaning. What are you advising them regarding policy and timing of policy? Also regarding the fact that they currently sit with some semblance of a balance of power? What are you telling them regarding their strategy for the upcoming election as it stands now in early February?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ve talked about this the fundamental challenge that the ndp has is that most canadians see uh the trudeau liberals is fairly progressive whether that&#39;s the case or not i think is in the eye of the beholder but it really does leave jagmeet singh without an island to call his own and um and so i suspect what you&#39;re going to see is is the ndp tack more to the left and create these these contrasts that the liberals can&#39;t go to in these positions that the liberals um are not willing to back to allow some differentiation to occur. And so I think that&#39;s a relatively sound policy, although I, as always, with a with a situation where you start pushing yourself to kind of the political extremes, you do risk losing voters along the way, too. So it&#39;s a bit of a calibration effort that&#39;s going to be ahead of the NDP.</span>

What What would you suggest if you&#39;re the Trudeau Liberals right now or the O&#39;Toole government? Are you taking this seriously? Are you using the NDP timing to calibrate any of your timing? Is there even a, you know, a subtweet style response to what the NDP have done that you would suggest if you&#39;re the Trudeau Liberals?

I think that when you&#39;re in first place, you should go and run your own agenda, make everybody else respond to you. The challenge that the Trudeau Liberals have had over the last two weeks is that their agenda has been undermined by their actual performance. We&#39;ve talked a lot about vaccines and how that has been the agenda for the last couple of weeks. If they&#39;re able to get things back on track, as they&#39;re signaling in the middle of February here, then they can start to run their agenda through the budget presentation in the later spring.

            <span class="text">Goran, same question to you to kind of wrap up this segment. From a broader perspective, how are you as the incumbent party or a government looking at another party putting out policy? And more specifically, if you&#39;re the liberals, are you responding at all to what you&#39;re seeing, especially knowing that you&#39;re probably going to want to tread on similar territory once this election is ultimately in the works?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you&#39;re going to watch it and you&#39;re going to see if there&#39;s any kind of movement. But I suspect there won&#39;t be significant movement on this matter. And B, it&#39;s usually it&#39;s almost always a mistake to run against the third place party. So there will be some red orange ridings that you&#39;re going to have to keep your eyes on for sure, because the Conservatives aren&#39;t even in them. I&#39;m thinking in areas around Toronto in particular, maybe southwestern Ontario, but it would be a big mistake to start focusing your efforts and your concerns on Jagmeet Singh. That would be taking you away from, I think, where the balance of the conversation during the election with the public is going to happen. So, well, you may find it annoying. You may want to respond. Message discipline isn&#39;t called message discipline because it&#39;s easy. And you&#39;ve got to resist that temptation, and you&#39;ve got to keep your eyes on the prize.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I have a quick question for you. I said that was going to be the last one to Corey. But if you were advising the NDP right now, you&#39;ve put out this policy late last week. What are some of the tactical things that you&#39;re trying to do with it this week if you&#39;re helping the NDP? I assume you&#39;re going to try to fundraise off of it. Is there anything else you try to do? Do you try to double down and make this an issue over and over, get it into earned media? I know that&#39;s a loaded question, but from your strategist playbook, what are some of the things you do once you have launched a policy into the public sphere? What are some of the things and tools that you can leverage now that it&#39;s out there?</span>

I don&#39;t think anybody is going to vote on public versus private, especially when long-term care facilities have been absolutely ravaged by COVID. So make sure that you&#39;re understanding, you&#39;re talking a lot about the employees that are working in these facilities. You should be talking a lot about the people who are not only working there, but who are living there and dying there. The impact of this pandemic is the reason and rationale to move that from private to public ownership. And</span>

It&#39;s how Canadians felt about how we got there the process and was it anxiety ridden or was it actually you know expectations were met and we felt good and we had enough airspace to talk about the positives of the vaccine so we could uh you know ensure that the vaccine hesitant group was converted i think you and i agreed on this i&#39;m surprised by this take is what i&#39;m saying yeah</span>

People aren&#39;t getting elected because of who they are. They&#39;re getting elected because of who they aren&#39;t. This goes back to 2012 in Alberta. And so that begs the question, can someone actually form that can get elected from who they are in the middle? And this isn&#39;t just about the Alberta Party. This is about the Conservative Party in British Columbia. This is about the NDP federally or the Green Party federally or the Green Party in every province. This is about small ass.

So what do the Alberta party do? First of all, they start a long campaign. So they&#39;re going to start in May and finish on October the 22nd, I think, somewhere around there, 21st or 22nd in October. So May to October is a long period of time.

There&#39;ll be statements about how the mayor is going to interact with the province. There&#39;s not going to be a headline to be had for the Alberta party and the party because it will be so irrelevant. And that&#39;s the same thing that we see time and again with the Green Party. We talked about the Green Party&#39;s leadership. It lasted forever. No one even paid attention. All of these irrelevant parties, like they have to really start thinking differently.

And so you sometimes see by the creation of a new political party, people can really break outside of the mold. You see this, like in France, Macron&#39;s party on Marche did not exist before he just created it. And all of a sudden, there it is, and he&#39;s the president of France. Jesse Ventura, he wasn&#39;t in either political party, and he just sort of comes in, he catches a wave, and there you go.</span>

As much as we&#39;ve been ribbing it, I think that&#39;s fair. They haven&#39;t met their potential in that way for nearly a decade. OK, do you feel like political leaders for a party like that can be made and incubated and won over a long haul? Or do you feel like they have to find their, quote unquote, star candidate or star leader who wants to take this on? And that&#39;s the only way some traction is sought for for a party like the Alberta Party or any other. And I like the term you use, fledgling party or under, you know, underwhelming party that that&#39;s got ambitions in this country.</span>

I think that the idea that there&#39;s going to be a leader that just emerges and is the perfect qualities and perfect person is relatively immature. I think that there&#39;s a much stronger likelihood that a brand can be established with the leader and the party that captures people&#39;s imaginations.

This is just the beginning of the branding exercise, not the end of the branding exercise. And the nine-month process that Alison Redford embarked upon, that was so destructive. Gary Marsh still pissed with me. I don&#39;t even know what I did wrong. I mean, all I did was beat you, Gary. All I did was beat you. You know, like, don&#39;t be angry. Don&#39;t go away angry.

            <span class="text">so they&#39;re doing okay in some fronts. But one interesting thread I want to pick up on is Liz Cheney from the Cheney dynasty, the congresswoman from Wyoming. She, of course, voted to impeach Donald Trump for the for the second time for inciting violence at the Capitol. She has now been censured by the Wyoming Republican Party. They overwhelmingly voted to censure her on Saturday in her role to to cast her vote. vote. Only eight of the 74-member state GOP Central Committee stood to oppose the censure in a vote that didn&#39;t proceed on a formal count. Corey, where do you kind of see this particular thread going? Because I think we, maybe I shouldn&#39;t say we, I find it interesting that one of the stalwarts of republicanism coming from a republican dynasty, the Cheney family dynasty, dynasty is facing such severe rhetoric and now, I don&#39;t know if you call a censure by your state GOP party a repercussion, but is facing some real blowback for her position. Do you feel like this is going to expand the scope of this sort of retribution that the current iteration of the GOP seems to be lashing out on a daily and weekly basis?</span>

But, you know, Zane, in some ways, this is a perfect tie into that last segment, because this is really rooted in this notion of negative partisanship as well. So just like you might want to create a new political party to get out of that negative partisanship box and just knock them all down, because everyone&#39;s got a problem with them, but maybe nobody has a problem with a new political party.

So as part of a report, we saw that the Trudeau government had some of their emails, you know, between Privy Council and the Prime Minister&#39;s office, I should say, reported in the media about the impact that adding details to particular COVID policy would have. What do you feel like the political impact over under on six will be of leaked emails, regardless of what they say, or not even leaked, but but but emails being exposed from the Prime Minister&#39;s office in the in the media?</span>

I don&#39;t think these ones are I think that these ones could have been if they&#39;d actually been followed, you know, like if there was a bunch of information that we&#39;d been hidden. But I think that these ones were like, we could do this. And people were like, now we&#39;re not gonna do that. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly damaging.

            <span class="text">the human condition. I really appreciate that. Carter, I&#39;m going to stick with you for our final question. One of the, I shouldn&#39;t say more prominent, but more voluminous attacks against the Trudeau government right now has been our our lack of domestic production of the vaccine. It&#39;s been waged by O&#39;Toole. It&#39;s been waged with a slightly less sharp elbow by Jagmeet Singh and the NDP. But it&#39;s catching steam, this argument that Canada doesn&#39;t domestically produce, which is why we&#39;re at the whims of the EU and why we&#39;re at the whims of global manufacturing. The potency of that political attack on a scale of 1 to 10, what do you think?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it could have been really good coming from Singh. I think O&#39;Toole is, of course, hampered by the fact that it was Harper that kind of allowed it to disappear under his watch. And if I were Singh, I&#39;d be saying, you know, obviously the conservatives are going to get rid of it. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t want the conservatives, but the liberals will never bring it back.</span>
