            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t want to talk about necessarily what John Tory did or did not do, but I think there&#39;s so many political questions as it relates to resigning. And Carter, the one I want to start with is John Tory comes out, for those that have not caught up to this story, on a Friday evening, not even afternoon, comes out on a Friday evening, declares that he has had an an inappropriate relationship with the staffer, which has now ended. He called it consensual. The staffer no longer works for his office as a political staffer, to be clear, a former political staffer. They decided to end it earlier this year, and he called it an error of judgment. He said, because of that, I&#39;m stepping down as mayor.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But Carter, one of the things we have seen over the last number of years, thanks mainly perhaps to the Trump era, is that politicians can double down. Stephen Carter, you&#39;ve been a fan of the double I&#39;m not saying on this particular issue. Were you surprised that John Tory kind of took the lane that he did? And I want to talk about that a bit. And then I want to talk about some of the what goes on before a big political decision or a life altering political decisions. That&#39;s the heart of the conversation I want to have. But before we do that, let&#39;s talk about the specifics of Tory and the fact that he that he chose the resignation path versus the stick it out, double down. I made a mistake keeping</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, I think that Trump showed us that just about anything is possible to survive. But Tory didn&#39;t even try. You know, he didn&#39;t wait the requisite two weeks after the story happened for him to be forced out of office. Instead, what he did is he stood up in front of a microphone in the press gallery at a very late hour. I think it was 8.30 or so in Toronto and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">resigned. designed and that to me was was unexpected i would have expected you know one of the pieces of advice zane would be uh why don&#39;t we see how this lands why don&#39;t we see how this plays before you actually uh take a an action that is you know not</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">not reversible and and that&#39;s what resignation is it&#39;s not reversible action and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and let me add to a bit of context as car because you make a good point around it landing it in this case was a toronto star article that i failed to mention But a Toronto Star article was slowly catching steam, it seemed like, had multiple authors that were kind of constructing this piece and were putting this story out. Corey,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m on the basic metric of surprise, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m kind of asking right now. Were you surprised you chose the lane of I&#39;m leaving rather than I&#39;m staying?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh i guess yes and no let&#39;s start with the obvious no you don&#39;t need to look to donald trump for an example of a politician who held on during such scandals rob ford yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know in 2013 fair enough just</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just barraged by scandals they the council basically took over the mayor&#39;s powers and staff and gave them to the deputy mayor and he still held on he</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he still held on because it&#39;s not actually that easy to get rid of a mayor if the mayor doesn&#39;t want to go And let&#39;s face it, John Tory was not the train wreck that Rob Ford was in the last years of his life. So on that certain level, I was surprised. But then when you think about that, that&#39;s perhaps the reason not to be that surprised. Because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">John Tory&#39;s entire brand had been stable and boring. And it&#39;s not as though,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s put it this way, Rob Ford acting like a cat has kind of costed into his very existence. distance uh but john tory the whole idea was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was supposed to be this stable boring fellow so what perhaps made it less survivable in his case even even curved for these times that we live in is that it&#39;s what he was supposed to be it&#39;s who he was supposed to be uh and what he was supposed to not be uh that that was led down</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">particular i&#39;m going to come to you in a second cory this is interesting you&#39;re using the term was i find that interesting what he was supposed supposed to be was, what did you say? Boring, stable, right? Like a cocktail of those words. What part of you thinks that there&#39;s a bit of strategy to say that this is who he is rather than who he was? And what I mean by that is like brand preservation. Like maybe this guy&#39;s another chapter and in six months, him leaving rather than trying to fight it out and stay, even if he could have kept his job, still keeps that overall, I shouldn&#39;t say brand untarnished, but less tarnished. Like what part of you strategically kind of looks at it from that that ends if at all yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah no that&#39;s a great point and um you know another little bit of context here he just he rolled back into re-election he was oh he wanted to romp yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and just a few months yeah just a few months yeah so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so very very i mean popular might be a stretch but certainly uh yeah i guess we&#39;ll say popular right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right certainly nobody thought that he anybody could take him on um and so yeah maybe this is a ability to preserve his brand maybe frankly this is just a reflection that the brand was more than just more than just bullshit because he acted the way politicians were supposed to act in times of yore when they had massive areas of judgment like this right and you know also let&#39;s be really clear this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is also the the particular type of scandal is one that has become i think the public consciousness has become more attuned to in the last bit the power dynamics between you know a 68 year old mayor who has all of this authority and a 31-year-old political staffer that you know that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty gross on a lot of levels you know the last thing i want to throw on the table though is that he may have been running a strategy for different purposes too and one of them is trying to preserve kind of his family life his home life keeping the cameras out of his family uh keeping his marriage at least somewhat intact like there&#39;s a lot of things that go into a calculation like this beyond the political and he just decided that um this is the way you&#39;re supposed to act in this moment carter lots of reasons he might have done that talk</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">brand preservation could have entered the equation whether it be brand preservation for the tory brand or whether it be for the perspective of trying to make a a boomerang back to some semblance of public life because let&#39;s not forget john tory has been in public life whether not as just mayor but like public life on the talk radio airwaves and such. Talk to me about this brand that he might be trying to preserve and which could have perhaps dictated the path that he eventually chose.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think that the only example that kind of pops into mind is Jim Prentice after he lost in 2015. He went right back into the corporate world immediately. And the corporate world is a, they certainly forgave Prentice the loss. I would imagine that John Tory&#39;s trying to think, will the corporate world forgive me my dalliance? And I think that, generally</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">generally speaking, they will. I think that if he acts perfectly from the point of time that this was discovered and moves forward, there&#39;s another act for John Tory returning to the corporate boardrooms of Canada. And I would imagine that he&#39;s quite used to that level of, of, uh, success and would want to hold onto it. So if you want to hold onto that, then he is acting exactly the right way. And Corey&#39;s also raised an interesting point that I think sometimes we take for granted and that his, he may actually want something really old fashioned, like his marriage to stay together. Um, you know, like it is one thing to be caught to be having an affair. It is another thing entirely to have that affair splashed across across the front pages of the Toronto Star and other national newspapers. That is a different type of humiliation. And I suspect that for him to save his marriage, it required immediate action. But I do think that both of those paths are the same path, right? You stick to, if you want to save your marriage, you get the hell out of office as soon as you can. If you want to be a corporate player, you get out of office and you make sure that you clean this up as best you possibly can. So I imagine that that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing.</span>

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s get into the strategy here, Carter. This is what I wanted to talk about, right? John Torrey, just like many times on this show, is just, you know, I&#39;m not going to use him transactionally, but he is a case that we&#39;re going to eventually, in this case, ultimately study for our purposes of the strategy discussion. And the discussion I want to have is exactly the one you talked about, which is, is this mutually exclusive, Carter? Could John Tory, if he came to you and said, Carter, I fucked up, right? I really fucked up. You&#39;re his advisor, one of his principal advisors in that mayor&#39;s office. Carter, I fucked up.</span>

There&#39;s going to be a bit of a dip whether it comes out or not. But if brand preservation is primary to me, or even family preservation, can I have my cake and eat it too, Carter? Can I still keep this job as mayor of Toronto? A job that, by the way, I&#39;ve got a lot of fucking capital with. I won handily. A lot of fucking people voted for me. Can I still keep this gig, preserve my brand? Is it possible? Or is it, as you just said in your previous answer, mutually exclusive? that if you want corporate, if you want brand preservation, you got to get the fuck out of this gig?</span>

And if it wasn&#39;t going to be his last term, and he still has a political ambition, then you could rewrite, you could keep him in office office and get him reelected in three years. I think that that would be possible. But I don&#39;t think you could get him reelected in three years and preserve his marriage and make him, you know, rehabilitate him for corporate life. It would be an all in on the political structure of you&#39;re going to be mayor for another eight years. We can do that for you. But what are your competing competing priorities.

Because keep in mind, the staff also are on the cutting block, right? As soon as your principal decides to leave, you&#39;re leaving too.</span>

Or even if there&#39;s like a conflict of interest there when you&#39;re trying to persuade someone to stay because your gig is on the lines. But I&#39;ll get to that. Corey, you wanted to chime in on something. So the question is really the broad strokes of what you may have seen or observed around how these career altering, and in this case, career ending conversations might be had structurally or even mechanically.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">find that voice that will agree with them. And then ultimately there&#39;s that one voice that gets dragged in in front of all of the other voices. And that&#39;s how the conversation gets built out. And so, because you got to keep in mind that just like everybody else everywhere, think about your boss, think about jobs you&#39;ve had, think about conversations you&#39;ve had with friends. There&#39;s a certain shopping that occurs. They know what they want to do and they want somebody to validate that that is the right course of action. And if they can&#39;t find it, that group can get pretty big, I guess is the point that I would make. So Corey,</span>

Carter, how many times, what I find interesting is dynamics here, right? There&#39;s power dynamics, so let&#39;s peel this back, right? There&#39;s clearly power dynamics in this Tory situation with him and the staffer, right? And we talked, you know, Corey, you gave a hat tip to this, and I know other outlets and podcasts are talking about the ongoing nature of consent, the power dynamics, you we&#39;re focusing on using this as a strategy conversation, but the power dynamics between the principal and the staff. And then what I think is really interesting, and I&#39;m curious if either of you have seen this, if the principal in this case, the elected individual brings in outside advisors, the best friend, for example. This person</span>

            <span class="text">person is the fucking shit. Don&#39;t fuck with They bring them in, to Corey&#39;s point, as the validation to the decision. Talk to me about the dynamics here because I find that really interesting because who at the end of the day holds the power? The people with core political skills that have been slaving away for 80 hours a week or the best friend that they talk to every weekend and go running with sort of thing or have coffee?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Well, David Axelrod talked about it during the Obama campaign. They had this strategy where they were going to roll into certain caucus states, and that was going to build the momentum that was going to get them to the later contest. And that&#39;s how they were going to beat Hillary Clinton in the 2008 primary season for the Democrats. Yeah.</span>

And there were friends of Barack Obama who were losing their mind. And Barack Obama would bring them to these people. And, you know, in that particular situation, the political staff that Barack Obama went up with, they won the day. But this happens all the time. You&#39;ve got to keep in mind that politicians are not robots that only talk to their staff. They talk to their spouses. They talk to their friends. They</span>

Even if you&#39;re right more than you&#39;re wrong, you&#39;re still going to be wrong sometimes. And everybody knows it. And so everything gets put into doubt. And ultimately, at the end of the day, it&#39;s the principal who decides. It&#39;s up to them. And so this shopping occurs perpetually, because quite often, it&#39;s a way to get around what is supposed to be the</span>

And rather than me overriding my principal strategist, and maybe that&#39;s an extreme example, because that&#39;s such a personal one. Of course, it would be my decision at the end of the day. Let&#39;s make an easier one. You&#39;ve got to do this television show. I don&#39;t want to do that television show. Well, I&#39;m not going to override him. I&#39;m going to say, yeah, Steven, I think you should talk to a few other of my friends here, have contrary views, really smart people, really understand television.

            <span class="text">the issues are going to be set. Well, this is one of the reasons you&#39;re going to want someone who comes from a background, because that person will bring their issues with them, right? Jennifer Kismat has talked, for example, about all the different ways that they can build and develop in Toronto, what they should be building as a city type of format. that would come with her because she&#39;d spent months and months and years and years building that brand persona for herself so if you&#39;re an existing politician you&#39;re going to be able to bring some issues with you but corey&#39;s absolutely right outside of that the issues are going to be set by someone else now is that a referendum on john tory no but integrity and trust may jump back in a little bit more because again you know back-to-back mayors ending in scandal Kendall, in Toronto, is there such a thing as an ethical politician anymore, may be an overlying theme that defines the election a little bit. You know, I mean, I suspect most people will answer with, no, we don&#39;t expect there to be any more ethical politicians, and may look and be more accepting of a little bit more of the deviant, the deviance, which is something that if you&#39;re going to campaign, I agree with Corey as well, getting yourself out there as soon as possible. um it would be super important can</span>

I understand what Corey&#39;s saying. It&#39;ll color it a bit. It won&#39;t dominate. It won&#39;t be the headline, but I get the point.

And let&#39;s go to advising John Tory in the future. Not to say, and listen, I&#39;m not saying John Tory deserves another chapter, right? I&#39;m not saying, you know, based on what he&#39;s done, but we&#39;ve seen people have other chapters, right? So let&#39;s just face that head on. And the reality, people do shitty, gross things and staying power, whether it&#39;s in in this job or in the future, what advice would, would one give? I&#39;m not going to make you do it, but what advice would one give to John Tory as it relates to</span>

As we discussed with Corey earlier to kind of preserve that brand to maybe let&#39;s say maybe the loose guidance to Carter is what do I need to do so that I can come back in a couple of years? It doesn&#39;t have to be elected office but carter i like the public eye i like being on a talk show maybe they&#39;ll invite me to a panel maybe they&#39;ll maybe i can have the patrick brown arc in some ways um you know sans the the the elected office if that&#39;s the loose sort of like this is what i want to do what are some of the things you&#39;d be you&#39;d be telling someone like like john tory in in in in the immediate future carter help</span>

It&#39;s John Horgan, because John Horgan left at the top of his game. He didn&#39;t lose an election. He was he had rebuilt the New Democratic Party of British Columbia in his own image and I think that that gave him gives him a real legacy when he leaves unfortunately we will never know if that was because of really smart planning on the part of John Horgan or because John Horgan just simply got sick and had to make the right choices for him and his family of course no one wishes that type of illness on on a politician but as a result I I think that his exit, I mean, we certainly haven&#39;t seen a proper exit out of Alberta.</span>

There&#39;s a couple of like, you know, you mentioned correctly his health issues, but never losing an election, calling an election at the right time takes a certain amount of skill, like reading the room during that pandemic election.
