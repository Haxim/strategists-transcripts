          <p>The Strategists go live with His Worship, Jeromy Farkas, Mayor of Calgary, for a chaotic, surprisingly earnest, and occasionally ill-advised deep dive into how he won, what his plans are and how heavy the chains of office really are. Then the gang breaks into a mini-episode of Ministry of Podcasts with MP Corey Hogan to talk all things budget and floor crossing. Finally, Zain Velji, as always lets YOU pick the questions and keeps everybody in line in our audience questions segment.</p><p>Originally recorded on November 12th, 2025</p><p>Join our Patreon for ad-free episodes, bonus episodes, and access to our exclusive Discord.<br /><a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/strategistspod" target="_blank">https://www.patreon.com/c/strategistspod</a></p>

Like there&#39;s a lot of candidates who are fighting for control over the football, so to speak. But I think it just comes down to those personal connections. And at the municipal level, it is so different, right? Right. The big calculus for a lot of folks is, is this representative going to pick up the phone? Right. And there&#39;s a lot of folks who are part of our campaign that wouldn&#39;t necessarily see themselves 100 percent aligned with me as a candidate or the policy positions and all the rest. But the the face to face really mattered. And it was that nucleus of support in Ward 11 when I had ran for city council the first time 10 years ago that it was those folks who showed up. But on election night, it was brand new folks I was surrounded with that had never supported me before. So I think it&#39;s that storytelling. It&#39;s the brand that&#39;s more important than any of the policy positions. But, you know, it helped that we had the best policy in the race.</div>

It must have been he has no principles. But I remember standing up at the stage and saying, yeah, you know, just because I&#39;ve changed my mind, it doesn&#39;t make me a flip-flopper. It means that I have a working brain. And I thought that that was the moment that, yeah, thank you. Well, and enough Calgarians, I think, saw that where, you know, if you&#39;re willing to do the work, if you&#39;re willing to knock on doors, if you&#39;re willing to engage in the community in a much more genuine way, then it&#39;s not a story anymore. It&#39;s just real. It&#39;s my life. And there&#39;s a level of exposure as a candidate running for office in a municipal realm where it&#39;s you on trial. It is you as the person.

We have tens of million dollars of capital for a new affordable housing project in Southview. So there&#39;s a lot of ways that we can still drive down the increase that the previous council approved while still responding to what Calgarians have told us is important.</div>

But let&#39;s talk about it from a communications exercise. From a communications exercise, what Canadians are looking for is a substantive plan. So you can talk about 400 pages, but</div>

            <div class="said">but the very fact that it&#39;s 400 pages and it has that kind of depth and gets into it was kind of an essential part of the communications exercise. But there&#39;s other parts of it, too. You have the visuals of it, which, let&#39;s totally unpack them, because God knows, you know, we should talk about the icebreaker on the cover a lot. But there&#39;s also then 20 pages of story, and the story is actually not a great, fun story. It&#39;s a, the world is tough story. And so, in many ways, what it did is it repositioned the stakes, and it talked about how we&#39;re going to respond to it. So the way I think about it is, you&#39;re</div>

And the standing vote is literally going on when the news that Matt That Gennaro is not there. Breaks. We&#39;re sitting in the House of Commons. You&#39;ve got to keep in mind this is a conservative motion we&#39;re voting on. We&#39;re looking across to the other aisle and we&#39;re thinking, what the fuck&#39;s going on? Where are these guys? It&#39;s like one third full. The mover, you know, or at least that Pierre Polyev was supposed to move it. You know, he&#39;s not there in the House of Commons. And then as the conservatives are voting yay on their motion, this news breaks. And all of a sudden, MPs are exchanging phones. Is this real? Hey, did you see this article? Including on the other side? Well, I think on our side. On our side, okay. I think they knew. Because half of them didn&#39;t show up, right?</div>
