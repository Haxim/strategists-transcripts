        <div class="desc"><p>The gang get together to discuss the state of the Alberta election with six sleeps to go. Stephen Carter unveils his predictions. Corey Hogan defends the virtues of polls. Annalise Klingbeil tries to get people to answer questions about undecided voters.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about how the NDP and UCP campaigns should be approaching the final days of the Alberta election, undecided voters, polls and Stephen's final predictions. Was Danielle Smith's weekend visit to Edmonton a feint? Can we trust polls to tell us what will happen on election day? And if we can't trust Margaret's judgement, whose judgment can we trust? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And we&#39;ve talked about that, because you say like, oh, well, we&#39;re going to leave some flexibility for whatever becomes the issue. Or, yeah, we&#39;re going to react to whatever the top issue is at the moment, or we&#39;re going to try to frame it out based on the media hooks that are available there. Very dangerous, because then you start doing crazy things. Stick to the plan. It&#39;s pretty baked by now.

And are they going to make choices? Some will, but it&#39;s probably not going to be because anything of you are doing, because what you&#39;ve done to date has not actually had an impact at the moment. So it&#39;ll end up being something like one of their friends says, hey, have you voted yet? It&#39;s election day. And they go, oh, I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t really going to vote. I think I&#39;m going to vote for David Swan. I like him. Oh, no, he hasn&#39;t run into elections. You can&#39;t. Oh, okay. Who&#39;s the person like David Swan then in this riding? Well, David Swan never ran in this riding, but I think you&#39;re thinking of Marlon Schmidt. He&#39;s the NDP candidate here in Edmonton Gold. David Swan&#39;s actually from Calgary, Margaret. Like, are you feeling okay? Have you gotten too much sun? Oh, so should I vote? Should I vote for Marlon? Yeah,</div>

So on election day, we get a telephone call, Chima and I around 545 in the in the maybe 515 in the evening. It&#39;s Nenshi&#39;s body person. And she&#39;s calling to tell us that they ignored our requests not to campaign on these overpasses. And they were campaigning on the overpass at Southland Station over top of McLeod Trail.

You want to, you want to kind of fake a certain momentum, even when you don&#39;t have it, you want to get people motivated saying, yeah, we&#39;re going to take the fight to them. You want those Edmonton people to come and volunteer and sure, maybe you&#39;re going to throw them on a phone bank for Calgary, but you want to keep the energy levels up. So Danielle Smith being in Edmonton, I don&#39;t think that was a misallocation of resources because of the same logic why Rachel Notley was there. You&#39;re not going to be there again. You&#39;re going to be in Calgary the entire time. So by all means, I do agree with Stephen. It kind of, it went a little beyond straining credulity when you started seeing people say, oh, six seats are in play, like Fox six seats are in play in Edmonton. In 2019, the NDP won all but but one seat and this is a stronger election for the ndp i think we all acknowledge that i think we realize that is it pot now look if they had said hey daniel smith did two rallies in edmonton decor maybe i&#39;d go oh what&#39;s</div>

The NDP oppo, you know, like the pictures that they had from the donut on the weekend where, you know, only 15 people showed up to do a door knocking session or something like that. And they spun it that this was a sad, pathetic turnout for an area that the UCP are supposed to be doing super well in. Like, I thought that that was very well executed. I thought that they had a pretty solid approach to building out this narrative that they were going to do fairly well. So to me, the NDP looks more credible at this particular moment.

Big campaign, multi-million dollar campaign, candidates everywhere, really playing to win. I have a hard time not just looking at that and saying, holy shit, like what Rachel Notley has managed to create out of the NDP since 2014 is totally surreal. And we can get pretty blasé about it.

I mean, it&#39;s hard not to just be really like when you take that even one step, step back from the campaign, be really, really impressed with what the NDP have managed to do in less than a decade. and you know for that reason I kind of have a hard time scoring it on points individually here I do think probably it&#39;s closer than it feels to me because for me it feels just like amazing what the NDP have managed to pull off but you know the reality is we can see the polls we know things are still pretty tight in certain areas we know that this is this is a dog fight right it&#39;s by it&#39;s by no means a walk for either party and I think you got to give credit where Where credits do, the UCP, despite</div>

          <div class="said">So let&#39;s go back and remind people of what polls are used for. Polls are used to show a degree of momentum and overall support. court. When we are doing 87 individual elections, polls can be very useful in kind of getting the tone and tenor of the 87, but they are not particularly good or particularly useful at predicting what&#39;s going to happen inside those 87 ridings, especially when you&#39;ve got ridings that are behaving differently and not made up of the same types of individuals. So I&#39;ve been on the wrong end of polls a couple of times, right? 2012, I told people we were going to win with 62 seats and everybody thought I was a lunatic. There wasn&#39;t a single poll, not a single poll that had us winning, let alone a poll that had us winning a significant majority. And people looked at me like I was a lunatic. And I was a lunatic. I was a lunatic that was right because the polls were unable to pick up on a significant change. And they were unable to pick up on some of the things that were actually happening underneath. Now, some would say that&#39;s just a delay factor. It wasn&#39;t just a delay factor. It was decisions being made late and the social fabric not yet locking in. And I think that we have some of that happening today, where the cultural nature of our province has been to be conservative, right? We vote conservative. That&#39;s what we do, even when we were electing very liberal conservatives, right? We were electing very liberal conservatives, whether it was Peter Lougheed, Ralph Klein in his later days, Ed Stelmack, Alison Redford. Prentice was the first conservative really to come in since the 1993 conservative of Ralph Klein. So we behave like we&#39;re super conservative, but our values are different. The</div>

But there have been a couple of notable misses on the municipal side, right? Which maybe you can make a good case that Calgary is just really tough to poll. Super relevant if we&#39;ve got a race that&#39;s coming down to Calgary. That&#39;s certainly a legitimate hypothesis I&#39;m willing to entertain. But the reality is, like I have said this on the pod before, I have two rules about polling, right? Don&#39;t lie about polls. Don&#39;t let polls lie to you. and people let polls lie to themselves all of the time because they sit there and they look at them and they say ah but the margin of error ah but you know if you think about the results that&#39;s really only 10 per riding and what does it really tell us about ridings but if you look at the large numbers when you think about the overall thrust of these things the reality is simple 2019 polls were pretty good 2015 polls were pretty good people misremember 2015 people should should should take a look they will surprise themselves to see that 2015 the final polls were really really predictive of the final result and 2012 was a miss 2012 was a miss for a lot of things across the board here but polls don&#39;t become a polling nihilist just because one poll was wrong if you want to come to me with a theory as to why the polls might be missing</div>

And now the Northeast, high visible minority population, very strong relationship with Irfan Sabir, sitting MLA, who&#39;s done a very good job of mobilizing the Northeast. and the numbers that I&#39;m seeing in the Northeast show that the Northeast is probably going to go almost entirely NDP. Calgary Cross is a little bit different just because it has, it&#39;s a little bit different makeup in terms of visible minorities and such, but it probably will go to the NDP. I think that it will, but I&#39;m not putting it in as for sure. Then we started getting into less less comfortable. Calgary Bow, Calgary Glenmore, Calgary North, Calgary Acadia. Those four Calgary ridings are super pulley. They very easily could go to the NDP, but they also could</div>

          <div class="said">probably some variant of 75% chance UCP wins, 25% chance NDP wins based on the poll of polls, you know, including some results that are not particularly strong for the NDP, which seem to be really living there in a big way right now. But you know, even with the quote unquote bad results, it&#39;s saying it&#39;s a one in four chance for the NDP. So how in the world could I dispute what what you&#39;re saying at this particular moment. I would argue that because of those seat by seat nuances, it&#39;s probably better than what they see because of everything that you&#39;ve just articulated, not disputing that. I do want to say the danger of doing what you have done without the data that you have, and maybe even with the data you have, Stephen, is that there has never been a losing campaign in a close race in the history of losing campaigns in close races that have not seen the the signs that they&#39;re going to win, right? Yeah, the polls say this, but the vibe&#39;s good at the door. Yeah, the polls say this, but did you see how many volunteers we had out? Something&#39;s happening in that neighborhood. These are the cries of losing campaigns everywhere. And you&#39;ve got to be very careful not to let polls lie to you. My second rule of polling here. And you&#39;ve really got to take the numbers for what they are. And it&#39;s really important because you talked about one of the jobs in the last week being the resource allocation. That&#39;s 100% true. And we We haven&#39;t really spent a lot of time in what that looks like, but it is sending volunteers. It is getting phone banks towards areas. It is putting money at the last minute into, you know, the limited advertising options you have in that space. And if you start getting the wrong picture of things, if it starts to get cloudy, you&#39;re going to make wrong decisions. So you&#39;ve got to be pretty clear eyed about these things as you move forward.</div>
