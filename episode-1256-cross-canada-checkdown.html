        <p>Pack your bags, the Strategists are doing a cross country tour. </p><p>Well, they tried to. It's a big country. But they do get around to discussing Alberta's federal-government-targeting national advertising campaign "Tell The Feds", Saskatchewan announcing intent to use the rights-trampling notwithstanding clause and a Manitoba election with some wild PC ads - <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/pc-advertisement-backlash-election-1.6983946?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar" target="_blank">one of which the gang even forgot to talk about</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter go from coast (Alberta) to coast (Saskatchewan) to coast (Manitoba) in a classic Strategists' checkdown of the political doings across Canada. Does Alberta Premier Danielle Smith really expect Ontarians to #TellTheFeds? What's the strategy of the landfill-heavy compassion-light Manitoba PC closeout? And will the gang ever get to their final destination? You'll have to pay $6 to find out. Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">Okay, we&#39;re going to keep it simple. We usually do when we go coast to coast. So Carter, we&#39;ve got this campaign here in Alberta. Help me understand it. Do you see the strategy of it? It&#39;s an $8 million campaign to tell the feds it could be the first implementation of the Sovereignty Act. The things Canadians count on won&#39;t work when needed. Let&#39;s stop blackouts. We can&#39;t afford them. them, do you see the strategy of this $8 million pan-Canadian campaign? And is it a good strategy? Those are the two questions. Start with the first one for me. I&#39;ll go to Corey. And then you guys can tell me if it&#39;s good or not, based on if you understand what the strategy is. Well,</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, I mean, first of all, if all it took was introducing the Sovereignty Act and in some fashion carving out some sort of new rules for Alberta, then we wouldn&#39;t need to run a national campaign, right? Because we wouldn&#39;t have to tell the feds anything, because all we&#39;d have to do is is implement the Sovereignty Act and away we go, right? So the strategy of advertising across the country saying tell the feds that we don&#39;t want cleaner air, we want dirty air, that strategy wouldn&#39;t be required if the Sovereignty Act actually did what Danielle Smith has advertised that it does. So it kind of undermines the Sovereignty Act strategy. But so</div>

Ontario&#39;s actual energy use, like when there&#39;s obviously there&#39;s overall production, there&#39;s energizers, all that crap, but their actual use is about 9% gas. So I kind of had the same thought, Stephen. And it&#39;s like, if you&#39;re an Ontarian, and you&#39;re not really seized with the need to kind of have certain supply on hand for times of peak demand, which is largely the value of gas, like, aren&#39;t you going to kind of look at this and be like, well, we don&#39;t really use gas.

          <div class="said">I had Carter giving me a bunch of preamble. I want to get your yes. Let me give you my postamble. I do think, I see the strategy, but it&#39;s pretty clear that the strategy is not actually to change minds in Ontario. It&#39;s not actually to put pressure on the federal government. It&#39;s to say to Albertans, we&#39;re advertising to Ontario. We&#39;re taking the the fight to them. We&#39;re not on the defensive. We&#39;re on the offensive. Here we are now with our campaign in downtown Ottawa. Zane Velji, known political commentator Zane Velji, even saw it when he was in Ottawa, this thing driving around. And that is not necessarily a bad strategy. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be effective at changing the policy. It&#39;s a continuation of the fight with Ottawa, but it&#39;s not a way to win the fight. But I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the point.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, so I think it will be effective in Alberta, I don&#39;t think it will be effective at changing the federal government&#39;s position or the minds of Ontarians at it. Because anytime you do one of these advocacy campaigns, and we&#39;ve had this conversation on this pod before, there is the risk on the other side, like if you go out and everybody knows you spent a ton of money in Ontario and everybody knows you&#39;re blasting ads everywhere and nobody is using that form to quote unquote tell the feds jack shit, you&#39;ve really kind of exposed yourself as being a total non-force and your argument being a total non-force in the good province of Ontario. So, you know, that&#39;s something that then the federal liberals will look at and probably even to a degree the federal conservatives and say, well, I&#39;m going to have to take note of that. So there&#39;s always a risk of backfire with an advocacy campaign. And again, we&#39;ve made this point before, but it&#39;s really worth underlining. And the more money you put into it, and the less you get out of it, the bigger the backfire.

We should just say that&#39;s kind of not our business. That&#39;s why they elect a government. And we have other mechanisms to make our concerns known.

It seems like the kind of thing that is so deeply consequential to the affected kids, but so not consequential to everybody else who should just butt out or not worry about it so much.

But, you know, just because you say that doesn&#39;t make it so. And attacking a group like this, you know, if the population and this is what happens with Bill 10. Right. If the population suddenly comes to see what is happening, the rallying power of it, the rallying attack could be devastating for a political party for quite some time. It sticks to you. And so I would expect that if if Mo starts to get pushback, that pushback could last for a very long time and be very, very challenging for him in the future, which is good because that&#39;s what happened to Jim Prentice.

          <div class="said">I actually want to talk about that last point, Carter, around the lingering of a political move in a second as we move to Manitoba. But Corey, let&#39;s finish off this segment about Saskatchewan, the notwithstanding clause on this. It seems like the argument that Carter&#39;s mentioned around parental rights, even as a buzzword, seems to be gaining more momentum than the other side of the frame. frame, the vulnerability of these kids, the fact that this is not necessarily about how you would parent, but about other situations that you are necessarily not privy to, but hopefully you can have empathy for, that side of the argument seems to be losing, at least from public opinion polling, at least from sentimentality. What needs to be done to shift the frame? What would you start suggesting needs to be done to make this argument perhaps more representative of where the population should be versus where they are with the parental rights frame that&#39;s being applied to it across the country.</div>

          <div class="said">I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an easy answer to that, Zane. As you asked the question, I think about all of the tactics I would normally suggest when a minority group is being attacked, including</div>

          <div class="said">introducing people to the stories of these individuals, having these individuals be spokespeople. But we are talking about children here, and a lot of those tactics aren&#39;t there, Which is part of why, in my opinion, this is so gross. Because the group is not in a position to stand up for itself. We are talking about children again here. And we are talking about the premier of Saskatchewan, the most powerful person in Saskatchewan, deciding to take this just like absolute heavy handed approach to it. And it&#39;s totally wild to me. so if anything&#39;s going to change if any frame is going to be redone it&#39;s going to require i think taking it and just shifting it as little as possible to make as complete as possible an argument here right so maybe it&#39;s not so much yeah we are all for parental rights and i have the right as a parent to know that the school is looking after my kids interests first and not the interests of the premier of saskatchewan and that&#39;s what i would expect of them in any situation situation maybe it&#39;s as simple as that maybe it&#39;s more complicated than that i suspect it&#39;s more complicated than that but i think at this point it&#39;s not to just try to counter it with the the exact opposite that&#39;s playing into the parents right</div>

It&#39;s a full-page ad that says, Stand firm. For health and safety reasons, the answer on the landfill dig just has to be no. And this is on the heels of her continual opposition to searching a landfill for the remains of two Indigenous women believed to have been murdered by an alleged serial killer in that landfill. is where their remains are suspected to be. The Manitoba PCs have said for a while, they&#39;ve been mealy-mouthed about it and then firmly know about it, that this is not what we want to do. They faced protests in Winnipeg over the summer. But now, Carter, taking out an ad campaign, digital billboards that we have seen in Winnipeg, we see the full-page ad, we see digital ads about this particular thing. Carter, I&#39;m going to go back to the same two questions. Do you see the strategy here, and is this a good strategy?

Do you feel like stand firm, the landfill dig, if the PCs lose here, this could have significantly longer term effects for a party here? Or do you feel like we are in a very different sort of cultural political space, that you do whatever it is to get elected, if you win, all is forgotten. If you&#39;re lost, there&#39;s no lingering side effects. You just come back four four years later, as a new thing. Talk to me about that. And I&#39;m not saying this is a perfect comparison, because we don&#39;t even, we&#39;re not even at Tuesday yet. We don&#39;t even know the outcome. We don&#39;t even, to Corey&#39;s point, we&#39;re not even on the ground.

And then I would have some showy PR pieces in downtown Ottawa, downtown Toronto, downtown Vancouver, so people felt the nationalness of it, so that we could then internally talk about how we have a national campaign. I would have a couple of pieces in French coming out as sort of a sustaining PR strategy in the next week or two. So all of a sudden in downtown Montreal, we&#39;re talking a bit about this now obviously the challenge there is they don&#39;t really use gas at all right uh so you&#39;re going to need to kind of create the the local quebec flavor but this is your chance also to just change the creative a little bit and say like this you know ottawa wants to come into our backyards and tell us how to run a provincial industry tell the feds you don&#39;t think ottawa should come into the backyards of provinces and run a provincial industry and run something like that that also puts ottawa on blast a little bit that you are um you are willing to expand and extend this campaign in interesting ways and uh and then yeah then just focus that money in alberta making sure everybody in alberta knows you are trying to uh you know wreck justin trudeau like a cheap pinata carter</div>
