            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, we&#39;re going to keep it simple. We usually do when we go coast to coast. So Carter, we&#39;ve got this campaign here in Alberta. Help me understand it. Do you see the strategy of it? It&#39;s an $8 million campaign to tell the feds it could be the first implementation of the Sovereignty Act. The things Canadians count on won&#39;t work when needed. Let&#39;s stop blackouts. We can&#39;t afford them. them, do you see the strategy of this $8 million pan-Canadian campaign? And is it a good strategy? Those are the two questions. Start with the first one for me. I&#39;ll go to Corey. And then you guys can tell me if it&#39;s good or not, based on if you understand what the strategy is. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, first of all, if all it took was introducing the Sovereignty Act and in some fashion carving out some sort of new rules for Alberta, then we wouldn&#39;t need to run a national campaign, right? Because we wouldn&#39;t have to tell the feds anything, because all we&#39;d have to do is is implement the Sovereignty Act and away we go, right? So the strategy of advertising across the country saying tell the feds that we don&#39;t want cleaner air, we want dirty air, that strategy wouldn&#39;t be required if the Sovereignty Act actually did what Danielle Smith has advertised that it does. So it kind of undermines the Sovereignty Act strategy. But so</span>

Ontario&#39;s actual energy use, like when there&#39;s obviously there&#39;s overall production, there&#39;s energizers, all that crap, but their actual use is about 9% gas. So I kind of had the same thought, Stephen. And it&#39;s like, if you&#39;re an Ontarian, and you&#39;re not really seized with the need to kind of have certain supply on hand for times of peak demand, which is largely the value of gas, like, aren&#39;t you going to kind of look at this and be like, well, we don&#39;t really use gas. So we don&#39;t really care. You know, that was my first reaction to it. So,</span>

You don&#39;t see the strategy. Corey, can I get you on that same question? Hold on, Carter. You can tell me why it&#39;s bad. Go ahead in a second. Corey, do</span>

            <span class="text">I had Carter giving me a bunch of preamble. I want to get your yes. Let me give you my postamble. I do think, I see the strategy, but it&#39;s pretty clear that the strategy is not actually to change minds in Ontario. It&#39;s not actually to put pressure on the federal government. It&#39;s to say to Albertans, we&#39;re advertising to Ontario. We&#39;re taking the the fight to them. We&#39;re not on the defensive. We&#39;re on the offensive. Here we are now with our campaign in downtown Ottawa. Zane Velji, known political commentator Zane Velji, even saw it when he was in Ottawa, this thing driving around. And that is not necessarily a bad strategy. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be effective at changing the policy. It&#39;s a continuation of the fight with Ottawa, but it&#39;s not a way to win the fight. But I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the point.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, I agree with what Corey has said. I mean, I think that this is not in any way, shape or form designed to change anybody&#39;s mind in Alberta, or sorry, in well, even in Alberta. This is this is about reinforcing a narrative to the existing base that that uh danielle continues to communicate with this isn&#39;t actually about changing the hearts and minds of the good people of ontario or or any other market this is about danielle smith being able to basically</span>

            <span class="text">basically say this is what she&#39;s trying to do um but it&#39;s not going to change anything and i think that that&#39;s where the strategy falls apart for me um the tactic Tactic is whatever. I mean, tactically, we decided to buy ads, whatever. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">strategy should be to actually put some pressure on the federal government to change their outcome, or their plan. Otherwise, it&#39;s rather hollow. And I think that it&#39;s going to, I don&#39;t know that it necessarily backfires, but I think that it is relatively hollow.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you see the strategy, you say it&#39;s not gonna be particularly effective. Tell me why expand a bit more on like, why don&#39;t think it&#39;s gonna be particularly? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, so I think it will be effective in Alberta, I don&#39;t think it will be effective at changing the federal government&#39;s position or the minds of Ontarians at it. Because anytime you do one of these advocacy campaigns, and we&#39;ve had this conversation on this pod before, there is the risk on the other side, like if you go out and everybody knows you spent a ton of money in Ontario and everybody knows you&#39;re blasting ads everywhere and nobody is using that form to quote unquote tell the feds jack shit, you&#39;ve really kind of exposed yourself as being a total non-force and your argument being a total non-force in the good province of Ontario. So, you know, that&#39;s something that then the federal liberals will look at and probably even to a degree the federal conservatives and say, well, I&#39;m going to have to take note of that. So there&#39;s always a risk of backfire with an advocacy campaign. And again, we&#39;ve made this point before, but it&#39;s really worth underlining. And the more money you put into it, and the less you get out of it, the bigger the backfire. And when you&#39;re a provincial government spending literal millions, if not tens of millions, if you&#39;re not getting outcomes, you&#39;re</span>

This is a known loophole. This is a loophole we haven&#39;t seen people make heavy use of.

I was recently surprised and perhaps even naive to the fact that municipalities have significant resources they spend on hiring government relationships and lobbyists of their own to convince both the feds and, in this particular case, this example I&#39;m going to present, I won&#39;t reveal it, but what the file was, but the province.

            <span class="text">In some ways, this campaign by the UCP targeted or the government of Alberta targeted towards the federal government is almost a little more defensible than some of them because at least it&#39;s like an order of government that kind of layers on top. Sometimes we just go right into the backyard and we say, this is how we think as a province, this is what you should do, right? And so, again,</span>

            <span class="text">again, I&#39;d be a hypocrite, but I&#39;m not comfortable with it. I think that this has gone a little far. And so provinces and the federal government need to tighten up the regulations around political money to include other governments. We obviously wouldn&#39;t let the government of China interfere in Canada. I don&#39;t think we should let the government of Alberta interfere in Saskatchewan. We should just say that&#39;s kind of not our business. That&#39;s why they elect a government. And we have other mechanisms to make our concerns known. I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s an equivalency between China and Alberta before anybody asks me on that. But there is a broader principle about not interfering in other people&#39;s elections.</span>

Like all of the government&#39;s stated policy objections are bullshit, right? Like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s nonsense.

Like, who&#39;s actually getting caught up in this? If you&#39;re in a loving environment, supporting environment, one where you can talk to your parents, your parents might disagree, but at least you&#39;re going to have that disagreement with them.</span>

Like that parents will buy into this idea that if you say the words parents&#39; rights, then, you know, parents will go, yeah, fuck, that&#39;s right. I do have the right to know what my children are doing. They believe that. I mean, parent activism in schools has never been at a higher level. But, you know, just because you say that doesn&#39;t make it so. And attacking a group like this, you know, if the population and this is what happens with Bill 10. Right. If the population suddenly comes to see what is happening, the rallying power of it, the rallying attack could be devastating for a political party for quite some time. It sticks to you. And so I would expect that if if Mo starts to get pushback, that pushback could last for a very long time and be very, very challenging for him in the future, which is good because that&#39;s what happened to Jim Prentice. And that stink didn&#39;t come off.</span>

            <span class="text">I actually want to talk about that last point, Carter, around the lingering of a political move in a second as we move to Manitoba. But Corey, let&#39;s finish off this segment about Saskatchewan, the notwithstanding clause on this. It seems like the argument that Carter&#39;s mentioned around parental rights, even as a buzzword, seems to be gaining more momentum than the other side of the frame. frame, the vulnerability of these kids, the fact that this is not necessarily about how you would parent, but about other situations that you are necessarily not privy to, but hopefully you can have empathy for, that side of the argument seems to be losing, at least from public opinion polling, at least from sentimentality. What needs to be done to shift the frame? What would you start suggesting needs to be done to make this argument perhaps more representative of where the population should be versus where they are with the parental rights frame that&#39;s being applied to it across the country.</span>

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s an easy answer to that, Zane. As you asked the question, I think about all of the tactics I would normally suggest when a minority group is being attacked, including</span>

            <span class="text">introducing people to the stories of these individuals, having these individuals be spokespeople. But we are talking about children here, and a lot of those tactics aren&#39;t there, Which is part of why, in my opinion, this is so gross. Because the group is not in a position to stand up for itself. We are talking about children again here. And we are talking about the premier of Saskatchewan, the most powerful person in Saskatchewan, deciding to take this just like absolute heavy handed approach to it. And it&#39;s totally wild to me. so if anything&#39;s going to change if any frame is going to be redone it&#39;s going to require i think taking it and just shifting it as little as possible to make as complete as possible an argument here right so maybe it&#39;s not so much yeah we are all for parental rights and i have the right as a parent to know that the school is looking after my kids interests first and not the interests of the premier of saskatchewan and that&#39;s what i would expect of them in any situation situation maybe it&#39;s as simple as that maybe it&#39;s more complicated than that i suspect it&#39;s more complicated than that but i think at this point it&#39;s not to just try to counter it with the the exact opposite that&#39;s playing into the parents right</span>

It&#39;s a full-page ad that says, Stand firm. For health and safety reasons, the answer on the landfill dig just has to be no. And this is on the heels of her continual opposition to searching a landfill for the remains of two Indigenous women believed to have been murdered by an alleged serial killer in that landfill. is where their remains are suspected to be. The Manitoba PCs have said for a while, they&#39;ve been mealy-mouthed about it and then firmly know about it, that this is not what we want to do. They faced protests in Winnipeg over the summer. But now, Carter, taking out an ad campaign, digital billboards that we have seen in Winnipeg, we see the full-page ad, we see digital ads about this particular thing. Carter, I&#39;m going to go back to the same two questions. Do you see the strategy here, and is this a good strategy? Start us off with that, and then I&#39;ve got a third question on this particular one that I want to ask.</span>

There&#39;s another group of people, and I would generally count myself in it, that says, like, you know, that&#39;s not the point. Or maybe even that is the point. Like, it&#39;s a lot of expense and effort, but we will go through hell and back for justice. You know, evidence that can strengthen the case, whatever. Justice includes closure.

            <span class="text">could this be something that has a longer term lingering effect this is almost taking words out of your mouths from the from the previous segment right maybe akin to a barbaric cultural practices where if you&#39;re a a political observer, you know, you could go be like 2015 Harper campaign, like you could pretty easily do that. Do you feel like stand firm, the landfill dig, if the PCs lose here, this could have significantly longer term effects for a party here? Or do you feel like we are in a very different sort of cultural political space, that you do whatever it is to get elected, if you win, all is forgotten. If you&#39;re lost, there&#39;s no lingering side effects. You just come back four four years later, as a new thing. Talk to me about that. And I&#39;m not saying this is a perfect comparison, because we don&#39;t even, we&#39;re not even at Tuesday yet. We don&#39;t even know the outcome. We don&#39;t even, to Corey&#39;s point, we&#39;re not even on the ground. So I&#39;m now kind of trying to take this and maybe use it as an example to talk about this broader concept of lingering effects. Give me your thoughts on that first, Carter, and then you, Corey.</span>

And then I would have some showy PR pieces in downtown Ottawa, downtown Toronto, downtown Vancouver, so people felt the nationalness of it, so that we could then internally talk about how we have a national campaign. I would have a couple of pieces in French coming out as sort of a sustaining PR strategy in the next week or two. So all of a sudden in downtown Montreal, we&#39;re talking a bit about this now obviously the challenge there is they don&#39;t really use gas at all right uh so you&#39;re going to need to kind of create the the local quebec flavor but this is your chance also to just change the creative a little bit and say like this you know ottawa wants to come into our backyards and tell us how to run a provincial industry tell the feds you don&#39;t think ottawa should come into the backyards of provinces and run a provincial industry and run something like that that also puts ottawa on blast a little bit that you are um you are willing to expand and extend this campaign in interesting ways and uh and then yeah then just focus that money in alberta making sure everybody in alberta knows you are trying to uh you know wreck justin trudeau like a cheap pinata carter</span>
