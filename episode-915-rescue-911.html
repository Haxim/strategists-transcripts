Spoiler alert, they&#39;re very banal.</span>

Now, of course, as you know, I will probably be doing one of two things tomorrow. So just if you&#39;re listening to this, if you&#39;re one of the folks that&#39;s come to this podcast because of the Jesperson bump, welcome. You&#39;ll soon understand we don&#39;t care for you all that much. And this is a very self-involved institution about us. So welcome anyways, I guess. Secondly, I just want to let the people know what&#39;s going to happen if they are indeed now going to listen to Jesperson after they&#39;ve heard this. I&#39;m going back and forth on timing. Corey, I see you&#39;re uncomfortable with that. But I think the people can keep up because they&#39;re smart. I will be doing one of two things, which is either aggregating what you two say uh and saying it uh simpler uh or i may just take over the hosting job from ryan because um as you know uh it&#39;s a natural proclivity for me to just just step on toes can</span>

Corey, any part of this you want to pick up on, 10K, 90-year-old man, Wall Street Journal, journal or the content of it which is telling a telecommunications company your internet is shit in a newspaper oh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the um the what what this is the only appropriate use of newspaper advertising this is effectively a dead medium otherwise but it is great for making a statement like this if he had spent ten thousand dollars on internet ads which he would have purchased through at&amp;t and you know he&#39;d probably still be trying to do it because of that slow internet ten thousand dollars of internet ads would not have the effect of dropping this in two papers of record you know the wall street journal and i think there was one in texas he did too so i mean good on him uh for for actually finding a way to lever this up and actually create much more than ten thousand dollars of value think of all the newspaper articles that have been written about this at this point but um you know i i guess this is uh this is a cautionary tale for for anybody who provides a service that is this slow that an old man can can just rake you over the coals like this i am sure verizon&#39;s behind it if we start following the money somebody get bernstein on this uh</span>

Like, oh, that guy, he stuck it to me. That&#39;s a great guy. I should get him on payroll here. But, you know, third point, and probably the more serious of them all, is it really shows you how he&#39;s scraping the bottom of the barrel here. The guy is not somebody anybody wants to work with. He&#39;s still going to manage to get off on this charge here. But that&#39;s only because of the timidness of the Republican Party at this particular moment. But holy cow, I mean, talk about a dreadful performance, even the setup of his legal team. And then his legal team itself has just been just dog shit for the past couple of days.

It&#39;s a question of, can he be impeached? He&#39;s no longer in office. We can&#39;t impeach somebody who&#39;s no longer in office. office.

This was a trial and an argument that was made to the American people. It was made really well. It was compelling television. The inclusion of kind of the AV support, if you will, of the television and the never-before-seen footage. I mean, this is just taking right out of hard copy or whatever the inside edition, right? Like the old school news shows, right? You know, never before, TMZ, I guess. This is the structure of news now, and they nailed it. They absolutely nailed it.</span>

So the main thing here is that Pierre-Paul Rievre is out as the critic for finance as O&#39;Toole shuffles his cabinet. Ed Fast is now the new Tory point person on finances, now having to respond and challenge, more specifically, Christa Freeland on that particular file. So, Carter, let&#39;s talk about this particular political strategy by O&#39;Toole first, and then we&#39;ll expand the conversation slightly to talk about the meaning and the import, and perhaps if we can get into it, the strategy of setting up a shadow cabinet. So, firstly, almost</span>

He has maybe not moved as fast as I would have liked him to, maybe not moved as quickly as we would have expected. But before the election has occurred, he is now putting forward a different face for the Conservative Party. And I think that that is exactly what he needed to do if he&#39;s going to be successful in the coming election.</span>

Do they serve a political or messaging purpose that you feel like is important from your experience and knowledge? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, there&#39;s multiple purposes to a shadow cabinet. One of them is, well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, let&#39;s just start with the most obvious and the simplest. It has to do with your party, right? You are giving your people something to do. You are distributing the workload in a way that makes sense because it&#39;s the way that the work will be presented to you from the government.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right. acts if the government changes. It&#39;s going to be a whole different cast of characters. There will be a lot of considerations. All of a sudden, things like the regionality of it, the ethnic diversity, all of that will come into play much more strongly. But you are ultimately identifying the leaders within your own organization. Part of the reason you both mentioned Pierre Polyev was quote-unquote demoted,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like demoted from what? From critic for one thing, for critic to another?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah. But you are signaling that he has got a voice that is now less important within the conservative party. And that will also tell you a bit about the cabinet making that Aaron O&#39;Toole ultimately gets involved in if he becomes the prime minister. The other thing, though, is that you are signaling something to Canadians, you are allowing one of the benefits of government always has is that they&#39;re the government, you know, talk about the power of incumbency, the fact that you can see them doing these things, because they are doing these things. It&#39;s easy to imagine Justin Trudeau as prime minister, he&#39;s the fucking prime minister. It&#39;s not as easy to imagine Aaron O&#39;Toole being the prime minister he has not had that job but by taking on the trappings of the government by acting as though you were the government and aaron o&#39;toole did this as well by releasing a readout of a conversation with a u.s envoy it is easier for canadians to imagine you to be the government and when they look at your shadow cabinet and they think of it like a cabinet and they say what does this tell me about aaron o&#39;toole it becomes a communications marketing piece as well carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">carter to To that point, I think Corey&#39;s covered a lot of the why do it and the import of it. Talk to us about some of the strategies around setting up a shadow cabinet, around either messaging or marketing or considerations. Is it as similar as setting up a cabinet if you&#39;re a government? Is there other things you can get away with, for example, that you couldn&#39;t if you were government, where you&#39;re having to actually now give people personal responsibilities? Do you have more leeway in a shadow cabinet? You can do more creative, interesting things because there&#39;s no real accountabilities. I&#39;m kind of curious what some of the strategery can look like and how creative one can get and how far they can perhaps push the bounds of thinking when they put together their shadow cabinet.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, at the federal level, it still is a trick because the federal level, you have more members of parliament than you have shadow cabinet positions, right? Right. So at the provincial levels, oftentimes a opposition party won&#39;t will almost not have as many voices as they need to have roles. So you&#39;ll be the shadow minister of X, Y and Z. And so you&#39;ll you&#39;ll be a little bit harder to manage a full, you know, to really dig into one portfolio. You may have to lean on one and and ignore the others a little bit. But at the federal level, your caucus is sufficient that you can actually have a shadow minister for every minister of the government, which kind of prohibits some of the game playing. Because what you really are trying to do, to Corey&#39;s point, is to signal what your government would look like. You know, when the shadow minister stands up and says, I disagree with the government&#39;s decision in this area and we think we should do the X, what they&#39;re really doing is putting forward the alternative government strategy. strategy uh so this is what our government would do but it also does something that cory you know because cory&#39;s points were all bang on i don&#39;t want to reiterate them all i just want</span>

Anything interesting you can do around shadow cabinets that you either can&#39;t do with cabinets if you&#39;re in government or creative things you&#39;d think of that could be applied here to formulating your shadow cabinet?

And this is us planting our flag and saying that this is important. So yeah, you can play with a little bit more. The other thing is, you don&#39;t have a department when you&#39;re a critic, right? That&#39;s an awful lot of work behind the scenes. But it also means you&#39;ve got to take a certain managerial skill set to it. The role of a critic is entirely to attack. So there are different people who will be better suited for those roles. Again, you can consider them for that you might not be comfortable considering considering them for a cabinet position.</span>

Would you do stuff like that, that could kind of mimic what you would lead like? What can he do to showcase to Canadians?

We&#39;ve talked before about the number of correspondence pieces that show up at the premier&#39;s office. And you use that as a metric of, you know, have I really stepped in the hornet&#39;s nest? And I think he did. But I think that this also is showing a pattern, right? So the pattern is do something. things so in alberta parks they were you know offloading and selling a number of different parks um and then they kind of got caught doing it and their first reaction was to say we&#39;re</span>

And then the next week, out trots Sonia Savage saying, we are going to reinstate the 1976 coal policy that Jason Kenney seven days ago said we didn&#39;t even rescind. But now we&#39;re going to reinstate it. And here&#39;s my problem. They&#39;re leaving loopholes all over the place. And the loopholes are, we&#39;re going to rescind, we&#39;re going to reinstate this policy. But if we made any changes during that time, when it was revoked, rescinded, not rescinded, not revoked, then we&#39;re going to allow those changes to go forward.

Or do you feel like the people are like, oh, okay, they did it, and they&#39;ll move on? Because that seems to be the hope, right? They reinstated it, they backed down on parks, we can turn the volume from 11 back to a three, and then they still get what they needed in that interim period. Is this good? And I hate to ask it this way, but despite it being perhaps Machiavellian, And is this a good strategy in your mind?</span>

I wanted to mention that the revoke, rescind thing is hilarious to me. I am, as you know, a recovering bureaucrat. And there is something in government, Alberta has something called the Interpretation Act. And it describes, hey, when you say one thing, it sometimes means other things. And interpretation in this act, repeal includes strike out, revoke, cancel, or rescind. They all mean the exact same things in the world of government. Like that&#39;s not even colloquially</span>

The leaders of the party, of the Wild Rose Party, Danielle Smith and the Wild Rose Caucus, mostly unmasked, walked over to the PCs. And the base, you know, the movement behind it said, we don&#39;t trust them. We don&#39;t trust you. We&#39;re not going anywhere. And so trust can be lethal to a government. Trust can bring down a dynasty, as we have seen here in the home province. That has also been true of the conservative movement federally.

For those who aren&#39;t aware of the idiosyncrasies of Alberta politics, we basically tend to think of it as three regions of roughly equal seat distribution, Calgary, Edmonton, and everywhere else. Edmonton&#39;s a mortal lock for the NDP. They have almost, they have all but one of the seats right now. The rural areas, maybe not as much of a hegemony for the UCP in a future election, but certainly it looks very, very strong. Calgary is going to be a bit of the battleground here. and you can really damage yourself if it looks like you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of giving into views that are seen by most calgarians is pretty kooky now if you want to however look at it the other way from like a party management point of view the the simple reality is there are a disproportionate number of no lockdowners within the ucp and</span>

Jason Kenney needs to think about these things in terms of what he is trying to do. And that means probably coming down to first principles again and saying, all right, a lot of shit is happening. We have caused a lot of this shit to happen. We need to fly the plane first and foremost. We can&#39;t fly into anything. Then we need to figure out how we are going to get to 2023. What is the course we are charting between here and the next election? And once they have that figured out, they need to communicate on that path relentlessly. Right now, the government is not communicating well. They are trying to talk to both the far right and moderates at the same time. And this is the effect we are seeing. They are not flying in one particular direction. They are whipping from one side to the other. And arguably, they&#39;ve got problems with the actual running of the plane that we have seen through all of these things.

With these shipments, we remain on track to receive 20 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna this spring. Stephen Carter, we&#39;ve talked about expectation setting. We&#39;ve talked about about the liberals, issues, management, woes, not just on this vaccine file, but historically. What do you make of that communication?

But what Justin Trudeau is trying to do here is get people focused on that end of March figure, like the end of that quarterly number and the assurances that he has there, because those weekly numbers continue to underwhelm, as I sort of highlighted with my math. And as long as you can get people thinking about the long-term on this, Canada doesn&#39;t look too poorly positioned, and come September, we&#39;ll probably be just</span>

The headline here reads interesting. We know about the tensions that have surrounded Trudeau and Modi in the past, and Trudeau and the Indian government more largely, I should say, to be clear. It&#39;s interesting that a Western country would be looking to India. There&#39;s that sort of brand play here. I&#39;m just kind of curious, what&#39;s a conversation or a headline like this means for the Trudeau government, perhaps even as an extension to the COVAX conversation, where you&#39;re thinking about the Trudeau government taking from, you know, developing countries for our own domestic supply. Now you see India, which, you know, is an economic, you know, upswing in many ways historically. But it seems like a weird headline to read if you&#39;re reading it here domestically, which is why I kind of wanted to bring it to your attention and just get your gut feel on what you guys thought of it. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And, you know, this is one of these things that perhaps we all need to update our priors a bit on. People tend to, people my age, so if you&#39;re around 40 years old, you think of India as what India was like in the 1990s, right? right? And India was a developing nation, quite a few steps behind many of the other nations in the region. You know, China and India were in a totally different kind of economic paradigm in those moments. Both have become much more economically significant players. India is a fascinating country because, you know, there is extreme wealth and extreme poverty. But when you go to urban centers in India, they&#39;re crowded</span>

            <span class="text">crowded and there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s culturally a bit different, But they are like any other major developed center. And so you could look at it and be like, from India, we&#39;re Canada. But I think that&#39;s a little bit of</span>

          <div class="turn">

Generally, countries don&#39;t like to think they&#39;re reliant on any country. They certainly don&#39;t want to think they&#39;re reliant on countries they think less of, and there are Canadians who think less of India, at least in terms of the capacity and the economy, right?

Any gut feelings you have, mainly from the lens of political brand and political history with India? I think, Corey, you did a good job covering kind of some of the assumptions people might make. But the impact on political brand and the political history Trudeau has had with India, Carter, anything you feel like could be interesting or perhaps red flags from what you see, or even yellow flags, so to speak?</span>
