He&#39;s going to have the most people who are at the state convention, which means he gets to pick a few more delegates. He&#39;s likely moved Nevada into an effective tie. He may even, at the end of the day, win Nevada depending on how things go. So that&#39;s because he had the organization to back it up. He didn&#39;t just leave town and walk out of town.</div>

          <div class="said">But Donald Trump has notoriously little organization. And some of these Republican states, they all have very different rules. This is something I&#39;ve touched on a lot of times. Some of them are electing the delegates right there on the ballot or some basic form of that. Some of them are essentially just assigned. But some of them, like in Louisiana, are chosen at a later date. So who&#39;s the actual delegate once you&#39;ve got those spots? And Donald Trump could not fill all of his delegate spots. he was not able to pack it up after the primary and so ted cruz i believe ended up winning louisiana after donald trump won louisiana by a fair bit so i this is going to be a problem for him going forward and i think those republican states that do have those kind of rules that allow you to select the candidates after the fact through different means even if they&#39;re bound to trump on the first ballot i don&#39;t know how many people think this is just going one ballot now It</div>
