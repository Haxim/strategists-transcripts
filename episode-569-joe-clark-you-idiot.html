          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i think now we&#39;re in the situation where we have to prognosticate tomorrow but you do not have to it does not look good for him in wisconsin and i think maybe that could be the start of a very bad slide for him the fact is with the republican system being as it is with winner takes all and whatnot yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe but on the other hand how many days have we sat here and said yeah maybe and you know what he&#39;s even had some bad days i think the problem for him is less even his primaries because let&#39;s face it he&#39;s still going to win quite a few as they go into the northeast corridor here or or at least he&#39;s well positioned to i think the problem is that he can&#39;t he can&#39;t actually back it up so you heard about louisiana where he won the primary and he&#39;s not going to have the the most delegates because he couldn&#39;t get his act together at the convention that followed so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i think what we&#39;re seeing is some of the weaknesses of trump becoming very apparent i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i don&#39;t think many people know about that and and what that could lead to do you mind for a second core explaining what that looks like in terms of when you say backing it up just just on a very high level yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah well and i think it&#39;s actually uh almost a segue into what happened last weekend and nevada too between uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">actually it was a saturday i seem to recall so even though he uh he lost the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the number of delegates elected because his supporters are so much more enthusiastic they They actually showed up at the county-level conventions. He&#39;s going to have the most people who are at the state convention, which means he gets to pick a few more delegates. He&#39;s likely moved Nevada into an effective tie. He may even, at the end of the day, win Nevada depending on how things go. So that&#39;s because he had the organization to back it up. He didn&#39;t just leave town and walk out of town.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Hillary Clinton, maybe she should have and maybe it was smart to because let&#39;s face it. She&#39;s quite far ahead and she&#39;s probably not going to be in a situation where she&#39;s right down to the wire. Right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But Donald Trump has notoriously little organization. And some of these Republican states, they all have very different rules. This is something I&#39;ve touched on a lot of times. Some of them are electing the delegates right there on the ballot or some basic form of that. Some of them are essentially just assigned. But some of them, like in Louisiana, are chosen at a later date. So who&#39;s the actual delegate once you&#39;ve got those spots? And Donald Trump could not fill all of his delegate spots. he was not able to pack it up after the primary and so ted cruz i believe ended up winning louisiana after donald trump won louisiana by a fair bit so i this is going to be a problem for him going forward and i think those republican states that do have those kind of rules that allow you to select the candidates after the fact through different means even if they&#39;re bound to trump on the first ballot i don&#39;t know how many people think this is just going one ballot now It</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, they are. But Corey&#39;s pointed out the wheels weren&#39;t always there.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It was a giant bubble. It&#39;s been make-believe almost from the beginning. Because his campaign isn&#39;t a campaign as we&#39;re used to seeing them.</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? So you&#39;d build ground construction of polling captains or people who are responsible for getting out the vote or managing a specific process.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">All of that is ground game. And then you&#39;d work on your messaging structure. How do you get into the media? How do you get these macro messages out into the zeitgeist? That&#39;s air game.</span>

You sent a tweet that I assume you did to rile me up because if you believed in it, you&#39;re an idiot. And the tweet was fundamentally somebody saying out there, well, Sanders needs to win 57% of the delegates going forward. And if he needs to – if he wants to move that number to 56, he needs to win Wisconsin by 48 points.</span>

So let&#39;s actually look at what&#39;s happened in the past couple of weeks here. And it is, well, everybody expected that Sanders was going to do well in these caucus states in the Northwest. They did not expect him to do this well. And that 57% number is kind of funny because it was like 59%, or pretty close to it not too long ago. go it is moving down and sanders is making some pretty incredible ground up now i want to be clear</span>

If that proves not to be the case, and if it proves to be the case that Sanders actually outperforms the polls, even by a couple of points, and that&#39;s the key here.

And the argument is that we&#39;re currently – if we didn&#39;t put 50% into those private schools, many of those students would flood back into the public system and it would cost us 100% of the dollars. We&#39;re actually saving money by funding private schools.</span>
