That&#39;s a problem for them but that&#39;s also a problem for the new democrats because you want to know who goes off script worse than anybody who&#39;s a government employee in the communications department it&#39;s the guys who used to be commentators and reporters and and they&#39;ve created themselves a bit of a time bomb with six i think maybe even seven people right now who have come from a universe of being able to say what they want when they want and and that are frankly very cozy with the rest of the the media.
