We&#39;ve discussed this multiple times on this show. We always need a fourth. And in this case, we&#39;re adding frustrating to the mix. Stephen Carter, for the uninitiated, here&#39;s how this works. I will go through a list of things that I find fascinating from a Canadian political strategy level. It could be policies introduced at a cabinet retreat, for example, or it could be appointments made to the Senate, or it could be videos put out and then retracted by certain political parties. I will go through all of these, and I&#39;ll name you the party in question, and I&#39;ll ask you, is this fine for them? Is this fabulous? Is this frustrating, or is this fucked, so to speak?

            <span class="text">Yeah, the Senate that was designed in 1867 to serve as a body of sober second thought, this cooling of the hot tempers of the public that has become this independent group of luminaries, at least that&#39;s the liberal vision of it. There&#39;s now only, I think, a dozen conservative senators, right? There&#39;s quite a few vacancies at this moment. But the Senate has wholesale changed, I guess, in the past decade, right?</span>

It looks like Chuck applied, he put his name in, he threw his name in the hat, and he was selected. We don&#39;t know who the other people were that we&#39;ve selected over. I assume it was, you know, people in prison. But no, you know, this is what happens, right? You can&#39;t pick from a list of the population when really it&#39;s just a list of those people who&#39;ve applied.

            <span class="text">really do think you could make the senate a body of ideas there&#39;s somewhere between partisan hacks and where we have currently where you say actually we just want to put the biggest thinkers uh in politics and and political discourse in the senate and have conversations and and allow Laos. Think of it almost as like a university with tenure, but for political actors, right? Where you say, man, they&#39;re always putting something interesting. Like you could put a person like Michael Chong in the Senate when they&#39;re tired of being an MP, and they would always be additive, right? They are always going to be adding something to the conversation. So I think that maybe that&#39;s the approach I would take. Failing that, if I wanted to re-energize the Senate, I would obviously appoint Keanu Reeves.</span>

At some point, somebody had to download stock imagery that had a bunch of tags on it, and nobody noticed it was like big fighter or anything like that. I&#39;m not even asking them to necessarily know the difference between fighter jets, although you would think that the Conservative Party of Canada would have at least a few people there with the kind of the rah-rah military boosterism that they at least purport to have at their heart, would have understood that, right, as it&#39;s going out.

So I am confused as to how this could have occurred in an operation that is purportedly as sophisticated as the Conservatives is. And that was a fairly high polish video, right? So it seems it&#39;s confusing to me it occurred. And I think it might show a certain complacency, a certain laziness, certain we&#39;ve done, you know, these videos and they&#39;ve been so popular, we&#39;ve stopped doing the very foundational checks on it and they got burned for it. But I am confused how it happened in the first place, because this has been a big deal so many times. Carter,</span>

So people, to Corey&#39;s point, did the internet sleuthing and did the simple reverse image searches of stock video. What is your take, Carter, on modern day stock video that you can easily get from And I&#39;ll get a little bit into the details here that you can easily get from a royalty-free or a very minimal pay-per-use sort of site to generate these quick hit</span>

As video is becoming an even more needed, volumous, not a special occasion tool, but you kind of need it every day, political parties, practitioners are having to turn to these modes to procure. and often as practitioners you guys may also agree with this that you can&#39;t usually find stock footage of someone in canada making sure it&#39;s exactly the same like you know there&#39;s limitations so i i also want to acknowledge that from a practitioner&#39;s perspective and get your thoughts on this carter as video becomes even more voluminous what do you think of stock image is this gonna become forgivable one of those things that people are like whatever as long as it helps He tells a story where this is going to have diminishing returns of people soothing this, and parties will ultimately be like, ah, fuck it. Who cares if this is a mountain from Indonesia? We&#39;re just here to tell a story, and we put out a video every day. So we&#39;re going to put out another one tomorrow, so you can go fuck yourself sort of thing. Are we going to get to that point?</span>

I mean, at one point, it was really high end to have a photograph, you know, Ken Burden style, and it was moving across the screen. Now you can find stock video for just about any circumstance. But the problem is that virtually any circumstance is generally not your specific circumstance.

            <span class="text">you go through those things and i think where the conservative one failed and you did make me realize something as we were talking here steven maybe a way that this did happen um but you want to go through and say okay it would one of these stock images potentially offend people because of its stock nature and i think that the fighter jets isn&#39;t pretty obvious oh yeah but when you search for these various terms quite often even if it&#39;s not alberta people know you&#39;re looking for images potentially of anywhere on the plains right and so they will tag a picture that was taken in montana with alberta north dakota saskatchewan they want to sell their piece because they want to because they want to sell it and so and they get to pick what the tags are so if you&#39;re just very quickly like searching and and putting tags in and and saying fighter jets canada well that might actually have been what this was tagged with and somebody got really really sloppy and didn&#39;t necessarily look at that again baffling</span>

And I&#39;m wondering if fuck it, we don&#39;t care is like perhaps like the new sort of where we&#39;re headed to some of this stuff, when you have to put out the volume of content that political parties have to put out. Yes, they got burnt this time, no doubt about it. It was not the right strategic call, right?</span>

How would you have dealt with this from a creative perspective? I&#39;m just curious to get both of your takes being like, let&#39;s just say what the creative you had was what you had. What would you do? I just kind of think it through for me. Just give me some some tips, how you&#39;ve done it in the past, and you in particular, Corey, you know, working within government and in large communications, Bureau Carter, any thoughts here, and then we&#39;ll move it on.</span>

As you&#39;re going along there and, and occasionally you have to make sacrifices, right? You say, man, I really want a shot that looks like this. Well, to get that shot with drones right now, not possible. And Hey, we can&#39;t get stock imagery because the Canadian air force doesn&#39;t allow that stuff to be used for stock imagery. It&#39;s only for editorial. What we don&#39;t even know that could be another component here. That&#39;s true. That&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Like what&#39;s a proxy that&#39;s just military, right? Yeah. um and if you can&#39;t get that shot i find sometimes i&#39;m certainly guilty of this myself like you&#39;re so you didn&#39;t get the shot you wanted and so you&#39;re searching for stock to get something that basically has the same feeling and you don&#39;t find it and you try to force it and it no longer actually works when you should say okay well what are the words is there another way we can visualize this is there another way we can say this and i think in this case there would have been a number of of options for them the the still with the moving still like the ken burn style sticks out pretty heavily if everything else is video i will say so you know you&#39;ve got to think about that in the context of the construction of your video but it would have not taken very much of anything for somebody to go and like i can&#39;t remember the specifics of the video at that moment but you could get a panning shot of department of national defense headquarters right where it&#39;s looking at at the sign you could there&#39;s a lot you could do that would be pretty low cost and low effort and send somebody out with an iphone versus being stuck with stock of that nature so there are choices but i think the main one is just to step back what&#39;s the sentiment you&#39;re trying to push if you can&#39;t get the words to match the image exactly go to something more thematic and if you can&#39;t get that well then you just got to go with something entirely different or maybe you make those words, part of the last image, and you make your next cut before the next image.</span>

And so you&#39;ve got a bit of a protectionist rationale there, but it seems clearly at odds with the environmental rationale that the liberals have as well, right? And I think that&#39;s going to be a challenge in any jurisdiction that&#39;s looking at Chinese EVs because, I mean, I&#39;ve never actually driven one, but some of them look fairly impressive. Certainly, we&#39;re all familiar with BYD, which is one of the big manufacturers in China, being able to build these vehicles that started at one point as knockoffs, but now look better than the vehicles that they&#39;re knocking off and coming in at way lower prices.

Is it because the previous ones have failed and that announcing another reset and having it fail is not what they need rather than just doing shit? Like, this announcement, like this political conventional wisdom of announcing a reset, right?</span>

Why the fuck do we still have political parties announce they&#39;re doing a reset rather than just reset? And so I&#39;m kind of curious, like, from your perspective, because the actions might be the same, but the announcement of this is a reset is not happening. Your thoughts on that?

            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s interesting. So if what they&#39;re thinking is we just don&#39;t get out there and nobody can get mad at us and nobody can critique our reset, that&#39;s very dangerous. like that&#39;s that&#39;s the most dangerous mindset in politics when you start getting so insular that you you don&#39;t want to hear from other people you don&#39;t want to do things because you think that they&#39;ll just invite criticism you are just hiding that is the most dangerous place to be in politics and it&#39;s so self-defeating and if that&#39;s where they are they just need to quit like they just need to quit everybody who&#39;s got that mindset needs to go do something else it&#39;s a big world politics ain&#39;t that great there are a lot of other things you can do with your life once you get outside of politics but i think that there&#39;s probably some more obvious reasons why they wouldn&#39;t be announcing a full reset at this moment one is and we&#39;ve talked about this in the context of as like last year when they did the cabinet shuffle one of the big critiques we had at the time was you only get to do this once right well so they&#39;ve done that they can&#39;t do another cabinet shuffle that looks foolish right they had their uh we&#39;re gonna move this budget uh or we&#39;re gonna going to move public opinion through this budget thing didn&#39;t really work you can&#39;t really keep announcing the same thing over and over again and uh if there is another card to play and i&#39;m of the opinion there&#39;s really only like one if you&#39;re going to keep going and that&#39;s a big big change at the top it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s either a new chief of staff or maybe a new deputy prime minister certainly there&#39;s been some reporting that uh mark carney might be in the mix for finance and so So maybe that just shuffles things up a little bit.</span>

            <span class="text">sometimes you really want people to feel the change. And I think in politics, quite often, it&#39;s that, right? When you&#39;re looking for change in general, you look for easy change, you look for change you can feel, you look for change you can see. Politicians are pretty addicted to that for the reasons that Stephen said, which is it allows them to shake the etch-a-sketch, get it all clear, and get to draw all sorts of new lines on it, right? And get back to that place where they have the goodwill and the charity to do the things that they want to do. So that&#39;s why you often see them announce the change. It&#39;s It&#39;s because they want everybody to know they&#39;ve changed. They make a show of the change for either internal or external purposes, depending on what&#39;s going on.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you on our next one, which is sticking with this Liberal cabinet retreat. There&#39;s some policy announcements coming out of it, and one fascinating one is around housing. The Liberals are proposing to build 250,000 new homes by 2031 on public lands. They&#39;re actually creating something called the Canada Public Land Bank and have a new public lands for homes plan, which they want to build these 250 quarter of a million homes on properties that they deem surplus, underutilized in the federal government&#39;s vast portfolio. This is something being pushed, not exactly, but, you know, versions of this has been pushed previously in the past, has been certainly pushed by the conservatives as well. Well, fine,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think that this, first of all, this is, in some ways, it&#39;s just a re-announcement of what&#39;s already been announced, with a little bit more specificity, but it&#39;s not talking about it. And it&#39;s also very consistent with saying, what are some of the things that the conservatives are saying that we should do? Let&#39;s just do them. And then we can take it off the table. And I think that Pierre Poliev is doing himself a bit of a disservice trying to find ways to critique it because it&#39;s not the conservative implementation of it, right? So these incredibly long-term leases rather than it being something that you can own outright.</span>

They are a vital part of our economy. But given the strain on the economy that is occurring right now, I think that we have to slow down temporary foreign workers. And we may have to reduce our overall number of immigrants in total. Immigration, I think, is a net benefit to society. I&#39;ve said that a thousand times. But right now, society also needs some housing starts. Ironically, a large portion of those temporary foreign workers and immigrants are working on the problem of actually building us more housing.

            <span class="text">Carter, level of concern. If you&#39;re the B.C. NDP right now, you&#39;re the government, you&#39;ve got Eby, you had Horgan prior too. This was supposed to be pretty straightforward. I&#39;m not going to say it was supposed to be not challenging, but straightforward, I think is perhaps the right term. It&#39;s no longer straightforward. I think that much is clear. The BC Conservatives were not supposed to be your principal opponent. They are, and they&#39;re surging. And the other party, to Corey&#39;s point, is near a collapse. Where are you on the panic scale between 1 to 10?</span>

            <span class="text">Oh, I&#39;m pretty panicked. I&#39;m probably at least at least a plus on the panic level right now, because you have to realize that if an election comes down to change versus more of the same, if the change has multiple options, it changes your number that you&#39;re going to need to achieve. achieve this is now a single option change has so you need to get 50 plus one and that&#39;s just not going to happen if you&#39;re the bc ndp right now so 50 plus one is off the table and uh the bc conservatives look like they are are the ones tracking towards it so this change election becomes really really difficult for uh the bc ndp and</span>
