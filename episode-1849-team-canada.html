Does anybody know a thing about those budgets? Does anybody care? No. Everything has been absolutely pushed off the front pages by this madness of the day we&#39;ve got with Donald Trump, where we got a tariff. No, the tariff&#39;s coming in a month. No, we got a tariff, but we&#39;re going to exempt a bunch of things. Okay, but we&#39;re actually maybe going to make it not apply to anything under the free trade agreement, which is not everything. It&#39;s about half of everything, apparently. But yeah,</span>

That doesn&#39;t happen. These things are really dependent on the stakes being high enough to drive people&#39;s attention and drive people&#39;s interest. And actually, Stephen made this point a couple of episodes ago, where people were saying, oh, I kind of like that Justin Trudeau. And you said, Carter, it&#39;s the same fucking Trudeau. It&#39;s the same Trudeau that we&#39;re always seeing. It&#39;s the same breathless pauses and all of that. Completely agree.

So the prime minister leaving is a catalyst to us changing our minds about him, because now we can start to remember him the way that we remember Jason Kenney or the way that we remember Stephen Harper. We changed the way that we, or even the way that we now remember George W. Bush, right? We changed the way that we remember them, because in the moment we can&#39;t. There&#39;s been no catalyst for changing the way that we think. I think this is a catalytic moment and the prime minister is taking advantage of it, which I think is good for his long term legacy. But I don&#39;t think that this opportunity would have presented itself in the same fashion if he hadn&#39;t had the moment of I&#39;m leaving first. It&#39;s a lot easier to love someone on the way out the door. Corey</span>

He fundamentally doesn&#39;t understand how tariffs work. He doesn&#39;t understand how the impact is going to happen. So it doesn&#39;t matter the envoys that are sent down to them. and daniel smith may have discovered that in the last week but that doesn&#39;t mean that she clearly understands what&#39;s actually happening and and in regards to your doug ford thing your doug ford idea that he should be in charge you could not be more right sir you could not be more correct i i i love it i love it i think that&#39;s the best thing so you&#39;re right and wrong all you know thanks for giving him the chance to be right and wrong zane that that&#39;s very kind of you i</span>

            <span class="text">I mean I think you know the answer they cannot feel like they found where they&#39;re going to go the question the the spot you were talking about with like the four different attacks on Carney depends on how you measure the attacks but you&#39;re right there was four that was a 15 second spot like that&#39;s a different hit every couple of seconds they are they are throwing spaghetti at the wall in a way i&#39;ve actually not seen a professional political party do in a very long time and you can tell that they um that</span>

            <span class="text">that they think that they&#39;ve got like so many options but the reality is a lot of them feel super weak to me and i suspect if you market tested them you&#39;d think like canadians don&#39;t actually see carney as weak for example Like, does anybody think the guy who was Harper&#39;s Bank of Canada governor who did Brexit, like, is weak the word that comes to mind there?

            <span class="text">And so, but the challenge is I can&#39;t even call this message testing because message testing requires you to test individual messages so you can disaggregate the effect. fact it&#39;s like running not one 15 second spot with four messages but four 15 second spots probably online looking at the click-through rates focus grouping them trying to see what was resonating what was not and it just feels weak</span>

Obviously, he&#39;s not the one giving the throne speech, but it&#39;s a chance. or it&#39;s game on. Like it&#39;s just an election. I think where he might get himself into trouble, if it looks like he&#39;s using the power of the government to prop him up politically. And so you could imagine, for example, the government of Canada paying for a televised address that starts to feel like a campaign speech if the tone is not pitch perfect.

            <span class="text">my concern there is higher based on some of the reporting in the Globe and Mail that it looks like Trudeau is going to appoint a bunch of people, fill a bunch of positions on his way out the door. Look, politicians do this before elections. There&#39;s no doubt about that. But the fundamental difference here is they&#39;re trying to turn the page on the Trudeau era. And so in Canada, there&#39;s a comp in 1984 when Trudeau, the senior left he left a pile of like appointments for you know Turner effectively to give and everybody remembers the of a certain age remembers that you had no option moment in the 1984 debate that was about those kinds of appointments those kinds of appointments hit differently when you&#39;re trying to do the switch of the leader because it looks like too much continuity so between the appointments and if you were to use the trappings of the office I think you would just have you</span>

I think Carney wants to say, this is fresh, this is new, this is different.

If Keto Maggie is to be believed, and some would argue, in Main Street polling, you know, it&#39;s much closer, I think, than people think it is.

            <span class="text">it&#39;s always possible. But I think the worst polling we&#39;ve seen for Carney still shows him winning by the third ballot. And that&#39;s because Bayless has to go off with relatively insignificant numbers of votes before you get to gold. But for both freelance supporters and gold supporters, Carney is the number two choice by like 80,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">80, 90% based on this polling. So, and Carney has a pretty solid lead in those polls, you know, 10 to 15 points. I think it&#39;s not likely Carney&#39;s going to lose this thing. And I still wouldn&#39;t discount a blowout, but point systems to Carter&#39;s point are unpredictable.</span>

I&#39;m going to outline the assignment and then I&#39;m going to ask you one other question. The assignment was to come up with a pun better than terrific, which, of course, our title sponsor, Flair Airlines, have come up with. And then to give us a limerick, a wide berth on what the limerick is about. Before that, Stephen Carter, overrated or underrated, because we do this for you and we make it real every single time.

            <span class="text">Overrated. I think that most people people thought that these things were in place already. This is a government that is flailing to make its legacy the things that it actually achieved instead of its legacy being the last moments of incompetence and the resignation of the prime minister against his will. These won&#39;t be the legacy elements. They won&#39;t be the things that people think about, and I just think that they&#39;re completely underrated.</span>

            <span class="text">Alberta for sure and Ontario, a little squeamish, but like agreement in principle. But I don&#39;t think it helps the Conservatives if this issue is back in the headlines, if we&#39;re talking about childcare again, because it is quite popular with many demographics, including the one I&#39;m in, right? Like it&#39;s a lot of money to people. And if you start to feel like that&#39;s at risk during the election, well, I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s what the election&#39;s about.</span>
