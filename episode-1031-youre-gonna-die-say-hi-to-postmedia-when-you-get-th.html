            <span class="text">This comes after Doug Ford&#39;s government in Ontario announced plans to allow more medical procedures to be done by for-profit health care providers. That&#39;s a move that&#39;s worth noting Prime Minister Trudeau has called innovative, according to the Toronto Star. So I want to dive into this broader issue of privatizing health care from the strategy perspective. active. Healthcare, it&#39;s always such a conundrum for provinces. It&#39;s a big beast and it&#39;s not normal times, right? We&#39;ve had almost three years of COVID, crises in hospitals, staff shortages, et cetera, et cetera. So Carter, let&#39;s start with you. Is allowing medical procedures to be done by private healthcare providers, is this a good strategy in Canada?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, it&#39;s done every day in Canada. If you go to your doctor, you&#39;re going to a private medical corporation. If you go and see a surgeon, you&#39;re going to see a private medical corporation. There are a few doctors that are on, you</span>

I can&#39;t remember the exact three-letter acronym, but there are a few doctors that are on that, but most of them aren&#39;t, right? So if you go to any clinic, if you go to your doctor&#39;s office, if you, you know, the walk-in clinics, you are going to privatize health care. If you go to a hospital and you are seen by a specialist, you are experiencing private health care. This idea of public versus private delivery, we have in the Canada Health Act, it is determined that we should have public administration. It does not say anywhere in the Canada Health Act that the delivery needs to be by some sort of public entity. And in fact, anywhere you go in the country, you will find private service delivering our public health care system. That is the nature of the game. It is unfortunate that we have not used it to inspire competition, but instead we have used it to reduce competition, which I think is one of the big mistakes. If you really wanted to do privatized health care properly, you would have health care organizations competing with one another, right? So when you go to get your eye surgery, there would be a competition competition because the technology changed and made it so much easier to do eye surgeries, but we kept the prices the same, right? Because we didn&#39;t have competition in the system to actually drive down the actual prices. Now, part of that no competition is because the doctor&#39;s unions or the doctor&#39;s associations, the AMAs of the world, are</span>

I would imagine that we&#39;ll probably wind up bailing out more private operators as we move through this. But there was no reduction in the amount of private care. All it is is a difference in how much private rhetoric there is. And rhetoric doesn&#39;t make our healthcare system better. If you want our system to be better, I&#39;m fine. If you want to actually remove private care, then you&#39;re going to have a battle with the doctors like we&#39;ve never ever seen. Because the doctors want to be private enterprises.

There&#39;s a lot of private interest in health care. When we go out and we buy bandages, we put them out to RFP, and if the price of bandages has gone down, we pay less. When we talk about custodial services, we&#39;ve seen all sorts of C-sign back and forth between what is done with public employees versus what is done with private sector. And when we talk about doctors, maybe not physicians directly, but there&#39;s reverse auctions for lots of things here. What I think really frustrates me is that people</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s actually pretty good for private health care, right? You find those efficiencies of scales. You get business people thinking about how they&#39;re going to deliver it. You reverse auction those services. You get it as cheap as possible. MRIs, x-rays, those come to mind pretty immediately. There was a time when it required a lot of expertise and a lot of time, and so you were stuck paying big bills.</span>

Diagnostic medicine. What&#39;s wrong with you? Well, I can make a diagnosis in five minutes and make X dollars or I can make a diagnosis in 20 minutes and I&#39;m only going to make a third of that.

And frankly, this is my point, we&#39;ve got to have a more honest conversation about healthcare, but that begins by saying healthcare is not just healthcare, healthcare is a million things. And some of them we need to treat differently than other parts of it to keep the system intact, but also to keep the system sustainable. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, you don&#39;t have it before an election. And so what makes sense about what the NDP is doing is they&#39;re latching on to something very real in the Canadian psyche, which is an anxiety about creeping privatization of health care. And we have this like crazy negative example just south of us. I mean, what&#39;s so funny about this continent is we have in Canada like an insanely extreme example of public delivery. Like we lock you out of the system if you&#39;re not fully in on public. And in the United States, we have this insane example of private where if you don&#39;t have the money, you&#39;re going to die, right? Like we just – we will not pick you up no matter what happens. But most of the world doesn&#39;t act like either of our systems, right? You&#39;ve got French model. You&#39;ve got the UK model. You&#39;ve got the German model, just to name a couple of countries that could be considered peers, that can allow for more interplay here. But because we share a continent with this insane country, any privatization is seen as very scary. So the NDP knows that, and the NDP has latched on to that. And the NDP has decided to take the position that they&#39;re going to use the specter of private health care. And I don&#39;t blame them. I think it&#39;s pretty smart politics because the conversation I talked about, even if it&#39;s what I thought the conversation was that the UCP wanted to have, And I don&#39;t actually believe that&#39;s what they&#39;re driving towards here. That takes years or decades even. Like, that&#39;s a long lead conversation. And that requires a certain amount of public education and an investment in it. And also putting aside the political cheap points for a couple of years, maybe right after being elected, now is not the time for that conversation.</span>

            <span class="text">know we used to call i mean back in 2000 when i was working with joe clark we called healthcare the third rail of canadian politics and it remains the third rail you touch it and you die um you know the the only only reason that the UCP is touching it now is that they believe the majority of Albertans are on their side, right? They believe in privatization. They think that most Albertans believe in private health care, or in certain elements, at least being delivered privately, to Corey&#39;s point.</span>

And people are so unaware of what happens within the system. They&#39;re so unaware of our bodies and how we actually die and what the processes are that it doesn&#39;t really matter how good you think you&#39;re doing. You&#39;re going to wind up with unbelievably complex problems because in healthcare, people die, people get sick, people don&#39;t make it. And anytime that your auntie passes, you&#39;re going to be pretty cranky at the system because we have this mindset today that everybody lives forever. And because everybody lives forever that the death shouldn&#39;t happen and then they you know when skin gets bruised when people are dying they don&#39;t understand that the skin is an organ and the organs are shutting down and people don&#39;t drink water when they&#39;re dying so they look you know they think that they&#39;re getting you</span>

            <span class="text">We had a plan in 2011, and the plan was to do the family care clinic. And the family care clinic model was going to be designed to give people confidence again, confidence within the system. Because I think that the greatest problem that people have is that they, if you ask ask anybody, how was your experience within the healthcare system? They will tell you it was great because most of the time they have a great, a great interaction with the healthcare system, especially if you&#39;re very sick. If you&#39;re very sick in Canada, we will take unbelievably good care of you.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">in our system, because we don&#39;t charge you for it, in order to make sure that there&#39;s not, like, an incredible demand on everything, we don&#39;t charge you money. We charge you time. We ration you through time. You think that you need this hip replacement. Nobody else agrees with you. Well, you&#39;re going to be on a list for 12 months, right? You think that you need to go to the emergency room. Triage has decided you&#39;re actually fine. You&#39;re going to be in the waiting room for 14 hours. And, yeah, should it be 14 hours? No. Right. But but we we intentionally and through design use time to reduce demand on the system because the alternative is there&#39;s just far too much demand and far more than is warranted by sort of the medical underpinnings of it all. So it&#39;s complicated, right? Like all systems have to deal with scarcity. And the way we deal with scarcity in the Canadian system is if, to Carter&#39;s point, if you really need it, hey, guess what? You&#39;re at the front of the line. You&#39;re there. We&#39;re going to take care of you. If we don&#39;t think you necessarily really need it, we&#39;re going to make you wait a bit. challenge being doctors</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? We&#39;re not different from the rest. If you&#39;re listening from somewhere else in this country, you might think like, well, Albertans probably want private health care. We don&#39;t. We don&#39;t. And the polling shows that. And in fact, if you ask Albertans who you trust to run the health care system, they&#39;re going to tell you the NDP. And in part, that&#39;s because of the NDP&#39;s strong opposition to private health care. So what I think is interesting about the UCP&#39;s approach here and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and probably fundamentally dangerous is we often have talked about the risk of the NDP running into the UCP&#39;s message box, talking about oil and gas too much.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The UCP can make the same mistake, and they appear to be making the same mistake. Elevating the importance of health care and elevating a conversation about health care based on everything we know about public opinion does, to me, seem to play into the NDP. Like, if you make the ballot question about health care, they&#39;re not going to say, good job, Danielle. They&#39;re going to say, well, we better put Rachel Notley in charge.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I do. I mean, I think that, you know, in terms of messaging opportunities, the NDP has a much stronger position. I do think that the NDP&#39;s rather simplistic say no to privatized health care is the right position to be taking. Corey&#39;s not wrong in that. I mean, first of all, it&#39;s a much simpler message. I just think they have no leg to stand on because they haven&#39;t really, you know, taken care of the lack of, you know, the privatization that existed in the market before. but i think that you know the ucp the the primary problem with the ucp and danielle smith is that danielle smith thinks that people think like her and the ucp think that people think like her and that means that they think in their circles private health care is great private health care will help deliver will solve all the world&#39;s problems and so they they they jump in thinking well albertans agree with us and to cory&#39;s point they don&#39;t albertans are actually pretty reluctant to just, you know, rubber stamp privatized care. In fact, one of the only really great protests we&#39;ve ever had in in Alberta history, in my recollection, and others may remember differently, was the Bill 13 protests when Ralph Klein was bringing in the opportunity for more privatization in health care. So I think, I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that Danielle has to be very careful what what she&#39;s pushing, what she&#39;s pushing for, because she could find herself, to Corey&#39;s point, really on the wrong side of a significant issue that people vote on. People do vote on health care. We&#39;ve seen it a number of times. In fact, it was one of the reasons I think that we beat Gary Maher. Gary Maher was far more for private health care in 2011. We beat the shit out of him. And ultimately, Alison Redford became the premier.</span>

            <span class="text">think that politicians forget that. And the UCP often forgets that people care about this and it shouldn&#39;t be messed with or it&#39;s messed with with peril to Stevens like third rail point. And the NDP sometimes forgets and starts talking about other issues that have much less resonance with the general public. But these are the things, you know, the famous line in 92 in the election with Clinton was, it&#39;s the economy, stupid.</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s a very American answer to that. But I would argue that in the past 30 years in Canada, it&#39;s health care, stupid, has probably been as resonant in elections, at least on the provincial level.</span>

In 1997, he was in his heyday. He&#39;d done all the things that he promised to do. And he had a boom and he started to spend money. But he also wanted to curtail health care spending because at that time, I&#39;m not sure where health care, it was Bill 11, actually, not Bill 13. I just always assumed it was an unlucky number. uh i&#39;m remembering now that bill 11 is cory&#39;s uh unlucky number um but what happened was they were bringing in i don&#39;t remember the specifics of the bill in terms of what it would privatize but it basically opened the door it wasn&#39;t a specific this is what we&#39;re going to privatize it was an opening of the door to more privatization and the public serve the public service coupled with um concerned</span>

Again, we really dived into that on our Thursday episode. Go get it. Friday, surprise. surprise, no one got fired from Smith&#39;s office. Then it&#39;s Saturday, Smith does her chorus radio show. And she announces on the radio show that the government&#39;s IT department will do its own investigation. They&#39;ll probe staff emails. She says there&#39;s 34 staff members in her office, 400 crown prosecutors. So this will take a few days. Also on Saturday, there&#39;s an emergency caucus meeting and surprise, there&#39;s no leaks out of it. Then</span>

            <span class="text">Then it&#39;s Sunday, some MLAs are in Calgary for Lunar New Year celebrations, including Brian Jean, who tells Global Premier Smith has the support of caucus. Then it&#39;s Monday, yesterday, the results of the investigation are already ready. Surprise! Almost 1 million incoming, outgoing, and deleted emails were reviewed, and the province says there&#39;s no evidence of emails between Crown prosecutors and the Premier&#39;s office. So that&#39;s my quick recap. Lots going on here. Where do we start? You guys aren&#39;t pundits, you&#39;re strategists. So let&#39;s dive into the announcement on Saturday that there would be this investigation. I know some people looked at it as this is Smith buying time. She&#39;s trying to buy herself a few more days to figure out what to do here because she doesn&#39;t want to get rid of a a senior staff member. Corey, let&#39;s start with you.</span>

            <span class="text">What did you see as the strategy here with the investigation? And I guess, do you think it was a good move?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s a lot to unpack. Some of it she did well, like just from a strategy point of view, and some of it I worry for her that she just kicked the can down the road and it&#39;s going to come back and haunt her, right? Let&#39;s Let&#39;s just start with some of the basic messaging around it here, which I can kind of sort of immediately discount is probably not super durable. The idea that you searched a million emails in two days, here&#39;s the thing. This is such a funny one because in a way that investigation should take five minutes, right? You just do a simple log query, has this person emailed that person, right? Like any competent IT professional could do that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So in some ways, like two days is way more time than you need. But if you&#39;re going to get like deep and forensic and start looking at all of the angles, then you&#39;re going to need way more than two days, right? You talk about a million emails. If you did one email a second, that would be 11 and a half days of emails. So that&#39;s not exactly a deep, thorough investigation. They&#39;re clearly like talking about searches at scale and really padding their number there. And I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very durable number for those reasons. Like, you know, all you need is another shoe to drop, an email coming from somewhere else. And all of a sudden, you&#39;re not just back where you were. It&#39;s worse because it starts to look like a cover-up. But things that I think she actually did pretty well on here, first of all, engaging her caucus in this matter. The fact that there were no leaks is one thing, but the fact that she actually got them all together and said this is what&#39;s going on,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">some suspicion just based on the time and all of that, that she must have managed to at least convince them in some way, shape, or form that there was not too much to it. I think that that&#39;s good. like the instinct to bring the people in and not hide from them but say okay well let&#39;s have it out let&#39;s have this conversation let&#39;s not let rumor win the day very smart very smart internal management maybe it was necessary maybe she didn&#39;t have a choice maybe there were calls for it but that&#39;s the kind of thing you would want to see a leader doing with their caucus there and um and then in terms of like where are we right now i don&#39;t know i mean like the cbc kind of putting the proviso of oh but we haven&#39;t seen the email i</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i don&#39;t think we assumed they&#39;d seen the email i I think, in fact, in the Patreon, we were like, well, it doesn&#39;t sound like it. It sounds like they talked to multiple people with firsthand knowledge.</span>

            <span class="text">But that&#39;s starting to get a little bit awkward for CBC, and it&#39;s going to be interesting to see how that plays out. Because they don&#39;t even need to be wrong, right? But now there&#39;s sort of a message track that you&#39;re going to start seeing conservatives follow about, like, you can&#39;t trust CBC. They did this reporting inappropriately. Your mileage will vary on whether that argument works for you. But you now have like a whole other front and one where you&#39;re on the offensive in part because CBC acted with integrity and then said, you know, just for clarity, this is the state of the play here. But let me tell you, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">i want to talk you guys have both um you&#39;ve both you&#39;ve both mentioned it and i think it&#39;s a key piece of this is the um the fact that it was cbc who broke this story um and i want to dive into that a bit more because it comes at a time when and i guess i&#39;m speaking with my former post media reporter had on here, where media continues to be cut and cut and cut. We saw today, J Source reported PostMedia is cutting 11% of its editorial staff. This comes after it was announced last week, 12 Alberta weekly papers would go online. The big old Herald building that at one time had 800 staff members, it&#39;s been sold to U-Haul after 10 years on the market. There&#39;s a tweet I saw this evening about the PostMedia layoffs today from a reporter who said, They actually don&#39;t even know who&#39;s been cut yet. They&#39;re going to find that out tomorrow. And I think that&#39;s like a key piece of this year is that I think some are framing this as CBC versus Smith. Do you guys think the strategy would have been different on Smith&#39;s behalf if it was, say, Western Standard that broke this story or if it was, you know, a Rick Bell that broke this story? How does the fact that it was CBC play into the strategy? Carter, do you want to take first up?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think that, you know, so let&#39;s, I mean, we have to look at the whole media environment. When Corey and I used to work at H&amp;K, we talked an awful lot about the media environment. You know, we used to talk about how 25, you know, less than 25% share wound up with your show being canceled, right? That was Star Trek.</span>

You know, I&#39;m picking up the phone, I&#39;m calling someone, this is an important story, you got to cover this story. You know, that in and of itself is shifting the way that we look at the government, right? It&#39;s actually, I mean, if Danielle Smith was more skilled, she could use something like this to cover off all kinds of other activities. She doesn&#39;t have that experience right now. She&#39;s not skilled enough. And I think that we can see that in different levels of government where they&#39;re using one thing to detract or distract from other issues.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, your question, though, was fundamentally one of strategy. And as we&#39;re prone to do, we ignored it entirely and just lamented the death of the media. But in terms of Smith using this strategy because it&#39;s CBC versus another strategy because it&#39;s various outlets, I think absolutely. I mean CBC is a four-letter word. It&#39;s three letters that are a four-letter word in huge swaths of Alberta. You can just say CBC and there&#39;s this presumption that they&#39;ve done wrong to many people. And I don&#39;t agree with Stephen that this has only hit the right-wing base. I think CBC&#39;s integrity benefits us as a society but hurts them as – unlike these one-off basis because any footnote is seen as weakness or an admission that maybe it&#39;s not the total story. And so when you have all the bravado in the world coming from the premier&#39;s office and they&#39;ve gotten increasingly sure-footed as</span>

            <span class="text">maybe there&#39;s nothing to find. Maybe they&#39;re just convinced nothing will be found as time goes on, right? Right. But you put that against CBC saying, well, yeah, I mean, we talked to a bunch of sources with firsthand knowledge, but we didn&#39;t see it ourselves. And the government is going, oh, there you go. See, look at the damn CBC again. And I think there&#39;s a lot of people who are looking at it and saying, well, they didn&#39;t see the emails. OK, maybe they don&#39;t exist. And so the strategy that she&#39;s playing, I think, A, works in general because of the integrity that CBC is taking to this. And I&#39;m partial. I like the CBC. I do commentary for the CBC and stuff like that. And but I think that it&#39;s doubly effective because it&#39;s the CBC and not post media or the Western Standard.</span>

But it&#39;s tough to measure. And it&#39;s tough to disaggregate unless you&#39;re getting deep polling in there. I don&#39;t think it hurts. I mean, ultimately, so much of what we do should be measured, but is fundamentally based on a sound theory. It&#39;s the theory of communication, which is if you say a message, and</span>
