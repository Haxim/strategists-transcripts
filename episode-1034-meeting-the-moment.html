Hold tight for a couple of weeks. It&#39;s not on shelves yet. So just, I guess, reaction here. And I&#39;m curious if you think the province&#39;s strategy, like, did it work or did it backfire?

            <span class="text">It&#39;s kind of an interesting intersection of politics and policy, and I want you two to weigh in. So stay tuned. So just super briefly, last week, we saw two walkbacks from the federal liberals. one involved amendments to the gun bill which basically removed the most controversial part of it um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">um amendments g4 and g46 would have outlawed currently legal rifles used daily by hunters and sport shooters um polyev is calling this a humiliating climb down and then the second one i&#39;m putting it in this category because i want to chat about both i don&#39;t know maybe you might call it like a extension not a walk back um but it has to do with the the medically assistant uh the the maids sort of stuff. So the Trudeau government is delaying the expansion of medically assisted dying to people with mental illness as their only underlying condition, delaying that until 2024. The federal justice minister told reporters last week they need more time to get this right. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">So two different issues here, very different issues. I want to acknowledge that. But I want to dive into this walkback aspect from the strategy perspective. So in one case, with a maid case it almost feels to me like you had policy that was written like years ahead of its time um and they&#39;re now dealing with the reality of that some could argue on the gun control stuff maybe it was written on the fly and they&#39;re now realizing there was issues that weren&#39;t intended um but cory let&#39;s start with you from from that strategy perspective like let&#39;s dive into walkbacks are they good are they bad are you only allowed a certain number does this show that people writing this legislation are humans and they make mistakes?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">How can I put this? You have a certain amount of time that you can hold on to a position and then be forced to walk back. So like, you&#39;re better to fail fast is what I&#39;m trying to say. Like if you&#39;re the government that&#39;s holding on doggedly in four month stretches and then retreating, you&#39;re not going to be government very long. And you&#39;re certainly not going to be an effective government but you can fail fast as often as you want if it&#39;s like one week oh this is going bad let&#39;s get out of here second week oh this different thing&#39;s going bad let&#39;s get out of here that&#39;s okay and government should be more willing to to walk away from the policies that are deeply unpopular something i always tell crisis communications clients and you know even corporate masters is like do not spend two weeks defending the indefensible there&#39;s this thing that happens everywhere it&#39;s not just in politics it happens in boardrooms across the nation it&#39;s just like i said it&#39;s it&#39;s human nature stuff where you</span>

It&#39;s fine. And not only that, this is something that we saw with the NDP and their defense of the just transition, right? The people were out front. The people were defending where the government was, and then the government took them out at the legs. And that&#39;s one of the critiques that Corey had on the just transition messaging from the NDP. It was right. Again, don&#39;t like admitting that, but it was a right critique. And I think that that&#39;s also the critique now of this backing down on the gun legislation. You&#39;ve had those people out there for four months on the power and politics and the, you know, the, the, the, the, the punditry shows and on Twitter and everybody&#39;s been defending, well, it&#39;s not as far as you think it is. And it should be, you know, we should have control of these guns and blah, blah, blah. And now all of a sudden the, the government has backed away from it and it has taken the legs right out from its most vocal proponents. It may have been the right decision, but if it was the right decision, then it was probably the right decision three weeks ago or three months ago, not the right decision today. and it isn&#39;t pierre pauliev&#39;s humiliating defeat or anything along those lines he&#39;s probably most pissed that he doesn&#39;t have that as an election issue that he can bang on um now it&#39;s gone i mean he&#39;s still gonna bang on it but maybe the government comes up with a better solution</span>

            <span class="text">The guns one is interesting to me, and it&#39;s probably worth digging into more in polling and trying to figure this out. But liberals will always tell you something like 80% of Canadians support gun legislation. And some variant of that was a talking point for a long time, right? As though that was in its own right enough. off but it reminds me a lot of um new coke so new coke was a product brought in to replace old coke in the 80s because um people liked pepsi more pepsi was winning that taste test challenge the original taste test challenge was coming out and there&#39;s a couple of reasons why that was the case one of them is that pepsi is sweeter so if you&#39;re only having a little bit of it maybe you do like it more coke fans will say that they like coke more because it&#39;s not as sweet it&#39;s not as cloying long-term, but that&#39;s not here nor there. The point is Coke said, we&#39;re going to have to change up this very old formula. And so they created just Coke. We call it new Coke now with this new formulation and they brought it to focus groups. And most people were like, yeah, it&#39;s fine. And there was always one or two people in the focus group who just railed against it and talked about how awful it was. And they absolutely hated it. And they would over time poison the entire focus group against the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the formula. And what famously happened at the time is the people running the focus groups told the brass at Coca-Cola, don&#39;t worry about it. It was only one or two people in each focus group. It&#39;s not a big deal. Now, the reason why this is a notorious story in focus group stories is because it actually was quite reflective of what happened in the real world. Most people don&#39;t give a shit about colas, right? They don&#39;t sit there and care about the formulation of them. And the one person who does, because you do not give a shit, you&#39;re like, hey man, whatever. I dust my hands of this. I guess you&#39;re right. I&#39;m not going to sit here and fight with you about whether this is the right formulation for coke and notoriously what happened was population</span>

            <span class="text">population turned against the new coke formula and they had to go back and that&#39;s why it says coca-cola classic on your bottles of coke now and that was at the end like an accidental marketing coup but the thing about guns is this most</span>

And obviously, we&#39;re not in an election right now. But this is a great example of somebody defining the entire focus of the conversation rather than trying to win the conversation. There is no way, as long as we are all debating whether Canada is broken or not, for Justin Trudeau to win. At absolute best, at absolute best, Justin Trudeau, if he could convince 100% of people who are like, wait, is Canada broken, that it wasn&#39;t, he&#39;s managed to convince them that&#39;s not broken which is not a reason to vote for him it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s it&#39;s like it&#39;s the it&#39;s the lamest victory humanly possible and so i i gotta give him top marks this is pretty remarkable how he&#39;s got everybody in the pundit class debating whether our country is broken that&#39;s incredible and and there&#39;s just very little ability for government to win on that turf because anything that goes wrong becomes a proof point that canada is broken The liberals that I see writing tweet threads and long-form opinion pieces about this and why Canada is not broken,</span>

And it was sort of encapsulated in this idea, this idea that people needed, you know, the government needed to work to make life better for Albertans, like that had to be the focus. And it was literally like words on a slide. It was kind of this joint, you know, it was post kind of political direction, okay, now how would the public service sort of make this into a mantra? And like, it was like, Like, this is the concept. This is the concept we&#39;re going towards, right? And then, but never meant to be a slogan. And then all of a sudden, you know, when it came time for us to sort of be putting bundlings together and pitching slogans to the political people for like government, you know, lecterns and things like this.

So the slogan, I think that I&#39;ve come to appreciate the slogan a little bit more, especially after my time in Surrey, because I needed a soundbite that would put the idea into people&#39;s heads of what they were going to get, what it is that they were going to get by choosing the candidate I was pushing.

And quite often, they also confuse values with a slogan, and they they will make some pretty basic values. A slogan about integrity, by the way, that is so classic insider thinking because you assume that everybody sees you as being the one with integrity and your opponent as being the one without integrity.

So that suggests a certain type of experience you&#39;re going to have while you&#39;re on the airplane. plain uh apple famously in the 90s was think different right and even that it&#39;s grammatically would be think differently and so it&#39;s almost like an inside it&#39;s like a joke within the joke there right where they they&#39;re willing to act differently by acting different and it tells you something about them in an economy of words and it evokes something that&#39;s what a slogan does but evoking is the important part there where i think a lot of slogans fall down is they either forget the economy of words and then you end up with a total mouthful and it&#39;s like this big positioning statement or it evokes nothing like some of the examples that steven&#39;s given here and</span>

            <span class="text">So negotiations continue for a new event center in Calgary. These have been happening for years. There was this plan for a mega hybrid arena stadium field house complex in the West Village that was known as is Calgary next? I was a City Hall reporter, actually, when a lot of that chatter was happening around 2017.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">That died. And then there was a deal for an arena in Victoria Park.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">That also died. And then the city recently launched this new event center committee. And Daniel Smith is now premier and seems to be more keen on the idea of subsidizing billionaires and um other people that we&#39;ve had previously um so in terms of what&#39;s new there was a meeting today monday among the new event center committee and basically one of the things reporters picked up on after the scrums when the meeting was done i</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">i think the meeting was behind closed doors um was that the committee is looking at all possible options when it comes to location um so just briefly again for those like not following this or from calgary there&#39;s a long list of reasons why Calgary next was a bad idea from what I remember reporting this story at the time um</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">that that the cost balloons to nearly $2 billion. That was in 2017, and taxpayers would have been on the hook for two-thirds. So, Carter, I know you&#39;ve got some thoughts here. Oh, yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, it&#39;s a dumb idea, Annalise. Thanks for asking. First of all, let me just say I don&#39;t think that the worst idea or the reason for not doing it is actually the creosote. I mean, obviously the creosote&#39;s a problem, But one could argue that using a giant public works project to clean up the creosote might actually be good for Calgary, just throwing it out there. But the challenge is we have a number of areas that are currently under redevelopment. We have the East Village, we have the Rivers District, where we were planning to put the arena in the first place, or in the second place, I guess. We also have the west end of downtown and the entire downtown, which has currently got a 30% occupancy, or vacancy, because no one&#39;s working in these places anymore. more. All of which to say, there&#39;s a lot of problems that you need to solve before you start going up and figuring out the next problem, which is trying to put in an arena in a place that doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense for a whole lot of economic reasons. To me, this is a,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Danielle Smith also has no business being in this discussion. This is not a provincial issue. The province wasn&#39;t involved when we built the Oilers&#39; new facility. That was built by the city of Edmonton. The deal was done by Edmonton. All the province did was allow our MSI funding to be used for the arena. That was it. That funding is really up to the municipality how to allocate. We removed some restrictions and that was it. Why on earth is Rick McIver even sitting on this committee? Why would you see the province of Alberta dropping in people? This is one of those things that you should watch for regardless of where you live. British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, wherever you live, when you&#39;re watching the provincial government taking on municipal responsibilities, it&#39;s because something is happening there that&#39;s not necessarily a good thing. We&#39;re seeing it in the Greenbelt in Ontario, where all of a sudden, Doug Ford is mandating new housing construction. And we&#39;re seeing it here in this arena deal, where Danielle Smith seems to be pushing for a solution that the municipal leaders had rejected for all kinds of valid reasons this is a huge overstep by this provincial government and it doesn&#39;t make any sense at all unless the province is bringing their fucking checkbook well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well sure but even then the province doesn&#39;t get to tell the city how to make a decision the only reason that the city would make a decision like this that would that would favor the billionaires as you eloquently put it it in your opening would be because the province is choosing to fund parts of it um because otherwise the city&#39;s not going to say well we&#39;re not going to you know we&#39;ll be on the hook for whatever whatever promises you made to murray edwards uh danielle it sounds like a great idea how can we pony up uh billions of dollars for for your for your political promises that&#39;s not the way that it works at city hall and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, the Green Line makes sense not for sporting events, but it makes sense for the city. The Green Line and better transit is just a good idea for the city writ large. What happens, though, is the Green Line passes within two or three blocks of the new event center location and the red line which is the north south line also passes within two or three blocks and the um the other line the blue line which is the east west uh lrt is within one stop of the event center um so you have a integrated transit solution to uh for the city of calgary and a large you know a large public gathering space which would be the arena arena um there is no such support none at all um that</span>

Oh, that&#39;s being paid for out of the oil sands. Oh, that&#39;s coming from the entire province. Oh, that&#39;s a good way for Calgary to finally get our fair share of it. The other part is, and we&#39;ve talked about this, the NDP need to run the tables in Calgary. Danielle Smith doesn&#39;t need to pick a winner.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i i think that she&#39;s jumped into a problem that she doesn&#39;t understand and will ultimately backfire on her if a she can&#39;t come to a solution and i think that&#39;s probably the most likely outcome even with a bucket full of cash um the solutions aren&#39;t easy to reach um she can try and blame this all on gondek uh which probably will work given you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the strategy that the uh the liars that on the flames tried um so</span>

            <span class="text">no i mean when we think about where stephen harper landed you know very comparable role. And look, it makes an awful lot of sense. There are clients that come to law firms for all sorts of problems. The one commonality they have if they go to Bennett Jones is they have deep pockets. They&#39;re probably big multinationals. They want people who understand these files. And Jason Kenney is a policy wonk. He will be so good at that job. He&#39;s a super smart guy. I&#39;m so happy whenever somebody leaves politics and has a next act because it seems to get get rarer and rarer. And I, for one, wish him the absolute best.
