        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Trudeau government's "conscious uncoupling" from the WE Charity and give the Alberta government strategy recommendations. Has the WE Charity reached the level of scandal? What should the UCP government do about the energy war room? And why is Stephen so mean to thoughtful listeners who put forward thoughtful questions? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">So, Corey, before we get started on the specifics of this story, talk to me about broadly what goes into creating a political scandal. Because the S-word is now starting to be used around this. by the opposition. But simultaneously, we&#39;ve also got the ethics watchdog now investigating Trudeau, which seems to happen every every 18 months or so, like clockwork. But what goes into this, this cocktail of creating scandals and scandals that perhaps take governments down? I want to talk about that first before we get into the foundation.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, unfortunately, it does feel like you could set your watch to these at this point for the Trudeau government and the ethics Commissioner. A scandal, simply put, is absolutely in the eye of the beholder. It is entirely different. It&#39;s not always of legal foundation, although that&#39;s usually a big part of it. Often there&#39;s some suggestion that a law was broken, whether that law carries jail time or is just the way things are supposed to occur.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">But a scandal can also be an amplified gaffe. It can be something where you have said something that is not illegal, but is deeply offensive to different groups of people or it could be a sex scandal ultimately it&#39;s anything that people in large enough numbers take an affront to and usually what&#39;s pretty foundational to a scandal is a denial by one side as well most of the time right uh where all of a sudden um what&#39;s very common to them is that there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s like a i don&#39;t want to use the word cover-up because i&#39;m not suggesting that&#39;s what it is in this case but um you know the suggestion that there is no scandal is so Though part of there being a scandal a lot of the time, it&#39;s hard to separate the two.</div>

And because there&#39;s nothing wrong, there&#39;s nothing to see, the other side pushes. Now, I will say this, that in today&#39;s society, we&#39;re always looking to add the gate suffix. Everything needs to be a gate. And we&#39;re trying to find a way to make almost everything a scandal. And it&#39;s kind of diminished the real scandals, the true the true pieces of of corruption</div>

          <div class="said">corruption that we used to see. And we used to see a lot more of it, to be honest. Right now, most governments, I think, are relatively scandal free. And that&#39;s one of the reasons that when opposition parties push for a scandal and try and get something going, you know, they do push back pretty hard. And I think the other thing is that scandals ultimately can bring down governments. A real scandal can end a government&#39;s right to govern. And we&#39;ve seen that only</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, Carter said a couple of interesting things here. The first is, you know, real scandals can take down governments. And then the other statement he made was this idea that scandals are often engineered by opposition parties in some ways. So how do you kind of reconcile these two things? Like, as in what is a real scandal and how does this concept of engineering, you know, whether it&#39;s a gaffe to your point, Corey, How do you engineer and elevate that to a scandal if you&#39;re part of the opposition class or the activist class in this case?</div>

I mean, bringing attention to the fact that the Trudeaus agree that youth should be more engaged. Are you suggesting, Mr. Scheer, that you don&#39;t think that you should be more engaged? I mean, this strikes this strikes me as um you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve forgotten what what a conflict of interest actually means which is you know if if i get a piece of work from my wife you know that that looks like a conflict of interest because i&#39;m financially benefiting from her handing something to me uh that type of conflict of interest i think is long ago been done away with we don&#39;t see it very frequently this</div>

There&#39;s a lot of egg on this government&#39;s face for doing it this way. It was a bad choice to do it this way. An open process or, you know, a diffused, you know, type of implementation. This is a big program. And that is probably the piece that I overlooked in our first criticism of it or our first look at it. $900 million is a lot of money. It is a lot of money to give to any enterprise, let alone a social enterprise. Now, this is a big foundation. This is a big organization that manages and moves a lot of money, but still, something like $900 million that you&#39;re going to just turn into a program, it feels to me like we wouldn&#39;t have accepted it if it was handed to a business, unless it was oil and gas, in which case Albertans would have loved it.

Why didn&#39;t they allow it to kind of set in the public mind? It would have been really interesting to watch the Trudeau liberals spend some money, get some support for the program, start to put it out there, and then all of a sudden pull the rug out from under them that this was done improperly, didn&#39;t go through the proper processes. processes, um, that might&#39;ve been a way, like it would have been a bigger scandal if people knew about it and man had, had invested in it. Uh, I might&#39;ve advised them earlier, uh, to let it, let it develop, let it, let it unfold before you start to, uh, make a big deal out of it. Maybe, you know, whisper to a few people, this doesn&#39;t look good. Get a few people on the talk shows, uh, saying that they were concerned about it.

          <div class="said">well look the liberals may have had the best intentions in the world uh but they They didn&#39;t follow the rules that are there to protect us all. That is their exposure. And in a funny way, I think their exposure is more legal than moral, as I said. So if I&#39;m the Libs, I&#39;m getting through this quickly. If I&#39;m the Conservatives, I don&#39;t even know what, quote unquote, lever I have to pull right now. I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m not even a witness. You know, it&#39;s going to be the Ethics Commissioner talking to people in government and what have you, or the WE Charity. So, yeah, you know, maybe you try to expand it. Say, hey, you&#39;ve got to look at these angles, try to push things that go by the ethics commissioner&#39;s, you know, field of vision, I suppose, that they might feel they have to address in their report, which would make the report go longer. But, you know, otherwise, you don&#39;t have a lot to pull, you know, because we are kind of in a narrower definition of conflict of interest than perhaps the conservatives wish. Carter,</div>

But this tweet, this this Facebook ad ultimately siding with is it fair to say climate change denying in some ways, you know, citing some research in that in that domain. So first, maybe you want to add more context. I&#39;ll let you do that. Give us the one to 10. And then what would you do?</div>

I&#39;d shut it down it&#39;s brought me nothing but pain if I&#39;m Jason Kenney I am now what am I, nine months into this thing and every month something that they do hurts and obviously there seems to be no oversight from the government because they have separated it it is a separate entity it is the equivalent of the We Charity it&#39;s a non-profit society that exists outside of government that gets $30 million a year that is governed by three ministers as private citizens. So that&#39;s problematic. The governance structure is a disaster. And obviously, the people leading it, Tom Olson specifically, seems to fit right in with Matt Wolf in being incredibly incompetent. So if I&#39;m Jason Kenney, I&#39;m looking at this and saying, I can&#39;t find a competent communicator to save my life. I&#39;m going to shut this thing down because every time it opens its mouth, it hurts.

It requires an extra million dollars. And the mandate has changed to say if there is any anti-Alberta energy campaigns going on by foreign entities, then this report will come out and showcase it rather than definitively saying there was prior to.
