I was really surprised we actually were doing this tonight, to be quite honest with you. You thought this was going to be canceled. I really did. I mean, Corey, everything is getting canceled these days. Pay attention. By the way, how Steven has not gotten canceled yet is actually a miracle. No,</span>

No one outside of Corey got the poll, Carter. So, of course, we know it was just an intellectual exercise for us to go through.</span>

            <span class="text">the liberal marriage with WE has come to an end before it even started. They have decided to part ways, which sounded like a very poor pre-divorce statement. But regardless, WE will now not be administering the close to billion-dollar volunteer program that the feds had stated was the only charity in the country that was able to do this. So I want to focus today on this story in particular, but I also want to talk about scandals on the main. Corey, you&#39;ve got your hand up.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">So, Corey, before we get started on the specifics of this story, talk to me about broadly what goes into creating a political scandal. Because the S-word is now starting to be used around this. by the opposition. But simultaneously, we&#39;ve also got the ethics watchdog now investigating Trudeau, which seems to happen every every 18 months or so, like clockwork. But what goes into this, this cocktail of creating scandals and scandals that perhaps take governments down? I want to talk about that first before we get into the foundation.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, unfortunately, it does feel like you could set your watch to these at this point for the Trudeau government and the ethics Commissioner. A scandal, simply put, is absolutely in the eye of the beholder. It is entirely different. It&#39;s not always of legal foundation, although that&#39;s usually a big part of it. Often there&#39;s some suggestion that a law was broken, whether that law carries jail time or is just the way things are supposed to occur.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But a scandal can also be an amplified gaffe. It can be something where you have said something that is not illegal, but is deeply offensive to different groups of people or it could be a sex scandal ultimately it&#39;s anything that people in large enough numbers take an affront to and usually what&#39;s pretty foundational to a scandal is a denial by one side as well most of the time right uh where all of a sudden um what&#39;s very common to them is that there&#39;s there&#39;s a there&#39;s like a i don&#39;t want to use the word cover-up because i&#39;m not suggesting that&#39;s what it is in this case but um you know the suggestion that there is no scandal is so Though part of there being a scandal a lot of the time, it&#39;s hard to separate the two.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, anything to add as to what goes into the recipe of scandal making?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">A scandal is two sides. I mean, I think that that&#39;s what Corey&#39;s saying with the denial</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">denial at the beginning.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You rarely hear of a scandal where someone says, you know what, that was a mistake. I misspoke and I&#39;d</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;d like to apologize. That</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That was something wrong and I&#39;m going to move forward. The</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The scandal always starts off, and this one with the We Charity, started off with, there&#39;s nothing wrong here. There&#39;s nothing to see. And because there&#39;s nothing wrong, there&#39;s nothing to see, the other side pushes. Now, I will say this, that in today&#39;s society, we&#39;re always looking to add the gate suffix. Everything needs to be a gate. And we&#39;re trying to find a way to make almost everything a scandal. And it&#39;s kind of diminished the real scandals, the true the true pieces of of corruption</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">corruption that we used to see. And we used to see a lot more of it, to be honest. Right now, most governments, I think, are relatively scandal free. And that&#39;s one of the reasons that when opposition parties push for a scandal and try and get something going, you know, they do push back pretty hard. And I think the other thing is that scandals ultimately can bring down governments. A real scandal can end a government&#39;s right to govern. And we&#39;ve seen that only</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">only a few times in history where the scandal ultimately takes out the governing party.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Most of the time, though, these are little made up blips that if the governing party could pull their heads out of their tushes long enough, they&#39;d be able to get past the scandal before it even develops any legs at all.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, Carter said a couple of interesting things here. The first is, you know, real scandals can take down governments. And then the other statement he made was this idea that scandals are often engineered by opposition parties in some ways. So how do you kind of reconcile these two things? Like, as in what is a real scandal and how does this concept of engineering, you know, whether it&#39;s a gaffe to your point, Corey, How do you engineer and elevate that to a scandal if you&#39;re part of the opposition class or the activist class in this case?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, the defining characteristic of a scandal is public outrage. So if you want something to become a scandal, you need to increase the level of outrage.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">outrage. And that usually means increasing your level of umbrage, talking about how this is morally wrong, how this is legally wrong, how this is part of the general degrading of Canadian fabric. You start to get yourself into the world of superlatives very quickly. often if you were trying to push for something being a scandal the worst ever you know the the the most corrupt ever things of that nature but um uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh but you know there&#39;s a challenge there which is i think and in a way sort of building on what carter said if if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">if everything&#39;s a scandal nothing&#39;s a scandal because you can only turn that dial up to 11 so many times before everybody</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">normalizes their speakers right and your 11 becomes their their baseline like their standard audio level. And so where the opposition has to be careful anywhere, not just on this particular issue, is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so much of what we need to know in politics, we learned as children, the boy who cried wolf, right? You know, the emperor has no clothes, another great one, Trump fans. But if you say everything&#39;s a scandal, nobody is going to take you seriously when the true scandals come along carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">carter to that point then does this situation with the foundation as we are now calling it does it have the right ingredients to to make a scandal i.e if you&#39;re sitting in opposition right now are you thinking yep these are this is this has got everything i need to start dialing up the volume does it have the ingredients well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">well i mean first of all i i think that it fails on its first test which is and i said this in our when we talked about the first time. The connection between the Trudeaus and this charity is that they show up at the charity&#39;s events. They promote the good work that this charity does. How is that a scandal? I mean, bringing attention to the fact that the Trudeaus agree that youth should be more engaged. Are you suggesting, Mr. Scheer, that you don&#39;t think that you should be more engaged? I mean, this strikes this strikes me as um you know we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve forgotten what what a conflict of interest actually means which is you know if if i get a piece of work from my wife you know that that looks like a conflict of interest because i&#39;m financially benefiting from her handing something to me uh that type of conflict of interest i think is long ago been done away with we don&#39;t see it very frequently this</span>

This is a big program. And that is probably the piece that I overlooked in our first criticism of it or our first look at it. $900 million is a lot of money. It is a lot of money to give to any enterprise, let alone a social enterprise. Now, this is a big foundation. This is a big organization that manages and moves a lot of money, but still, something like $900 million that you&#39;re going to just turn into a program, it feels to me like we wouldn&#39;t have accepted it if it was handed to a business, unless it was oil and gas, in which case Albertans would have loved it.

Why didn&#39;t they allow it to kind of set in the public mind? It would have been really interesting to watch the Trudeau liberals spend some money, get some support for the program, start to put it out there, and then all of a sudden pull the rug out from under them that this was done improperly, didn&#39;t go through the proper processes. processes, um, that might&#39;ve been a way, like it would have been a bigger scandal if people knew about it and man had, had invested in it. Uh, I might&#39;ve advised them earlier, uh, to let it, let it develop, let it, let it unfold before you start to, uh, make a big deal out of it. Maybe, you know, whisper to a few people, this doesn&#39;t look good. Get a few people on the talk shows, uh, saying that they were concerned about it.

That is their exposure. And in a funny way, I think their exposure is more legal than moral, as I said. So if I&#39;m the Libs, I&#39;m getting through this quickly. If I&#39;m the Conservatives, I don&#39;t even know what, quote unquote, lever I have to pull right now. I&#39;m assuming I&#39;m not even a witness. You know, it&#39;s going to be the Ethics Commissioner talking to people in government and what have you, or the WE Charity. So, yeah, you know, maybe you try to expand it. Say, hey, you&#39;ve got to look at these angles, try to push things that go by the ethics commissioner&#39;s, you know, field of vision, I suppose, that they might feel they have to address in their report, which would make the report go longer. But, you know, otherwise, you don&#39;t have a lot to pull, you know, because we are kind of in a narrower definition of conflict of interest than perhaps the conservatives wish. Carter,</span>

But this tweet, this this Facebook ad ultimately siding with is it fair to say climate change denying in some ways, you know, citing some research in that in that domain.

So that&#39;s problematic. The governance structure is a disaster. And obviously, the people leading it, Tom Olson specifically, seems to fit right in with Matt Wolf in being incredibly incompetent. So if I&#39;m Jason Kenney, I&#39;m looking at this and saying, I can&#39;t find a competent communicator to save my life. I&#39;m going to shut this thing down because every time it opens its mouth, it hurts.

You had Steve Allen, who is the former chair of CED here, leading this panel. And on a Friday afternoon, the Minister of Energy says it&#39;s going to be delayed for four months. It requires an extra million dollars. And the mandate has changed to say if there is any anti-Alberta energy campaigns going on by foreign entities, then this report will come out and showcase it rather than definitively saying there was prior to. So I know we&#39;re getting to very much inside baseball. We&#39;ve probably lost all of our listeners. It&#39;s fine. If you&#39;re in Alberta, thank you for sticking with us.

Carter, I want to go to you first on this. You&#39;re hearing the question for the first time, but thoughts on tethering the conservatives and forcing them to take a stand on separatism?</span>

But if I&#39;m the Conservatives, I don&#39;t even feel like I&#39;d be trapped by it because they don&#39;t need to say the Alberta complaint about equalization is correct. They just need to say equalization is broken. They&#39;ll blame Trudeau for letting things get to this point. They&#39;re going to say, yeah, it&#39;s an injustice. I understand Albertans are mad about it. Equalization has been used as social engineering.</span>

I think that it becomes very easy for them to say, of course, I support Canada. But supporting Canada means working with the provinces.
