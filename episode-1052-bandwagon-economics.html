        <p>The gang talk about the phenomenon of every politician being a sports fan at playoff time - often to embarrassing effect. Plus - the $13 billion battery plant gets debated from a policy and politics perspective. Meanwhile, Zain disavows hockey and burns forever the possibility of running for public office while simultaneously plugging merchandise available at <a href="http://www.westofcentre.ca" target="_blank">WestofCentre.ca</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about politicians becoming sports fans during the playoffs, the $13 billion public price tag for the VW battery plant, the first two days of the PSAC strike and more. Is the price paid for authentically admitting you're not a sports fan too high? How can Pierre Poilievre oppose the VW battery plant without hurting himself? And with Carter up 1-0 in the series, is it time for everybody to jump on board? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We have all successfully gotten rid of our blue check marks. Congratulations to all of us. We all had them, and we all decided not to keep them. But of course, Stephen Carter, Pierre Poliev, has kept his because he now has Twitter blue. He&#39;s got Twitter blue. Well,</div>

          <div class="said">the reason i&#39;m bringing this topic up let me actually go back to it is that there&#39;s a a politician or a political candidate running for mayor in toronto who posted a picture of him in a leafs jersey and then was called out for posting that picture saying can&#39;t wait for the game to start when the when the leafs were already down 5-2 and on their way to losing the game and he was called out by many people uh uh online and i was like well this reminds me like he you know he probably had a long day of door knocking is a guy who&#39;s running you know at least as it relates to the poll several points behind is doing his obligatory carter his obligatory political jersey moment stopped by at a bar for 15 seconds so he can get the picture and move on and and you know just probably got there later the team posted it late as they&#39;re still working out the the kinks in the campaign campaign team uh but cory do you agree that you have to do it like you like let me stress okay use your rule is almost i&#39;m starting to almost make a list of rules right this is what i want to get out of this segment okay what are the rules for politicians uh as it relates to to sporting events and i should be clear and core you have made it clear around playoff sporting events right when it gets serious right like i&#39;m not talking about you do it every saturday night if you&#39;re playing teams playing hockey in canada or whatever i&#39;m talking playoffs you&#39;re right where where the team is congealing, or the city is congealing around a team.</div>

          <div class="said">i i think it&#39;s legitimate to be like hey they&#39;re the last alberta team let&#39;s go oilers and there&#39;s the premier you can&#39;t like cheer against the oilers as i don&#39;t know i think if If I was Premier, I might be inclined to a little bit. Wouldn&#39;t be popular, though. Let&#39;s put it that fucking way, right? But yeah, like, you don&#39;t need to get full-throated in there if it&#39;s like your team&#39;s rival and it&#39;s in the same geography. I think that&#39;s the kind of thing that gets people a little bit eye-rolling because, you know, do you, like, I don&#39;t know, my Twitter feed right now is full of Flames fans cheering against the Oilers and just being like, yeah, go Kings, right? Right. And so I think that you have to if you want to come off as that sports fan, you again, you have to match the cadence of where the actual sports fans are. If you&#39;re not one, if you are one, just let your passions fly the way they are. But like, if you&#39;re not, you can&#39;t be too far ahead of the sports fans in your geography.</div>

I&#39;ll tell you what an investment looks like. An investment looks like you have something that&#39;s going to give you a return. If they&#39;d given a loan that gave a return to the people. I mean, if you look back at some of the better subsidies that we have had in Canadian history, we got stocks for them. When we bailed out the car industry, we got our money back and we got our return on our investment. This isn&#39;t an investment. This is giving away money to people who don&#39;t need our money. Do you think Volkswagen really isn&#39;t going to build a battery plant? It&#39;s only a question of where they&#39;re going to put it. And if we&#39;re not competitive enough on its face to get the battery plant, then we&#39;re just buying a little bit of action right now. And buying a little action right now feels a lot more prostitution-like than actually a good business sense, if you want to break it down. That&#39;s what it feels like to me. We&#39;re just buying a little action on the side because this isn&#39;t core to the Volkswagen group. I mean, sure, they&#39;ll be here for a while, but will they be here for 100 years?

And if you just replace a battery plant with, say, arena, I mean, this is a playbook people use. They try to get people to bid up with public money to give private benefit. And there&#39;s a bit of a race to the bottom here. But there&#39;s a couple of important things to put on the table here. And one of them is this was an attempt to match the US, right? right? The US</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">then we need to match the US. Because where I disagree with Stephen is if the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act benefits went away, well, in 100 years, and Canada was in the same place, like, you know, they&#39;re not actually that much better than us. They&#39;re splashing a lot of federal money in. And so if we want to kind of re-level the playing field, it&#39;s going to cost federal money. Now, is that still in our interests? That&#39;s really tough for me to say. In some ways, I have less of a problem with this kind of approach to subsidies than I do if we were just trying to create something out of whole cloth, because what we&#39;re trying to do is almost negate another person&#39;s subsidy. But the absurdity of this is, that means both us and the United States have taken an action that if neither of us had taken it the same degree, it wouldn&#39;t have cost our public purses as much money. Yeah, several billion dollars</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">correct. Well, and that&#39;s very frustrating, because maybe Volkswagen still would have needed something to get to North America, but maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been the equivalent of $13 billion. Maybe it could have been $4 billion. Maybe it could have been $5 billion. But there&#39;s a kind of a broader economic thing here. And there&#39;s a school of thought, which I actually have an awful lot of sympathy for, which is that all of these subsidies are kind of nonsense, right? right? You&#39;re effectively pushing uphill a rock that is naturally going to tumble back down. It&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s just buying off your lack of competitive advantage in an area. And why are you doing this? Because inherently the economy does not want to be there. And there are places that we can have a comparative advantage to our peers. And if we were really that interested in it, we could, you know, we could have more free trade deals, for example. we could do all sorts of interesting things in order to get more more stuff on our shores but</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">there is a there is a reality here right which is comparative advantages is really about like overall economic benefit and sometimes that&#39;s not the only consideration here sometimes we want to talk about how it&#39;s spread around sometimes we&#39;re talking about trying to build industries to have new comparative advantages in the future and sometimes that does require a bit of a catalyst and it takes a concerted effort and it says we&#39;re going to do something we&#39;re not competitive at for a bit in order to become competitive down the road. And there is an argument to be made that if you create a hub for battery development in Canada, it&#39;s going to have wraparounds and it&#39;s going to have more of a natural draw for other battery plants down the road because that&#39;s the way industry often works. Like geography matters a lot for these particular things. This is a relatively nascent field. And so there&#39;s probably a stronger argument to do it now than perhaps in 30 years if we were trying to play catch up so all very nuanced and i i think that ultimately though we do need to keep an eye on what we are trying to will into existence that is just not otherwise going to happen i think that&#39;s important carter</div>

We, we, we drove new knowledge because we had new industry here and, and better industry in many regards. And we could drive more new knowledge if we were investing in things like climate change and actually shifting, as Peter Lougheed did, to new technologies that were required and were going to be required in the future.</div>

If you gave each one of my friends that have employees a million dollars per employee, you know what? Their businesses would grow too. Their employment would grow. But is that the way that we want Canadian jobs to grow? Or do we want to invest in the actual ingenuity of Canadians? And the way I would invest is to lower everybody&#39;s taxes. How much lower would your taxes be on your corporate income tax if we hadn&#39;t made this investment? right this is a way of stealing from others stealing from entrepreneurs who are making it work giving it to a foreign corporation and not even making sure that the jobs stay here for at least five years this is a mistake corporate welfare is almost always a mistake when we&#39;re bidding against a government that has unlimited pools of debt and that&#39;s what the united states is unlimited pools of debt we cannot do the same here and i&#39;m watching justin trudeau drive our our deficit higher, drive our debt higher, and pushing Canadians into a worse place because of it.</div>

          <div class="said">are gonna go with underrated no i i like that But a final question for you. Let&#39;s get a heat check on this. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. In the ongoing PSAC strike against the feds, this is the public service employees that are currently on day two of the strike. Let&#39;s use a clear-eyed, simply a strategic lens on this. Who&#39;s winning thus far, Carter, the feds or PSAC?</div>

          <div class="said">getting out of them is it seems to be much harder than it should be. So my my great concern is that both the federal government and PSAC, you know, don&#39;t make the progress that people expect. And right now it hasn&#39;t impacted people too badly, but it will have an impact. I mean, the public sector matters and getting this thing solved is going to be in everybody&#39;s best interests. I&#39;m not going to come down and say this is going to, you know, the Trudeau government has to solve this. I think this is going to be a shared problem that both PSAC and and the government of the day here have to have to really shake their heads and say, is this really what we want right now?</div>

Like, work stoppages are tough, and they will hurt both parties over the long term, which is why, generally speaking, they are to be avoided, right? There&#39;s a lot of animosity and antipathy that carries forward, even when it&#39;s done, when it&#39;s settled, because there are lost wages that never come back. there is this ill will between management and workers that is tough to get past and god help you if you get in a situation with scabs or replacement workers right all of a sudden the people who cross the picket line are going to have some tensions with the people who didn&#39;t cross the picket line and i certainly hope we don&#39;t get to a place like that uh and yeah</div>

          <div class="said">from an awful lot of canadians on that right like you know that there needs to be an increase where i think they likely have less sympathy and where i think that they have a bit of a confused strategy is also the idea of remote work which seems to have been elevated to a right for a number of people in many eyes, which is obviously not the case for many, many workers. And, you know, we can roll our eyes at this notion of there being a laptop class who had a very different pandemic experience than service workers, than people who work in construction, than people who work in, you know, industrial settings. But this really underlines it. And I think PSAC&#39;s big problem here is that that is a very unsympathetic position to say, like, Like, I want to work remote when so many Canadians simply do not have the ability to do that. About a quarter of Canadians work in sales and services, just to give some rough numbers</div>

          <div class="said">numbers here, right? You&#39;re not generally doing that kind of work remotely. Additionally, industrial work and on top of that, like, there&#39;s not actually a majority of Canadians who can work remotely even a couple days a week. And so I think PSAC needs to be very careful there. there. Now on the plus side, the fact that there are these two big issues means there&#39;s also movement to make a deal or a range of movement to make a deal because you don&#39;t need to get both. You can get something on one or both and you can declare victory and you can get yourself out of a strike situation. And similarly, if you&#39;re the government, you have a few more things that you can potentially offer there. But it&#39;s going to be rough on both parties. It&#39;s going to be rough on on canadians uh it is obviously at a moment where many people have just filed their tax returns my wife being one of them i filed months ago so that&#39;s the guy i am but uh yeah</div>
