            <span class="text">This is The Strategist, episode 1052. My name is Zain Velji. With me, as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Guys, we have done it. We have all successfully gotten rid of our blue check marks. Congratulations to all of us. We all had them, and we all decided not to keep them. But of course, Stephen Carter, Pierre Poliev, has kept his because he now has Twitter blue. He&#39;s got Twitter blue. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, and he can charge it back to the people, right? I think that that part is pretty important. He would</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">would count that as an expense to his office, and he would bill it back to the people, whereas normal human beings who have to pay for stuff don&#39;t have that opportunity. But Pierre has lived on the government dime basically his entire life, and yet he pretends to be some sort of fiscal conservative, which just brings me great joy. yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">you know I would say say that it&#39;s probably the only thing that&#39;s going to get him any attention this year so it&#39;s probably a good investment cory</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but you know one of the interesting things about it is apparently they couldn&#39;t figure out how to mass unblue check people so what they did instead is they just hid the blue check so if you actually go into the html you can see that it&#39;s just a hidden check and in fact if you of course everybody here who has a blue check will be able to do this uh you can go and you can look at your notifications and you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">Hey, can I ask you, did you guys ever use your, did your verified blue check actually get you anything in real life? I mean, did it up your networking potential? Did people respond to you quicker? Do you feel like there&#39;s anecdotal or otherwise evidence that you were actually, there&#39;s actually a real loss for you here? Because I&#39;m now genuinely curious.</span>

It happens all the time, whether you&#39;re running for election or not. This, I felt, is a great time to talk about the strategy of sports.

Or do you still have to do the sport thing? That&#39;s my first question that I want to kind of dig into. If the answer to that is yes, Corey and Steven, what are the rules for that in 2023? How do you kind of still be authentic, but still try to be relatable? Corey, let&#39;s talk about the strategy of sport. The binary question first, give me your answer. Do you have to do it in this 2023 world? Or is sports just less important than it used to be? You</span>

            <span class="text">the reason i&#39;m bringing this topic up let me actually go back to it is that there&#39;s a a politician or a political candidate running for mayor in toronto who posted a picture of him in a leafs jersey and then was called out for posting that picture saying can&#39;t wait for the game to start when the when the leafs were already down 5-2 and on their way to losing the game and he was called out by many people uh uh online and i was like well this reminds me like he you know he probably had a long day of door knocking is a guy who&#39;s running you know at least as it relates to the poll several points behind is doing his obligatory carter his obligatory political jersey moment stopped by at a bar for 15 seconds so he can get the picture and move on and and you know just probably got there later the team posted it late as they&#39;re still working out the the kinks in the campaign campaign team uh but cory do you agree that you have to do it like you like let me stress okay use your rule is almost i&#39;m starting to almost make a list of rules right this is what i want to get out of this segment okay what are the rules for politicians uh as it relates to to sporting events and i should be clear and core you have made it clear around playoff sporting events right when it gets serious right like i&#39;m not talking about you do it every saturday night if you&#39;re playing teams playing hockey in canada or whatever i&#39;m talking playoffs you&#39;re right where where the team is congealing, or the city is congealing around a team.</span>

            <span class="text">So I personally think that there&#39;s some nuance in it. For me, the opportunity you have to not do it is actually if you are a Calgary-based politician right now, for example. Are we supposed supposed to pretend that we&#39;re oilers fans at</span>

            <span class="text">i i think it&#39;s legitimate to be like hey they&#39;re the last alberta team let&#39;s go oilers and there&#39;s the premier you can&#39;t like cheer against the oilers as i don&#39;t know i think if If I was Premier, I might be inclined to a little bit. Wouldn&#39;t be popular, though. Let&#39;s put it that fucking way, right? But yeah, like, you don&#39;t need to get full-throated in there if it&#39;s like your team&#39;s rival and it&#39;s in the same geography. I think that&#39;s the kind of thing that gets people a little bit eye-rolling because, you know, do you, like, I don&#39;t know, my Twitter feed right now is full of Flames fans cheering against the Oilers and just being like, yeah, go Kings, right? Right. And so I think that you have to if you want to come off as that sports fan, you again, you have to match the cadence of where the actual sports fans are. If you&#39;re not one, if you are one, just let your passions fly the way they are. But like, if you&#39;re not, you can&#39;t be too far ahead of the sports fans in your geography.</span>

On the policy itself, Carter, why are you out? Because I know you&#39;re out on this policy. This is the feds providing $13 billion to Volkswagen, come here, kind of trying to match the</span>

I&#39;ll tell you what an investment looks like. An investment looks like you have something that&#39;s going to give you a return. If they&#39;d given a loan that gave a return to the people. I mean, if you look back at some of the better subsidies that we have had in Canadian history, we got stocks for them. When we bailed out the car industry, we got our money back and we got our return on our investment. This isn&#39;t an investment. This is giving away money to people who don&#39;t need our money. Do you think Volkswagen really isn&#39;t going to build a battery plant? It&#39;s only a question of where they&#39;re going to put it. And if we&#39;re not competitive enough on its face to get the battery plant, then we&#39;re just buying a little bit of action right now. And buying a little action right now feels a lot more prostitution-like than actually a good business sense, if you want to break it down. That&#39;s what it feels like to me. We&#39;re just buying a little action on the side because this isn&#39;t core to the Volkswagen group. I mean, sure, they&#39;ll be here for a while, but will they be here for 100 years?

The government&#39;s footing an initial capital investment of $700 million and then up to $13 billion of those subsidies that I mentioned. Your take on something like this, this is making</span>

But this concept of government putting a couple hundred million, couple hundred thousand, couple billion into projects isn&#39;t something that is reserved for one partisan Jersey color. We&#39;ve seen all governments kind of do this and engage in it. But your thought on this one, especially perhaps related to the particular dollar amount and maybe even the particular</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m a little more torn than Stephen on it. Everything he said is generally true. And if you just replace a battery plant with, say, arena, I mean, this is a playbook people use. They try to get people to bid up with public money to give private benefit. And there&#39;s a bit of a race to the bottom here. But there&#39;s a couple of important things to put on the table here. And one of them is this was an attempt to match the US, right? right? The US</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">US are the ones who shot first on this particular one. And so if we want to even just get to a level playing field again, then</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">then we need to match the US. Because where I disagree with Stephen is if the IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act benefits went away, well, in 100 years, and Canada was in the same place, like, you know, they&#39;re not actually that much better than us. They&#39;re splashing a lot of federal money in. And so if we want to kind of re-level the playing field, it&#39;s going to cost federal money. Now, is that still in our interests? That&#39;s really tough for me to say. In some ways, I have less of a problem with this kind of approach to subsidies than I do if we were just trying to create something out of whole cloth, because what we&#39;re trying to do is almost negate another person&#39;s subsidy. But the absurdity of this is, that means both us and the United States have taken an action that if neither of us had taken it the same degree, it wouldn&#39;t have cost our public purses as much money. Yeah, several billion dollars</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">in this case, correct.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">correct. Well, and that&#39;s very frustrating, because maybe Volkswagen still would have needed something to get to North America, but maybe it wouldn&#39;t have been the equivalent of $13 billion. Maybe it could have been $4 billion. Maybe it could have been $5 billion. But there&#39;s a kind of a broader economic thing here. And there&#39;s a school of thought, which I actually have an awful lot of sympathy for, which is that all of these subsidies are kind of nonsense, right? right? You&#39;re effectively pushing uphill a rock that is naturally going to tumble back down. It&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s just buying off your lack of competitive advantage in an area. And why are you doing this? Because inherently the economy does not want to be there. And there are places that we can have a comparative advantage to our peers. And if we were really that interested in it, we could, you know, we could have more free trade deals, for example. we could do all sorts of interesting things in order to get more more stuff on our shores but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is a there is a reality here right which is comparative advantages is really about like overall economic benefit and sometimes that&#39;s not the only consideration here sometimes we want to talk about how it&#39;s spread around sometimes we&#39;re talking about trying to build industries to have new comparative advantages in the future and sometimes that does require a bit of a catalyst and it takes a concerted effort and it says we&#39;re going to do something we&#39;re not competitive at for a bit in order to become competitive down the road. And there is an argument to be made that if you create a hub for battery development in Canada, it&#39;s going to have wraparounds and it&#39;s going to have more of a natural draw for other battery plants down the road because that&#39;s the way industry often works. Like geography matters a lot for these particular things. This is a relatively nascent field. And so there&#39;s probably a stronger argument to do it now than perhaps in 30 years if we were trying to play catch up so all very nuanced and i i think that ultimately though we do need to keep an eye on what we are trying to will into existence that is just not otherwise going to happen i think that&#39;s important carter</span>

Okay, you know, I guess I can get that. I understand what&#39;s going on.

We, we, we drove new knowledge because we had new industry here and, and better industry in many regards. And we could drive more new knowledge if we were investing in things like climate change and actually shifting, as Peter Lougheed did, to new technologies that were required and were going to be required in the future.</span>

You can look at the film industry, if you want to look at another one that everybody Everybody just races to the bottom. And then the second that it&#39;s not profitable, you know, we&#39;ll have a surge of filming in Alberta because all of a sudden our tax credit looks good.

If you gave each one of my friends that have employees a million dollars per employee, you know what? Their businesses would grow too. Their employment would grow. But is that the way that we want Canadian jobs to grow? Or do we want to invest in the actual ingenuity of Canadians? And the way I would invest is to lower everybody&#39;s taxes. How much lower would your taxes be on your corporate income tax if we hadn&#39;t made this investment? right this is a way of stealing from others stealing from entrepreneurs who are making it work giving it to a foreign corporation and not even making sure that the jobs stay here for at least five years this is a mistake corporate welfare is almost always a mistake when we&#39;re bidding against a government that has unlimited pools of debt and that&#39;s what the united states is unlimited pools of debt we cannot do the same here and i&#39;m watching justin trudeau drive our our deficit higher, drive our debt higher, and pushing Canadians into a worse place because of it.</span>

So certainly, once in, assuming he can win the seat, and I have no reason to believe he wouldn&#39;t be able to win the seat, once in the House of Commons, he&#39;ll be quite an interesting lieutenant, I think, for Pierre Poliev.

            <span class="text">are gonna go with underrated no i i like that But a final question for you. Let&#39;s get a heat check on this. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. In the ongoing PSAC strike against the feds, this is the public service employees that are currently on day two of the strike. Let&#39;s use a clear-eyed, simply a strategic lens on this. Who&#39;s winning thus far, Carter, the feds or PSAC?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s winning yet. And I&#39;m not sure that this is going to be a situation where anybody comes out ahead. You know, strikes aren&#39;t great for either party. And, you know, once you&#39;re in them, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">getting out of them is it seems to be much harder than it should be. So my my great concern is that both the federal government and PSAC, you know, don&#39;t make the progress that people expect. And right now it hasn&#39;t impacted people too badly, but it will have an impact. I mean, the public sector matters and getting this thing solved is going to be in everybody&#39;s best interests. I&#39;m not going to come down and say this is going to, you know, the Trudeau government has to solve this. I think this is going to be a shared problem that both PSAC and and the government of the day here have to have to really shake their heads and say, is this really what we want right now?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, I think, I mean, I really want to underline what he said. Like, work stoppages are tough, and they will hurt both parties over the long term, which is why, generally speaking, they are to be avoided, right? There&#39;s a lot of animosity and antipathy that carries forward, even when it&#39;s done, when it&#39;s settled, because there are lost wages that never come back. there is this ill will between management and workers that is tough to get past and god help you if you get in a situation with scabs or replacement workers right all of a sudden the people who cross the picket line are going to have some tensions with the people who didn&#39;t cross the picket line and i certainly hope we don&#39;t get to a place like that uh and yeah</span>

            <span class="text">work stoppage which is why generally speaking you try to negotiate uh around them and and when you get to them it&#39;s because there&#39;s been a serious breakdown in some way shape or form the two issues that seem to be at the core of this are of course wages we&#39;re in a deeply inflationary environment and i think that the peace act probably gets an awful lot of sympathy from</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">from an awful lot of canadians on that right like you know that there needs to be an increase where i think they likely have less sympathy and where i think that they have a bit of a confused strategy is also the idea of remote work which seems to have been elevated to a right for a number of people in many eyes, which is obviously not the case for many, many workers. And, you know, we can roll our eyes at this notion of there being a laptop class who had a very different pandemic experience than service workers, than people who work in construction, than people who work in, you know, industrial settings. But this really underlines it. And I think PSAC&#39;s big problem here is that that is a very unsympathetic position to say, like, Like, I want to work remote when so many Canadians simply do not have the ability to do that. About a quarter of Canadians work in sales and services, just to give some rough numbers</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">numbers here, right? You&#39;re not generally doing that kind of work remotely. Additionally, industrial work and on top of that, like, there&#39;s not actually a majority of Canadians who can work remotely even a couple days a week. And so I think PSAC needs to be very careful there. there. Now on the plus side, the fact that there are these two big issues means there&#39;s also movement to make a deal or a range of movement to make a deal because you don&#39;t need to get both. You can get something on one or both and you can declare victory and you can get yourself out of a strike situation. And similarly, if you&#39;re the government, you have a few more things that you can potentially offer there. But it&#39;s going to be rough on both parties. It&#39;s going to be rough on on canadians uh it is obviously at a moment where many people have just filed their tax returns my wife being one of them i filed months ago so that&#39;s the guy i am but uh yeah</span>
