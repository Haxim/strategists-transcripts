            <span class="text">speculate but also give you rationales for who we think should be in justin trudeau&#39;s cabinet. So we will talk about the MPs that the liberals have elected, who deserves to be in, who are the locks going forward. And then we will we will try to argue it out over the course of the show. But before we get there, I want to talk to you, Stephen Carter, because you have done this before you have made a cabinet before, be it provincially, but the process is, I&#39;m assuming largely the same.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s the way we did it. We said, okay, what positions do we want to have? Or</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Or even better, how many do you want to have? Because that&#39;s going to actually dictate the types of cabinet positions that you create. So for the purposes of this exercise that we&#39;re doing today, we&#39;re assuming 28. Correct.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Right. Do we need to balance regionally? Do we need to balance gender? Do we need to balance age? Do we need to balance experience levels? Right. Right. Will we have senior cabinet ministers, even if we don&#39;t call them senior cabinet ministers? Will we have a select group of people that are kind of at the top end and a group of people that are that were nurturing and moving up that at some point, maybe after the next election or in the mid between elections cabinet shuffle, they&#39;re going to move up higher. So those are the types of things that you map out in advance, because that&#39;s going to help you tremendously when you actually get to choosing the individual cabinet ministers. One</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">One more question on this. What&#39;s the group like that&#39;s making Cabinet right now? If you were to give us the insight right now as to what Trudeau is doing by what you&#39;ve done in the past, who is this group largely? actually.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">These are people who have, I mean, you, you start with your loyalists. You absolutely must start with the people who&#39;ve been there for you from the beginning. So you, you, I mean, the, the, the analogy is you take the large rocks and you put them in first, right? The people who matter the most to you. And then you, you add in the second tier of rocks, the smart ones, the people who, um, have to be there for a whole bunch of different reasons. Uh, they may not have been loyal to you in the past, but you, you grab those people and then you fill in the small sand. Uh, Those people that are virtually indistinguishable from one another but are being chosen for gender reasons or regional regions. So you&#39;ll find, I mean, I&#39;ve put in a couple of people in my cabinet that in my notes I put last second edition because now I need this. This is the best person to represent Northern Ontario and can do the job. job</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um so we pick that person instead of picking um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s almost indistinguishable from the except they&#39;ve got this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah cory i want to bring you in on this as well um carter was mentioning the the rocks the the smart people in the middle and then the sand i like that that&#39;s I like that, the three tiers. But what do you as an MP need to do to present yourself as a rock or a smart person? How do you present yourself as viable to get into candidate to the decision makers effectively?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m going to be really curious to hear what Stephen thinks about this as somebody who was probably lobbied, if not officially, implicitly through different conversations with different MLAs before that cabinet was put together. But I think when you think about a country like Canada, and as big and diverse as we are, there is no doubt a pretty broad understanding that cabinets reflect regions. We go out and we make sure we have regional representation. But where I&#39;ve seen MPs go off the rails in the past is that they believe just because they&#39;re expected to reflect regions that they should act regionally. and when you&#39;re building a cabinet especially for a country like this with so many diverse opinions think about alberta think about quebec think about the maritimes you need to make sure that you can put yourself in somebody else&#39;s shoes and think about these issues in a way you have to show you have a mind for cabinet in a country like canada this is not a very easy country to govern at the best of times and when it&#39;s divided it can be very difficult and that&#39;s what uh where i think think sometimes MPs make a mistake. Yes, they don&#39;t want to just be the champion for Calgary, for example. They need to be the champion from Calgary who can put themselves in the shoes of someone from Trois-Rivières. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

Oftentimes when you&#39;re making a cabinet, we saw this in Alberta, because our alberta uh special where we picked our cabinet ministers we tended to go with experience and then the cabinet was chosen the exactly opposite right which makes total sense well not exactly opposite but to a degree was different losing</span>

Kent Hare, when he was in MLA, actually introduced a bill to be able to, I didn&#39;t even agree with this bill, I thought it was a bit of a violation of civil liberties, but a bill that if they found a gun in your car during a routine traffic stop, they just took your car.

He&#39;s got the opposite problem going into this. And finally, tell us if you agree or disagree. Reach out to us on social media, etc. Let us know where you think we&#39;ve got it totally wrong. If you are from one of the regions where you think we&#39;ve given given short shrift to let us know about that um we&#39;d be happy to to hear from you uh and especially steven who will hear from you and probably respond in hate so i love my</span>
