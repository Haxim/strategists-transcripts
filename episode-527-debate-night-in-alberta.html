            <span class="text">All righty, Debate Night in Alberta 527. That&#39;s the episode number of The Strategists. My name is Zain Velji with me, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Gents, how are you doing, Zain?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">How are you doing? So, Debate Night in Alberta. Tell me first, before we get into it for today, you guys were both in the room in 2012. What was that like?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">A lot different than not being in the room. I think I ran a hole in the carpet in Global Studio. they may send me the bill when they hear this podcast it&#39;s pretty stressful and you just die every time your candidate opens their mouth because you&#39;re worried well now you got to be clear my candidate was Ross Sherman but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so you died multiple</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">multiple deaths as well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well he did he did very well I think credit where credit&#39;s due right you you worry I&#39;m worried that you&#39;re going to be at the receiving end of John Turner you had no option yeah you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">watch for all the traps and you&#39;re far more attentive to little details than you are watching the whole piece. Because when you watch the whole piece, you&#39;re able to get an overall sense and maybe view it more the way the average Albertan watches it instead of some crazed political consultant.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Right, right. Okay, so I&#39;m going to go to the most obvious question for tonight. Who won this thing?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, in my mind, no question. Rachel Notley. And maybe that&#39;s my left-wing bias, but every single time Jim Prentiss had to choose whether he was going to address a question or a pointed attack towards Brian Jean or Rachel Notley, he chose Notley each time. And that in itself would probably be enough for me to give the win to Rachel because she looked like the opposition leader, the potential premier.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But beyond that, she</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">she had an answer for every one of his barbs. He threw it out, she knocked it back. I had rarely seen such a masterful performance. Stephen Carter, your take?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, it would be too easy for me just to follow Corey and say that, you know, Rachel won. I think that there could be a case made, though, that Jim</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Jim Prentiss won by not losing. There were two obvious losers in the debate, and those losers were Brian Jean and David Swan. So clearly that puts Jim Prentiss in a contest with Rachel Notley, not a bad place for him to be. The question would be, will voters elect an NDP government or will they fall back home afraid of the NDP the way that they were afraid of the Wild Rose in 2012?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">You touched on Brian Jean there. I want to talk about that for a second. Simplistic message, talked about taxes all day long, but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">but is that a good thing? Was he on message? Was he off message? What does that resonate to people that are not us, people who are not crazy doing this right now? What</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">What does that translate</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">translate to the regular voter?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Hey, well, I heard Stephen say that he thought Brian lost. I think he&#39;s wrong. I think crazy people watch these debates, especially when there&#39;s a hockey game going on. We are literally recording a podcast instead of watching a possible elimination hockey game. We&#39;re not normal. Most Albertans get their news in soundbites, in segments, when you see the tweets, when you go out and you get that 30-second clip. You&#39;re going to get that simple Brian Jean message. He never wavered, but he doesn&#39;t need to waver. It&#39;s a message that&#39;s got a lot of resonance with Albertans. I see Stephen Carter disagreeing. It</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It is such a simple message. We will not increase taxes. Then he immediately starts talking about he&#39;s going to spend more on health care and he&#39;s going to reinvest in education. Albertans aren&#39;t stupid. They&#39;re not going to hear this simplistic message from Brian Jean and go, go, oh, well, that adds up. It doesn&#39;t add up. It won&#39;t work. And he was the obvious loser in the debate.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I just don&#39;t think that they&#39;re going to have the benefit of the rejoinders. They&#39;re going to hear we can keep taxes low. We have a plan.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s his message. He&#39;s stuck to it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">There certainly will be an audience for it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s talk about this. Corey, you mentioned the 45 second limit, the punchiness of this debate.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Was there a moment for either of you guys that is going to define this debate? Was there anything that is going to be headline worthy or repost I think</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s when we got to turn the TV off. I mean, that to me was the most exciting part. Is that any way</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">punchy for you? Yeah, sure. So you&#39;re going to quote Rachel Notley lines all night because she&#39;s the only one who had any lines that are worth remembering. Brian Jean&#39;s line is, everybody else is the coalition of tax raisers. uh and and but that was it was just repetitive that&#39;s why we remember it i think that rachel notley&#39;s lines were much stronger um</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um i don&#39;t know if we switch chairs here but i think i was the guy who said rachel won but i&#39;m going to argue against that you need to know too much background you need to know brian jean was a pc donor uh the economist line was great but the economist line the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the people who are choosing the winners and losers of this debate are people who know what was going on and they know exactly what was being spoken of and they&#39;re the ones who are going to point out and give context to that quote because that&#39;s the way things always work.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, I want you to remember you just said that. Think back, put on your way back cap. Way back. Down to 2012. A little-known columnist named Don Braid called the debate for somebody. Do you remember who he thought won that debate? I</span>

All right, well, I&#39;m not going to be a stand-by or turn-deck measuring contest. I have another question here. Okay, Jim Prentiss, what should he feel or could he feel satisfied about today? He had the toughest job going and anything he could feel satisfied about? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, he&#39;s still premier. He goes home and he&#39;s premier. And that still gives him an awful lot of leverage in this election going forward.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that he&#39;s going to be happy that he may have developed a one-enemy strategy instead of the two-front war. He may be able to convince Albertans that right now the great red scare is what they should be afraid of, not having to fight both the Wild Rose and the NDP. Coy, any reaction on that?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">She had the opportunity to position herself as an Alberta NDP. An Alberta NDP does not invoke the spirit of Jack Layton as though Jack had all the answers. I don&#39;t think that... I mean, sure, Linda Duncan got elected in Alberta, but it&#39;s not like Jack Layton had this great sway and the Great Orange Wave.</span>

I mean, but these guys, there is nobody to partner with in this next government. That&#39;s what makes this so interesting is that we still have that three-way race.

I think that he will find that there is more receptivity to a simplistic message in rural Alberta than there is in urban Alberta. I don&#39;t mean to imply that rural Albertans are simple. It&#39;s just that the low taxes mantra, low service, We provide fewer services in rural Alberta, and therefore they want to pay fewer taxes. Makes sense.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. Let&#39;s talk about the most important man in that room, Jim Prentice. I mean, he finishes that debate, goes into his green room. You guys are advising Jim Prentice. And your one saving grace, like you said, Carter, he may not have lost that debate. And secondly, the PCUs seem to have a very efficient vote. And for people who may not know what that means, they generally have votes that get them seats effectively. They win seats with their votes. So you&#39;re advising Jim Prentiss.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think he needs to break the cycle. but the thing about efficient vote when you&#39;re the government is it means your vote is broadly spread across you can win seats everywhere the problem with efficient vote is it&#39;s efficient right up until it&#39;s not and this is when you see vote collapses this is 1993 when the conservatives go from a large majority to two seats i&#39;m not saying that&#39;s going to happen to jim prentice but that is always the risk when your vote is spread too far he could get 20 percent in every riding in this province and he could lose every seat in this province.

            <span class="text">Well, I think that he&#39;s got a much different problem than Notley and Jean in so far as Notley and Jean are currently competing in very distinct geographic regions. Prentice&#39;s very low vote is spread out everywhere. So he&#39;s got to choose battlefields. Where is he going to fight? Where is he going to win? What are the seats that are even available to him right now? And it&#39;s got to be Calgary. He&#39;s got to run around Calgary basically fighting, I think, against the NDP. And he&#39;s got to say that any vote for the Wild Rose is a vote for the NDP. And that becomes his mantra for the next 10 days. And he&#39;s going to try and scare everybody the same way that we tried to scare everybody in 2012.</span>
