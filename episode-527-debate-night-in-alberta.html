And maybe that&#39;s my left-wing bias, but every single time Jim Prentiss had to choose whether he was going to address a question or a pointed attack towards Brian Jean or Rachel Notley, he chose Notley each time. And that in itself would probably be enough for me to give the win to Rachel because she looked like the opposition leader, the potential premier.</div>

The question would be, will voters elect an NDP government or will they fall back home afraid of the NDP the way that they were afraid of the Wild Rose in 2012?</div>

I think crazy people watch these debates, especially when there&#39;s a hockey game going on. We are literally recording a podcast instead of watching a possible elimination hockey game. We&#39;re not normal. Most Albertans get their news in soundbites, in segments, when you see the tweets, when you go out and you get that 30-second clip. You&#39;re going to get that simple Brian Jean message. He never wavered, but he doesn&#39;t need to waver. It&#39;s a message that&#39;s got a lot of resonance with Albertans. I see Stephen Carter disagreeing. It</div>

Then he immediately starts talking about he&#39;s going to spend more on health care and he&#39;s going to reinvest in education. Albertans aren&#39;t stupid. They&#39;re not going to hear this simplistic message from Brian Jean and go, go, oh, well, that adds up. It doesn&#39;t add up. It won&#39;t work. And he was the obvious loser in the debate.</div>

I think that he will find that there is more receptivity to a simplistic message in rural Alberta than there is in urban Alberta. I don&#39;t mean to imply that rural Albertans are simple. It&#39;s just that the low taxes mantra, low service, We provide fewer services in rural Alberta, and therefore they want to pay fewer taxes. Makes sense.</div>

You guys are advising Jim Prentice. And your one saving grace, like you said, Carter, he may not have lost that debate. And secondly, the PCUs seem to have a very efficient vote. And for people who may not know what that means, they generally have votes that get them seats effectively. They win seats with their votes. So you&#39;re advising Jim Prentiss.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think he needs to break the cycle. but the thing about efficient vote when you&#39;re the government is it means your vote is broadly spread across you can win seats everywhere the problem with efficient vote is it&#39;s efficient right up until it&#39;s not and this is when you see vote collapses this is 1993 when the conservatives go from a large majority to two seats i&#39;m not saying that&#39;s going to happen to jim prentice but that is always the risk when your vote is spread too far he could get 20 percent in every riding in this province and he could lose every seat in this province.

Prentice&#39;s very low vote is spread out everywhere. So he&#39;s got to choose battlefields. Where is he going to fight? Where is he going to win? What are the seats that are even available to him right now? And it&#39;s got to be Calgary. He&#39;s got to run around Calgary basically fighting, I think, against the NDP. And he&#39;s got to say that any vote for the Wild Rose is a vote for the NDP. And that becomes his mantra for the next 10 days. And he&#39;s going to try and scare everybody the same way that we tried to scare everybody in 2012.</div>
