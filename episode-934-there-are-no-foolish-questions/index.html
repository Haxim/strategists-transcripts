        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are subjected to the return of grab-bag favourite "Fine, Fabulous or F**ked" before some serious talk about the domestic political ramifications of the situation in Gaza. Are Canadian attitudes towards Israel and Palestine shifting? Was "One Dose Summer" a communications self-own? And how foolish was it for Zain to change a time-tested scale? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Tune back to a few episodes ago, episode 934, to understand what I&#39;m talking about. But listen, welcome to the show. This is an ongoing segment that we do. And what we do with this segment is I run through a list of stories that are currently in our political zeitgeist. It&#39;s kind of a grab bag of things that are big and small, things that are meaningful and perhaps not. And I asked Stephen and Corey whether the participants at play, and often the singular participant who&#39;s faced with the decision or has to hold the proverbial bag, is it fine for them? Is it foolish for them? Is it fabulous or is it fucked? The best way to jump into this, Stephen Carter, is by jumping into this. And I&#39;m going to start with you. Yeah. Justin Trudeau, with his standing on the podium mentioning this term one-dose summer without necessarily any rudder. I mean, we got a bit of a rudder later in the week on Friday when we learned that 75% of first dose and 20% of second dose is perhaps what he was saying. But this whole concept, this verbiage, this marketing speak that is one-dose summer, fine, foolish, fabulous, or fucked for Justin Trudeau? I</div>

          <div class="said">think it&#39;s foolish. I think that the problem is you have a situation where you&#39;ve now created a branding that can be used against you. And also it is it doesn&#39;t reflect the reality. We&#39;re in the middle of May right now. And we&#39;re seeing a significant step up in the number of vaccinations that are being delivered across the country. And frankly, I think more of us are going to have our second dose by the end of June than anybody would have reasonably predicted just a few months ago. So it just feels foolish to be putting the cart before the horse and also defining a failure. And One Dose Summer feels like a failure more than the success that I think we&#39;re actually heading towards.</div>

It&#39;s going to suck as a summer. I mean, so why are we branding this summer? Why don&#39;t we just let it unfold? I mean, no one really knows what this summer is going to look like.

We&#39;re going after the platforms, not the people. He&#39;s tried to make that distinction pretty clear. But now he&#39;s been thrown another wrench, another curveball regarding the algorithms. and wasn&#39;t able to say as it stands right now with a bit more time under our belt uh cory on c10 for minister gilbo find foolish fabulous or fucked right now it&#39;s</div>

Is it that as a parliamentarian, you need to know your shit, as simple as that? Is it that you need to have studied on this so that your job is not to just sit there and sit pretty, that you&#39;re actually advocating for a bill when you introduce it? What&#39;s the political lesson? I&#39;m just offering a few suggestions, but from your perspective, what&#39;s the political or even parliamentarian lesson that you would offer in broad terms based on this Gilbo example around C-10? Yeah,</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, Know Your Shit is a great start because so many of these things came out of almost, I think, what they perceived as a simple quick win. But really, I think that&#39;s the lesson. Beware of quick wins. Beware of easy wins. You&#39;ve got to understand the nuance of these particular issues. They are complicated. You are up against multi-billion dollar opponents here in these social media companies. They&#39;ve already lost a few rounds. They are getting more sophisticated. they are starting to use more pointed arguments that are likely to be more effective as they go down the road yeah australia may have surprised them they&#39;re not surprised by canada anymore so there&#39;s also kind of a lobbying notion in here and you can&#39;t walk like i said can&#39;t walk into this half-cocked this is this the idea that the like so i i&#39;m of two minds when i hear about ignoring the advice of his own officials right a briefing note went up and said this clause is here because of this reason and some official used language way beyond what they should have put put in a memo saying this is necessary for safeguarding. Like that&#39;s just bad briefing, no drafting for an official. They stated something in absolute terms and nothing in the world is that absolute. Right. And now they&#39;re, you know, elected officials embarrassed as a result. Their minister&#39;s embarrassed. They shouldn&#39;t have done that. So I don&#39;t I don&#39;t necessarily fault Gilbo as much on that as I think perhaps other people do. But there is kind of a fundamental reality here, which is there were flags on the field. There were people telling you there are complications here. you&#39;ve got to be aware of. And you can&#39;t just sort of, you or your chief of staff or your director of policy can&#39;t hand wave these away and say, oh, we fucking got this. This is popular. We&#39;re going to do this. Look what&#39;s happening in all these other jurisdictions.</div>

And I say this with this minister in particular, because not many of us know about him, but, you know, his history has been as an activist, where it&#39;s been really using the bully pulpit, you know, taking things that are very complex and making them very simple to understand from like that rhetoric and almost candidate perspective.

And ultimately, you can&#39;t just sit there and say, hey, I got a poll. Hey, it says Canadians think that we should do something about this. Ergo, I&#39;m going to do something. I&#39;m going to be popular. Because this is also something we&#39;ve talked about in the past, this theory of novel concepts. And I used to always say this in polling context, right? Beware of polling on novel concepts. People have thought about it for 30 seconds. They can have their mind changed with 30 seconds of good arguments the other way, right? right? It&#39;s much different to poll on something that people have debated back and forth and sort of determined their whole political identity about. That&#39;s pretty durable. You&#39;re not going to change that with a billboard. You might change it with a billboard if nobody has thought about how you&#39;re going to regulate these companies before.

And maybe they&#39;re covering it a little bit too hard on the minister, because it turns out that it&#39;s not just Facebook. It&#39;s not just the social media platforms that now have become part of your adversary. It&#39;s part, it&#39;s the media that have become part of your adversary.

Polling coming out by Leger saying 42% of those surveyed in Canada don&#39;t think Canadian athletes should compete in the Tokyo Olympics. 39% saying they should. And you also have polling out in Japan, which is, you know, while has limited their COVID spread quite significantly in terms of deaths as compared to our country and their population size per capita. They&#39;re doing amazing. Their vaccination rates are very poor right now. They&#39;re still in that 65 plus category. And so, you know, this particular question for Gilbo on Inheritage, and I know this is a decision by, you know, COC, but Inheritage has a play in it as well, is, you know, is his non-comment on this at this moment, not available for comment.

To me, there&#39;s something about it. I can&#39;t explain it. Clearly, I&#39;m not the communicator that Corey is. But something about it feels like it could be one of those questions.

Doug Ford&#39;s most recent political attack, because it clearly is as such, asserting that tighter federal borders will help drive Ontario&#39;s case counts down much faster. So he&#39;s extending lockdowns, giving a bit of a hat tip to community spread, but then is hitting hard on this federal jurisdiction of closing the borders. In fact, going so hard to now develop 30-second spots that they&#39;re running as the PC party of Ontario against the federal government, fundraising emails, all the like. It&#39;s a continued part of his rhetoric. It started probably about 10 days ago, extended to Friday when he said, oh, by the way, I think Friday or Thursday, just so I&#39;m clear, when he said, we&#39;re continuing the lockdown. But, you know, this is all about the variants and the borders and what the federal government could be doing here.

The federal government is not going to do what Doug Ford wants to do, and he&#39;s just sitting out there flapping in the breeze, genitals exposed to the winds, because ultimately he&#39;s going to spend a lot of money. He&#39;s going to try to rile up people on an issue. And if he is lucky, they will forget he tried to do it. If he&#39;s not, they will remember he did and that he was wrong. There&#39;s just absolutely no benefit. Listen, I understand the desire of provincial politicians to blame it on the federal government when things go wrong. That&#39;s not a COVID thing.

I&#39;m not going to do a whole thing about Alberta, but we did touch on Alberta quite significantly last week, and there&#39;s been some developments. Drew Barnes, this is the leader of the now ousted two-person... Leader of the pack. Of the pack. Here&#39;s what he said from last week. He said that the decision makes it clear that Kenney does not accept dissenting voices despite repeatedly saying the opposite and goes against the grassroots of the UCP. He&#39;s quoted as saying, hundreds of our members have already quit the party. Hundreds of our members are not donating anymore. He said many of his constituents and people across the province have told him they envision a free, more prosperous Alberta that gets a better deal from Ottawa. And then he started talking about comparators of Jason Kenney&#39;s polling numbers versus Justin and Trudeau in the province of Alberta, just to rub that into the wound. Carter, as a message for Barnes, from the advice that we gave him last week, even reconciling with perhaps new advice you have for him, what do you make of this messaging? Fine, foolish, fabulous, or fucked, based on the two goals he might have, right? Let&#39;s be clear, once again, to remind listeners from episode 934, the two goals that he had was either, you know, being part of a takeover of the UCP and or forming a new political movement. Based on what you heard, fine, foolish, fabulous, or fucked. And please Please don&#39;t say foolish, or I&#39;ll just come across the screen and kill both of you. It&#39;s</div>

And I think there&#39;s an increased demand from both, I&#39;d say, citizens in the United States and Canada to have their governments do more on it. Do you sense that as well?
