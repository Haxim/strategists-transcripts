We&#39;re here to power through that concept and talk about something else. Because I&#39;m not going to call this an emergency episode as much as Stephen Carter wants me to do that. But I think it&#39;s a special episode. It is special.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, we&#39;re here because we were talking about – so I got a poll. I got polled. I got a phone call, a live pollster started asking me questions, and that never happens to me. By the way, that should never happen to me. They should probably ask at the start, do you have any one of these 12 backgrounds, nine of which I do, which would exclude me from a poll. But I got a live pollster who was asking about provincial issues, and I was talking to you two. And that happened today. That happened today. So I was talking to you two, and I thought, why</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">I mean here&#39;s the thing I am very good at this job I think we all know that I feel like I feel like that was one of the best not as not as good as the rally sponsored by KKK pop which if you still don&#39;t get you will have to research okay cory talk to us about this poll you got one today live call can i ask you whether it was on i assume is on your cell phone right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right it was on it was on one of my phones yeah yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it was from the logic group or the logit group i can&#39;t remember now but i wrote it down they wouldn&#39;t tell me who the sponsor was i gave them a hard time about that which by the way i was a super annoying person to poll they really should have hung up on me multiple times when</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when i started saying saying things like, that&#39;s going to introduce order effect, and that&#39;s a double-barreled question, and I&#39;m not going to answer that. That premise is wrong.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But they didn&#39;t, because they&#39;ve got quotas to meet, and I was a live body who was entertaining them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so I got a poll. I got a poll. And at first, I just thought, yeah, okay, because I was on the road. I was traveling today, and I thought this would be a good way to kill some time. And they asked me, how is the provincial government handling the economy? That piqued my interest.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">How I was planning to vote in the provincial election, which is many years away. My views of Trudeau, Notley, and Kenney were the three people they asked about. And then a bunch of government-specific questions. So how is the provincial government doing on COVID? How&#39;s it doing on federal relations? How would I vote on the question of separating from Canada? Which may sound like, wow, but I&#39;ll tell you, that&#39;s something that the province has been polling on for quite some time at this point, because it&#39;s a bit of an alarming trend. See previous episodes. It was all really interesting. But like the bulk of the survey was on Alberta&#39;s fiscal situation, this giant deficit that we&#39;re facing down. We had a big one before COVID. We&#39;ve got a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a huge one now, just huge. Like people are talking 20 billion plus.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I had questions about how big of a deal this deficit was, if I thought it needed to be eliminated within five years, if I supported a plan to do that, something, some language like that. that. Now, where it got really interesting was, would I support a 5% wage rollback for public sector employees? It was pretty leading. It talked about government employees being half the budget, which is only true if you count nurses, teachers, maybe even doctors as government employees, which I don&#39;t think is really what people had in mind.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then also said, hey, are you aware that wages in Alberta are 10% to 20% higher than everywhere else? Does that make you support wage rollbacks? And then there were questions like, would I support a PST instead</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">of having to cut services? Would I support a healthcare premium? Would</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Would I support more private healthcare? But perhaps most</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">most intriguing of all, and all of those are kind of like, whoa, is the government considering all of those, right? But perhaps</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">perhaps most intriguing of all, in addition to those questions individually, I was asked them in conjunction. So how would I feel about a 5% wage cut, 5% PST, and reductions in spending rolled in as a plan, presumably for a five-year deficit goal? That&#39;s a lot of fives. That&#39;s very marketing speak, right? And so that&#39;s very very interesting. Being asked about a compromise plan isn&#39;t something you normally see unless somebody is actually considering the execution of a total package. So it&#39;s really interesting because somebody, and you can&#39;t really say with certainty who, is message testing some pretty specific messages.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, I want to get your reaction to what you just heard from Corey. Perhaps we&#39;ll get into the speculation of who this could be in a moment, but any basic thoughts on that survey construction, especially considering what we&#39;ve talked about in the past with with uh what what proper survey construction looks like what are you what are you seeing here what are you sensing here in your mind well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well the five by five by five plan definitely has my interest peaked um i mean already it&#39;s branded i mean it&#39;s a five year or five percent wage rollback five percent pst and a five-year plan that&#39;s someone testing something that&#39;s thought through like this is this is now at stage two of the actual discussion instead of stage one Stage one is me and Corey sitting in the back of a room going, well, I don&#39;t know. Maybe it could work. But</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But now you have to go out and you have to test it. And if you test it and it comes back with a certain reasonable numbers, like who&#39;s it going to upset? Who&#39;s interested? And that&#39;s why all those other questions are there because you&#39;re looking for all those crosstabs, right? The separatists. Well, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, we can&#39;t get them anyways. So if they&#39;re angry, who cares, right? Right. Or, you know, this actually has a pretty strong crossover with former liberal voters or it&#39;s got a crossover with somebody else. So you can you can put together a package of ideas and this this testing, this five by five by five, which is now how I&#39;m christening it. Corey hasn&#39;t christened it as such, but the five by five by five plan that&#39;s ready to be tested, that&#39;s ready to be rolled out, that&#39;s ready to be put into the balloon of whether or not this is actually going to go somewhere. so i&#39;m dying to know who&#39;s going to actually test this i mean maybe it&#39;s us maybe we maybe the reason they called you cory is they wanted us to talk about this on the podcast we</span>

Let&#39;s go through a few groups that that could maybe not have commissioned it, but perhaps could have but could also benefit from the value of the results of this poll. And let&#39;s start with the most obvious one, guys. Let&#39;s start with the UCP. So suppose this was them. This is the governing party in Alberta. They&#39;re putting this poll out. Corey, what are your thoughts? What are they what are they perhaps telegraphing or what are they trying to get out of something like this? It seems obvious, but I want to hear your thoughts in a more nuanced way, perhaps.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, look, there&#39;s actually a few reasons you might do a poll like this if you&#39;re the UCP. You might be planning to do something, but you must also consider the possibility you might be trying to prove something would be unpopular.</span>

            <span class="text">And certainly when you see a political party that has internal dissent on a particular issue, there&#39;s a saying with public opinion research in government, right? Public opinion research has been weaponized, and it ends arguments instead of starting arguments. So you come in and you have the numbers and everybody shuts up, which is why, by the way, premier&#39;s offices are so anxious about who sees polling when and how.</span>

You pull on the individual components, you see what the support is for those levels or for those individual pieces, and then you put together a couple of different bundles and you see how people react to the bundle.

There&#39;s a lot that you mentioned here. So perhaps what I&#39;m going to ask you to do is say the one or two things you found most surprising or most intriguing as related to the content of this survey. And by that, I mean the policy instruments that were presented. We&#39;ve kind of done a drive-by on a few of them, but is there anything that you wanted to just mention that you were pretty surprised to find within this live call?</span>

            <span class="text">cory final question and i&#39;ll go to you right after this, Carter. Corey, does the 555 plan find the light of day? Is it trial balloon? Do you see yes or no? Do you see this finding an existence beyond the podcast of the strategist?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, you know, this might actually be how it finds the light of day. We&#39;re talking to thousands of people right now.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But yeah, I think that once it&#39;s out there and it&#39;s a packaging of ideas that were already out there, people are going to talk about it, which is another reason and why I think the NDP needs to have their own plan.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, let me be more clear, Corey. Do you feel like government or third-party group trial balloons this as a strategy?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t know what the poll is going to come back with. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I suspect, unlike Carter, I actually think it&#39;s going to be fairly unpopular. Sales tax is not a popular proposition. It&#39;s a bit of a poison pill to any kind of plan. I&#39;ve seen polling in the 20s, the 30s at best, but you compare that to some of the other income. options that are available to people. By the way, people will always say raise taxes on the person who makes a dollar more than I do. That&#39;s just a truism.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But that leaves a lot on the table, right? I mean, you can basically get majority support from about $75,000 upward for income support or for income taxes.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, do you feel like this finds the light of day with the government or the UCP government or a third party group?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s a very reasonable possibility it doesn&#39;t, but someone invested a shit ton of money in this, so it&#39;s hard to do that poll and not actually release</span>

            <span class="text">i&#39;m gonna beg for some more five star reviews i am gonna tell you the listener do a couple of things leave us five star review ask Ask a question on that review and tweet us or find us on Facebook. If you&#39;ve also received this poll, we want to hear from you about that, because I think that&#39;d be very interesting. Did you hear the 555? Did you get, as Carter speculated, a different number? Was it a live call? Did you find it out in another format? Just send us your notes. If you if you have heard about this poll, it&#39;d be really interesting. And we want to jam on this further. So that&#39;s a wrap on Episode 809 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velji. With me, as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter, and we&#39;ll see you next time.</span>
