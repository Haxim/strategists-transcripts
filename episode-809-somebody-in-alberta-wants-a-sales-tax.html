          <p>SPECIAL EPISODE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use the occasion of Corey getting surveyed on sales taxes, wage cuts, privatizing health care and health premiums to talk about how and why parties, governments and interest groups construct political polls. Is the UCP floating a “grand bargain”? Have the NDP lost their mind? And why, exactly, would an interest group be interested in a Herman Cain retread? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

They should probably ask at the start, do you have any one of these 12 backgrounds, nine of which I do, which would exclude me from a poll. But I got a live pollster who was asking about provincial issues, and I was talking to you two. And that happened today. That happened today. So I was talking to you two, and I thought, why</div>

            <div class="said">How I was planning to vote in the provincial election, which is many years away. My views of Trudeau, Notley, and Kenney were the three people they asked about. And then a bunch of government-specific questions. So how is the provincial government doing on COVID? How&#39;s it doing on federal relations? How would I vote on the question of separating from Canada? Which may sound like, wow, but I&#39;ll tell you, that&#39;s something that the province has been polling on for quite some time at this point, because it&#39;s a bit of an alarming trend. See previous episodes. It was all really interesting. But like the bulk of the survey was on Alberta&#39;s fiscal situation, this giant deficit that we&#39;re facing down. We had a big one before COVID. We&#39;ve got a</div>

            <div class="said">So I had questions about how big of a deal this deficit was, if I thought it needed to be eliminated within five years, if I supported a plan to do that, something, some language like that. that. Now, where it got really interesting was, would I support a 5% wage rollback for public sector employees? It was pretty leading. It talked about government employees being half the budget, which is only true if you count nurses, teachers, maybe even doctors as government employees, which I don&#39;t think is really what people had in mind.</div>

            <div class="said">perhaps most intriguing of all, in addition to those questions individually, I was asked them in conjunction. So how would I feel about a 5% wage cut, 5% PST, and reductions in spending rolled in as a plan, presumably for a five-year deficit goal? That&#39;s a lot of fives. That&#39;s very marketing speak, right? And so that&#39;s very very interesting. Being asked about a compromise plan isn&#39;t something you normally see unless somebody is actually considering the execution of a total package. So it&#39;s really interesting because somebody, and you can&#39;t really say with certainty who, is message testing some pretty specific messages.</div>

            <div class="said">I suspect, unlike Carter, I actually think it&#39;s going to be fairly unpopular. Sales tax is not a popular proposition. It&#39;s a bit of a poison pill to any kind of plan. I&#39;ve seen polling in the 20s, the 30s at best, but you compare that to some of the other income. options that are available to people. By the way, people will always say raise taxes on the person who makes a dollar more than I do. That&#39;s just a truism.</div>

If you&#39;ve also received this poll, we want to hear from you about that, because I think that&#39;d be very interesting. Did you hear the 555? Did you get, as Carter speculated, a different number? Was it a live call? Did you find it out in another format? Just send us your notes. If you if you have heard about this poll, it&#39;d be really interesting. And we want to jam on this further. So that&#39;s a wrap on Episode 809 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velji. With me, as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter, and we&#39;ll see you next time.</div>
