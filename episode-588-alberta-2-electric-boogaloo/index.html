        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan check in on what's happened in Alberta this summer, and the broader political lessons that can be learned from the same. Is Jason Kenney going to get into trouble for "double-dipping"? Was the NDP approach to campaign finance reform a misfire? And how depressing would it be to be a bureaucrat briefing Stephen Carter on PPAs? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

He&#39;s doing all those things and no one else is doing anything, right? So from that point of view, he&#39;s getting off to the early start that he needs to get off to.

You need to, as a PC, sort of put on this cloak and say, I&#39;m stopping the wolves from taking over this party. And the longer that Jason Kenney has to sort of build comfort with the PCs and say, hey, I&#39;m not so scary, I just want to get rid of the NDP, the better his chances are in that delegated convention. and especially if he&#39;s got those organizers who are already predisposed to be involved out there working on his behalf.

          </div>
          <div class="said">vantage point, what do you think? Yeah, there&#39;s a massive gap in campaign finance and expense laws in this country and almost jurisdiction by jurisdiction. And it is a bit of an arms race because somebody brings in a rule to fix a challenge, and then somebody brings in a new practice that circumvents the rule. And that&#39;s effectively what Jason Kenney&#39;s done. You have to keep in mind, in Alberta, leadership contests have not been regulated by legislation for very long. That&#39;s a relatively new development. Right, right.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">right. And now what they&#39;ve done is they&#39;ve said, well, it doesn&#39;t kick in until the official announcement of the leadership. So there we can circumvent that. That&#39;s no problem at all. But it&#39;s not just the leadership prior to the official call. We&#39;ve also got the fact that we don&#39;t have any rules, generally speaking, around internal party offices, right? If you want to take over every single constituency association in a party, you can have significant pull over the candidates and policies. There&#39;s no rules around that. Outside writ period, Stephen&#39;s already talked about. Federally, we have campaign expense laws when we&#39;re in writ, but there are no such rules when you&#39;re outside of the writ and you can pretty much put unlimited dollars against it as long as you&#39;re able to raise it. There are always going to be gaps, I guess. Well, there&#39;s a certain law of unintended consequences.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, I think that the only thing that I&#39;m confused about with Jason Kenney&#39;s particular approach to fundraising right now is I had not heard that it was incorporated as a for-profit corporation, but if I were him, I wouldn&#39;t have incorporated at all because at least the last time I was really in-depth with these finance laws, the rule was for an unincorporated association, if you make a contribution to a political entity that&#39;s under the Election Finance and Disclosure Act, all it does is it just it targets back that contribution to the original donor and not the association as a whole so what i mean by that is if i am raising as as you know unite alberta jason kenney&#39;s unincorporated association and i raise i</div>

          <div class="said">don&#39;t know three million dollars and that&#39;s why i&#39;ve put the cap of 30 000 i can literally transfer all of that money to the leadership campaign on day one and it is just targeted back to the individual donor where it originated. So it would have allowed you to bring that money into the leadership contest. Under his current structure, if he&#39;s actually incorporated as a for profit corporation, he has no ability to spend that money as soon as the leadership contest begins. That&#39;s my only confusion about his approach.</div>
