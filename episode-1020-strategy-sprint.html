        <div class="desc"><p>The gang are forced to work together to build strategies for Kyrsten Sinema, Danielle Smith, Jagmeet Singh and Justin Trudeau. Quotes from the movie "Dave" guest star.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter, in an annual Strategists tradition, are subjected to the very-misleadingly-titled "strategy sprint" where Zain asks them to work together define goals, strategies, tactics and messages for politicians from across North America. Can Jagmeet Singh take the mantle of Canada's universal health care champion? Will we be talking about President Kyrsten Sinema in 2025? And is anybody going to call Corey on that "good fences make good neighbours" talk Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And Corey, it should make you very happy as someone who we have known historically as having an unlimited joke budget. Carter, I&#39;m sure, will join us. And if he doesn&#39;t, well, it&#39;s going to be an excellent episode. This is now, I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s clear, Corey. The 12th in a row. The 12th in a row.

I will start a timer and we&#39;ll have 12 minutes on the clock, which will ring. At the end of it, you&#39;ll summarize wherever you&#39;re at. I don&#39;t care even if we&#39;re just struck on goals and if Carter&#39;s killing time, you&#39;ll have to summarize where you&#39;re at and you&#39;ll have to give me everything else that you haven&#39;t completed in the moment. It will be an improv game. If at that 12 minute mark you haven&#39;t done strategy or tactics or message, you&#39;ll have to make it up on the fly. You&#39;re going to have to give me a fully baked four pillar strategy for each of the things I&#39;m going to mention. The second thing is we&#39;ll alternate on who starts first. We&#39;ll have between you and Carter going first. And I am absolutely aware that Stephen Carter is not here by the time I&#39;ve given all these rules. And you know what makes that great, Corey?

The first one, Kristen Sinema. We&#39;re going to the United States before we come to Canada. She is a senator from Arizona. She is now leaving the Democratic Party. She&#39;s becoming an independent. Corey Hogan, I need you to outline going forward for her what her goals are, what her strategy is. Between you guys, Carter, you&#39;re building off Corey. You&#39;re not competing with them. You two are a team. goals strategy tactic message cory you start with goals i go to carter for strategy tactics message 12 minutes on the clock starting now cory what are her goals now that she&#39;s an independent doesn&#39;t necessarily leave the senate at lurch but she&#39;s an independent um and and perhaps a vote that the democrats were counting on some key key bills and heading into 2024</div>

          <div class="said">Well, yeah, at the start, it&#39;s just maintaining and building a profile. So for me, the tactics she needs to focus on are lists and money, right? And because that&#39;s a lot of where relevance comes from. The two are, you know, they support each other. They&#39;re not mutually exclusive. So building lists, I think you&#39;re talking to people and you&#39;re saying things like, I I want to work with like-minded people from coast to coast who believe the party system is breaking America. I want to encourage your representatives to not be so slavish to the left or the right, but to put America before party.</div>

          <div class="said">And then you get them to be brilliant in the list and you talk about ways that you&#39;re going to encourage that kind of activity going on. And so after all of your speeches about putting America before party, you also mentioned the creation of a new PAC, a new super PAC, America Before Party PAC, right? right? ABP PAC. And it&#39;s going to go out and it&#39;s going to spend money to encourage people who elect independent-minded senators and representatives who are going to stand up to their parties and do what&#39;s right for their community. And to signal to the moderate Republicans you might be thinking about along the way, well, you know what? One of the first people that you float as somebody who would have been a great person to give money to and an example of why you need something like that. Let&#39;s talk about Liz Cheney. Liz Cheney should have had support. Look at what she did there. So you do the classic Stephen Carter where you wrap your arms around the people that you want to support you and you try to show your reasonableness by saying Liz Cheney should have had some support.</div>

And I suspect in at least conversation with her Senator colleagues in the Democratic Party. But if you wanted to make more of a show, the next time they do something that is unpopular with the public as a whole, there&#39;s your media hook, no longer caucusing with the Democrats. You need a true independent caucus here. This is no longer working, right? At a certain point, you&#39;ve just got to stand up and you&#39;ve got to say enough is enough. I&#39;m the only person willing to call bullshit in this chamber. That&#39;s the benefit of being an independent.

Carter, I&#39;m going to come back to you on tactics, and Corey&#39;s going to round us out with message. But, Carter, you get the ball rolling. And you get to directionally choose now that the Alberta Sovereignty Act has passed with those amendments that we talked about in the previous episodes, kind of stripping out some of those superpowers for cabinet. Stephen Carter, the clock starts right now. What are the goals for Danielle Smith with the Sovereignty Act passing?</div>

So I think I would make my fights on that. I think it would be about the carbon tax.

And frankly, Albertans know best what works for Albertans. That&#39;s why the constitution has given us this sovereign authority as a province. It&#39;s why we have responsibility for local concerns, because local governments know best how to address local concerns. It&#39;s time for Ottawa to butt out.</div>

And And I&#39;m sorry to Canadians because it&#39;s clear to me that we are not. It&#39;s clear to me that he sees health care as an annoyance, whereas I see it as a right, an obligation of government to fulfill part of our birthright as Canadians to have universal health care. So I am today announcing the end of our supply agreement, which is not to say I&#39;m going to bring the government down tomorrow. But it&#39;s to say that the government, if it wants a single other vote from us, is going to have to write this right now, right now. And I won&#39;t accept anything less than that. And so I&#39;m no longer asking, I&#39;m telling, the Prime Minister will meet with the premiers in the next two weeks, or else we will bring his government down.</div>

It indicates that Trudeau&#39;s pandemic spending wasted billions, probably doesn&#39;t surprise many, that they overpaid as much as $32 billion, that there was big price tags over $200 billion for fiscal supports to individuals and businesses. And there now seems to be the ongoing tug of war, Stephen Carter, to define the pandemic spending era. Was it good? Was it not? In this case, Corey, I&#39;m going to get you to begin on our goals. And you are going to play Justin Trudeau and the liberals. You are the governing party. This is your two plus years of pandemic spending. This was in many ways in the moment considered to be a masterstroke of efficiency, how quickly your government could move, celebrated across the world for helping people quickly and swiftly, keeping the economy afloat. If you remember at that time, the stock market was doing great. We kind of had bounce back job growth. We&#39;re now relitigating this in a very different time. High inflation, people expecting the recession to hit, job losses, etc. We are at relitigating pandemic spending and perhaps sending it off on a legacy trajectory of some sort. And Corey Hogan, you are helping Justin Justin Trudeau and the liberals. What would your goals be here if you are the governing liberal party on this?</div>
