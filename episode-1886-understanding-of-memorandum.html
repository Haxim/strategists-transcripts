            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">uh should we talk about it i guess let&#39;s talk about it we i want to break this down in well three quarters talking about the pipeline stuff and then i do want to actually and the reason i&#39;m saying this out loud is just to remind myself because as you know this this show uh works on I want to talk about the UCP AGM and their convention that they&#39;re having and what are the ramifications of all that sort of pipeline talk related to that particular group. But let&#39;s start here.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Shannon, Stephen, we now have an MOU.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It exists. It is real. It is, as predicted, not several dozen pages. It is two or three pages. It is very short. Danielle</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Danielle Smith signed it yesterday alongside Mark Carney in Calgary. He then gave a speech to two standing ovations at the Calgary Chamber of Commerce to 1,000-plus people. Carter, Shannon, we can talk about the details of the MOU or the lack thereof, but I want to spend the majority of it on the strategy side of things for each of the relevant parties. But give me your take, Stephen Carter, in terms of when you first saw it, what stuck out to you or what sticks out for you in terms of the MOU itself? And, Shannon, same question, and then I&#39;ll add some details along the way. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that if we&#39;re talking about the big takeaway, the big takeaway for me was the pipeline, right? The pipeline, the promised pipeline, which has to have a private proponent by July 1st, 2026, which I thought was a super tight timeline. And I saw Carney commenting on it, saying if there wasn&#39;t private dollars, there wouldn&#39;t be a pipeline, which I had</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">had hoped he would be saying, because I just don&#39;t see a private proponent coming around in the next seven months to build a multi, multi-billion dollar project, even if that multi, multi-billion dollar project is backed by the governments of Canada and the government of Alberta. Um, I just don&#39;t see that happening. Uh, I just don&#39;t, you know, I think that this is a great memorandum of understanding for, uh, Danielle Smith to wave around at her AGM as you&#39;ve, as you&#39;ve kind of alluded to, but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but it is a more important document, uh, for</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for Carney when it all starts to fall apart and he has to have a new election in a few, uh, in a few months, uh, or a few years time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Shannon, what&#39;s your main takeaway? And we&#39;ll get into some of the details in terms of what it does show uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">uh my main takeaway is that this is a major signal to uh oil and gas investors that they can place capital here uh without any of the uh other uncertainties that had been placed in or that they had that they had heretofore said were barriers to them placing capital the clean electricity regulations so uh moving those aside means that you can invest in natural gas, fire electricity generation anywhere in the country, because I think we all know that an exemption for Alberta is basically icing the policy entirely, that there would no longer be any oil and gas cap regulations that were still TBD.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And so if you wanted to make an investment in any kind of primary production in Alberta or elsewhere, that you wouldn&#39;t have to factor that in to your risk outlook for that investment. And that, you know, linear infrastructure of many kinds, not just the North Coast, but other types of investments in linear transportation infrastructure for oil and gas, that those would be at not just at not frustrated by an oil and gas cap or or other forms of regulation but uh would also be declared in the in the national interest so this isn&#39;t just for a pipeline to the as yet notional to the north coast but any other type of infrastructure that people were looking at whether it was an expansion of existing infrastructure or or uh new investments up to you know churchill or east west interconnectivity or those kinds of things so it was rolling out the red carpet for that and saying there are no longer any uh impediments right so we&#39;re back to harper era kind of uh regulatory environment there uh and harper era approach uh which is anything goes but harper plus uh which is that um if you know environmental assessment gets in your way or any of those kinds of of laws we&#39;ll move those aside for you as well on that side so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">so it says that to me um and that&#39;s what it&#39;s saying to uh global investment community and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">and it&#39;s also saying also</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">also on uh climate even the stuff that we&#39;re going to keep around</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">around industrial carbon pricing that kind of stuff also negotiable uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">uh with alberta and therefore for the country so uh and that the on the climate side like methane negotiable industrial price negotiable it&#39;s baked right there into the agreement we&#39;re We&#39;re going into negotiations on this because there&#39;s all kinds of ways for 170 or 130, depend on who you talk to, whether that&#39;s a carbon price that&#39;s a bit of a mannequin in the window. There&#39;s all kinds of complexity behind it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">you know, it&#39;s basically saying to investors, you don&#39;t have anything to worry about in terms of climate or natural resource policy. You can place capital here. If there&#39;s capital to be placed, place</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, you want to get in on this, and then I want to talk about strategy and stagecraft, which is the heart of this show.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I just think that, you know, Shannon&#39;s view of the document, my view of the document, has some variances. And I think it specifically is varied around climate policy. And, you know, I think that she&#39;s right. Right. A whole bunch of pre-existing climate requirements have been eliminated, but they&#39;ve been replaced with an effective carbon tax. And that carbon tax is going to be an effective rate. I think it&#39;s one hundred and thirty dollars. And if it is at that level suddenly, you know, and goes up from there, suddenly projects like Pathways become viable. And we could really start to see a reduction in carbon output from the</span>

They didn&#39;t talk about this as being a fake pipeline. They didn&#39;t talk about this as being bullshit. They largely agreed that Semo used a good thing, but we need more.

If the federal government gets off its duff and actually pays attention to the concept of the Canada Health Act, I will note that the Liberal Party of Canada is always very, very quick to take credit for Pearson&#39;s bringing in of this, of the Canada Health Act, but then not so quick to defend its principles. Anyway, so I think there&#39;s that piece, but also there&#39;s this, the role of the industrial carbon price now comes into, as a bit of a touch, like a conflict point, an axis of conflict. You already had Rob Anderson out last night saying, yeah, this is a big win for us. And it&#39;s, you know, don&#39;t worry, you know, like heavy industry is fine with the, you know, the escalating to 130 effective price. There&#39;s all kinds of ways. I&#39;m not going to get into it. It&#39;s very weedy to do jiggery pokery with the industrial carbon price and the credit system and how it all works together.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But the way they phrased it looked like Corey Hogan was advocating. It was almost like an ad that Corey Hogan took out with a good photo of Corey Hogan and said, I, Corey Corey Hogan MP am going to do the following things. So I now want everyone to know that that was not an ad by Corey Hogan, but if it was very nice, very nice because it was even read. I know this is what I&#39;m talking about. They, they, they really missed it on the design aspect because it looked like Corey was promoting these things that he then accomplished. She was like, Hey, in the next six months, I&#39;m going to do all these things. And then he did. So for whatever that&#39;s worth, Carter, Carter, give me your take on what this does for Mr. Hogan&#39;s chances for re-election, an interested party amongst this crowd.

            <span class="text">Well, the upside is that his numbers went up when he was punching away against Trump. And so to Carter&#39;s point, having a being in a grieved party is is usually good for an incumbent government and has somebody else to blame for your problems. And it allows him to also be shown to the people of British Columbia as someone who is smart and strong and funny and, you know, nuanced and focused on the things they&#39;re focused on, which is economic growth.

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">framed up their opposition to this thing. You notice yesterday, I don&#39;t think he said the words climate change once. He talked about the coastal First Nations and their choices, including economic development for other projects. And he talked about BC&#39;s commitment to economic development and jobs and new projects. Those were his grounds of disagreement on this thing. So it allows him to say that message over and over and over again. We&#39;re</span>

And so there&#39;s these flags randomly being flown like, you know, you&#39;re the scouts troop in the local candy parade on Canada Day, it made no sense at all. Periodically, the crowd would cheer when he would say something, but they weren&#39;t really connected. They weren&#39;t, you know, making eye contact with him. They were like way behind. So he would just say things and then randomly there would be these, you know, like please clap moments coming from behind him. It was awful. It was a crime against visuals. He would have been better off either by himself or with a team of ministers investors behind him if we were going to do it outside uh outside is fine but uh it did run the risk of looking quite drab and looking like uh uh rishi sunak uh launching the uk campaign in the rain yes</span>
