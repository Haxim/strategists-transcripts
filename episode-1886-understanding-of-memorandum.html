        <p>NEW EP: Episode 1886: Understanding of Memorandum</p><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dive into the generational, transformative MOU between the Canada and Alberta. They explain what it actually means, what it definitely doesn’t, and why everyone involved is already gaming out the best and worst case scenarios. Is everyone suddenly buying pipelines? Who actually gained (and who got played)? And how up to date is Carter on the latest trends? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p>Get your live show tickets now!<br /><a href="http://strategistslive.show" target="_blank">http://strategistslive.show</a></p>

          <div class="said">uh my main takeaway is that this is a major signal to uh oil and gas investors that they can place capital here uh without any of the uh other uncertainties that had been placed in or that they had that they had heretofore said were barriers to them placing capital the clean electricity regulations so uh moving those aside means that you can invest in natural gas, fire electricity generation anywhere in the country, because I think we all know that an exemption for Alberta is basically icing the policy entirely, that there would no longer be any oil and gas cap regulations that were still TBD.</div>

          <div class="said">And so if you wanted to make an investment in any kind of primary production in Alberta or elsewhere, that you wouldn&#39;t have to factor that in to your risk outlook for that investment. And that, you know, linear infrastructure of many kinds, not just the North Coast, but other types of investments in linear transportation infrastructure for oil and gas, that those would be at not just at not frustrated by an oil and gas cap or or other forms of regulation but uh would also be declared in the in the national interest so this isn&#39;t just for a pipeline to the as yet notional to the north coast but any other type of infrastructure that people were looking at whether it was an expansion of existing infrastructure or or uh new investments up to you know churchill or east west interconnectivity or those kinds of things so it was rolling out the red carpet for that and saying there are no longer any uh impediments right so we&#39;re back to harper era kind of uh regulatory environment there uh and harper era approach uh which is anything goes but harper plus uh which is that um if you know environmental assessment gets in your way or any of those kinds of of laws we&#39;ll move those aside for you as well on that side so</div>

A whole bunch of pre-existing climate requirements have been eliminated, but they&#39;ve been replaced with an effective carbon tax. And that carbon tax is going to be an effective rate. I think it&#39;s one hundred and thirty dollars. And if it is at that level suddenly, you know, and goes up from there, suddenly projects like Pathways become viable.

I want to break it down to four players that I think are interesting to me from a strategy perspective. What I want to do is talk about what their most optimal strategy is in this situation, what they&#39;re trying to do, and then the risks or the holes in that based on your assessment. And let me start with perhaps a tertiary player, maybe not even secondary, which is Nahid Nenshi and the Alberta NDP. I&#39;m very curious to get your take in what they said, which was pretty much saying this is a good step for Alberta. We need more than this, but this was a good step.</div>

And then B, you know, just give me a sense of what&#39;s the best thing that could happen for them with this play and what&#39;s the worst thing that could happen, the risks that kind of present themselves with this play. And I&#39;ll kind of keep that same format across Carney, Smith, and then Eby. But let&#39;s start with Nenshi because I find that interesting. They didn&#39;t talk about this as being a fake pipeline. They didn&#39;t talk about this as being bullshit. They largely agreed that Semo used a good thing, but we need more.

And I think Carter started highlighting some of the risks. No private proponent found. She wore those pieces of paper, et cetera. But give me the best case scenario and then also touch on what you think the worst case scenario of her strategic play is.</div>

Anyway, so I think there&#39;s that piece, but also there&#39;s this, the role of the industrial carbon price now comes into, as a bit of a touch, like a conflict point, an axis of conflict. You already had Rob Anderson out last night saying, yeah, this is a big win for us.

It&#39;s extremely complicated and weedy, therefore hard for, you know, guys like Poliaver to make fetch happen in terms of the conflict around it. But it remains the point of contention. And the way you know that is, you know, Rob Anderson was already out last night tweeting about how like 130 is NBD and we can make it work for Alberta because it won&#39;t actually be real.</div>

Conventions bring out the more radical folks or the more sort of extreme folks within a party, regardless of stripe. The more activist base, I guess, is a friendlier way to say it. Like, can she hold this up as a W with a liberal prime minister when she was supposed to be Alberta first? I thought she was on fucking my side.

So I now want everyone to know that that was not an ad by Corey Hogan, but if it was very nice, very nice because it was even read. I know this is what I&#39;m talking about. They, they, they really missed it on the design aspect because it looked like Corey was promoting these things that he then accomplished. She was like, Hey, in the next six months, I&#39;m going to do all these things. And then he did.

And so there&#39;s these flags randomly being flown like, you know, you&#39;re the scouts troop in the local candy parade on Canada Day, it made no sense at all. Periodically, the crowd would cheer when he would say something, but they weren&#39;t really connected. They weren&#39;t, you know, making eye contact with him. They were like way behind. So he would just say things and then randomly there would be these, you know, like please clap moments coming from behind him. It was awful. It was a crime against visuals. He would have been better off either by himself or with a team of ministers investors behind him if we were going to do it outside uh outside is fine but uh it did run the risk of looking quite drab and looking like uh uh rishi sunak uh launching the uk campaign in the rain yes</div>
