        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about #DNCleaks and the start of the Democratic Convention. Did Debbie Wasserman-Schultz need to resign? Did Bernie Sanders do what he needed to? And what time is nap time for the California delegation?

Unfortunately, there was the Munich shootings at a McDonald&#39;s, which changed the channel, you know, for them. But then they did bring out their vice presidential pick later that day. and it you know they had about uh you know 12 hours of peace and peace being they were just thinking about donald trump in the end of his convention but unfortunately then</div>

          <div class="said">yeah and some suggestions as to how they could make his road a bit rockier questions about his religion right etc etc the second big bucket of concern it raises is the about donors they they talked about donors in very negative and crass fashion you know they&#39;re going to be seated as far back as possible fuck that guy he&#39;s you know not giving enough money whatever yeah and then the third bucket is one that i think people should keep half an eye on is a bit of concerning and it&#39;s spreadsheets effectively if this person gave x here&#39;s what they&#39;re getting y and that starts to look very uh you know graft like a transaction i gave a donation and i&#39;ve got this government appointment or whatnot i think that&#39;s a bit of a sleeper issue here people should be aware of but ultimately all of these emails happened underneath the tenure of debbie wasserman schultz who herself sent emails talking about not particularly being fond of bernie sanders seeming really out of touch, asking how she could get tickets to Hamilton, etc. And frankly, this is not just Bernie who&#39;s been calling for her head. She&#39;s well known not to be particularly well liked by the president, Barack Obama. The Clinton camp didn&#39;t have a lot of love for her.</div>

And you know that somebody after you is always going to be reading your emails and looking for a bit of a scapegoat or has that ability to do so. So I was always very careful about what was in my emails. I can&#39;t believe that the Democrats wouldn&#39;t have taken a similar approach there. I thought they were surprisingly lax.

Whenever you do work with a government, there&#39;s a risk that your files will be foiled. Right. FOIPed in Alberta, FOIA and a lot of other jurisdictions. Basically, Freedom of Information Act requests to see all of your interactions with the government. And that&#39;s happened, I think, to all of us in different cases. Just, you know, they want to see that information and you work with the privacy commissioner or whatnot. not and basically as soon as you get word of that even before the scope has been defined by the privacy commissioner you go back and you say okay is there anything that either in or out of context could potentially get us in trouble do we need to contextualize something but you have this conversation you have this conversation you sit down you review all of your communication and the challenge you have by the way in a lot of cases when you do work with the government as a bit of an aside is that almost no professional is ever going to comment on client work right And so you&#39;re not able to defend yourself in this situation. It&#39;s up to the government to frame it however they want, and they can easily throw you under the bus if they want, if there&#39;s anything that&#39;s challenging. You&#39;re not able to contextualize things. So you need to go through and you need to understand exactly what your exposure is. And I can&#39;t understand that the Democrats didn&#39;t have a better setup for that and a better understanding of what might be coming. me. Carter,</div>

          <div class="said">with putting your thumb on the scale in general around the dnc around the issue of bernie sanders okay two things though that i think are really important here one bernie sanders was asked by the Democrats if he was going to run for president to do it within the confines of the Democratic Party so that there would not be a third-party candidate that could potentially splinter. Now, if the next time there&#39;s a very progressive candidate comes along and is asked the same thing by Democrats, I think they&#39;re going to look at that a bit differently based on Bernie Sanders&#39; experience. So I think there&#39;s a certain trust thing there that you have to consider. The other thing is that they were so on the record with no, we are neutral, no, we are neutral, And then some of these are blatantly contradicted by the emails, some of the reactions they&#39;ve had, which is just going to create an institutional distrust between the progressive and establishment wings of the party. That, to me, is a bigger problem than this week. This week will be papered over. You&#39;re going to look at Sanders supporters, and Sanders supporters are going to be mad, but they were always going to be sad and mad. And you&#39;re always going to have that visual of some woman crying as Sanders says, I&#39;m not going to be the nominee. Dominique.</div>

Actually, you know what? I should mention, do you recall when we were talking last August about who we thought Hillary Clinton&#39;s vice presidential pick might be? You listed four people and one of them turned out to be the guy? No, I said Tim Kaine was the top of my list, and here we are. Tim Kaine. This is just the kind of wisdom and prognostication I bring to the show here. But the bump, I think it&#39;s important for people out there to keep in mind, like the don&#39;t panic thing that we were saying to people earlier remains. You always get a convention bump. he got a very traditional convention bump three to four points right yeah we&#39;ll see if it holds i do think he put on the table some narratives that could carry him through november if the democrats don&#39;t get their act together but generally speaking this is this is not a shocking shocking amount of movement for a candidate coming out of a major convention carter yeah add to that</div>
