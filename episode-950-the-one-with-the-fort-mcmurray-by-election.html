Corey, but just to fill in the audience, QAnon supporters have reportedly gathered in Dallas, Texas. Well, they did in anticipation of the return of JFK Jr., who they believe was going to announce 2024 presidential run for Donald Trump. Of course, JFK has been dead for 22 years. And this is, of course, the latest claim from the QAnon movement that believes that the world is run by a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles.

Apparently, they bought into the Canadian Materials Company. Stephen Carter, you are, of course, a fan of meme stocks. You&#39;re a big GameStop fan.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">speaking of working great uh here is probably my favorite headline i have read in the last six months this one comes to us from ctv news ontario man says he found rocks in president&#39;s choice frozen berries carter and was offered 300 in points if he kept quiet that&#39;s right an ontario man who says there are rocks in his frozen president&#39;s choice berries and he was offered 300 in compensations to shut the fuck up about it uh the resident of oshawa said that he and his wife were preparing smoothies for their children last month when they found several foreign objects in one of their children&#39;s bowls they were then offered 300 not in cash but at a pc optimum point points uh to not say anything uh cory it seems like uh safe to say uh he did not redeem the points well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well first of all those points are better than cash yeah because with the low low prices at president&#39;s choice brands i you&#39;ve got nothing to lose by taking the points instead you&#39;re going to use it you&#39;re going to buy bread that was uh priced too highly these things are just going to happen it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s fine it&#39;s great second of all where do people think berries come come from? Fields. Fields full of rocks. You know what we call that? We call that organic. You owe them 300 president&#39;s choice points, in my opinion. Oh,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, it&#39;s very cogent logic. Stephen Carter, this man finding a rock in his president&#39;s choice blueberries, frozen blueberries, of course, frozen in government subsidized freezers. We&#39;re a lot of deep cuts on this show already. But Stephen Carter, over to you.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I found some rocks in my berries, and it ultimately cost me $300 to have them removed so it was also very painful um but i&#39;ve recovered now and the surgeon says it&#39;s probably going to be okay i</span>

Clearly, Air Canada CEO apologizes, commits to learning French as backlash in Quebec grows. Corey, Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau has apologized and committed to improving his French amid heavy backlash by federal and Quebec officials who called his recent comments about not needing to speak French despite having lived in Montreal for 14 years shocking and disrespectful. He said, quote, I want to clarify that I did not in any way mean to disrespect Quebecers and Francophones across the country. I apologize for those who were offended by my words. He</span>

            <span class="text">He officially said that today I&#39;m committed to improving my French, the official language of Canada, the language he used in quebec cory this was all part of his kind of 26 minutes speech that he delivered in montreal he spoke french for about 20 seconds of it uh he got some questions from the media afterwards of course uh the media in this case were part of our flare airlines school of journalism uh graduates so congratulations to them uh they asked him about his lack of french and he said i don&#39;t need to learn french i got along in montreal just fine is this overblown is this like pandering to quebec heck, is this like a crazy story? Or is this legitimate in your mind when you see it from Air Canada? And then we&#39;ll talk about the communications sort of ramifications and how they dealt with it.</span>

            <span class="text">think it&#39;s all of the above. And it really depends on your lens. There&#39;s a lot of characters here who acted in what let&#39;s call it a suboptimal fashion. And let&#39;s start with Rousseau. How you live in Montreal for 14 years and not understand that your comments would would be taken</span>

            <span class="text">taken in a very dim light is just absolutely beyond me. The city of Montreal is perpetually in conversation as to whether there&#39;s too much English. It&#39;s been going on my entire life. And to say that you&#39;ve lived there for 14 years, well, it sounds like maybe your house was there. It doesn&#39;t sound like you actually lived there, if that&#39;s how little insight you have into the city of Montreal and the psyche of Montreal. Air Canada itself is a a very weird organization, because Air Canada was a crown corporation at one point, and there are still these vestiges of government control on Air Canada. The Official Languages Act applies to it. So yet another reason why you probably should have known better than to step into it here. But also, it creates a very weird dynamic, because other airlines don&#39;t have that consideration. You&#39;ll remember, well, maybe you won&#39;t, but when WestJet began, there</span>

And so there</span>

            <span class="text">there is also that. And there needs to be an appreciation of that. I mean, just try to put on your hat. Imagine you&#39;re sitting in Edmonton. If you&#39;re listening to this podcast in Edmonton and imagine there was a CEO who came from Quebec and said, I&#39;m not going to bother learning English.</span>

So there is some substance here, too. I don&#39;t want to make it sound like it&#39;s just histrionics. I don&#39;t believe it is. I think it&#39;s more than an optics challenge that the CEO has because it shows sort of a disregard for the predominant language in the area. But, you know, I do get to this point of how do you not see this backlash coming? Well,</span>

If you were prepping a CEO of a company, giving a 30-minute sort of keynote-style speech in Quebec, and you know he&#39;s going to speak for 20 seconds, you&#39;ve helped him prepare the remarks, how would you have armed him to perhaps minimize or blunt the criticism that, of course, he was going to get? And perhaps you may suggest that maybe they were tone-deaf enough to think they weren&#39;t going to get the criticism, but let&#39;s just maybe blow past that.</span>

But he should have said, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t speak French particularly well. I&#39;m struggling to learn this language as as it is. I think it is important, but this is, you know, let me do my three lines and my 20 seconds worth of French, and then if you&#39;ll forgive me, I will revert back now to English so I can stop, you know, destroying the language.</span>

I&#39;d actually unpack it from a strategy perspective. I actually really think you&#39;re framing for the leadership review for Kenny is actually advantageous. It&#39;s not Kenny versus some sort of like messiahic sort of person that could show up. It&#39;s like this guy. Okay. Now, if I&#39;m in the caucus then, right, let&#39;s start here with this question. Or if I&#39;ve got leadership potential, am I trying to do anything now that Gene is, you know, not denying that leadership is on his mind? He&#39;s even said in some of these early interviews that if Albertans would have me, I&#39;d love to do the job. Clearly, you&#39;re looking at this guy implicitly and explicitly for the top job if he enters the fray. Ray, suppose I&#39;m sitting in that caucus right now, there&#39;s a leadership review, and then the guy that might be the heir apparent, or at least the first to throw his hat in the ring to replace him, what moves do I think I need to make in the interim between now and leadership review to maybe muddle the question of what that leadership review might be about a bit?</span>

Otherwise, you get Brian Jean. And if it&#39;s about Brian Jean, it&#39;s about Brian Jean. I think that one of the things that will be very interesting to see over the next bit is if Jason Kenney takes this moment, all of this that has occurred, and uses it as an opportunity to bluntly</span>

There are factions of people trying to get rid of Jason Kenney. Jason Jason Kenney&#39;s under attack from all sides, and what this does is if Corey goes through with his Brian Jean is my enemy strategy, that points the finger all at one person, and you&#39;re relatively clean now.

And Brian Jean is highly likely to win that by-election. So what he needs to do is if he&#39;s not going to sign the papers, he needs to make sure he&#39;s lining up the absolute A-team of campaigners and an absolute all-star candidate. Finding that all-star candidate, someone who represents the United Conservative Party, like the PCs and or the Wild Rose, who&#39;s going to stand in the face of Brian Jean and say, you know what, Brian, we couldn&#39;t win when you were the leader.</span>

You&#39;ve got to think about the moves that your opponents might be doing, too, and how they might be trying to position you. And one of the things that is obviously going to come at Brian Jean, because you&#39;re already seeing whisper campaigns about it, is it&#39;s all about him. It&#39;s not about the movement. So you&#39;ve got to make it all about the movement, not about him. And I think that that humility that Stephen talked about is exactly what you&#39;ve got to carry into this, at least in your municipal campaign. And you&#39;ve got to go around and when you&#39;re door knocking, make a bit of a show of like, well, I&#39;ve always been clear. Like I started by saying, I do not support this leader. I believe in the grassroots. I&#39;m here to vote for you. And if Jason Kenney were to kick me out of the caucus for voting in support of you, so be it.

There&#39;s a lot of controversy around this because, of course, now the scenario of raising the flags on the 11th to lower them again is one that&#39;s been accepted by Indigenous leaders.
