        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Erin O'Toole's ouster and the ongoing protests in Ottawa through a supersized segment of "Fine, Fabulous or F--ked". What does O'Toole's defeat mean for the Conservative Party? How did the Ottawa Police come off so unprepared? And why does Stephen Carter get to go to so many restaurants these days? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

And I guess that&#39;s why I would give the answer that I gave. It&#39;s pretty troubling to think about why Aaron O&#39;Toole was dropped, because it&#39;s not that he was necessarily dropped because of an inept election performance. That was true a month ago, right? That was true when the Reform Act was first brought on. But it would appear to any outside observer that he was dropped because he was unwilling to go far enough on things like meeting with the convoy on on, you know, there was some reporting, take it all with a grain of salt, because the reporting at the at the end of Rome is always a little questionable, but that it was it had to do with some of his votes on social issues. And if that is true, if really he lost his job because he couldn&#39;t hit the test that the party put for him, well, that&#39;s very problematic because it suggests that the next leader is probably going to be further outside of the Canadian mainstream.

          <div class="said">Well, I think it&#39;s fucked. I think that, you know, Aaron O&#39;Toole didn&#39;t do that badly in the election and he was trying to appeal to the larger electorate. But the problem is when you&#39;re trying to appeal to the larger electorate in a party that has no desire to appeal to the larger electorate, you wind up getting screwed. So this has been the problem with leaders all the way through. I mean, even Harper, you know, did suffer from having two caucuses. He just managed it better because it was newer. He was able to hold it together because he&#39;d brought it together. So this is this is something we&#39;ve talked about a few times. You know, the only person who can hold these these two things together seems to be the person who found it. And in the case of Jason Kenney, for example, that doesn&#39;t even appear to be the case. So I think that right now we&#39;ve got Aaron O&#39;Toole suffering this blow that isn&#39;t a result of his performance, but as a result of the situation that he&#39;s in, running a caucus that is fundamentally different than the Canadian electorate. I mean, what did we say today? 87% of people in Ottawa, Ottawaans,</div>

And it&#39;s only recently that they&#39;ve started to push away from it because the caucus wants to embrace these people.

          <div class="said">Yeah, well, the central tension of O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership just ended up being too much. It&#39;s exactly what Stevens described. I thought for what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m not going to sit here and Monday morning quarterback. I thought he did what the conservatives needed. I thought he took control of a party that was already too beholden to its more fringe elements by saying the things that would get him the job. And then he hard tacked towards the center when the election came. Now, two problems. One is people</div>

          <div class="said">people are going to have a hard time trusting your word at that point, right? The other problem is that if the election doesn&#39;t happen right away, you&#39;re sitting there and you&#39;re playing footsie with the right of your party for too long. So, you know, ultimately, how do we sum up Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership here? He ran to the right to become leader. He ran to the center for the election. He lost the election because of the stuff on the right, and he lost the leadership because of the stuff in the center. And, and that is the final word on Aaron O&#39;Toole. It was just it was too clever by half. And, and unfortunately, I think his party perceives his loss in the election as a failure because he ran to the center. Whereas I think many observers, including myself would say it was because of the things on the right. It was the gun stuff. It was some of the healthcare stuff. It was how close he seemed to Jason Kenney at a time when Alberta was going through a fourth wave. And, you know, people take the lessons they want. Election debriefs are always kind of Rorschach tests. And the Conservative Party has made it really clear what their particular psychosis is. I</div>

          <div class="said">I want to move on to our next question. Carter, I want to ask you this, you know, our mutual friend for all three of us, Kyle Olson posted a really interesting analysis on the fundraising apparatus that is the Conservative Party of Canada and how money, especially the micro dollar money that the party in the country with the largest membership, the Conservative Conservative Party of Canada, how it has almost a power base outside of the leader&#39;s office, responding to key moments with your dollar, sensationalizing the fundraising. Talk to me about what that looks like and that power dynamic within the Conservative Party of Canada. It might lead to the conclusion that Corey was talking about, which potentially favors folks like Pierre Polyevera. But talk to me about fundraising in the conservative circles and whether that could have been part of the downfall, or if you agree that could have been part of the downfall for one Aaron O&#39;Toole who tried to pick or tried to code switch certainly, but then tried to pick more reasonable lanes when it related to mainstream Canadians, which may not have been what the base wanted.</div>

          <div class="said">So when we all worked together, we used to do seven point Likert tests. And we always used to talk about the ones and twos and the sixes and sevens. And the ones and twos and sixes. And sorry, explain to people what a seven point</div>

          <div class="said">point Likert is. So a seven point Likert is like if you&#39;re, do you support the oil and gas industry? Pick seven if If you do pick one, if you don&#39;t, and the ones and twos are on one side, the sixes and sevens are on the other side. And, and in Canadian politics, you can, you can do anything on a, on a seven point likelihood scale, but we always just seven, you can do five, you can do three. It doesn&#39;t really matter.

          <div class="said">we used to do sevens and we talked about the sixes and the sevens, and we talked about the ones and the twos. And the thing with the sixes and the sevens, ones and twos is they are hyper engaged. They know their issues. They know what they care about. They know, and they know their talking points, right? They know, and if it&#39;s oil and gas, they can say what they love about oil and gas. If it&#39;s environmentalism, they can say what they love about environmentalism. It does not matter the issue. But what happens if you&#39;re always talking to the sixes and sevens and ones and twos, you are missing out on the three, fours and fives. And the distribution in general of people in these Likerts is that more people are in the middle because more people don&#39;t care as much. So the people who are on the far right that are giving all this money to the conservative movement are watching their Fox News, are watching their MAGA signals, are watching and listening to their religious affiliations or whatever there might be. And they are getting their talking points and they are then funding their money through to these activities.</div>

But this has kind of created a power base outside of it to almost bring to the leader saying, hey, what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t resonating with the people who are giving us this money.

And then there was one that was a demographically representative sample of Albertans done by a polling firm. We just bought the sample and we ran them through the exact same thing. And it was this really interesting thing that happened where if you looked at just the demographic sample, it was kind of a bulge if you looked at that one to five scale in this case from left to right. And you saw that most people lived in the middle. Like, do you feel strongly about this on one side? Do you feel strongly on this other side? Nah, really, I&#39;m sort of in the the middle. But when you looked at the one that was the anybody could do it, opt in one, it was self-select. Yeah. And all of a sudden it was everybody with intense opinions at ones and sevens.

He did a Facebook Live video, five minutes or so, nicely produced, talked about what happened that afternoon or that morning, I should say, how he was voted out, how he&#39;d be resigning as the leader of the Conservative Party by extension. And then his main takeaway was lessons to his party, as well as the prime minister that said, listen to the other side. I&#39;m curious what you thought of that message. Was that exit that he&#39;s staying on as an MP? He did this video and that was his key message. Fine, fabulous or fucked?

If you step back and you look at it from a more strategic, long-term view, though, a lot of what Stephen says, I&#39;d agree with. And I want to add, there is always a next leader. And you&#39;ve created an environment where this is your go-to And this is your response. I mean, just look at just look at Australia. Look at the United Kingdom.

This was a caucus coup in the case of Aaron O&#39;Toole. And coup&#39;s not accurate. Like, they used the Reform Act. They followed all of the rules, right? But when you talk about Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership contest, it&#39;s a very different kind of vote. It&#39;s that we&#39;ve discussed it on this show before, but ultimately you&#39;re going to go to Red Deer. You&#39;re going to cast ballot as a member if you pay a fee, and then you&#39;re going to see the yeas or the nays there. I don&#39;t think it makes it more likely he survives the leadership contest. test, I don&#39;t think it seriously damages it.

          <div class="said">I&#39;m hearing? I do, for a couple of different reasons. One of them is whenever these things happen and people look at the reaction, there&#39;s the possibility they say, okay, maybe that won&#39;t work out very very well, right? Because the consequences are so abstract until you actually see it. And then the other reason is simple bandwidth distraction. There is now a federal conservative leadership contest going on.

So he chose a moment where he had maximum kind of right-wing media darling cred, and he locked up as many of those early endorsements as he could. So it makes an awful lot of sense to me. It was probably the best moment for the next several weeks for sure, maybe even going on month for him to do it, and he did it. So if he was planning to run for leader, this was a very sensible way to do it. The other thing is he tied himself into a broader international conversation, and it&#39;s tough to sit there and look at an Instagram post with 460,000 views on a Sunday night and say, are those 460,000 Canadian views?

People forget that in the 2015 election, which was a wave election, Polyev didn&#39;t win by a ton. It&#39;s not inconceivable to me that he could go down if he becomes this flashpoint of far-right conservatism in his Ottawa riding.

The problem is if he does what he thinks, you know, if he wins the leadership, I think he faces real trouble in his home riding. And I think, you know, this idea that the liberals will, you know, Ottawa will just elect him after this convoy, after this after this situation. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I mean, we&#39;ve I&#39;ve said it a thousand times. Attention spans are short. Right. Every story is three to four days. This is an 11-day convoy.

The protest on Parliament Hill, yes, is the one that we&#39;re all focused on. But these protests have been occurring in every major Canadian city for weeks and months, right?

It is built of wood, right? And these people are setting up bonfires.

          <div class="said">didn&#39;t like when riot police came in with their shields and their and their batons and they would you know bang on the front of it and And then but we developed a new kind of way of policing. And the World Petroleum Congress here in Calgary, I think, was a really good example of that number of years ago. Maybe it was the World Petroleum Congress or Global Petroleum Congress or something like that. But basically, everybody and their dog came and they wanted to protest. And the police were very well prepared. And they had their bikes and they put their bikes out and they allowed people to do peaceful protests within specific zones. Right. So if you stayed within your zone, no problem. and and the police had a excellent response plan it was all mapped out everything worked the way it was supposed to work because the protesters did what they were supposed to do and the police did what they were supposed to do and now that same game plan exists from the one side right from the police side the police side is we&#39;re not going to intervene we&#39;re not going to get in the way of these protesters lest we make a bad situation worse and so what they do is they they make a bad situation worse because now the protesters are allowed to occupy. They&#39;re allowed to march down the street. So whether it&#39;s a simple march where they&#39;re walking down 17th Avenue in Calgary or a parked protest in front of Parliament Hill, those</div>

They care more about the negative publicity than what their civilian oversight wants them to do. And they do not act. And so we have police chiefs that are weak-kneed and not leading their actual police forces. And we wind up with a situation where the police are impotent and the protesters are godlike.

          <div class="said">Police are afraid, right? Is that OK if we say that police are afraid? They are afraid to be taken. They are afraid to act in an aggressive fashion. and they are afraid that the sins of their past will color the potential, their actions of the future. And that should be the case, right? I think that it is good that the police are reflecting on their actions in the past and whether or not they have been too harsh, especially in things like shutting down peaceful protests or, you know, like the 1960s civil rights movements or even the Black Lives Matter movements. in the united states we haven&#39;t seen that though in canada and the reason is in canada our protests were much more civilized and our police were far we&#39;re much more civilized but these are uncivilized protests and we&#39;re still using the civilized response and the police chiefs are looking for strong leadership that says this is okay this is what our community expects expects our community expects that if people are are are putting up piles of gas that are moving in a sauna and a hot tub that you should get them the hell out of there that this is not the type of protest that we want to see our community should be saying that&#39;s too much and that&#39;s where it comes to the civilian boards these unpaid volunteer boards that are scared of their own shadows and they&#39;re not leaders it&#39;s like asking a non-profit society board to take action with a 400 or 600 million dollar police force it just will never happen demand better from the volunteer we these people shouldn&#39;t be volunteers they should be paid they should be experts they should know what they&#39;re talking about and they shouldn&#39;t be afraid to take a stance and direct their police chief to take action when action is appropriate i appreciate</div>

I think the whole point of a protest is to raise some noise and raise some action. And there are many examples of people doing positive change through protest. I think this is dreadful change were they ever to be successful. I don&#39;t want to create a false equivalency between good things and bad things here.

And Corey Or he said, in his perspective, he doesn&#39;t necessarily blame Justin Trudeau. But I want to ask it to you, Carter, in this way. Trudeau and his government&#39;s refusal to meet with the convoy, fine,</div>

And one of the increasing, and I&#39;ll keep the focus on the prime minister, Corey, one of the increasing data points that we&#39;re seeing is that what once was maybe a 90% wedge issue with vaccinations is less so that when people now look at restrictions, and that&#39;s less of a popular wedge issue, if a wedge issue in the prime minister&#39;s favor at all. So it relates to that political risk for Trudeau. I&#39;ll ask it to you in that way. Is it fine? Is it fabulous? Or Or is it fucked, the political risk that Trudeau faces now with growing swells of the population, not just these convoys wanting fewer and fewer restrictions?</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, we flagged this for the past few weeks at the very least. But this is a growing area that the prime minister is going to have to deal with. The sentiment in this country is shifting to one of we&#39;ve got to ease up on restrictions here. And that&#39;s been clear since early January, at least. You saw that with reactions to some of the measures that Ontario brought in, for sure, where there was not a lot of gratitude that schools were going to be closed for, you know, a few more days. Let&#39;s put it that way there. the center is moving on this issue and it&#39;s moving for a lot of reasons one is just straight up fatigue people are so tired of it and i mean we can we can kind of point</div>

I don&#39;t have anything to worry about now. Fuck the kids under five. You know, fuck the people with the comorbidities. I just want to go to, you know, Montana&#39;s and get myself a steak or whatever. I don&#39;t know, right? But there is a certain selfishness in here as well where the fear is gone, right? The fear is gone for so many of us who have now gone through the disease, and all we see are the restrictions in front of us.

And then the Ottawa police probably has to answer some questions about how they were so ill-prepared for this particular situation to begin with, why these requests came, when these requests came. It has to be noted that other provinces in this same country have been able to deal with this, Quebec, British Columbia, even other cities in the same province, right?

So why not just allow yourself to live in that 70%? You&#39;re not going to get them all voting for you, but this is a really good, this is a good opportunity to go back to our six rules for the pandemic and find that safe middle road, not too far to the right, not too far to the left, you know, not too hot, not too cold, the Goldilocks zone for the last bits of COVID.
