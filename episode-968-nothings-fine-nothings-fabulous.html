And certainly in the last couple of weeks, as he kind of limply swung from moderate to I&#39;m going to be whatever you want me to be. And in that case, it&#39;s kind of weird and crazy. It was pretty bad to see and certainly was damaging to the real estate values on O&#39;Toole Island. Are we</span>

            <span class="text">continues its heel turn And really leans into some of the uglier elements that have driven it to this point. And I guess that&#39;s why I would give the answer that I gave. It&#39;s pretty troubling to think about why Aaron O&#39;Toole was dropped, because it&#39;s not that he was necessarily dropped because of an inept election performance. That was true a month ago, right? That was true when the Reform Act was first brought on. But it would appear to any outside observer that he was dropped because he was unwilling to go far enough on things like meeting with the convoy on on, you know, there was some reporting, take it all with a grain of salt, because the reporting at the at the end of Rome is always a little questionable, but that it was it had to do with some of his votes on social issues. And if that is true, if really he lost his job because he couldn&#39;t hit the test that the party put for him, well, that&#39;s very problematic because it suggests that the next leader is probably going to be further outside of the Canadian mainstream. And, you know, I&#39;ve said this up and down, you know, any venue I could in the last week, but people</span>

            <span class="text">just change governments sometimes, you know, even if they don&#39;t have major problems with the government or even if their problems are, you know, legitimate, but the solution is worse. And if we&#39;re in a situation in this country where you have a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a really radicalized conservative party and a liberal party, eventually you&#39;re going to have a really, really radical conservative government in this country. I think that feels almost inevitable, and that&#39;s pretty troubling. We&#39;ll</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;ll save the Pierre Palliot truck, and I want to get into it too because there&#39;s a lot to untangle there if, for example, he is one of the standard bearers for potentially that movement you&#39;re mentioning, Corey. Carter, I want to ask you, for the Conservatives, Aaron O&#39;Toole gone. Fine, fabulous, or fucked? Give me your top line and let&#39;s discuss this a bit more after that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it&#39;s fucked. I think that, you know, Aaron O&#39;Toole didn&#39;t do that badly in the election and he was trying to appeal to the larger electorate. But the problem is when you&#39;re trying to appeal to the larger electorate in a party that has no desire to appeal to the larger electorate, you wind up getting screwed. So this has been the problem with leaders all the way through. I mean, even Harper, you know, did suffer from having two caucuses. He just managed it better because it was newer. He was able to hold it together because he&#39;d brought it together. So this is this is something we&#39;ve talked about a few times. You know, the only person who can hold these these two things together seems to be the person who found it. And in the case of Jason Kenney, for example, that doesn&#39;t even appear to be the case. So I think that right now we&#39;ve got Aaron O&#39;Toole suffering this blow that isn&#39;t a result of his performance, but as a result of the situation that he&#39;s in, running a caucus that is fundamentally different than the Canadian electorate. I mean, what did we say today? 87% of people in Ottawa, Ottawaans,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Ottawaans, I don&#39;t even care, people from Ottawa don&#39;t even want these protesters gone. And the Conservative Party, I mean, I don&#39;t know what they did today, but they basically embraced them for the last eight days. And it&#39;s only recently that they&#39;ve started to push away from it because the caucus wants to embrace these people. The conservative movement wants to be more MAGA and less Aaron O&#39;Toole.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, talk to me about this, this broader appeal that Carter is mentioning, right? You try to be broad, you try to move to the middle, you embrace the Brian Mulroney, you take the true blue and you put on the PC jersey color to try to win the election, O&#39;Toole leaves space. Is that just a rule now? Is that just a lesson that doing that leaves tremendous cleavages within your political party if you&#39;re the Conservative Party of Canada? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, the central tension of O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership just ended up being too much. It&#39;s exactly what Stevens described. I thought for what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m not going to sit here and Monday morning quarterback. I thought he did what the conservatives needed. I thought he took control of a party that was already too beholden to its more fringe elements by saying the things that would get him the job. And then he hard tacked towards the center when the election came. Now, two problems. One is people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people are going to have a hard time trusting your word at that point, right? The other problem is that if the election doesn&#39;t happen right away, you&#39;re sitting there and you&#39;re playing footsie with the right of your party for too long. So, you know, ultimately, how do we sum up Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership here? He ran to the right to become leader. He ran to the center for the election. He lost the election because of the stuff on the right, and he lost the leadership because of the stuff in the center. And, and that is the final word on Aaron O&#39;Toole. It was just it was too clever by half. And, and unfortunately, I think his party perceives his loss in the election as a failure because he ran to the center. Whereas I think many observers, including myself would say it was because of the things on the right. It was the gun stuff. It was some of the healthcare stuff. It was how close he seemed to Jason Kenney at a time when Alberta was going through a fourth wave. And, you know, people take the lessons they want. Election debriefs are always kind of Rorschach tests. And the Conservative Party has made it really clear what their particular psychosis is. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I want to move on to our next question. Carter, I want to ask you this, you know, our mutual friend for all three of us, Kyle Olson posted a really interesting analysis on the fundraising apparatus that is the Conservative Party of Canada and how money, especially the micro dollar money that the party in the country with the largest membership, the Conservative Conservative Party of Canada, how it has almost a power base outside of the leader&#39;s office, responding to key moments with your dollar, sensationalizing the fundraising. Talk to me about what that looks like and that power dynamic within the Conservative Party of Canada. It might lead to the conclusion that Corey was talking about, which potentially favors folks like Pierre Polyevera. But talk to me about fundraising in the conservative circles and whether that could have been part of the downfall, or if you agree that could have been part of the downfall for one Aaron O&#39;Toole who tried to pick or tried to code switch certainly, but then tried to pick more reasonable lanes when it related to mainstream Canadians, which may not have been what the base wanted.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So when we all worked together, we used to do seven point Likert tests. And we always used to talk about the ones and twos and the sixes and sevens. And the ones and twos and sixes. And sorry, explain to people what a seven point</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">point Likert is. So a seven point Likert is like if you&#39;re, do you support the oil and gas industry? Pick seven if If you do pick one, if you don&#39;t, and the ones and twos are on one side, the sixes and sevens are on the other side. And, and in Canadian politics, you can, you can do anything on a, on a seven point likelihood scale, but we always just seven, you can do five, you can do three. It doesn&#39;t really matter. But we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we used to do sevens and we talked about the sixes and the sevens, and we talked about the ones and the twos. And the thing with the sixes and the sevens, ones and twos is they are hyper engaged. They know their issues. They know what they care about. They know, and they know their talking points, right? They know, and if it&#39;s oil and gas, they can say what they love about oil and gas. If it&#39;s environmentalism, they can say what they love about environmentalism. It does not matter the issue. But what happens if you&#39;re always talking to the sixes and sevens and ones and twos, you are missing out on the three, fours and fives. And the distribution in general of people in these Likerts is that more people are in the middle because more people don&#39;t care as much. So the people who are on the far right that are giving all this money to the conservative movement are watching their Fox News, are watching their MAGA signals, are watching and listening to their religious affiliations or whatever there might be. And they are getting their talking points and they are then funding their money through to these activities.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The problem is if you consistently tailor your communications to sixes and sevens, you forget how to communicate to three, fours and fives. and three fours and fives are where the election is won and lost so we have pushed ourselves into money getting situations so the conservative party can get as much money as they want why does rebel news excited it&#39;s not because ezra levant&#39;s good it&#39;s because ezra levant has tailored his stuff to people in the sixes and sevens he knows where those people are and he knows that they send money these also are the same people that were taken advantage of by evangelical evangelical</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Corey, you know, to Carter&#39;s point, the analysis that our friend Kyle did was ultimately saying that the liberals don&#39;t have the same structure of fundraising. A lot of it&#39;s directed within and by the direction of the leader&#39;s office. But this has kind of created a power base outside of it to almost bring to the leader saying, hey, what you&#39;re saying isn&#39;t resonating with the people who are giving us this money. Your thoughts on the dollars and cents and what that, it&#39;s a larger problem than O&#39;Toole, but whether that you feel like that was a contributory factor to his downfall. Yeah,</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I absolutely do. I think it&#39;s a bigger story. And I actually think it&#39;s a bit, I&#39;m not calling Kyle naive, Kyle&#39;s a smart guy, but it&#39;s naive to think that it&#39;s limited to the Conservative Party. In the 90s, in the early 2000s, we were so desperate to get big money out of politics. We</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We kind of failed to understand what would happen when we were so reliant on small all money exclusively right and the thing is most people don&#39;t walk around their life most people are three fours and fives to steven&#39;s point right they don&#39;t walk around thinking about politics all of the time and thinking about how they can engage in politics in any way shape or form so political parties became addicted to the ones and the sevens on basically every issue uh and that&#39;s you know in many ways the conservatives are a little further ahead on this they were the first ones to follow this game that you know this based on their reform party roots and and the grassroots movement that they had built there and um what you find is that it does create this this feedback loop for a party and over time it changes the conversation in the party as a whole it scares out the people who are in the middle right because they&#39;re going to select saying like i don&#39;t want too much to do with this and i&#39;m kind of sick of these mad emails or they are going to to drift into one of those categories here in</span>

            <span class="text">andrew leach and so they uh you know one of the things that i i showed them was we had a survey that was just open to all albertans you know anybody could go and they could give their opinion. And then there was one that was a demographically representative sample of Albertans done by a polling firm. We just bought the sample and we ran them through the exact same thing. And it was this really interesting thing that happened where if you looked at just the demographic sample, it was kind of a bulge if you looked at that one to five scale in this case from left to right. And you saw that most people lived in the middle. Like, do you feel strongly about this on one side? Do you feel strongly on this other side? Nah, really, I&#39;m sort of in the the middle. But when you looked at the one that was the anybody could do it, opt in one, it was self-select. Yeah. And all of a sudden it was everybody with intense opinions at ones and sevens. And they sort of dipped towards the middle there.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But one of the things I think you have to observe about that particular conversation is that at the end of the day, the public conversation looked an awful lot more like the you than it did the hill, right? There was a lot more intense opinions driving it. And that&#39;s because when it comes to these matters, people open</span>

And then his main takeaway was lessons to his party, as well as the prime minister that said, listen to the other side. I&#39;m curious what you thought of that message. Was that exit that he&#39;s staying on as an MP? He did this video and that was his key message. Fine, fabulous or fucked?

And he talked about kind of this need to look across and see all of Canada.

I mean, today&#39;s exhibition of parliamentary moronic tendencies is exactly what the conservatives are going to be faced with. They don&#39;t know which side of the coin they&#39;re on in any given day. One day they&#39;re going after, they love the convoy. The next day they&#39;re going after the prime minister for not getting rid of the convoy. Which is it? Pick a lane. And Candace Bergen doesn&#39;t have the capacity to pick a lane.

We&#39;re on the way up, right? O&#39;Toole&#39;s doing better. I&#39;m doing better. We&#39;re back on track. And throwing over O&#39;Toole sends a signal to your base, your crazies, that says, you know what? If they can do it, we can do it. We have time.

            <span class="text">So you got to watch out for that. And change begets change in these situations. But I ultimately think it&#39;s fine. I just it wasn&#39;t a comparable ousting. This was a caucus coup in the case of Aaron O&#39;Toole. And coup&#39;s not accurate. Like, they used the Reform Act. They followed all of the rules, right? But when you talk about Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership contest, it&#39;s a very different kind of vote. It&#39;s that we&#39;ve discussed it on this show before, but ultimately you&#39;re going to go to Red Deer. You&#39;re going to cast ballot as a member if you pay a fee, and then you&#39;re going to see the yeas or the nays there. I don&#39;t think it makes it more likely he survives the leadership contest. test, I don&#39;t think it seriously damages it. And in many ways, it could be a bit of a release or a relief valve if people sort of say, okay, we&#39;ve had our pound of flesh here.</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m hearing? I do, for a couple of different reasons. One of them is whenever these things happen and people look at the reaction, there&#39;s the possibility they say, okay, maybe that won&#39;t work out very very well, right? Because the consequences are so abstract until you actually see it. And then the other reason is simple bandwidth distraction. There is now a federal conservative leadership contest going on. The same people that you would be counting on to organize against Jason Kenney all of a sudden have something different to do. And that could have serious effects on what comes next. Carter,</span>

If you go back to my discussion about sixes and sevens, right? These are the people who love to volunteer and they, you know, leaderships, having leaderships one on top of the other isn&#39;t such a big deal for them in Alberta.

So he chose a moment where he had maximum kind of right-wing media darling cred, and he locked up as many of those early endorsements as he could. So it makes an awful lot of sense to me. It was probably the best moment for the next several weeks for sure, maybe even going on month for him to do it, and he did it. So if he was planning to run for leader, this was a very sensible way to do it. The other thing is he tied himself into a broader international conversation, and it&#39;s tough to sit there and look at an Instagram post with 460,000 views on a Sunday night and say, are those 460,000 Canadian views?

We must appeal across the country. Pierre Palliev can&#39;t. That&#39;s what I&#39;d be tying him to. And I think that that&#39;s the risk that he took. So I think the risks outweigh the very real benefits that Corey articulated. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I don&#39;t think</span>

I think his support of the convoy is fucked, and it could be an anvil around him for this leadership contest and certainly for any general election to follow. I sort of viewed that in the context of this question as baked in. He had made his decision to support that convoy before Aaron</span>

People forget that in the 2015 election, which was a wave election, Polyev didn&#39;t win by a ton. It&#39;s not inconceivable to me that he could go down if he becomes this flashpoint of far-right conservatism in his Ottawa riding. So it&#39;s kind of not a smart move, I think, on a base survival level for a politician. But what&#39;s done is done on that front. run. And in that context, he&#39;s decided he&#39;s going to try to ride himself to the leadership and the prime ministership by being that guy. And if you&#39;re going to be that guy, that was the moment to get maximum benefit out of being that guy. I</span>

How do you de-risk, if you&#39;re working on Team Pierre, how do you de-risk that you&#39;re not just that guy, that you don&#39;t become 13% Pierre, that you don&#39;t just become someone defined by uh your your far right tendencies that you actually want to win the leadership and show a pathway to viability how do you win the leadership by um by ensuring you&#39;re not just that yeah</span>

            <span class="text">right? You can win. Theoretically, you can win the leadership by being the right-wing darling. In fact, it&#39;s probably, given the behavior of Aaron O&#39;Toole and Peter McKay, both trying to show their right-wing bona fides to the entire country as they were seeking the Conservative Party leadership, it might be the only way to fund a leadership and it might be the only way to actually win a leadership. The problem is if he does what he thinks, you know, if he wins the leadership, I think he faces real trouble in his home riding. And I think, you know, this idea that the liberals will, you know, Ottawa will just elect him after this convoy, after this after this situation. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I mean, we&#39;ve I&#39;ve said it a thousand times. Attention spans are short. Right. Every story is three to four days. This is an 11-day convoy. It&#39;s going to be remembered in a way that the January 6th riots in Washington is going to be remembered, right? Like these are going to be things that stick around for a long, long time, in my opinion. I could be wrong. I predicted O&#39;Toole would survive. So what do I know?</span>

            <span class="text">didn&#39;t like when riot police came in with their shields and their and their batons and they would you know bang on the front of it and And then but we developed a new kind of way of policing. And the World Petroleum Congress here in Calgary, I think, was a really good example of that number of years ago. Maybe it was the World Petroleum Congress or Global Petroleum Congress or something like that. But basically, everybody and their dog came and they wanted to protest. And the police were very well prepared. And they had their bikes and they put their bikes out and they allowed people to do peaceful protests within specific zones. Right. So if you stayed within your zone, no problem. and and the police had a excellent response plan it was all mapped out everything worked the way it was supposed to work because the protesters did what they were supposed to do and the police did what they were supposed to do and now that same game plan exists from the one side right from the police side the police side is we&#39;re not going to intervene we&#39;re not going to get in the way of these protesters lest we make a bad situation worse and so what they do is they they make a bad situation worse because now the protesters are allowed to occupy. They&#39;re allowed to march down the street. So whether it&#39;s a simple march where they&#39;re walking down 17th Avenue in Calgary or a parked protest in front of Parliament Hill, those</span>

They care more about the negative publicity than what their civilian oversight wants them to do. And they do not act. And so we have police chiefs that are weak-kneed and not leading their actual police forces. And we wind up with a situation where the police are impotent and the protesters are godlike. And that is not the society in which we should live.</span>

Talk to me about civilian oversight. Talk to me about what that looks like. And you talked about how it&#39;s weak. Is that the point of breakdown in your mind?

            <span class="text">Police are afraid, right? Is that OK if we say that police are afraid? They are afraid to be taken. They are afraid to act in an aggressive fashion. and they are afraid that the sins of their past will color the potential, their actions of the future. And that should be the case, right? I think that it is good that the police are reflecting on their actions in the past and whether or not they have been too harsh, especially in things like shutting down peaceful protests or, you know, like the 1960s civil rights movements or even the Black Lives Matter movements. in the united states we haven&#39;t seen that though in canada and the reason is in canada our protests were much more civilized and our police were far we&#39;re much more civilized but these are uncivilized protests and we&#39;re still using the civilized response and the police chiefs are looking for strong leadership that says this is okay this is what our community expects expects our community expects that if people are are are putting up piles of gas that are moving in a sauna and a hot tub that you should get them the hell out of there that this is not the type of protest that we want to see our community should be saying that&#39;s too much and that&#39;s where it comes to the civilian boards these unpaid volunteer boards that are scared of their own shadows and they&#39;re not leaders it&#39;s like asking a non-profit society board to take action with a 400 or 600 million dollar police force it just will never happen demand better from the volunteer we these people shouldn&#39;t be volunteers they should be paid they should be experts they should know what they&#39;re talking about and they shouldn&#39;t be afraid to take a stance and direct their police chief to take action when action is appropriate i appreciate</span>

I don&#39;t want police services to default to forceful action, that&#39;s for sure. But I don&#39;t think that you are required to sit in a box when you&#39;re protesting. I think the whole point of a protest is to raise some noise and raise some action. And there are many examples of people doing positive change through protest. I think this is dreadful change were they ever to be successful. I don&#39;t want to create a false equivalency between good things and bad things here. But the fact of the matter is, people are going to view that question differently. All of that said, though, it</span>

Why weren&#39;t you having those difficult conversations about declaring an emergency sooner?

            <span class="text">The other thing I&#39;ll say is, is there is a line, right? Like, as much as I don&#39;t think a protest is required to be comfortable, at the end of the day, we are a country that&#39;s governed by laws, not by the whims of the angriest, right? And things can&#39;t get so out of control and so overboard that it causes serious damage to other people and property and all of those other There are other things that people are, I think, rightly anxious about at this point. You know, it&#39;s like that old, so in the United States, there was a Supreme Court justice named Stewart. His test for obscenity was, I know it when I see it, right?

It feels to me that it would be passed and the amount of people that would come was so foreseeable. And I&#39;ll tell you another thing. It&#39;s a lot harder to tear down a sauna and take away gasoline than not allow those things to be put there in the first place. Carter?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I just think that, you know, Corey makes a good point about protests should be, you know, it doesn&#39;t need to be peaceful. It doesn&#39;t need to be, you know, without pain. You know, I&#39;d be allowed, I would allow, like, I think that sometimes it might be better just to let them go for their little march, right? Personally, I&#39;d like them to get a permit and pay for it, but whatever, they&#39;re not going to do that. But</span>

            <span class="text">But let them go on their little march. But where I draw the line is when people&#39;s lives are impacted. And when I see businesses having to shut down because week after week after week, people are coming and protesting and fighting and attacking these businesses because they&#39;re doing the right thing and following the law. And then I see, you know, the residents in Ottawa getting impacted in such a foul way and businesses being impacted in a foul way. All of those people who couldn&#39;t go to work at Rideau Center, they didn&#39;t get paid. They didn&#39;t get any money. They&#39;re not, they&#39;re worse off today day because some other some assholes impacted their lives and uh not only that you know we</span>

            <span class="text">gotta put a stop to it because it only amplifies and it only ends in violence. You must, must, must end it. And I would argue this is in violence now. It has been in violence in Ottawa for far too long, and it has kept people away from their livelihoods and away from their homes and away from their businesses for far too long.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Stephen said something about inconveniencing people. Again, I would say a certain amount of of inconvenience. That&#39;s kind of what a protest is all about, right? You&#39;re trying to draw attention and all of that.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But again, like, it&#39;s all about extremities and balances here. You have a right to protest. You also have a right to a livelihood, and rights need to be balanced. And, you know, I would say in general, and maybe one of these things we need to be talking about more, is that absolutely, literally any action can be described as a right. Anything can be described as a freedom. You could say, I have the freedom to drive as fast as I want. I have the right to punch people people with bad opinions in the face. I mean, you can describe anything in those terms. It doesn&#39;t necessarily make it true.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But when we actually get beyond kind of the pedantry of that and kind of the word games of that, the way we actually test this is we say, well, no rights absolute. And generally, the limit of your rights is when they unreasonably infringe on mine. And it&#39;s that balancing act that you&#39;ve got to consider here. And so a couple of hours, deeply inconveniencing Ottawa, maybe even a day or two, deeply inconveniencing Ottawa.</span>

You demand to talk to a minister, whatever. You&#39;re not going to get your meeting by protesting. You get your meeting by doing old fashioned work and getting people to listen to you.

And one of the increasing, and I&#39;ll keep the focus on the prime minister, Corey, one of the increasing data points that we&#39;re seeing is that what once was maybe a 90% wedge issue with vaccinations is less so that when people now look at restrictions, and that&#39;s less of a popular wedge issue, if a wedge issue in the prime minister&#39;s favor at all. So it relates to that political risk for Trudeau. I&#39;ll ask it to you in that way. Is it fine? Is it fabulous? Or Or is it fucked, the political risk that Trudeau faces now with growing swells of the population, not just these convoys wanting fewer and fewer restrictions?</span>

The sentiment in this country is shifting to one of we&#39;ve got to ease up on restrictions here. And that&#39;s been clear since early January, at least. You saw that with reactions to some of the measures that Ontario brought in, for sure, where there was not a lot of gratitude that schools were going to be closed for, you know, a few more days. Let&#39;s put it that way there. the center is moving on this issue and it&#39;s moving for a lot of reasons one is just straight up fatigue people are so tired of it and i mean we can we can kind of point</span>

            <span class="text">point to the absurdity of saying well i&#39;m fed up of this danger so i&#39;m just going to like who cares but that is sort of human nature we we kind of re-baseline all of the time the other is much more selfish so many of us have had covet at this point like on this podcast two out of three two out of three yeah and uh and so So we start looking at these restrictions, not us personally, I&#39;m kind of just sort of rhetorically grandizing here, and we start saying, well, why? I don&#39;t have anything to worry about now. Fuck the kids under five. You know, fuck the people with the comorbidities. I just want to go to, you know, Montana&#39;s and get myself a steak or whatever. I don&#39;t know, right? But there is a certain selfishness in here as well where the fear is gone, right? The fear is gone for so many of us who have now gone through the disease, and all we see are the restrictions in front of us. And that&#39;s a damning testament on humans, but I think that&#39;s a huge component of it.</span>

Fine, fabulous or fucked his lack of absence or even lack of social media sort of commentary commentary putting out a post doing anything about this this convoy to the point that ottawa&#39;s mayor or i think earlier this morning or or was it yesterday and all the days are blurring together said we need the prime minister here guys like we need the prime minister here to get some compromise on the table but trudeau&#39;s choice here he said some shit like that uh watson did fine fabulous or fucked uh the absence from the 31st to tonight when he spoke for the first time and we&#39;ll talk about what he said at the emergency debates uh in the house of commerce</span>

And then the Ottawa police probably has to answer some questions about how they were so ill-prepared for this particular situation to begin with, why these requests came, when these requests came. It has to be noted that other provinces in this same country have been able to deal with this, Quebec, British Columbia, even other cities in the same province, right? And when we start talking about if you are the prime minister, it&#39;s not necessary to kind of apportion blame, but you do need some of those facts to stand for themselves. Now, Ottawa is not a federal city. It&#39;s not Washington, D.C. I think that&#39;s an important thing to keep in mind. It</span>

Washington, D.C. is directly run by Congress. Congress can just do whatever they want with the city. Even self-governance, limited though it may be, is entirely at the whim of Congress. So you&#39;ve got to work within our federal construct here. You&#39;ve got provinces who are primarily responsible for policing. But Stephen&#39;s right.

Those two were penned three weeks ago prior to this kind of taking shape or taking root. I think that lesson is very strongly relatable right now. But Carter, I wanted you to jump in, and I&#39;ll kind of end with one final strategy question to make you guys a little bit uncomfortable. But Carter, I want to get your thoughts on what Corey just said here around the broader problem, the bigger problem. We&#39;ll have plenty of time to dissect it, but in the confines of how does this end, talk to me about some of the vision pieces and the strategy pieces of the broader problem.</span>

But it&#39;s not 50-50 like they&#39;re seeing in the United States. It&#39;s 70-20. There&#39;s 10% that can&#39;t decide which side of this chasm they want to be on, but it&#39;s 70-20. So why not just allow yourself to live in that 70%? You&#39;re not going to get them all voting for you, but this is a really good, this is a good opportunity to go back to our six rules for the pandemic and find that safe middle road, not too far to the right, not too far to the left, you know, not too hot, not too cold, the Goldilocks zone for the last bits of COVID. Keep going back to where we were however many episodes ago when we had our six rules for managing COVID. COVID, those rules aren&#39;t wrong. And they can still be managed right now. And as I&#39;m watching Jason Kenney, Jason Kenney is getting ready to break one of the rules and move too far too fast to one side.</span>

But let&#39;s talk about what victory or winning for this group looks like, because the end to this might need a little bit of give and take. And what&#39;s something they walk away with? What&#39;s something, if you were whispering in their ear saying, you got this, leave, walk away, you declared victory, you made your point, and you got, you know, something from it. Carter, from your perspective, and I told you, it&#39;s an awkward question, but I want to ask it.
