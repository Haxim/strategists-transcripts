        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Doug Ford's Friday tough-guy act, Saturday reversal, Sunday scramble - before turning to the imminent federal budget. How much damage has Ford's reversal caused him and his government? Is now the time for a cabinet shuffle? And is this federal budget the most important day in years, decades or centuries?

          <div class="said">Oh man, I don&#39;t even know where to start here. As Ontario Premier Doug Ford sat down on Friday afternoon&#39;s news conference to extend the province&#39;s COVID-19 measures, social media feeds erupted with posts from around the province, from around the country, uniformly expressing outrage. I&#39;m reading a piece here Here is an intro from the Washington Post, which is arguing that because of this disastrous Friday press conference and Saturday walkback that Doug Ford should resign. But let me add some of the details. Ford opened by blaming the federal government for not providing the province with sufficient vaccine supply, despite the fact that Ontario currently has still a million doses to yet to be administered, abdicating his responsibility for a pandemic that was never going to be solved immediately by vaccines. scenes. He moved on to make the absurd claim that Ontario had the toughest measures in North America, which it did not. He then added a couple of other items. He indicated that outdoor recreation in terms of playgrounds would now be closed. He also announced that the government was empowering the police in Ontario to arbitrarily stop anyone who&#39;s outside their residence during the province&#39;s lockdown, giving law enforcement extraordinary powers to threaten civil rights. Of course, this was certainly walked back by the government, but certainly was fought by several police forces in Ottawa, Waterloo, Peterborough, ensued, followed by Toronto and Hamilton. And then he also refused to do a few things that many people expected him to, a curfew, delaying and telling the Trudeau government to please fuck off with their offer for the Red Cross support, and also Also, not installing as many advocates that asked for anything related to paid sick days. Have I missed anything? This was a lot that they kind of threw out on a Friday afternoon and then walked back a ton of. Corey, you&#39;ve got your hand up. You want to jump in with some context before we jump into analysis?</div>

And it became look at this guy. He wants to shut down our playgrounds.

It&#39;s not actually the communicator&#39;s job to step in and veto the policies that have come out of the legal experts and the public health experts. It&#39;s their jobs to package them in a way that people can understand what we mean when we talk about those things.

          <div class="said">think that any time politicians take a big swing at something, and it&#39;s got a long list of things, people are going to grab onto the weakest link within that list. So the weak link, the policing, I&#39;ll just pick up on policing because it&#39;s so easy to pick up on. And I want to go a little bit further than what Corey was talking about, too, because he&#39;s entirely right. The way that the police did this is particularly bad. But those weak links become really problematic. So the weak link of, you know, not being able to go to a playground with your kids, that is a weak link in the communication structure. It is hard to justify. It was easier to justify the first time we did it when we thought that this was passed by touching things. It is much harder to justify now that we kind of know that COVID&#39;s more aerosol.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">So how we push this communication out with all of these weak links in it is the problem. So if you if you&#39;re going to put forward a list, you got to really make sure that each one of those things is bulletproof, because it&#39;s the bulletproof nature of it that enables you to to carry the day. Each piece should be justifiable. And the problem with Ford&#39;s communication on Friday and why he was back in front of the cameras on Saturday is that there were so many weak links and they were so easy to pick up on things like like the carding, which, of course, especially</div>

Let me take that a little bit further. let&#39;s move away from this carding piece and let&#39;s talk a little bit about all the anti-mask protests right the the challenge that we are seeing uh you know when when i&#39;m still able to get my my ticket for not having a registration still a little bitter i&#39;ll be okay but the you know i still get that ticket but at the exact same time there&#39;s or the next day there is a uh a massive rally downtown breaking the law and i see no tickets being handed out i don&#39;t see any um enforcement of the rules it it makes me angry it begs the question what what&#39;s special about that group do the police agree with that group and they just don&#39;t agree with me did they did they ticket me because i drive a certain type of car you</div>

But imagine if the police had thrown out a tweet that said, community is important, so we aren&#39;t going to shut down restaurants that stay open. Would you still be cheering them on? I mean, these decisions have to be made by civilian oversight, and the application of police authority should not be arbitrary, certainly not at the policy level. And so that&#39;s the difference, I think, between the mask protest and this particular thing is a statement was made by the police force that we are not going to, the police are always going to need to use discretion in their jobs to an extent. If I get involved here, I might make make the situation worse. I&#39;ve got to consider the bigger thing at the moment. But the idea that you would put out as a matter of policy in an online setting, we are just not going to do this. That is what I find particularly problematic.</div>

It just seems like this very convenient, like, let&#39;s just put out this 140 characters. Like, people will see it. They&#39;ll get it. but when your whole mantra is like tough guy communicating of the people like salt of the earth sort of person it just seems like a weird escape hatch many times like i i cared less about what he said but the way that like dude you introduced this like as tough guy to your point cory with like absolute statements at the beginning of your press conference on friday and then a whimpering fucking tweet on saturday like i don&#39;t know if i love it so a question to you on both medium and message um for your thoughts yeah</div>

I wish I hadn&#39;t been so absolute. I wish I had canvassed more. But you know, we are in a moment where we&#39;re dealing with live ammo. And I&#39;m trying to keep this on the rails. And Ontario, this is not on the rails. There are people who are going to die if we don&#39;t start moving more aggressively towards locking this thing down. Now, I will answer any question on this matter, and I would get used to saying, yeah, I was wrong. I was wrong, and I&#39;m glad Ontario brought me back and asked me to look at the other health advice that was out there.</div>

There&#39;s rumors of a cabinet shuffle imminently happening tomorrow. He&#39;s lowered the age for AstraZeneca vaccines, perhaps trying to change the channel. He&#39;s been on a very cordial phone call with the prime minister, now accepting health care workers and rapid tests from the federal government. What do you kind of sense in these political moments that something like this could just be a trigger for all your past political sins to kind of come to bear? And it seems like that&#39;s what it is, like the pent up frustration of people just really snapped with this particular moment. Is that how you see it? Or did you kind of see this as as perhaps being a something different?</div>

          <div class="said">normally every year this government has somehow gotten away with not doing it for two years fine but you just have to have a budget at a certain point and budgets are full of different items some good some bad it&#39;s a lot of ledgers and if you are trying to constrain spending in any way shape or form you are going to piss somebody off and even if you&#39;re or not, somebody&#39;s gonna say, how come they got so much and I didn&#39;t get very much, right? So budgets have good and they have bad. They are not entirely political wins. And what you want to do is you want to make sure that you control the story around the budget and keep the conversation on the good, on the political wins.

So this might not be the most difficult budget in the world to communicate. This might, however, be one of those things that they live to regret. Because even if it&#39;s the great budget with all of the good stuff, and this election doesn&#39;t happen for, let&#39;s say, six months, let&#39;s say 12 months. And all of a sudden, you&#39;ve got a fiscal update in there. What do you say next?
