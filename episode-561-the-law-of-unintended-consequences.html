            <span class="text">of short-sighted decision making but you know it goes back further than 2012 zane way back the republicans have been digging their own grave for so long now that</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that i&#39;m sure their arms are giving out i they&#39;ve got to be tired uh but yeah let&#39;s talk about specifically what everybody is is freaking out about in the rnc these days the republican national committee and that&#39;s all of these rules they put in place in 2012 when it looked like mitt romney was going to be the presumptive nominee and some of these have been talked about a bit in the news but they&#39;re probably worth going over sure the one everybody talks about right now is rule 40 so in the republican rules rule 40 essentially sets a threshold for how many delegates from how many states you need before you can be considered as a presidential nominee at the convention so back in 2012 they really didn&#39;t want to embarrass Romney by having Rand Paul show</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">show up on uh you know on the ballot and getting a few votes and taking them off message because you know as much as the conventions are about nominating a president they&#39;re not uh they&#39;re now just theater they&#39;re they&#39;re a great excuse to get Clint Eastwood to go up and show how senile he&#39;s become um but they created this modification of this rule so it was it raised the threshold that was required in order for you to be considered as a nominee so that not just in 2012 but ideally in 2016 uh president romney on his re-election bid wouldn&#39;t have to deal with anybody who gets a couple of seats bottom line to be considered a nominee for the president of the united states and the republican party under current rules and they can change and we get that in a second but you are required to get a majority majority of delegates from eight states. Now, it used to be you needed to get the most delegates from like three or five states. So they significantly raised the ceiling. But the problem is everybody</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">everybody and their dog is running right now. There are some real questions as to if anybody is going to win the majority of delegates in eight states. Keep in mind, not every state&#39;s winner takes all. In fact, fewer</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fewer than in years past are. So you might be splitting that pie 12 different ways and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and there is a number of scenarios out there where one person who&#39;s not as popular as the other people wins eight states with a majority and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and the person with more delegates actually can&#39;t even go on to the ballot like the number of scenarios are insane that&#39;s nuts well and the problem is not that these scenarios exist because in a in theory they can just change the rules</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">donald trump wins the majority of delegates in eight states he takes a bunch of winner takes all states because with his 20 it&#39;s enough to be more than anybody else right so he wins all the winner takes all states or enough</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">nobody else gets enough delegates combined they have more than enough to stop donald trump now you&#39;re the republican party you have to change the rules specifically from rules that were agreed upon on before everybody entered this race to allow everybody else into the race that would have otherwise been excluded from at the convention if you&#39;re donald trump doesn&#39;t that give you every excuse in the world you need to take your ball and go home oh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">oh absolutely you they will change the rules let&#39;s be clear no these rules are not standing the way that cory is describing it is 100 accurate the problem is or the opportunity is they can change the rules yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the outcome of that change is also predictable right so they will change the rules that is predictable the outcome of that change is that donald trump will get screwed and he will go away and he will pout he&#39;s already talking about an independent candidacy in 2016 he sort</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">sort of ruled it out but not</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">carter used a word here that i that i want to talk about a little bit more predictable right yeah the rule change is going to be predictable it was when they made it last time the amendment to that rule could be predictable but let&#39;s take it back a little bit because i think there&#39;s a lot more to discuss why</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">why do people do this why do and this is not just you know within the american context corey wanted to jump in before no</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i want to jump in on this point why</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">why they do this is because they saw a situation that they assumed was i think chronic and they decided to fix it so rule 40 was only one of the things the republicans did yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they also had to deal with the whole like everybody and their dog was front runner in the republican party for a week right yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah the chap in last time so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so they they did a couple of other things they tried to reduce the number of winner takes all states because they didn&#39;t want anybody to get or sorry they tried to um they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they tried to look at the winner takes all in the context of when are people voting and all that and they decided if there&#39;s going to be winner</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">winner takes all they want them on the back end to clean up so when somebody gets out of the mess they get to go forward but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they would also just front load a lot more so all of these contests or the majority of delegates to the republican convention are being elected in like one month it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s like boom and the problem with that is that doesn&#39;t really give a lot of time for a field that is so deep to clear right like within why why drop out when next week there&#39;s another you know third of the delegates coming out right so that&#39;s a problem uh the fact that after that it&#39;s winner takes all that&#39;s a problem because all of a sudden maybe just donald trump decides he&#39;s going to stick it out and then it&#39;s the minimum thresholds which aren&#39;t necessarily new but it&#39;s certain percents that certain states have said you need to get to win all of the the delegates and some of those percents are like 20</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

Now, guys, political parties are probably asking for certain things this holiday season. But what they ask for is not necessarily what I&#39;m hoping you guys think they should get. So I&#39;m going to list to you four political parties, our two local ones here. Actually, you know, I&#39;ll go with three local ones here in Alberta, and then I&#39;ll go with the two major parties federally. And you tell me what they think they want right now, what they are wishing for, but what they actually need. Does that make sense? Are you guys good? Sure. Yeah, you seem very agreeable</span>

I didn&#39;t bring any money. That was the quote everyone got. Great quote. Maybe work on that wordsmithing a bit. And then went on to say, you&#39;re the smartest. You unemployed oil workers, go get new jobs in different sectors. Effectively saying it&#39;s never coming back. I know that&#39;s not what she meant. Pretty grim. And then from the footage I saw, sat there deer in headlights like as they asked about Rana Ambrose saying, well, what about market access? Had no answers. And Kent Hare, who was sitting next to her, you know, as being the local MP, stepped in and got, like, the quotes in the bottom half of the article that effectively saved it from being a true total debacle. Not to say it wasn&#39;t a bit of a debacle. I think this is why people have MROs.

            <span class="text">trudeau fine okay i figured that as much when you told me your number ones and finally i think this is the most interesting question for our end of season awards which canadian politician do you see has the highest ceiling entering into 2016 has the most amount of room to grow um whether it&#39;s becoming a a bigger name whether it&#39;s becoming a household name. Who has got the biggest political ceiling going forward?</span>

            <span class="text">See, I think it would be my choice of Michelle Rempel. She&#39;s certainly coming from lower down than Brad Wall. And I think that someone like her could choose to run for the leadership of the Conservative Party and could win.</span>
