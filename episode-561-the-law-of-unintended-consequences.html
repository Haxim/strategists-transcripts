          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about political parties that have made decisions that come back to haunt them. Did the Republican Party dig their own grave? Will Justin Trudeau's campaign promises ultimately bury him? And is Stephen Carter single handedly responsible for the demise of the Alberta PCs? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Now, it used to be you needed to get the most delegates from like three or five states. So they significantly raised the ceiling. But the problem is everybody</div>

I didn&#39;t bring any money. That was the quote everyone got. Great quote. Maybe work on that wordsmithing a bit. And then went on to say, you&#39;re the smartest. You unemployed oil workers, go get new jobs in different sectors. Effectively saying it&#39;s never coming back. I know that&#39;s not what she meant. Pretty grim. And then from the footage I saw, sat there deer in headlights like as they asked about Rana Ambrose saying, well, what about market access? Had no answers. And Kent Hare, who was sitting next to her, you know, as being the local MP, stepped in and got, like, the quotes in the bottom half of the article that effectively saved it from being a true total debacle. Not to say it wasn&#39;t a bit of a debacle. I think this is why people have MROs.

Who has got the biggest political ceiling going forward?</div>
