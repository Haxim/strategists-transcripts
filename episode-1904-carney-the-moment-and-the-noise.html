          <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss Mark Carney’s Davos speech and why it cut through the global noise. What made the moment land, and what does seriousness buy Carney right now? Who was this speech actually for? And how did “being serious” become a political strategy again?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>
