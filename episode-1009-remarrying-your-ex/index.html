        <p>The gang talk about a rocky start for Danielle Smith, getting ahead of issues you know are coming and then ask what we can learn from the political drama coming out of the UK.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's early stumbles and unbridled chaos in the UK Conservative Party. Is the UK Conservative Party in total free fall? How does Smith get ahead of all of the things she finds herself apologizing for? And what on Earth is going on in the House of Commons? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Her sharing of the blog&#39;s content was first reported by independent journalist Justin Ling, who&#39;s done a tremendous amount of work digging through Danielle Smith&#39;s locals account with videos, texts, comments that have been posted. Guys, this is less about the Velji rule, despite the fact that the Velji rule may see a bit of a cameo appearance. What the hell is going on, Carter, with Danielle Smith&#39;s apology tour? And I&#39;m talking about this seriously now, because there is a good chance she&#39;ll have to apologize for this, just like she had to apologize for the vaccinated. And I&#39;m going to to put apology in air quotes, just so those who can&#39;t see me apologize. Just like she had to apologize for the unvaccinated being the most discriminated group that she&#39;s seen in her lifetime. Just like she had to apologize for her commenting that Ukraine should remain neutral. We might be on the verge of another quote unquote apology. What the fuck is going on, Carter? Well,</div>
