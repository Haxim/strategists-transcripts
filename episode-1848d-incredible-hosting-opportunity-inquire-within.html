            <span class="text">how you make sure this kind of thing is less likely to happen again in the future. So let&#39;s start with the first one. To avoid it, you&#39;ve got to create a pressure that makes America think this is just like this is not going to go well for us, which is part of why I think a lot of us are pulling our hair out at Danielle Smith&#39;s actions and words and suggesting that Canadian oil shouldn&#39;t be on the table here. Because, I mean, it&#39;s almost the point. It&#39;s very important. Oil and gas is very important for the United States from Alberta. And so our ability to avoid all tariffs is strengthened if we threaten to put that on the table. And taking it off the table doesn&#39;t help us. If we take off the table the things America actually cares about, we are going to be screwed. We are going to end up with very big tariffs, right? And, you know, anybody who&#39;s giving,</span>

And I encourage you to go back and sort of interpret them through the lens of what is this guy actually saying? What&#39;s he trying to do? Because his entire trade war is not rational. It&#39;s an emotional thing. It&#39;s a tough guy thing. How do you deal with a fucking tough guy? Answer that question, you find the answer to A, right?</span>

And there you have to be tough and you have to be asymmetric. And if he&#39;s going to frame his tariffs in conquest, then you treat him like an oligarch and a conqueror. And you do things like, I&#39;ve talked about this before, cancel those Trump trademarks. Ban X. sex tell uh shopify not shopify spotify and tell apple music they&#39;ve got to take down podcasts from right-wing podcasters who are supporting it get fox news off the airwaves freeze accounts of people who are pushing for this who are in his inner circle use the oligarch playbook hurt him not americans and watch his head on on come off his you know body if you do need to move to the next thing and actually push back find time limited ways to push back if you&#39;re going to reduce Reduce electricity to the United States. Give a lot of notice and do it for 72 hours, just to make your point. Same with oil and gas. Do these things for time-limited periods, just to make your point. And then we&#39;ve got to get to sea. And sea is where you can spend a lot more time. We spent eight years not doing anything to get ready for this. We&#39;ve got to, as a country, get serious about how we strengthen our economy, strengthen our military, strengthen our cultural independence, and get out from underneath this particular thumb. It&#39;s a real challenge, and it&#39;s going to take years and years to do, but we&#39;ve got to get through the moment of crisis, and then we&#39;ve got to start protecting our country against acts like this in the future.</span>

She is doing an exaggerated version of the character that she would bring to those negotiations in that debate and that conversation. And that&#39;s how the liberals are handling it right now.

So you may actually say, I don&#39;t need to do anything. How have your comments and your stances and your photo ops and your meetings with governors and the Republican leadership, how has that aged given today? And what, if anything, do you need to do if you&#39;re Daniel Smith?</span>

It&#39;s because Trump burns everybody he works with, everybody he negotiates with. And people probably should have been aware of that before they sent the premier of Alberta down to talk to him, too. Whatever you think of our motives, I just think tactically it was foolish for exactly what you said. All he needs to do is stand up and say, we don&#39;t give a shit about oil. I don&#39;t care. You know, we&#39;re going to do this. And you&#39;ve gone from being somebody who&#39;s on Team Canada saying we&#39;re united against Donald Trump. that was your that was the path not taken to the person for daniel smith yes that&#39;s right to the person who took a different approach that just looks really ineffectual and that&#39;s a that&#39;s a dangerous place to be you know you went out on a ledge you you took the big swing you whatever metaphor you want here but now you&#39;re gonna have to own some of this and you&#39;re gonna have to wear it and we don&#39;t have really any polling in alberta that&#39;s specifically asking the question like hey hey, how do you feel about how Danielle Smith has done on this particular matter? I suspect it&#39;s days away. I suspect that Folling already exists in some situations here. But the vibes are not great, at least in Calgary, at least talking to Edmontonians. A lot of frustration with how she&#39;s taken this approach. And I think that</span>

You know, pictures with Pete Hegseth as he&#39;s being accused of, you know, assaulting his wife or ex-wife and hanging out at Mar-a-Lago. These are not good vibes at moments like this.

But let&#39;s be clear, he&#39;s not putting his whole ass into this. If we take at face value that he wants Canada as a 51st state, like he sees this as a solution, he would have gone a good distance to tearing our country in pieces if today he had not said, we don&#39;t need Canadian oil, but said the opposite. That&#39;s the one thing we do need. We&#39;re willing to exempt that. Imagine what that would have done to our country. But he didn&#39;t, because he&#39;s only half paying attention to this file.

It&#39;s all about diplomacy and you, you get to kind of take a victory lap, both at the provincial and federal level, but it just is not going to play very well.

It&#39;s very dangerous for a premier of a whole province. And our ability to avoid tariffs on everything we have in Alberta, this goes back to my point A, right? We got to be tough. We got to put it all on the table. We might not want to do it, but we have to be willing to to take a stand on this. And it&#39;s a certain amount of mutually assured destruction, brinkmanship style negotiation, but that&#39;s the kind of negotiation Donald Trump responds to.</span>

Why didn&#39;t you say something then? Yes, I get there were tensions behind the scenes. I understand that. I understand that was part of how it came to a head here, but you had a lot of choices and you had a lot of options and you can play the, well, you know, but I&#39;m just one member of a team card for sure. And I think people understand that. But if you dial the rhetoric up a little too high, people start to say, well, if that&#39;s how extreme you felt, your actions make no sense to me. And so that&#39;s the challenge she has as she moves forward here. And I also just think realistically, it&#39;s tough for somebody who is so closely tied with the rise of Justin Trudeau to disown Justin Trudeau in any meaningful way. So she&#39;s in a bit of a box. I think she has given herself license to be the one who&#39;s firmest about his leadership with people. And she is also using that as an example of her being tough more broadly and tough with Trump. But I just don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to work, if I&#39;m being frank. Greg, Carter,</span>

The carbon tax affected the government&#39;s popularity. That is the hole the liberals now need to dig out of. But you are not going to sustain a conversation for five weeks on a finished topic, on a done deal, on a closed thing, on a dead letter. It&#39;s not happening. So I think that the sooner Pierre Polyev can wrap his head around that and move to whatever this campaign is going to be, not what he wanted it to be, the better off the conservatives are going to be.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, so for those who aren&#39;t aware, there&#39;s been like a week of columns of varying degrees of Daniel Smith was right. There was a really embarrassing moment for both of them when they talked about Daniel Smith&#39;s approach worked on Monday, just before the press conference where Trump effectively said, no, tariffs are still on for February 1. And they both had to take down and rewrite their columns, like just just brutal stuff, right. And I think they&#39;re so desperate to prove their first columns right that they&#39;re losing a little bit of perspective here. And I&#39;m sure they&#39;re feeling very assaulted by people calling them traitors. I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t think of themselves as traitors. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not in any kind of meaningful sense of that term. right but columnists do best when they&#39;re reflecting the public not relaying the government&#39;s message to the public and my hot take here is this never would have happened if post media was in better shape at this point they all work from home they work by talking to people on the phone and having meetings they don&#39;t run into people the same way they used to they don&#39;t have their news room to keep them sane this is crackers like when i read these post media columnists right now and even when i read like getting into chris nelson talking about energy you all need to go outside side and touch grass like this is not the conversation on the streets of Calgary and Rick Bell&#39;s column today and I got a lot of time for Rick I know a lot of people roll their eyes at him but you know he he does legitimately try to represent the people a lot of the time but the idea that you&#39;re sitting there saying well I would be right if you exclude Calgary and you&#39;re a fucking I mean Carter you were making this point to me you&#39;re a fucking columnist for For the Calgary Herald and the Calgary Sun, your</span>
