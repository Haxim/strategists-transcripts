We&#39;re now seeing this crossroads of vaccines that are later than we expected, a new variant entering our shores that perhaps has a greater likelihood to spread. What do you kind of think the federal government response here should be? Is this kind of a moment that they find themselves in that is unprecedented?

Because in order to protect itself and ensure that it could spread, it became less deadly, so it didn&#39;t kill its hosts. Very clever of it. This one is becoming more easily spread.

We&#39;ve talked about Team Trudeau brand quite often. Initial praise for handling of the pandemic in the later sort of innings here, not getting so much praise for the vaccination rollout. A third wave and a spike in territory we haven&#39;t found ourselves in could be disastrous to the Trudeau brand. That alongside the fact that Canadians historically, in most recent polling, care about debt and deficit the least they ever have at this moment. So I want to qualify that to Corey&#39;s point at this existing moment from what we&#39;ve seen from some polling. With that being said, do you feel like there is a value in trying to take on a disproportionate, larger, bigger role than they have, as we&#39;ve seen the second wave kind of blow out of proportion?</div>

          <div class="said">So when vaccination is being done, they are being judged on vaccination. And when we are done being vaccinated, they will immediately be judged by the Canadian public on the economic recovery. And the economic recovery means that you must have viable businesses. We were talking with my daughter and her boyfriend today about, you know, businesses and how many businesses are going to be in a position where they can actually survive this particular pandemic. Well, because the economy doesn&#39;t rebound if small and medium enterprise doesn&#39;t rebound first. That is the driver of the economy. And that</div>

The small amounts of money that went to small businesses, I think it was up to $20,000 per small enterprise. That was life-saving for a lot of small enterprises. That kept the lights on. It kept the employers being able to have an income, and it kept their rent paid. So I think that that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to be evaluated on. No one ever cares about debt and deficits. Even people who pretend to care about debt and deficits, if you give them even the most simple stacked question where they have to put one thing above the other, debt and deficit very quickly drops to the very bottom of the pile. It&#39;s just not something that people judge themselves on or actually make anything vaguely resembling informed decisions outside of the very few people who are real true fiscal conservatives.</div>

But if we end up in a situation where where we are then vaccinated, let&#39;s just assume that everything we&#39;ve heard, it remains the case that we&#39;re going to get our quarterly numbers and then some over the next couple of quarters. Then people are going to say, what the hell did you spend all of that money on? Because the moment of anxiety that we feel right now about being so far behind in the vaccine race will be gone.

And maybe Manitoba wanted to invest their money a little bit differently. Say this is about long-term security of, of supply for things like this, But the suggestion that you are somehow breaking the logjam by doing this when there&#39;s not Health Canada approvals, when this thing is not going to flow to you first anyhow, it&#39;s kind of silly.

          <div class="said">let&#39;s let&#39;s move on to another element of our vaccine conversation because i know cory you love this this is actually oh yeah loading your boat this is this is making it happen for you um carter i want to talk about vaccine communications and frankly more specifically anti-vax communications. A story&#39;s come out that both in Canada and the United States, doctors and nurses are trying to build confidence online in COVID-19 vaccines through social media, mounting coordinated campaigns to combat anti-vaccination forces prevalent on the platforms. Their main strategy is to monitor hashtags and keywords used by individuals individuals on social media, and then from there, flood social media posts with supportive messages countering vaccine opponents. So we&#39;ve talked about vaccine communications in the past. I&#39;m going to have a special episode for us as we deep dive on it in terms of how to get more and more people to adopt it. But at this current junction, Stephen Carter, for you, are you A, surprised that we&#39;re in this state where doctors are now taking this into their own hands, And B, do you like their strategy of if someone speaks negatively, you kind of get your Instagram or Twitter hive or Facebook hive to come flood them with positive comments en masse? Do you feel like there&#39;s efficacy in that? I want to talk about the calm strategy a bit with both of you on this before we close it off on this segment.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think that the science of defeating this has been relatively clear. Experts don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s peer-to-peer that does it. uh so the idea of being flooded with positive comments if those comments are coming from peers i think that would be very effective if it&#39;s coming from um you know a hundred different white coats uh with just stethoscopes i mean you know no one&#39;s going to care that you know four out of five dentists recommend people still buy the other fucking brand so it doesn&#39;t you know like this is this is not something that people do um and it&#39;s not going to be uh it&#39;s not going to help. I mean, I have noted that as there has been vaccine scarcity, people are seemingly more willing to get it. That also might just be a bump because of, you know, the proximity to getting it and watching other people get it. No one&#39;s, you know, the negative outcomes seem to be minimal. At this stage, though, here&#39;s my thing. I care very little about vaccine hesitancy. I care almost about – as much about vaccine hesitancy</div>

If you look at the UK, for example, they&#39;re seeing much higher uptake than they originally planned, and maybe we can learn something from them. If we want to look at the United States, there are 50 states that provide us various models for vaccine distribution that we can learn from. So I don&#39;t know. This is outside of my area of expertise. The logistics of vaccine distribution are not something that I learned in business school. But, you know, I do like what Stephen has said about the</div>

He&#39;s not in that position. He could have easily voted to convict, and I think he wanted to vote to convict. But I think he knew as leader, him voting to convict makes it much more difficult for them not to. And so what he did is he walked this line and he gave kind of intellectual air cover to this notion that you can loathe Donald Trump. You can actually call for him to have criminal charges against him, because McConnell&#39;s not worried about the consequences down the road to that, you know, to him and his primaries. But he gets to put voice to that, and then say, but I still voted to acquit because I think that you can&#39;t do this to a private citizen. So he&#39;s created a landscape that allows his conference to pick and choose the elements that they want and that they need in order to be successful themselves. So I, you know, give credit where credit&#39;s due. The guy knows the game. He is a very savvy political operator. He&#39;s got no soul. He&#39;s an evil man.
