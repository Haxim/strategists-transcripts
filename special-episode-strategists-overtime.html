            <span class="text">Hello, listeners of the strategist podcast. Well, in fact, I should say, Patreon listeners of the strategist podcast. This is Zain Velji here. You know, we did mention that every once in a while we would include special content on this feed that is exclusive for our Patreon subscribers. Well, today&#39;s your lucky day because what you&#39;re about to listen to is something we dubbed as strategist overtime. This was part of our live show that we recorded on Sunday, April 10, in in Calgary.</span>

            <span class="text">After the live show, we had an intermission, and then we did something called Strategist Overtime, where we ran through a few topics of the day and then took some Q&amp;A from the audience. So here&#39;s Stephen Corey and I batting around certain things like Boris Johnson in the Ukraine, Elon Musk on Twitter, Jagmeet Singh, Krista Freeland, and then we turned to the audience. They threw questions at us. I tried to repeat them into the mic. So in certain cases, you might be missing a few cues, but you&#39;ll figure it out. You&#39;re the smart folks. You&#39;re the Patreon subscribers. And for you, this exclusive Strategist Overtime from our live show in Calgary on April 10th.</span>

Hilarious. He literally had a poll yesterday that was about that. This guy now could own up to 15% of Twitter. He&#39;s blown by SEC guidelines in terms of disclosing his 5% stake that he&#39;s taken on.</span>

So when you just simply say that all speech should be free and it will regulate itself and find some sort of mean, that hasn&#39;t worked for Facebook and it doesn&#39;t work for Twitter. So there&#39;s too many attacks, there&#39;s too many false stories, there&#39;s too much misinformation on both on almost all of our social media platforms and it&#39;s all protected under this idea that Mark Zuckerberg and and Jack who apparently has a last name but who can remember they</span>

Debt is a percentage of GDP, which Corey had spoken about quite a bit on the last podcast. And, you know, all of those are good metrics, but at the end of the day, there&#39;s a couple of raw numbers. And those raw numbers are how much money are we spending and how big is the deficit. And by those two metrics, it&#39;s a big spending budget. And we were really impressed that Christopher Freeland stepped forward and said, essentially, this is a restraint budget. And she said it with a straight face, which we thought was pretty unbelievable. And it turned out it was unbelievable.</span>

Yeah, I think that his base has become establishment conservatives, the old PC class that you&#39;d see in downtown Calgary, and certainly when you see some of these leaks of, you know, the membership harvesting, not harvesting, but trying to get people to go to their general meeting and all of that, right? It&#39;s emails from oil CEOs to their companies saying, hey, if you want to go, this is free, right? And that is old school PC politics for sure.

There is a group of Albertans who will always believe that Rachel Notley is in some sort of sinister coalition to destroy the oil and gas industry. But guess what? They&#39;re not going to vote NDP. They&#39;re not accessible voters to you if you&#39;re the NDP. Keep your eyes on the fucking prize. The distance that you provide to those people is based on what they can do for you and your province, not on the politics aside.</span>
