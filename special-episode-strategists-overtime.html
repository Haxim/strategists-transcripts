        <div class="desc"><p>After the live show, we kept going because we're extra like that and we'd like to share the audio with you. Do we have thoughts on Boris Johnson? Yes. Elon Musk? Yes. Chrystia Freeland? Obviously. Does Stephen Carter pour water on his head at one point? Acoustic gold.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. After recording Episode 981, the gang kept going to run through a few more issues-of-the-day and answer audience questions, including: what do we think of Boris Johnson's trip to Kyiv? Is the idea of Elon Musk joining the board of Twitter good for anybody at all? And if you had five minutes with any Canadian politician - and they had to take your advice - who would you talk to and why? Zain Velji and the audience, as always, split question asking duties and keep everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote><p>We also want to give a shout out to <strong>Ryan Sauvé</strong> - who captured the entire proceedings on camera. While you might not see his amazing video work we are all benefiting from his amazing audio. He took some pretty rough files and turning them into auditory - well, silver if not gold. Because of technical difficulties at the venue his backup was all that remained of the recording for the main show and his mixing and retouching work on the overtime show was, in the words of Stephen Carter, "wait, people can do that?".</p></div>

          <div class="said">Hello, listeners of the strategist podcast. Well, in fact, I should say, Patreon listeners of the strategist podcast. This is Zain Velji here. You know, we did mention that every once in a while we would include special content on this feed that is exclusive for our Patreon subscribers. Well, today&#39;s your lucky day because what you&#39;re about to listen to is something we dubbed as strategist overtime. This was part of our live show that we recorded on Sunday, April 10, in in Calgary.</div>

          <div class="said">After the live show, we had an intermission, and then we did something called Strategist Overtime, where we ran through a few topics of the day and then took some Q&amp;A from the audience. So here&#39;s Stephen Corey and I batting around certain things like Boris Johnson in the Ukraine, Elon Musk on Twitter, Jagmeet Singh, Krista Freeland, and then we turned to the audience. They threw questions at us. I tried to repeat them into the mic. So in certain cases, you might be missing a few cues, but you&#39;ll figure it out. You&#39;re the smart folks. You&#39;re the Patreon subscribers. And for you, this exclusive Strategist Overtime from our live show in Calgary on April 10th.</div>

And by those two metrics, it&#39;s a big spending budget. And we were really impressed that Christopher Freeland stepped forward and said, essentially, this is a restraint budget.
