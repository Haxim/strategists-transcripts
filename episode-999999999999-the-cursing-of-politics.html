      <h1>Episode 999.999999999: The Cursing of Politics</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">August 19, 2022</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>The gang launch off of recent events in Canada and the United States to talk about profanity in politics. When does it work? When does it backfire? And why do we need to hear about Stephen Carter's nipples?</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about swearing in politics - recent instances, its history - and what power it has in public discourse. Is deploying profanity an effective strategy? Can we expect to see even more of it in the future? And how long has Stephen Carter been sitting on that podcast review? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>
