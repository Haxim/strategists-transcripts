So, like, what did you think, like, when you compared, when you think back, and I chose some, I think, some rather egregious examples, but when you think back to the Republican convention, are there speakers that jump out at you beyond the Dana White and the Hulk Hogan moments? Or, like, I was really struggling to kind of come up with a list of speakers that really anybody noticed in the Republican National Convention. convention no</span>

I just cannot understand that energy, but that&#39;s fine. Second of all, I do think that the Democrats are just better at this stuff. You know, there&#39;s more Hollywood connections, there&#39;s more entertainment industry, there&#39;s more design industry. The spectacle of the DNC is something that the Republican, first of all, I think it was just the best DNC I&#39;ve ever seen in terms of and packageability in television, but</span>

            <span class="text">they&#39;re always better than the Republican one. The Republican one always feels a little dark. The red light that promenades through everything because it&#39;s the Republicans and red&#39;s their color these days, it creates this dour energy. I don&#39;t know.

Winning the popular vote, well, we&#39;ve seen a couple of times where winning the popular vote doesn&#39;t really matter. Hillary Clinton lost, and so did, who lost to Bush? Al Gore. Al Gore lost.

And for example, North Carolina, Stein is continuing to destroy the the opposition, the governor opposition. And so the Democrats continue to be five points up and the Democrats aren&#39;t five points up in the in the presidential race. But I do think that that&#39;s their high watermark. I think that the high-water mark for the Democrats is to lift themselves back up to the Senate standings, right? So Bob Casey in Pennsylvania is up by five to seven points. I mean, Mark Kelly in Arizona is winning. Nevada is going Democrat for the—in fact, everything as far as Montana. Tester just recently had a poll that put him up by five points over his competitor in the Senate race. There is a very real possibility in what can only be described as a devastating map for the Democrats Senate wise. They could even they might they might they might they might hold</span>

Was this the convention that brought together and really rebalanced the, you know, one of these moments in American history where everything gets flipped up and maybe there&#39;s new parties and there&#39;s new people and there&#39;s new approaches? No, I don&#39;t really think so. But if your goal was to capture attention and entertain, I don&#39;t know how this is not the best convention.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, look, I&#39;m not sure that could ever happen again. A modern political event, especially if it involves the vice president of the United States, but just in general, there are, I mean, even in Canada, there&#39;s so many guardrails on them. Really big police presence, really big security presence, free speech zones, quote unquote. quote, you know, they&#39;ve been rebranded and renamed, but largely it comes to you can protest over there, you cannot protest over here.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">weeks ago, right? Right. There are legitimate security concerns because a bullet can undo the will of 300 million people like that, you know, and that&#39;s a pretty scary thought when you think about it. So I just don&#39;t know that you&#39;re going to see that again. 68 was chaos. We had so many political assassinations around that time, too. People started saying, we&#39;ve</span>
