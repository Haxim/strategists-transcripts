            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">uh as the friends of patreon on uh we cory we want to talk about how how we vote uh listen in previous episodes we have talked about the conservative leadership race here we&#39;ve talked about the ucp leadership race we flirted ever so slightly with talking about at least not this round but previous rounds because it happens every two years how the conservatives in the uk vote and in fact if you&#39;re not aware they&#39;re doing it right now. Again, they&#39;re selecting another leader to replace Boris Johnson. But worry not, because Boris Johnson says he may also want to get in on that. That&#39;s another thing. That&#39;s a totally different thing that I can spend two hours on. We&#39;ve also talked about on The Strategist, but also in our sister podcast, which we have started and then kind of let crumble kind of like American democracy itself. We&#39;ve talked about how American presidents are elected. So I want to talk today about how we ultimately, how we vote, how we allow certain people to vote. How we choose leaders. How</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">we choose leaders. Who is able to vote to select leaders? And specifically, who&#39;s able to select these leaders in</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">in political party apparatus? Is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Is it members? Is it the general public? Is it delegated? Corey, give me a few others. Is it caucus? There&#39;s so many different different options. Carter, looking at the playing field in 2022, when you see the multitude of ways that the political parties have in terms of how we choose leaders, do you have a favorite yourself, top line? Is there a particular way and who should be able to vote that you like the best?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I prefer a wide open party system to select delegates. I think that the delegated process serves the party best because it sends your top people into the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">convention to actually spend time together. And at the convention, they connect, they build relationships. Corey, I&#39;m sure, has been to different party events. We&#39;ve all been to different party events where those party events are the stalwarts. And it also creates an automatic healing period, right? We&#39;re seeing so so many 51 49s, right? So many 52 48s, uh, really small victories. Um,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Corey talked about it in our last part or in, in, in our podcast with the six nines after the decimal point, um, talking about how, uh, you know, Pierre Polyev may want to be pushing really hard to get a big number, right. To hold the party together to show that he&#39;s got the victory. I mean, that, that type of thing, is required because there&#39;s no immediate healing process there&#39;s no ability to take the losing team for a drink to to spend time together to to spend time uh you know talking about the common goals and common realities instead you just have this one member one vote you&#39;re still at home no one calls you afterwards and tells you how important you are to the party you&#39;re just gone and you don&#39;t care anymore because there&#39;s so many members the the uh cpc just released that they have 678 thousand members that will be eligible to vote in this process, 678,000 people who won&#39;t be getting a telephone call after the process. Um, they don&#39;t matter individually. They do not matter collectively. They matter a lot.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, um, before I ask you for yours, get me, get me the, the index of types of, okay. So I&#39;ve, I, of, of, of ways that people can vote or political parties have selected a vote for leader. We&#39;ve got the wide open, right? So anyone can vote, purchase Purchase a membership, show up, right? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, not even necessarily purchase a membership. You have the U.S. primary system, for example, where somebody just</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just shows up. And, you know, there&#39;s variants of that from anybody can show up, which we&#39;d call an open primary, to a closed primary where you&#39;ve got to be on a list and you&#39;ve got to be a member of the political party. Not really a member, but like a registered Democrat you&#39;ll hear in the States, a registered Republican. Which,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Which, by the way, in the States, does that mean, do you know if that means any financial transaction with the party? No. It</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, you can change your registration. And in states that have registration like that, and I think it&#39;s fallen somewhat out of favor, though. You know, these things are all shifting.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But in states, usually you can just change your registration every so often. And there might be kind of a period. But the idea is you can just</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just say, like, I&#39;m a Democrat now. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Right. Maybe next election. Like, you know what? I think I&#39;m a libertarian. And there are a lot of political parties everywhere, but certainly in the United States as well. So you can register for some crazy French third party too along the way and then there&#39;s these big lists of who&#39;s registered how. So that&#39;s kind of the most extreme version. Anybody can vote or anybody who puts their hand up and says I am gets to vote and there&#39;s no filter by the party. It&#39;s sort of handled by the state elections boards. boards um the next version out is just you know just to simplify things would be like the caucus where you do have to be a member of the party and you show up and you caucus together so when people are talking about caucus states and you&#39;ll recall in 2016 i suppose when bernie sanders was doing so well with the caucus it was because he could actually get members to show up and hang out and go through an excruciating process several hours</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">in a community association hall or some gym you know somewhere</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and that&#39;s really a delegated that that is the contest that stephen carter is talking about</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s the american supersized version but the idea is you&#39;re electing delegates who in turn maybe elect delegates who in turn go to the state convention who in turn choose their delegates for president right so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of the the american version if we&#39;re going on a spectrum the canadian version would be the next one up which</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is the members uh in a delegated convention would uh usually in person or like at a voting place or multiple multiple voting places get together and cast a ballot for who they want to send as a delegate to the convention and much more direct than the american one the american one is filtered through state conventions and all of that um and then as you go further afield you get contests uh well maybe this is not this is a weird i&#39;ve broken this spectrum i don&#39;t even know what the fuck this is yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah yeah yeah because i skipped</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">skipped over one member one vote which</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">which i think would be in between there but you&#39;ve got one member one vote which uh allows anybody to just buy a membership and vote remotely there&#39;s variants of that too where it&#39;s just an instant roll-up or there&#39;s actually rounds of voting which is steven will be familiar with because he&#39;s run elections like that and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then you know in the more extreme gatekeeping versions um and it&#39;s a spectrum you&#39;ve got more delegated</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">delegated conventions where the delegates are more hand-picked you know it might be the party bosses it might be the in the canadian context the presidents of party associations the people on the executive and their power it&#39;s not like delegated conventions disappeared overnight like their power got diluted you had more and more delegates elected that would go with the party bosses to these conventions and then the most extreme version is like the caucus chooses the leader you you are the leader of the caucus so the caucus gets to pick who you are and there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of versions in between you know the french do a weird thing the the uk UK does a combo thing where you&#39;ve got to have like a caucus filter. The UK one&#39;s a strong one. It&#39;s like the top two candidates from caucus go for it. The Labour one is you need at least 10% support of the caucus in order to move forward. To go to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">to the membership, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? Yeah. Like there&#39;s no shortage of ways to choose leaders. And often we find that we&#39;ll oscillate between them when the weaknesses of one become too much to bear. And then, you know, the strengths become taken for granted. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So with that being said, Carter, I&#39;m going to come to you in a sec. like, Corey, do you have a favorite that you particularly favor? And I want to get into your last comment too, in a second, right? Which is one of the reasons we even, at least I was interested in this topic when you guys brought it up as something to do an episode. And it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been railing on a bit around one member, one vote, especially here in Alberta, which lets you exploit a system, find a fringe of a fringe and win based on that. But is there a favorite you like, Carter? You&#39;ve kind of chosen that delegated model with the healing and the folks Folks coming together, physical locale, kind of filtering up. Is there something you like, Corey, from like a personal bias or personal preference perspective?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You know, I&#39;ve been thinking about this since we sort of decided we&#39;re going to talk about the topic. And I think the answer is no. I think that reality is it&#39;s ever shifting. And if you asked me 10 years ago, my answer would be different than if you asked me today. And not because I&#39;ve, I mean, I&#39;ve changed as a person. But I&#39;m saying if you put present me in a time machine back 10 years, I might suggest a different system than right now. And where I think these systems run into trouble is people try to create the purest versions of them</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">instead of trying to create like practical versions of them that that deal with the downsides where all of a sudden it&#39;s like, yes, we want party democracy. We like the idea of more parties being involved, but maybe we shouldn&#39;t go so overboard that it&#39;s instant members are able to determine the entire party. Or, yes, we like delegated conventions. We like the things Stephen Carter talked about in terms of being able to, you know, have the beer afterwards and bring the party together and have a more manageable group. But maybe we shouldn&#39;t create these gates where all of a sudden it&#39;s an entirely elite exercise that seems removed from the general population. And, you know, that&#39;s something that you&#39;ve got to calibrate over time. time. The system you could put in today may resolve today&#39;s problems, but new problems will arise. It&#39;s why we&#39;re always changing election laws too. It&#39;s a fluid environment. And I think people would do better than rather saying, I believe in this system to the death. It&#39;s, well, I&#39;m going to react to the situation and how it&#39;s evolving. And I&#39;m just going to keep moving with the flow here and try to keep some principles in mind. Become more principles-based than rules-based. What are we trying to get out of a party election? We&#39;re trying to involve the members. Whereas we&#39;re trying to make sure that we&#39;re palatable to all Canadians, whatever your principles may be, and then adjust your party mechanisms to follow. Carter,</span>

Or in the UK, the conservatives are going to select a new prime minister with a membership pool of 160,000 in a country of what, 50, 60 million, something in that range.

            <span class="text">frame that you&#39;ve just thrown at me here, because I&#39;ll tell you, one thing is like, what do you mean by democratic? You mean party democracy? It&#39;s a great question. Do you mean general public? Is democratic just the existing members? Does democratic include potential members? I&#39;ll say</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">say when it gets covered in the broader media landscape, it&#39;s usually about general public versus the sliver of people selecting a new leader.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Right. Well, but like the reality is, even when you&#39;re trying to create a system, being democratic within your party might not be the same as being democratic within your public. You know, you&#39;re not necessarily reflecting the will. And the idea of these instant members, I think, is part of what&#39;s kind of gotten people upset in various contexts here. So it&#39;s not really clear to me that even if we&#39;re just going to be simple about the word democracy, that it&#39;s obvious what democratic means. Because there is a case to be made that you lock the membership as soon as there&#39;s a vote. Basically, if you weren&#39;t on the boat, that&#39;s the membership anyways. That&#39;s democracy because those are the people who are truly members of the party. Everything else is just a sales drive. But beyond that, we tend to think of the word democratic not just as mob rule.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s balances. There&#39;s checks in it. There&#39;s this idea that you want to appeal to a lot of people and consider the interests of a lot of regions. So if you&#39;re talking about a leadership vote, maybe mob rule democracy, one member, one vote is anybody can come in. And many people would see that as democratic. Maybe another person would see it only democratic if those points are weighted by region. So you&#39;re making sure you&#39;re getting voices in rural areas as well, and they&#39;re being heard. And of course, that somewhat reflects our actual system. We create ridings and we say, this is worth one MP. Even</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Even if the turnout in that riding is 10% and the turnout of the riding next door is 80%, they don&#39;t get eight times as many MPs just because they&#39;ve got 80% turnout. We sort of acknowledge that representation doesn&#39;t necessarily require voting.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You can represent people from a region, even if those people didn&#39;t show up for you. So, you know, there&#39;s a lot of questions there. But Zane, to your point, you&#39;ve totally derailed me from like almost what I was going to say in response to Carter&#39;s here, but I think you&#39;ve asked a good question. Parties should do the work of defining that and saying, what are we trying to get done with our leadership? Are we trying to create policy</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">policy that will resonate with all Albertans? Are we trying to have a system that is going to get the most motivated volunteers? And be really intentional about that and then sort of track their leadership over time. Now, the big problem is you define those principles. And the minute you do, people are going to start trying to game the systems regardless, because some people will do better in one system versus another. You know, some reward intensity, some reward moderation, and people will fight over the levers of the party in order to dictate what kind of system it is. And Carter and I have said this a lot, you choose the system, you choose the leader. Like, imagine it was a caucus vote for the UCP. Travis</span>

But all to just sort of underline the point, these things are not as cut and dry as sometimes people try to make them out to be. And, you know, I think that in general, people should be very leery of like the very absolute statements about only this can be a reflection of democracy. right the hypocrisy in political parties is massive um let&#39;s start with the obvious they all use instant runoff for their leadership contests but god forbid we use instant runoff in general elections yeah there&#39;s some sort of magic is at the minute we go in the you know they&#39;re worried about all of a sudden candidates splitting in funny ways and then there&#39;s like a you know there&#39;s a like an extremist candidate with 20 of the vote who wins but apparently Apparently that&#39;s not a problem in a general or, you know, they&#39;re not so fussed because they may be the extremist in that case.

            <span class="text">Because the relationships are owned at the local level as well. Right. The relationships that are owned in a one member, one vote are owned by the leadership candidates that are selling the memberships and they are owned by the party. They are not owned by the constituency association, which is supposed to be the fundamental building block for parties and for governance, right? Like the stronger your CA is, the stronger your community and constituency association is, the stronger your party is. And by creating a process that builds really strong CAs, you are building the ability to win elections in areas that you didn&#39;t necessarily expect it before. One of the great challenges of politics federally is regionalization, right? You have regionally strong areas, you have regionally weak areas. If you want to build out your regionally weak areas, you have to build individually strong constituency associations. associations. That&#39;s one of the reasons that the delegated process works so well. It does fail. I mean, there will be tons of areas where you don&#39;t get the 14 delegates that you can send because there&#39;s just literally not enough people in the constituency association. But that&#39;s okay. You have to be starting somewhere. Just by signing up 678,000 members doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you are stronger. Now, it does mean that you&#39;ve got $15 per 678,000 members. And it does mean that there is a donation value that we can project based on prior performance of members against donations. Maybe it&#39;s another, you know, $45 per member that will happen in the next two years. That&#39;s a lot of money.</span>

Corey, what do you think about this? Should we detangle those two things? Because often the system is chosen, I shouldn&#39;t say often, but sometimes it&#39;s pretty clear the system is chosen with an eye towards what will net us the most amount of money, whether the membership sales, whether the cash call for the candidates, whether they they be small or large? What do you kind of think of the financial component here? Because these are entities that need to keep breathing and working financially. Talk to me about that. What&#39;s your thoughts there?

They sent, so 14 elected delegates from Calgary Centre and other two that were what we call ex officio, the president and the past candidate. Plus there were probably a bunch of party executives that were there, Calgary Centre being kind of an obvious hub.

Anyone can kind of jump in a reasonable membership cutoff so that you can join after the rules are sort of in place, which, by by the way, is not the case in example for the UK, right?

There&#39;s no doubt in my mind, if we were living in a world of entirely delegated conventions, we would probably be a lot more critical of that we would remember things like, you know, how expensive they are. And we would have such recent examples of people unable to go from disadvantaged groups, lower income groups uh i can tell you the liberal party of canada was always it was always one of those things where uh you kind of wince at how low that you know you&#39;d have elected delegates uh you know a certain percent for indigenous populations and then like the conversion to actually showing up at the convention was very poor right and a lot of it had to do with the cost so i think um you know it&#39;s easy to forget those problems this is all this is sort of what i was saying at the start Like we oscillate between these systems because we take for granted their strengths and we can only see their weaknesses at a certain point. And we take for granted, I think, the strengths of one member, one vote. It&#39;s exactly what you talked about, the convenience for people, the kind of the egalitarian nature, the ability that you can sit there. But as soon as you set a system, that system is going to be gamed. And often that will be gamed in a way that makes those ills seem really, really ill. and uh and what we see right now with one member one vote is like just a full-throated embrace of what&#39;s the most likely to we talked about this a few days ago on this six nines episode right but what what&#39;s most likely to um to get you um to act well we know from a history of like fundraising that it&#39;s the most extreme messaging it&#39;s the most aggressive messaging and so you you know, leadership candidates are seeing that they&#39;re seizing the opportunity and, and you know, you can drum people up on all sorts of crazy shit. And that&#39;s exactly what people are doing right now. Now, does that mean we need to bail on one member, one vote? Maybe, maybe not.

At least going into this, you know, there was some doubt seeping in as we got a little bit closer to the thing, but he was the presumptive.

And so, you know, like there are some benefits to a system like that, like that system made liberals feel like they could just be five minute Tories and get invested in that support went to the Tories.

We have this real disconnect where you&#39;re being elected by one group and you&#39;re asked to oversee another group who don&#39;t actually need to listen to you.

And by empowering, I mean, this is basically Michael Chong&#39;s thesis, right? You empower the individual MPs, you strengthen Canadian democracy, because the centralization that comes from these party systems, these party driven leadership systems, is not healthy for democracy. I mean, in a funny way, we all just vote for a dictator every year, we just choose our dictator, you know, we know how little the individual MP actually has an effect on these these things so you know that&#39;s the that&#39;s the positive right like you could perhaps strengthen democracy uh in a more general sense with a system like that now</span>

It&#39;s simple. It is clear. We now know it. Yeah. We&#39;ve explained it to people. No, Carter, This is about adding nuance to the conversation.

            <span class="text">everyone who&#39;s a New Democrat understands exactly what that is. But there are so many different types of New Democrats. You know, we&#39;ve talked before about the John Horgan New Democrats and how that&#39;s different than the Jagmeet Singh New Democrats and how the New Democrats under Jack Layton look different than they are now or Ed Broadbent. I mean, because the leadership defines</span>

And I think the ultimate concern that we bring to this is that the one-member, one-vote, the most, quote-unquote, most democratic, may create some unintended consequences when you&#39;re running a small system. And that unintended consequence is that you</span>

            <span class="text">political parties would do a better job of saying, what are we trying to accomplish with this? Having that conversation outside of the heat of a leadership contest, setting some clear boundaries and some guidelines that are not about the moment, but about in general, the principles that they want to bring forward. You know, what does it mean to be democratic to that party? What does it mean to be electable to that party? What does it mean to engage your activists? And how important are these things? And how much weight do we put to all of them as we&#39;re building out this system? What I fear right now is that we have a bunch of opportunists who are wrapping themselves in some very extreme language about the virtues of these systems when really they just want to get elected.

So of course, Carter, I just want to ask you this very very simple question. Your thought, knowing how it works in the Republican primary for president, lay it on us, Carter, the 2016 GOP nominee, who&#39;s it going to be? Jeb Bush.</span>
