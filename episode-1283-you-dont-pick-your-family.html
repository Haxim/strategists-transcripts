It happens often. And usually it happens or has happened recently, which allows us to talk about it. And one of the things I want to talk about in this under, or I should say, under this banner, Stephen Carter, of why the fuck do we still do this, is going after strategists, campaign managers, and advisors. We have talked for a a very long time that the public&#39;s attention span is limited, that they could barely name a local candidate, that they could barely name a cabinet minister, let alone most people, or a good portion of people, don&#39;t even know who their premier is, and occasionally some people have no idea who the prime minister is. Yet, in politics, we see it all the time. Rather than going after the main person, the principal you&#39;re trying to take down, people go after their advisors, unelected folks. Sometimes Sometimes they&#39;re not even in the office. Sometimes they&#39;re just informally advising someone&#39;s campaign or someone&#39;s ambitions or someone&#39;s pathway towards becoming the next leader of a country in this particular case that I&#39;ll mention. And Carter, we now have our newest example of why the fuck do we still do this as related advisors, because the liberals are going after Jenny Byrne. She&#39;s, of course, known as the senior advisor to Pierre Polyev&#39;s camp. She was a former podcaster, so part of the Klan in that sense, ran Stephen Harper&#39;s campaign, the one that had the famous barbaric cultural hotlines, you know, tactic near</div>

            <div class="said">the end. And she is now a known, at least in the small political circles, advisor to Pierre Pauliev and his ambitions to become the next prime minister of Canada. Carter, the liberals have kind of waged an attack that goes after Jenny Byrne and goes even further, goes after her firm for being registered lobbyists for Loblaws, the giant grocer, on the heel as a draw or a wedge of contrast as Pierre Poliev talks about grocery prices being too high and Justin Trudeau being responsible for those high grocery prices. So Carter, let&#39;s park the issue aside for a second in terms of like, is this an effective attack, etc. I promise I&#39;ll get to it. But answer my question, because this is usually how we start this segment off. Why the fuck do we still go after unelected advisors, sometimes those that are not even in the office, to make an attack on the principal?</div>

            <div class="said">Well, a short answer, Zane, is because it works. And the reason that it works is that the media don&#39;t care really who&#39;s elected and who&#39;s not elected. What the media look for is who&#39;s got power. And so when you say those, you know, unofficial advisors, I mean, an unofficial advisor is someone with absolutely no, you know, recourse if the public decide that they don&#39;t like the advice that&#39;s being given. So there&#39;s no the dynamic is very fluid. So when people decide to go after Jenny</div>

That&#39;s it in a nutshell. And now I&#39;ll hand it over to Corey, who will explain why I&#39;m right, probably. Corey,</div>

            <div class="said">there was a lot of kind of anti-internationalism that was involved in it. And Pierre Polyev kind of can just shrug, you know, and everybody around him is going to be like, well, she was here before he was leader, and what are you going to do? And yeah, he&#39;s given her a role, but yeah, he&#39;s got to balance the caucus. And that&#39;s the thing, Zane. Caucus is seen as like something to be managed and to be dealt with and traded off with, right? And so when you make a decision relative to caucus, that maybe isn&#39;t entirely the thing you would always do if you had full unfettered authority. But when you start talking about advisors, when you start talking about staff, you have full unfettered authority. So when your advisor, Jenny Byrne, is working for Loblaws, it&#39;s pretty easy to say that</div>

So keeping her around, even though there is pain involved with it, is probably the right thing to do for Pierre Polyev. Should we stop this? No, no, of course not.

This is just more smear and lies from a desperate floundering government that, you know, is so concerned with what Loblaws is doing that they&#39;ll dig through, you know, the lobbyist registry and what a company I&#39;m associated with does, but won&#39;t actually solve the problem themselves. Like this is the level of competence and quality that we have from our current government. So yeah, let&#39;s talk about what we&#39;re going to do about, you know, high grocery prices. Let&#39;s talk about the fact that they only seem high because our, you know, wages are stagnant. You know, the growth of GDP in this country is non-existent. Everything seems more expensive because we&#39;re all standing still while the world gets more expensive. So, you know, maybe there&#39;s a way you do that and just sort of move on with your life from there. But I think those are longer term plays. I think in the short term, I wouldn&#39;t sweat it too much. We&#39;re a ways to an election. And, you know, can&#39;t really even say years anymore, though, eh?</div>

We&#39;ve talked in the past about launch as it&#39;s how important a launch is, and we&#39;ve had deep dives into that. I&#39;m going to put that also on the side today. Today, I want to talk Talk about less so what your launch is, more so the timing of your launch as related to your competitors when the gate is kind of, when the race is relatively narrow like this one is. And so give me your thoughts about this. If you&#39;re one of these cams thinking about it, let&#39;s assume all your vetting and all that sort of stuff is behind you. Let&#39;s not get bogged down in those technicalities. From a pure strategic choice perspective, the ability to cluster your launch together within a day or two, so to speak, within the same week, good, bad? Are you into that?

These campaigns have been going on for a while. There&#39;s nobody who is actively involved in the Alberta NDP who has not been engaged in one of these campaigns, either directly by one of the candidates or through a proxy or somebody who&#39;s on an org chart that doesn&#39;t exist yet because there&#39;s no technical campaign yet, right? This has been happening, and it will continue to happen regardless of whether or not somebody announces tomorrow. And yeah, there&#39;s kind of the kick that goes out into the general public there. It is a bit of a starting pistol. It does allow you to do the fundraising things. But every</div>

They will still be selling memberships. And this activity continues unabated. And I actually think it&#39;s a super fascinating, like, trap that organizations fall into, which is they start to think they&#39;re running a general election. And they start to say, well, we just got to get the, you know, the front page of the Edmonton Journal. We&#39;re in great shape. Well, no, that actually doesn&#39;t mean a thing unless it sells memberships, you know.

Does it say anything else? And I go back and I&#39;m trying to draw a parallel from last episode when we talked about Daniel Smith&#39;s policies being rolled out. And you guys, I think both came, at least one of you said it and the other one agreed to it, which is going first has a certain value in that sense, in terms of responding to Daniel Smith&#39;s statement. statement.</div>

It doesn&#39;t give you a front-runner status if someone&#39;s gonna launch at noon, if you&#39;re launching at 10 a.m., using the example that Corey&#39;s just put on the board. Does it actually give you materially anything? Like, if I saw Kathleen&#39;s tweet right now, and I was running one of those campaigns, and I was gonna launch at 11, and should I even bother sending a text to my team to say, should we launch at 9? Like, and this might sound stupid and petty, but like people think about these things. Like, like we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve probably been part of chains. Talk to me about going first on a technicality. Does it actually get you anything in a leadership race?</div>

Once ads can go out and there&#39;s an A version and a B version, your campaign gets a little bit better.
