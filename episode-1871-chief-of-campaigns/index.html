If there&#39;s no change between now and January, the caucus will lose patience. Carter, there&#39;s a lot of discussion around, and we&#39;ve talked about campaign managers in the past. When did they become so relevant? events we&#39;ve talked about chiefs of staff and i want to save the chief of staff conversation because carney&#39;s having difficulty finding one that&#39;s also an interesting conversation but</div>

And they&#39;re already kind of like they&#39;re already talking about the historic margins and all that sort of stuff. The second part of the Jenny Byrne success story. So the question really does become, does she almost have the wind behind her back here, Carter, to say that if she just fights, plants her ground, doesn&#39;t do anything, and just suggests to people that we keep the campaign going, that that is enough of a distraction for them or that&#39;s enough of a B-side strategy for them to say, yeah, let&#39;s just make sense to keep Jenny around because the campaign hasn&#39;t ended. You don&#39;t change a campaign manager midstream because the campaign hasn&#39;t ended. We could be six months, 12 months, 18 months away from an election. Why get rid of the campaign manager when we&#39;re still in a campaign? I think that&#39;s pretty smart if that&#39;s where they&#39;re at. Do you think that&#39;s where they&#39;re at?</div>

How big could the pool potentially be of chiefs of staff to Mark Carney? And let me give you the case of how it could be big, and let me give you the case of how it could be small. The big pool could be professional people Mark Carney&#39;s worked with that he trusts in a managerial style role. The smaller pool is people with connections to this caucus that understand parliamentary procedure.</div>
