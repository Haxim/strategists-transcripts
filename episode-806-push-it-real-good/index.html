        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the Conservative Leadership Race, push polls and the appointing of Alberta judges. Is Peter Mackay going to be the next Conservative leader? Are Alberta public appointments being politicized? And before I hit play can you please guarantee me the title refers to polling? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">The thing that&#39;s always difficult about leaderships is gauging where the horses are relative to each other. You only have a couple of real concrete moments and they become less concrete almost with every passing year. And obviously the big one is membership sales. And depending on how the leadership race is structured, you may have a very good idea of what memberships came through a different candidate or you may have no idea whatsoever. so ever. And one of the challenges with measuring leadership membership sales is that it tends to be campaigns that are very well coordinated that turn in membership stamped with the name of that leader.

And it can really kind of throw things out and up and around and you don&#39;t really know who&#39;s got those memberships and and who doesn&#39;t. And my understanding, and it could be wrong, because I&#39;ve been following this leadership race with the same interest as every other Canadian, which is to say, not really at all.</div>

          <div class="said">Sure. The thing about delegated is there&#39;s a million flavors of of it so maybe we end there but if you want to look at the extremes at least within this country on the most open side you have the Liberal Party of Canada which has the supporter system essentially you just register as a Liberal supporter and you&#39;re able to vote in leadership races and nomination</div>

          <div class="said">nomination contests and by the way that system was created in Alberta when I was the executive director of the Alberta Liberal Party in a past life and it was sort of adopted stoppeded by the federal party at a time when the liberals were quite starved for attention, were the third party. Because one of the benefits of a system that&#39;s more open, such as that, or the one member, one vote, which we can talk about in a second here, is that the barrier becomes much lower. You create a larger pool. That pool is incredibly useful for things like fundraising. It&#39;s incredibly useful for building that foundation from which you grab those next levels of of supporter that&#39;s how you you always want to move them up that pyramid right from you know supporter to member to uh and what&#39;s happened over time to activists what&#39;s happened over time is we have pushed down the authority of the party to the lowest rungs right uh because that&#39;s a pretty quick way to get a quick jolt of adrenaline as you bring in outsiders and make them insiders one member one vote is you spend five dollars ten dollars on a membership and you get one vote and And that vote is either weighted or not based on region, right? It could be no matter where you are, where you show up, you&#39;re going to be able to vote equally, or it could be based on your, the number of ridings. So each riding gets a hundred points, for example, which is the most conventional one at the federal level in Canada, uh, or, or some version of that, some blend, some hybrid where it&#39;s, you get up</div>

And that&#39;s really where you can see horse trading and conversations such as, come over to me if your candidate comes off the ballot or whatnot.

And he&#39;s fighting against the internal sort of system in some ways. And he did something that you, I believe, had done with the Alison Redford campaign, which is he came out today asking, in his case, social conservatives, but saying, please make me your second choice. So you&#39;re kind of you&#39;re this is a very real life parallel to what you had faced about a decade ago, I&#39;d say, with Alison Redford.

I think that the move that Carter did by basically endorsing Horner as number two was brilliant. It was really inspired and I&#39;ll give him credit for that.

          <div class="said">I want to talk about something that I think we are all familiar with, but maybe our listeners are not, which is polling in campaigns. And I want to start in a very hyper localized way, because in Calgary here, where the three of us live, the current conversation around the city&#39;s Green Line LRT, which if you want to know more about it, just Google it and the bungling of what that looks like in many directions. However, camps have formed. One camp saying we need to build partial version and reimagine what the green line looks like, and the other group saying let&#39;s go with the full thing as planned going forward. Both groups have come out with polling.</div>

          <div class="said">polling. And it&#39;s not necessarily polling that you would see from, let&#39;s say, a reputable pollster per se, although one of them comes from a polling company, but we can talk about that. But it&#39;s polling specifically intended to move the needle of public opinion. And this is is something we&#39;re familiar with on campaigns. In fact, I say that we&#39;ve all used it as instruments on campaigns. So Corey, kind of first of all, give us a hyperlocal sense of what you see of these two polls. And I&#39;ll ask Carter the same. And then let&#39;s zoom out to have this larger strategic conversation of the relationship polls have on campaigns and specifically for the purpose of influence.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, polling has been weaponized, I think it&#39;s fair to say. And what I mean by that That is, people realize that especially on what are more low stakes isn&#39;t quite the right word, but let&#39;s call them low engagement, low intensity issues. That just going with the flow is absolutely something that people do and are willing to do. And so much of it is based on vibe. And on this issue, which is about building an extension of Calgary&#39;s mass transit system. First, we had a well-funded group come out against the Green Line. line and what they did is they released a poll that effectively had a thumb on the scale. I&#39;m going to come back to that in about 10 seconds here. And then it was followed up by the pro group putting out a poll that probably had just as bad or worse of a thumb on the scale. And what I mean by thumb on the scale is this. A question is not a question is not a question. An awful lot matters in the construction of a poll. Like let&#39;s not even just talk about who the poll is going to. I think that&#39;s pretty obvious. But there</div>

          <div class="said">You know this is this this polling question was something I was intimately familiar with on the last Nenshi campaign and Carter I remember talking to you about it intimately because we had that first poll come out not saying that was a push poll first poll come out I&#39;d say six weeks before election day saying we were down 19 points and then we had another poll come out saying we were up 17 points and the the reason I&#39;m mentioning this example is not to point to you guys as to why I have so much gray hair as of recent. It&#39;s lasted so long. But it&#39;s to say that, is there a strategy here, Corey, that this was perhaps done to neutralize polling? Because I&#39;ve seen that happen a few times, which is to say, you put out a shitty poll, we put out a shitty poll, all polls are shit, poison. Well, let&#39;s move on. And could you think that could be part of the calculus here? I</div>

          <div class="said">you know, Carter is absolutely right. Message testing is not polling to be released. And we really do need reporters to have some literacy in this matter. You know, there&#39;s some questions you should always ask if you&#39;re a reporter covering a poll, right? Okay, explain to me how you got your sample, especially if it&#39;s an online poll, because there&#39;s some pretty garbage sample out there. Tell me the days that you ran this poll over, it should be a huge red flag if they managed to do it in a day, right? Because that tells you they&#39;re just getting the the first respondents, they&#39;re not filling out particular sample sizes here. Okay, let me see the entire script, right? I want to see every question you asked before. I want to see that you made all of this, you know, accurately as represented as possible. And then you need to be able to sit back as a reporter and say, what else might I not be aware of here? And for God&#39;s sakes, talk to a professional pollster about what other kind of considerations might be coming in here acknowledge your own limitations in this space go into it and say okay this is this is pretty convenient for this side why why might this be problematic on a certain on a certain level because uh</div>

          <div class="said">ends up somehow becoming a pollster at some point. They end up, you know, they do message testing for us, right? So it&#39;s like, hey, you know, we don&#39;t have much money because this is not a lucrative business. So the person who&#39;s interested in doing data, which by the way, a little secret, there&#39;s very few of them. So if you get them, keep them close to you, right, end up doing polling and such. And so, you know, one of the observations we had from that last Nenshi election is that some of the same people who are once data people on the other side started running little polling shops. And that&#39;s just my way of kind of introducing the question, Carter, because the threshold of polling today has become lower and lower and lower. And those people who&#39;ve spent their time, resources, getting advanced degrees are now, you know, in a situation where they&#39;re competing with former data people that have now just casually started to do polling. But since there is no sort of barrier to entry, we can kind of see this sort of stuff.</div>

And I&#39;m very curious, especially on social media, I&#39;m very curious to hear your opinion on this, because it is a conversation that&#39;s been revived in Alberta politics this week with a press secretary saying he blocked 50 people, best day of his life. I&#39;m paraphrasing, that&#39;s not exactly what he said, encouraging political staffers to block people. So I want going to have this conversation on reconciling, quote unquote, democracy with political staffers and in this case, politicians as well, blocking people. What&#39;s your take?</div>
