Plus:  disagreements about whether Poilievre is a master storyteller and passport woes.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Michelle Rempel Garner not running for UCP leader, passport issues, Poilievre's message discipline and more. How big of a problem for the Liberals are the lines at passport offices across Canada? How worried should the Liberals be about Poilievre's communications skills? And which estates said yes? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We need to help the liberals here on this episode, because as it relates to the liberals, I diagnose two fundamental problems. Number one, they do not have a smart, succinct response to the gatekeepers&#39; freedom narrative and the subsequent proof points, which we&#39;ve now been able to see. Do we need more proof points? That everything in this campaign, he&#39;s going to jam into that frame. And he&#39;s doing it quite effectively. Affordability, gas prices, everything. He&#39;s</div>

            <div class="said">putting everything into that frame. And so the question that we have to ask ourselves, and Carter, let me start with you on this, is what do the Liberals need to do? Because the second problem I diagnose here, perhaps with the Liberals, and maybe I&#39;ll use the response that Minister Gold gave to asking Service Canada to do more in a generic way regarding passports, but also the speech by Chrystia Freeland, where her plan to tackle affordability really fundamentally just reannounced things that the Liberal government said, oh, look, we</div>
