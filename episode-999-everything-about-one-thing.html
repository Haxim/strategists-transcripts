            <span class="text">And, you know, here&#39;s what I want to say. And this is where I want to get into the strategy element of it, Carter. We need to help the liberals here on this episode, because as it relates to the liberals, I diagnose two fundamental problems. Number one, they do not have a smart, succinct response to the gatekeepers&#39; freedom narrative and the subsequent proof points, which we&#39;ve now been able to see. Do we need more proof points? That everything in this campaign, he&#39;s going to jam into that frame. And he&#39;s doing it quite effectively. Affordability, gas prices, everything. He&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">putting everything into that frame. And so the question that we have to ask ourselves, and Carter, let me start with you on this, is what do the Liberals need to do? Because the second problem I diagnose here, perhaps with the Liberals, and maybe I&#39;ll use the response that Minister Gold gave to asking Service Canada to do more in a generic way regarding passports, but also the speech by Chrystia Freeland, where her plan to tackle affordability really fundamentally just reannounced things that the Liberal government said, oh, look, we</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it seems to be an emotional disconnect. Maybe not even a policy disconnect, Carter, an emotional disconnect that the liberals have and that peer is starting to build and perhaps grow on. So when you have a government, as we&#39;ve talked about last episode, when we talked about this disconnect that the liberals might have, this malaise, I think is the term that I kind of pushed on us. Now</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Now I&#39;m kind of going a bit further to saying there might be an emotional disconnect with the public, an emotional misalignment with the public, while the guy on the other side seems to be running unabated,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

We see no indication that that&#39;s actually true, but it doesn&#39;t need to be true. He doesn&#39;t need to actually implement anything. That&#39;s the joy of being in opposition.
