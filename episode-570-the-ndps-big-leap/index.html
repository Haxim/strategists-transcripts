        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the NDP federal convention in Edmonton. Does the Leap Manifesto doom the party? What's to be made of Mulcair's 48% support level? And how much carbon did this conversation use up? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Oh, it&#39;s incredible. You know what? And you contrast that with the Sixers who let go of Hinckley. The process is dead. Hey, guys, speaking of the process being dead, Tom Mulcair. Oh, yes.</div>

I hope that goes without saying, which are how should we address the problem of resources, which are huge jobs for labor. We&#39;re not just talking about oil and gas, by the way. We&#39;re talking about forestry. We are talking about infrastructure, you know, building, the building trades in general. And then we have environmental concerns. Sincere though they may be, largely removed from the working class realities that have traditionally been the NDP bread and butter. Interesting.</div>
