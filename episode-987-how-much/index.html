        <p>Stephen Carter was in Nashville, Tennessee last night picking up the "Best International Campaign" award from Campaigns and Elections. But he still found time to watch the Conservative leadership debate - or at least fake it well enough for a dive into what it means for the candidates and what it could mean for the future of the the Conservatives.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss last night's Conservative Party of Canada leadership debate. Who won? Who lost? What does it mean? And can this party hold together in the long term? And has there every been a more perfect match than Stephen Carter and Nashville, Tennessee? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Patrick Brown, one of the leadership candidates and arguably a friend of the pod, door number eight, was not on stage. But you had other candidates who certainly were, including Pierre Pallieva, Leslyn Lewis, Sean Sharae, amongst Scott Aitchison and Roman Baber. Guys, the debate itself was two hours in format, standard format debate that you&#39;d see. But I have to say, the gloves seem to really be off. And the scorched earth rhetoric that at least the Pallieva campaign has been unleashing online and at rallies found its way on stage. age.</div>

For many people, they&#39;ll say, look at Polyev and the way he&#39;s holding them to account. I mean, that would be fucking sociopathic behavior in any office if somebody was having a discussion. Why do we put up with it in politics? Absolutely beyond me. The swipe that Asheray made about we&#39;re not on a student council, I don&#39;t think does service to student councils which act with far more decorum than uh than i saw polyev act there he&#39;s acting like an asshole on a student council not like a student council more generally and um and yet that&#39;s what a lot of people are going to be really drawn to how tough he is it seems how aggressive he is how it&#39;s not something that he&#39;s going to let sheree off the hook on</div>
