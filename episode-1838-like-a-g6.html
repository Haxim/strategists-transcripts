A lot has happened since then. I&#39;m just going to lay some timeline stuff on the table and then we will get into it. So Monday night, last Monday night, President-elect Trump vowed to introduce 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. You may remember we recorded a podcast on Tuesday night. That&#39;s important. On Wednesday, Trudeau met with the premiers at an emergency meeting virtually. And then the premiers put out their own statements about the meeting.</span>

And relationships can actually, you know, fundamentally make policy secondary or take a backseat. So what they&#39;re trying to do is forge relationships. They were hoping that they took, you know, Dominic, that they took Katie, that they took the Prime Minister, and someone would hit it off with someone around that table. Like, I bet you the strategy was nothing, not nothing, but fundamentally</span>

We need to get into this new orbit, make some calls. Is anyone friends with Kash Patel? I hear that guy&#39;s going to be important, right? But seriously, this was a relationship building exercise to see if there was any vibe, right? If there was any vibe that they could present themselves, not as a bunch of liberal snowflakes, but be like, oh yeah, we can get along with these people. And I think that was fundamentally the purpose of the trip. And I think that was fundamentally a pretty good strategy. And I should suspect that more and more with Team Trudeau as part of their Team Canada approach. And what I&#39;m fascinated by is, is they&#39;re ever going to, you know, tap</span>

And for four years, he had to deal with Donald Trump, the president. And I&#39;m sure he has many bags of tricks in order to deal with him, flatter him, get what he wants out of him. Sometimes he was effective, sometimes he was not in those four years, but he sure learned a fucking lot. I guarantee that&#39;s the case. And now he&#39;s ready to, probably better than any other G7 leader, walk in and have conversations with Donald Trump, armed</span>

But when they&#39;re actually in the room with them and that person is all of a sudden charming, they&#39;re like, oh, they&#39;re not so bad or I&#39;m OK with that person.

And I&#39;m sure they were saying things like, okay, well, no matter how insane he like makes a claim about the border, like we react with this tone, and we just keep bringing them back to this fact. And we just keep repeating, you know, Canada and America are great friends and we don&#39;t take the bait. And, you know, I&#39;m sure there was an awful lot of that on the way down as they were thinking about those roles. It was probably an awful lot of, okay, well, Justin, you&#39;re going to be the one who talks to Donald Trump because he really respects like the leader and he doesn&#39;t want to be talking to a second in command. So you talk to him and we&#39;ll try to sidebar with all of the other people who we think might be quite influential, like the Commerce Secretary. And we&#39;ll divide it up in this way. And we know that, you know, Katie has a good relationship with, I don&#39;t know, right? Like, whatever it might be, that&#39;s probably the thinking that they&#39;re doing around there. And in my experience, these do tend to be like you prepare for the worst, and then you&#39;re pleasantly surprised kind of preparations and then meetings because, again, people are – even Donald Trump, nicer</span>

            <span class="text">Canada. Is Justin Trudeau going to respond and engage? No, for 100 reasons he&#39;s not. One of the primary ones being he&#39;s a prime minister. He talks to presidents. He doesn&#39;t talk to governors. And so there is a certain understanding that that is where the conversation is. And you give up your own power to them when you elevate somebody who&#39;s at a subnational level like that. Like, imagine Trudeau having a special relationship with a premier in Australia. You know, he calls up, you know, he&#39;s like, I was just talking to Chris Minns of New South Wales. And, you know, we&#39;ve come to this conclusion about the Australian government. That&#39;s never going to fucking happen. That&#39;s not even going to happen with Trump as president, right? Because that&#39;s just not how international relations work. And that&#39;s not how politics work. It would diminish him. It would diminish Trump to elevate the premier of Alberta too highly. So he&#39;s just not interested in it. And</span>

But we&#39;re talking about Daniel Smith&#39;s media profile here, and trying to get into the the U.S., she&#39;s actually a very good communicator. She&#39;s very good at this.

            <span class="text">is when you&#39;re trying to get on to talk radio in the United States or in this country. And so she brings the core competency one would need in order to be noticed. And I would say that&#39;s not for nothing. In fact, I&#39;d say that that&#39;s her principal skill right now, is that she says the right words, she&#39;s got that right-wing radar and she&#39;s actually moved further to the right over the course of her political career i think she could very easily get noticed for alberta oh it&#39;s it&#39;s i think it&#39;s total fuckery but for danielle smith if she wants to get into the conversation line up her next gig wherever that might be i mean she&#39;s premier of a province with 92 approval rating so i and i&#39;m not saying that you know she&#39;s going anywhere anytime soon at least from her own party but yeah man like she&#39;s a fan of tucker carlson and she very much uh still wants to keep that door open i i&#39;ve always believe that about danielle smith even while she&#39;s in the premier&#39;s chair and she&#39;s not gonna waste this opportunity and by the way to be clear as we said before we&#39;re still in the fucking pre</span>

            <span class="text">cory because it&#39;s like it&#39;s nuts when you when you think about it and you think that she&#39;s a premier and okay what is the end game But then Zane kind of makes like a case for, yeah, that bigger profile, but it&#39;s still nuts. Like, Corey, what do you think is the endgame here of being thirsty and wanting to be such a big part of this conversation?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think the end game is that she elevates herself. She elevates Alberta. She makes Alberta a bit of a model. She draws attention to Alberta. She maybe even gets investment to Alberta in her mind, right? And she thinks like, hey, I&#39;m trying to create a free market utopia here. So why don&#39;t you all come and join us in this free market utopia? I think there&#39;s a couple of problems with that, though. One is, it&#39;s funny to say, but when you look at how Daniel Smith is governing, she&#39;s not actually governing that right wing. She doesn&#39;t have a lot of things she can point to and say, see, we&#39;re the right wing Canada model. No, she&#39;s governing in a much more populist sense. She&#39;s a little all over the place with moves that it would be tough to peg down. I mean, just last week, she was basically nationalizing environmental data, right? That&#39;s not a small government approach to things. And there are other examples of that if you look at it over the past, I don&#39;t know, 36 months of her running and then being premier. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s not so clean. she can&#39;t be held up as this model as this totemic right winger in Canada, because that&#39;s just not how she&#39;s governed. It would be pretty tough. Outside of social issues, I think to make any kind of case on that. And frankly, there are Americans who are far more to the right than her on social issues. There are Canadian premiers who are arguably more to the right than her on social issues. So I just don&#39;t think she can be the model she wants to be there. But all of that that is almost secondary. I just, listen, I don&#39;t, it&#39;s tough. This is tough medicine for many Canadians to swallow, but I&#39;m just going to say it. Americans do not think about Canada.</span>

Fucked if they know, they might hear them on a podcast. They might think of them as a curiosity, but they&#39;re never going to elevate them into international conversation in that way. Will she be on more podcasts? I&#39;m sure she will. Will she potentially get the ear of some of the bigger thinkers in Trump&#39;s orbit? Yeah, that&#39;s a real possibility too. Could Trump weaponize her against Trudeau if he decides that he really wants to go for the jugular? 100%.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and so i do think it&#39;s uh it&#39;s an interesting path that she&#39;s trying to walk and i do think she is i since i think she&#39;s sincerely trying to engage in this because she sincerely thinks that because of who she is and the governor she&#39;s met and the and the contact she has in her rolodex that she will be more effective at this than trudeau and whether you believe that or not What I&#39;m saying is the position she holds and the position that Trump holds and the position that Trudeau holds just boxes her out. Nobody is going to deal with a subnational government on these particular moments unless it&#39;s to hit somebody over the head with it. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying here. And so I think that when I see a note, like a statement, like Daniel Smith put out, I think I</span>

And it&#39;s just, it seems so unlikely to work that it kind of makes me think you&#39;ve got to reorient yourself to a reality that exists that perhaps you&#39;re not seeing, which is you are a premier, not a prime minister.

            <span class="text">So Corey and I just think there&#39;s two different goals here. I actually don&#39;t think fundamentally she&#39;s trying to shift the conversation. I think she&#39;s using that as a guise. The border patrols, the fence at all, the agreement with Trump. I honestly just fundamentally, legitimately believe that she is just trying to get noticed. That there is a loyalist and an ally on the other side of the border, get to know my name. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">really really talks multiple times about the value of oil and gas pipelines you know providing the united states with the oil and gas it requires goes back to affordability which i think the affordability line is basically the only thing that was on message in all of it right? Because you&#39;re talking to Americans and affordability in the United States, right? And you are talking about providing oil and gas to the United States and that being part of energy security. I don&#39;t think many Americans think of Canada as providing energy security to them. We do. But again, it goes back to that American psychology. And they would generally see their energy sovereignty coming from themselves because they&#39;re Americans and America defends America and America supports America. So I read through that and I think, okay, well, you&#39;re trying to make it all about oil and gas and and in the you know the so-called readout certainly they talked about that i think that again this is one of those funny things when you&#39;re the prime minister and you&#39;re sitting there in mar-a-lago and you&#39;re thinking about the things that will be pain points for the prime or president of the united states of course oil and gas is going to be very high on your list you know so you&#39;re going to use that as the wedge you&#39;re going to use that as the conversation and maybe you want to hear that and say well so daniel smith is right so we should really be be talking about oil and gas and the need to be secure and all of that but you somewhat undercut that by then talking about all of these pipelines that you want to see too and turning it from a give to an ask right i am going to give you oil and gas or we could use another pipeline here mr president what are we trying to do here and and i think she&#39;s just trying to have her cake and eat it too when</span>

Daniel Smith, and I know everyone like clutches their pearls when you make a Trump comparison to any other politician. I&#39;m not making an ideological comparison.

            <span class="text">oh yeah well and and you could easily imagine construction that says like you know to albertans to canadians to americans and then she could talk to each of the audiences along the way here i do wonder if part of why it was written the way it was was to give ourselves a bit of cover because she is essentially engaging in international affairs in a way that many would consider inappropriate appropriate, right? This is a federal responsibility. Why are you getting involved in this? So you make it almost feel like it&#39;s designed to be talking to Albertans or Canadians, but clearly based on your choice of language, the words you use, the way you phrase certain things, you are talking to the United States or you&#39;re attempting to. I don&#39;t think that it got exactly stellar pickup in the US of A, right? So yeah, maybe it&#39;s just as simple as that to provide political cover. But maybe it&#39;s not so simple. Maybe she is doing exactly what Zane said, and she&#39;s trying to create this tight Trumpian style format that he would potentially read and say, yeah, I mean, I love that. I love that. I love how short and to the point that is. It&#39;s tough to say, but it&#39;s certainly a stylistic choice that I think leads to some tortured prose. And I&#39;m not necessarily sure I would have recommended it if I were the Premier&#39;s communications team okay</span>

No, because between him going down and, you know, people definitely turning their heads and saying, well, that&#39;s interesting to Mar-a-Lago, even if people like me are way less enthused about it. Plus, Pierre Polyev doing stuff like this where he almost can&#39;t help himself and he seems to be propping up a man who, let&#39;s be very clear, is so incredibly unpopular in this country.

Danielle Smith has that cover too, right? Like, she&#39;s clearly ideologically, she&#39;s not doing it needfully. She&#39;s not doing craftfully, but she&#39;s definitely like, she&#39;s doing it. And she&#39;s saying, well, but this is because of Alberta. It&#39;s not because of me. Pierre Polyev may have that same sensibility. I&#39;m not saying he does. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s necessarily kind of shown any sort of allegiances to Donald Trump. But you&#39;ve got three people here, Trump, Smith, and Polyev, who can&#39;t, to your words, can&#39;t help themselves. They just cannot not be who they are.</span>

But the fact is, we could have literally scripted, I think we almost scripted what he was about to say. You did. Like between the three of us, I honestly think we did. And it&#39;s not because we&#39;re amazing at what we do, it&#39;s because he&#39;s predictable at what he does.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">one of the reasons, if you&#39;re Team Trudeau, that you think you have a chance here is because everyone is kind of playing their part.

            <span class="text">to Mar-a-Lago and meeting with Trump and I&#39;m not even in the conversation? Like, Polyev has had an interesting, almost Trump-like effect in the Canadian media cycle. Once again, not making a direct comparison on ideology here, but from like strategy intact, is that every day has been a Pierre Polyev day. Either he&#39;s been kicking down the prime minister or he&#39;s been taking control of a policy or he&#39;s been doing something. Think about the last time we&#39;ve been talking about the prime minister in a positive way outside of maybe a couple of pre-budget announcement things seven months ago. Pierre Polyev is our Canadian political ecosystem. And the fact that he wasn&#39;t for three days, that he wasn&#39;t mentored at the premier&#39;s meetings, that he wasn&#39;t Doug Ford at the head of the premier&#39;s council, that he wasn&#39;t Justin Trudeau heading to Mar-a-Lago probably expedited what we thought was good, at least what I thought was going to be a couple of weeks going for Pierre Polyev before he broke. broke but nope he broke he got the visuals and he did the thing that that the chat gpt of the podcast could have predicted do</span>

            <span class="text">And I think about this in terms of the one I always think about when I think about, like, the tail wagging the dog like this is income trusts, which was a vehicle that was very popular for, you know, a lot of purposes. But it was kind of breaking things from a tax point of view. And it doesn&#39;t matter if you know what an income trust is. I don&#39;t think I need to get into it. All you really need to know is that the government of Canada then got rid of income trust, the liberal government of the day. And why I mentioned this is I just so happen to have been doing some polling in Calgary at the time. And,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And, um, the position of the conservatives at the time was, uh, you know, income trust bad. And the position of the liberals at the time was income trust good. And they like flipped overnight, right? When the liberals got rid of them. And then the conservatives were opposed to, to that particular point of view.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And maybe I shouldn&#39;t even say the conservatives were saying income, income trust bad, but they were, you know, they weren&#39;t exactly, you know, their biggest champions. And so this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this polling showed that Canadians were very opposed to income trusts.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then the Liberals went and they got rid of income trusts. And all of a sudden, Canadians were very</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">very supportive of income trusts, right? right? Because like, at least in Calgary, because what happened was, everybody took their cues from the political leaders, and all of a sudden, an issue that they didn&#39;t think about at all, they just lent their, they took the opinion of somebody that they trust on these particular matters, which is their political leaders. So it happens all the time, right? It&#39;s not something that people have been thinking about. It&#39;s not a high salience issue, as we say, and because it&#39;s a low salience issue, you&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re much more willing to lend to somebody else your support and take take their opinion and call it your own opinion. And I suspect a certain amount of that will happen here, but it&#39;s always a bit of a trade, right? Like it&#39;s never a perfect conversion. Like there&#39;s an efficiency to that conversion. And if you, the popular person takes an unpopular position, yeah, you might move that unpopular position, but that unpopular position is going to move you too. And the question just becomes where and how much. And while I&#39;m certainly not saying that this is is going to drop Pierre Polyev even into a race, let alone out of contention.</span>

            <span class="text">You can&#39;t take too, too many of these positions and expect it not to dent your popularity over time. So I do think it&#39;s interesting that he basically took the bait, right? And yes, he will make Fix the Broken Borders more popular with Canadians widely, but he&#39;s going to make Pierre Polyev less popular doing this too. And if you spend the next eight months making this exact same trade,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And in this case, I think, Corey, this articulates a very helpful sort of way of talking about when we talk about political capital being spent, this is a version of it too. This is not the most natural version of it. the more natural version of it is you find something you want to do. It&#39;s maybe unpopular, but you either want to do it because you feel like a small constituency or group or just frankly, just conviction that you have that it needs to be done and you spend that capital. But this is also a version of that same thing. When you spend capital on doing something and it reduces your own popularity, that is capital being spent. And in this case, it might be small nicks or small all cuts, but the thousand-cut strategy is conventional wisdom, because it&#39;s conventional wisdom. It has happened before, where it wasn&#39;t one thing that led to the downfall of Pierre Poliev in the final year of an election. They said, hypothetically, but it was many small, stupid things that led to it, so to speak. And at some point, maybe people are like, yeah, we&#39;re tired of the sloganeering, and this was the last slogan that was added to the pile. We just didn&#39;t buy into it, and this guy was pretty hollow, and he just exposes a bunch of of stuff. And you never know where that snowball kind of can lead to. With Justin Trudeau in the seat, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to lead to anything.</span>

There&#39;s been a lot of pardon scandals in my lifetime. I remember Bill Clinton pardoning people who had donated to his presidential library. Obviously, we remember Donald Trump pardoning all sorts of shady characters, one of which he&#39;s now named ambassador to France, because that&#39;s the fucking world we live in here. and I don&#39;t think this is a good addition, right? I don&#39;t think that Joe Biden is wrong that Hunter Biden&#39;s prosecution got very political. There were a lot of political voices leaning on it. They squashed a plea deal at the last minute, a judge did. That felt very political. That doesn&#39;t really happen like that very frequently in court and so it&#39;s tough to think that he got a fair shake but</span>
