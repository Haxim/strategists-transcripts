        <p>With Stephen Carter returning next week, the rest of the gang use this opportunity to take a plane ride down to Mar-a-Lago and talk the strategy of proactive Donald Trump management.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Zain Velji discuss Trudeau's visit to Mar-a-Lago and the reactions of Danielle Smith and Pierre Poilievre to the same. Was being the first leader to visit Trump a good idea or did Trudeau set a trap for himself? Can Danielle Smith elbow her way into an international conversation? And is the Michael Jackson impersonator available to do podcasts? Stephen Carter is still in an undisclosed Southern Hemisphere New Zealand, returning next week. Annalise Klingbeil asks the questions and demands answers.</em></p></blockquote>

They were hoping that they took, you know, Dominic, that they took Katie, that they took the Prime Minister, and someone would hit it off with someone around that table.

But seriously, this was a relationship building exercise to see if there was any vibe, right? If there was any vibe that they could present themselves, not as a bunch of liberal snowflakes, but be like, oh yeah, we can get along with these people. And I think that was fundamentally the purpose of the trip. And I think that was fundamentally a pretty good strategy.

Sometimes he was effective, sometimes he was not in those four years, but he sure learned a fucking lot. I guarantee that&#39;s the case.

And we just keep repeating, you know, Canada and America are great friends and we don&#39;t take the bait. And, you know, I&#39;m sure there was an awful lot of that on the way down as they were thinking about those roles. It was probably an awful lot of, okay, well, Justin, you&#39;re going to be the one who talks to Donald Trump because he really respects like the leader and he doesn&#39;t want to be talking to a second in command. So you talk to him and we&#39;ll try to sidebar with all of the other people who we think might be quite influential, like the Commerce Secretary. And we&#39;ll divide it up in this way.

He doesn&#39;t talk to governors. And so there is a certain understanding that that is where the conversation is. And you give up your own power to them when you elevate somebody who&#39;s at a subnational level like that. Like, imagine Trudeau having a special relationship with a premier in Australia. You know, he calls up, you know, he&#39;s like, I was just talking to Chris Minns of New South Wales. And, you know, we&#39;ve come to this conclusion about the Australian government. That&#39;s never going to fucking happen. That&#39;s not even going to happen with Trump as president, right? Because that&#39;s just not how international relations work.

She maybe even gets investment to Alberta in her mind, right? And she thinks like, hey, I&#39;m trying to create a free market utopia here. So why don&#39;t you all come and join us in this free market utopia? I think there&#39;s a couple of problems with that, though. One is, it&#39;s funny to say, but when you look at how Daniel Smith is governing, she&#39;s not actually governing that right wing. She doesn&#39;t have a lot of things she can point to and say, see, we&#39;re the right wing Canada model. No, she&#39;s governing in a much more populist sense. She&#39;s a little all over the place with moves that it would be tough to peg down. I mean, just last week, she was basically nationalizing environmental data, right? That&#39;s not a small government approach to things. And there are other examples of that if you look at it over the past, I don&#39;t know, 36 months of her running and then being premier. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s not so clean. she can&#39;t be held up as this model as this totemic right winger in Canada, because that&#39;s just not how she&#39;s governed. It would be pretty tough. Outside of social issues, I think to make any kind of case on that. And frankly, there are Americans who are far more to the right than her on social issues. There are Canadian premiers who are arguably more to the right than her on social issues. So I just don&#39;t think she can be the model she wants to be there. But all of that that is almost secondary. I just, listen, I don&#39;t, it&#39;s tough. This is tough medicine for many Canadians to swallow, but I&#39;m just going to say it. Americans do not think about Canada.</div>

Fucked if they know, they might hear them on a podcast. They might think of them as a curiosity, but they&#39;re never going to elevate them into international conversation in that way. Will she be on more podcasts? I&#39;m sure she will. Will she potentially get the ear of some of the bigger thinkers in Trump&#39;s orbit? Yeah, that&#39;s a real possibility too.

Nobody is going to deal with a subnational government on these particular moments unless it&#39;s to hit somebody over the head with it. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying here.

          <div class="said">really really talks multiple times about the value of oil and gas pipelines you know providing the united states with the oil and gas it requires goes back to affordability which i think the affordability line is basically the only thing that was on message in all of it right? Because you&#39;re talking to Americans and affordability in the United States, right? And you are talking about providing oil and gas to the United States and that being part of energy security. I don&#39;t think many Americans think of Canada as providing energy security to them. We do. But again, it goes back to that American psychology. And they would generally see their energy sovereignty coming from themselves because they&#39;re Americans and America defends America and America supports America. So I read through that and I think, okay, well, you&#39;re trying to make it all about oil and gas and and in the you know the so-called readout certainly they talked about that i think that again this is one of those funny things when you&#39;re the prime minister and you&#39;re sitting there in mar-a-lago and you&#39;re thinking about the things that will be pain points for the prime or president of the united states of course oil and gas is going to be very high on your list you know so you&#39;re going to use that as the wedge you&#39;re going to use that as the conversation and maybe you want to hear that and say well so daniel smith is right so we should really be be talking about oil and gas and the need to be secure and all of that but you somewhat undercut that by then talking about all of these pipelines that you want to see too and turning it from a give to an ask right i am going to give you oil and gas or we could use another pipeline here mr president what are we trying to do here and and i think she&#39;s just trying to have her cake and eat it too when</div>

I&#39;m making a political sort of theater and act and tact comparison, which is she&#39;s very much Trumpian in the sense of having, you know, imaginary problems that don&#39;t exist and creating theater out of it and then proposing imaginary solutions that kind of solve it all for political gain. and and it&#39;s fascinating but i think one of the reasons it&#39;s short is she wanted to shop it around</div>

This is a federal responsibility. Why are you getting involved in this? So you make it almost feel like it&#39;s designed to be talking to Albertans or Canadians, but clearly based on your choice of language, the words you use, the way you phrase certain things, you are talking to the United States or you&#39;re attempting to. I don&#39;t think that it got exactly stellar pickup in the US of A, right? So yeah, maybe it&#39;s just as simple as that to provide political cover. But maybe it&#39;s not so simple. Maybe she is doing exactly what Zane said, and she&#39;s trying to create this tight Trumpian style format that he would potentially read and say, yeah, I mean, I love that. I love that. I love how short and to the point that is. It&#39;s tough to say, but it&#39;s certainly a stylistic choice that I think leads to some tortured prose.

Once again, not making a direct comparison on ideology here, but from like strategy intact, is that every day has been a Pierre Polyev day. Either he&#39;s been kicking down the prime minister or he&#39;s been taking control of a policy or he&#39;s been doing something.

Pierre Polyev is our Canadian political ecosystem. And the fact that he wasn&#39;t for three days, that he wasn&#39;t mentored at the premier&#39;s meetings, that he wasn&#39;t Doug Ford at the head of the premier&#39;s council, that he wasn&#39;t Justin Trudeau heading to Mar-a-Lago probably expedited what we thought was good, at least what I thought was going to be a couple of weeks going for Pierre Polyev before he broke. broke but nope he broke he got the visuals and he did the thing that that the chat gpt of the podcast could have predicted do</div>

But it was kind of breaking things from a tax point of view. And it doesn&#39;t matter if you know what an income trust is. I don&#39;t think I need to get into it. All you really need to know is that the government of Canada then got rid of income trust, the liberal government of the day. And why I mentioned this is I just so happen to have been doing some polling in Calgary at the time. And,</div>

So it happens all the time, right? It&#39;s not something that people have been thinking about.

And if you, the popular person takes an unpopular position, yeah, you might move that unpopular position, but that unpopular position is going to move you too.

          <div class="said">And in this case, I think, Corey, this articulates a very helpful sort of way of talking about when we talk about political capital being spent, this is a version of it too. This is not the most natural version of it. the more natural version of it is you find something you want to do. It&#39;s maybe unpopular, but you either want to do it because you feel like a small constituency or group or just frankly, just conviction that you have that it needs to be done and you spend that capital. But this is also a version of that same thing. When you spend capital on doing something and it reduces your own popularity, that is capital being spent. And in this case, it might be small nicks or small all cuts, but the thousand-cut strategy is conventional wisdom, because it&#39;s conventional wisdom. It has happened before, where it wasn&#39;t one thing that led to the downfall of Pierre Poliev in the final year of an election. They said, hypothetically, but it was many small, stupid things that led to it, so to speak. And at some point, maybe people are like, yeah, we&#39;re tired of the sloganeering, and this was the last slogan that was added to the pile. We just didn&#39;t buy into it, and this guy was pretty hollow, and he just exposes a bunch of of stuff. And you never know where that snowball kind of can lead to. With Justin Trudeau in the seat, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to lead to anything.</div>

I don&#39;t think many Canadians would know that this is what OpenAI has been alleged to do, if it weren&#39;t for the New York Times and now Canadian media outlets and others filing the lawsuit. suit it is its own way of uh pushing the conversation win or lose and in this case of course they want the proper legal outcome but i&#39;d say it&#39;s almost secondary when we&#39;re entering these waters not not you know that are that are so new and embryonic in some ways yeah</div>

There&#39;s been a lot of pardon scandals in my lifetime. I remember Bill Clinton pardoning people who had donated to his presidential library. Obviously, we remember Donald Trump pardoning all sorts of shady characters, one of which he&#39;s now named ambassador to France, because that&#39;s the fucking world we live in here. and I don&#39;t think this is a good addition, right? I don&#39;t think that Joe Biden is wrong that Hunter Biden&#39;s prosecution got very political. There were a lot of political voices leaning on it. They squashed a plea deal at the last minute, a judge did. That felt very political. That doesn&#39;t really happen like that very frequently in court and so it&#39;s tough to think that he got a fair shake but</div>
