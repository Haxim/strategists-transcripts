        <p>After the annual audit of web domains owned by The Strategists Media Corporation, the gang turns to a UCP convention that seemingly gives lots of fodder to opponents of the government and a federal Liberal Party that looks increasingly ready to turn the page on their current leader.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Alberta UCP convention before turning attention to the growing conversation that it's time for Justin Trudeau to step down as Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Is Take Back Alberta Danielle Smith's biggest strength or biggest problem? Is there a path forward for Justin Trudeau that doesn't involve a walk in the snow? And why has Corey declared war on people who wear political t-shirts, a group that could be charitably described as 95% of our listening audience? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

They&#39;ve got all the powers of the caucus. And so because they control those two things, they&#39;re much more powerful than the board. And that used to be the case.</div>

And the difference now is who controls when the leadership review happens? Who controls what the leadership review looks like? Who controls who has all of the delegates that they&#39;re pumping in? I mean, when we did the leadership review to keep Redford, it was a tremendous amount of work and we weren&#39;t faced with this level of organized opposition. This level of organized opposition is basically unheard of. Most of the time it is flushed out of the party and they go and they form something like the Wild Rose or the Alberta Party before that. Or, I mean, Randy Thurkelstein has been involved in, I think, two or three different parties being set up. It&#39;s really quite amazing that they have taken over the government party.

Obviously, Danielle Smith was a very essential part of Take Back Alberta&#39;s early victory. Danielle Smith herself was actively saying she would run against Jason Kenney, became one of the people who was immediately somebody in the conversation, I think far more than we appreciated at the time, to be sure. Like, you can run the tape on that. And we&#39;re like, oh, that doesn&#39;t seem like that&#39;s going to go anywhere. We were wrong. And she was an open, active individual challenging Jason Kenney and his positions in these areas. And so in some ways became the front of house for a lot of these same ideas. Obviously, a lot of that Take Back Alberta energy is what was required to get Daniel Smith over the top. We&#39;ve already talked about the fact that it wasn&#39;t a very convincing win. It took many ballots. And if Take Back Alberta hadn&#39;t been involved, she would not be premier. year so there is a reality that&#39;s there too but i think that as both of these organizations started to feel themselves i mean daniel smith&#39;s organization and take back alberta tensions were going to be natural because</div>

There&#39;s going to be 100 others that weren&#39;t even passed as policy conventions. See, for example, like the solar panels. Oh, the solar panel one was crazy.

Policies, individually or as a package, seem interesting. The board, you&#39;ve got Danielle Smith&#39;s leadership and the phraseology and even her speech, which we haven&#39;t even gotten to, but it was largely rehashed from the throne speech, if I can kind of give it that from both the content and tonal perspective.

You know, fantastic. We got one smart idea. Everything else should be tied to the extremists that are coming after the province.

You have shuffled your cabinet, you&#39;ve changed your team. I&#39;m predicting this happens at this point. And then what? What do you have? You have only yourself.

The who question, they&#39;re happy to figure that out. Like, they&#39;re happy to kind of be like, fuck it, we don&#39;t care. It just can&#39;t be this guy. versus the big hang-up, perhaps in the summer and even earlier on, where there was initial rumblings of Trudeau&#39;s weakness was that, well, he&#39;s better than anyone else that could potentially replace him.

          <div class="said">I mean, that statement&#39;s just patently false at this stage. I mean, there are very few people who could do worse than Trudeau at this stage because he&#39;s in such a negative situation. situation. He has watched the party. He has led the party as it has gone into a free fall in the polls. And there&#39;s a time that you can say, well, the polls aren&#39;t everything, right? There&#39;s the polls shift, polls change, polls move. All of these things are true. Polls do do all of those things. But when you&#39;ve got a picture over time that is telling this consistent story, the polls aren&#39;t going to get you out of this. You need a significant shift to get out and the significant shift at this point is the prime minister&#39;s head that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s that&#39;s available to them uh again you know you try and figure out what could you do well what are the what are the other options all you know we could do a cabinet shuffle we just did a cabinet shuffle we could we could get rid of some staff yeah you can get rid of some staff but who&#39;s left to get rid of who&#39;s who&#39;s the person high enough on the uh on the list that actually is in a position to you know in some fashion signal that the the the thing&#39;s going to turn around we you know our last episode was called the d team um by</div>
