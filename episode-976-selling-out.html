It&#39;s a mail-in event. You are mailing in your vote for leadership, and not just the individuals who signed up, not just the 15,000-ish that could have been 20,000 people that signed up for that live event in Red Deer, but all UCP members. Stephen Carter, when you saw this, I want to get your initial take. When you saw the rule change come down with the executive director of the UCP indicating how this was about a flourishing democratic movement, how this was fairer than ever before, how this was the best process that got everyone involved and part of the process. What did you think?</span>

Yeah, that&#39;s the the only way they can ensure a fair process the bc liberals just had a mail-in ballot for their process and the stories that you hear in british columbia about how that unfolded is just staggeringly dirty so i suspect that we&#39;re going to see all kinds of foul play but don&#39;t don&#39;t worry they&#39;ve added a third party um they&#39;ve added a third party you</span>

It&#39;s not hard. Political parties have been doing it, well, forever because it was only recently that we started to switch to mail-in ballots or telephone balloting. So recently, meaning like in the last 15 years. Before that, everything was run in person. So just simply set up. I mean, we talked at one point about the five major centers plus Calgary and Edmonton. That&#39;s certainly a lot of work, but at the same time, it could be managed. You could live stream Jason Kenney&#39;s remarks. You could live stream the election preparedness pieces. And then you could allow every single member the opportunity to vote in person. And if you really wanted to go crazy, then certainly every constituency association is up and running within the UCP. They don&#39;t have, you know, like oftentimes the Alberta Liberal Party or the Alberta Party or even the Alberta NDP may not have all 87 ridings up and running. but the the ucp does i&#39;m sure that they could have run a simple process to ensure that everybody had the ability to vote in this in person but they didn&#39;t choose that which</span>

It&#39;s not about the count. The count&#39;s not where the cheating happens. The cheating happens when you mail out the ballots, the ballots are picked up, the codes are picked up by different people, and those ballots are filled in by people who aren&#39;t the person that they say they are, right?</span>

I&#39;ve seen it many times, and it is something, you know, people have been sent to jail because of it. And I remind you that four years ago, there was a mail-in ballot process that resulted in the current leader of the UCP, the person who&#39;s advocating for this new process, being investigated by the RCMP for the last four years. Now, it does beg the question, why does it take four years? But here we are.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let me start with Brian Jean. His, you know, aggressive calls now with inside the UCP, claiming that Jason Kenney is doing just what Carter said, cheating, that he&#39;s bending the rules in his favor. Is Brian Jean just wise to your earlier commentary on this podcast and elsewhere to shut up and remove himself from the picture because his constant propositioning of himself as a replacement, even when he&#39;s talking about perhaps legitimate things like the rules, doesn&#39;t help the case? Or is Brian Jean on the right wavelength here in your mind from what you see in terms of trying to call out the premier in this process from a strategy perspective? No,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think he&#39;s wrong to make it about him. I said that at the end of last episode. I still believe that. One of the things that Jason Kenney would really have going for him is if people saw this as a vote between Jason Kenney and Brian Jean, both flawed individuals rather than Jason Kenney and this perfect candidate that may or may not exist out there who has all of the virtues you&#39;re looking for. So Brian Jean, if he wants to be successful, he needs to think about this stepwise. Step one is to vacate the office of leader. Step two is to run for leader. It&#39;s not to do the both of them concurrently. That&#39;s not an optimal strategy. That&#39;s not to say it won&#39;t work, but it&#39;s not an optimal strategy.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">One of the things, I mean, a lot of what Carter is saying is there&#39;s a lot of innuendo out there. There&#39;s suggestions, could this vote be appropriate or not? I think last time, if I&#39;m not mistaken, UCP wasn&#39;t mail in, it was mail out, like they mailed out a code to vote, and then they voted on on like computer, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I could be wrong about that. I&#39;m sure someone will correct me if I am. There were, of course, like multiple leadership contests in there with the PC leadership, and then the UCP leadership. But, you know, again, these processes, it&#39;s not the mechanics of the actual thing. And I don&#39;t think Stephen and I are disagreeing on this point. It&#39;s a lot of the things around it, right? Who&#39;s on those lists? How did they get on those lists? Did they know they were on those lists? Did they vote themselves? Is this actually their vote? Is this actually a membership they paid for? All of these things that are, you know, not just party rules, but actually start to bleed into election rules. and so uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh with with the innuendo that was out there in 2017 plus these rule changes plus everything else i guess the macro point step back because we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t have perfect knowledge as to who&#39;s acting in a toward or untoward fashion out there this</span>

He&#39;s not going to take your advice. He&#39;s going to do it. And if not others, more demonstrations like we saw today with UCP MLA speaking out within the legislature on the footsteps of the legislature. They might grow in number. They might stay as small. But the family drama continues. And it continues until Until May 18th, Carter, at least, because we don&#39;t know what happens on the back end of that vote. I bring up the two questions, right? Logistics, OK, let&#39;s say they&#39;ve solved that. Legitimacy, still very much on the table on the 18th. Zoom out for a second and map out for me what you think the terrain of Alberta politics dominated by this family drama will look like for the next, well, foreseeably two months here.</span>

You&#39;ve got a weird dynamic in the legislature, And it&#39;s just going to get weirder. Today, you had a number of constituency presidents plus a number of MLAs stand on the front steps of the legislature and basically condemn the rule change, right?</span>

And it&#39;s not the kind of thing where I think it&#39;s going to get better over time. it&#39;s just going to sit there and fester and people are going to see then you&#39;re going to have stories that come out about somebody being sent a uh you know a vote or an id or a membership that they didn&#39;t ask for and you&#39;re going to have stories about those things not showing up that you did ask for and did it come out of my mailbox and it&#39;s just going to be hit after hit after hit after hit all the all the while you&#39;ll note of this list of seven that i mentioned i didn&#39;t mention kind of you know instigator number one here i didn&#39;t mention our friend from fort mcmurray</span>

How are you trying to spin this as the greatest show in Alberta? Not drama, but this is a natural healing exercise of concern. Tell us what we do. We&#39;ve now taken what was supposed to be two and a half weeks, Turn it into two months. Stephen Carter, what&#39;s the game plan?

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, basically what I&#39;m going to do is remind you that if you&#39;re an MLA, your primary responsibility is that in the house. In the same fashion that staff would be asked not to work on leaderships during work hours, MLA should not be working on this process during work hours. we need to make sure that we are focused on um the outcome uh for sure i mean but the outcome for albertans we have a very positive budget we have uh lots of legislation that needs to get pushed through that should be our focus during the working hours outside</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">outside of working hours you can do what you want to do you can be a part of whatever movie you want to be a part of but during the working hours let&#39;s get focused again on why people elected us and that&#39;s to get the job done for Albertans.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And if we can do that, you&#39;ve taken already a big step forward, because then at least you&#39;ve got, you know, 12 hours every day, where you don&#39;t have MLA shitting on the leader. And that&#39;s ultimately what you&#39;re trying to do. Do what you need to do, do what you want to do outside of this, but stop using the media. This is now a closed process with members, make the calls, send your emails. But don&#39;t do this during work hours, and don&#39;t do it through the media.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, you&#39;re sitting in that room. You&#39;re waiting to pitch next, of course. UCP has this massive retainer that&#39;s available.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yes and that for me. What are you suggesting that the UCP do for the next two months? Is there any way to polish a turd or is this going to be a turd regardless? Carter says, listen, working hours, we focus on our political wins not bad advice carter and then let people do what they need to outside of that don&#39;t use the media it&#39;s a closed process cory what are you adding to that how are you keeping discipline how are you keeping this thing together and not fraying even more if you believe that&#39;s at risk akin to what carter does so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so uh building on what carter said i would i would say first let&#39;s agree what we agree on we want to keep this party together and we want this party to beat the ndp regardless of what occurs in this leadership review uh and whatever spills out of this so we&#39;ve got to stay focused on those things and that naturally leads into some of the points carter was making about staying focused on work the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the the campaign around jason kenney uh and i&#39;m not saying legal or illegal i&#39;m saying clean or dirty are you running this clean or are you running this dirty because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because if you are actually running it clean there are a number of things that i would recommend one of them is actually signal this will be a weird time there are tens of thousands of members there are going to be mistakes with memberships going to the wrong place to the wrong name ballots not showing up all of those things and when they happen we&#39;re not asking you to keep quiet about it we&#39;re asking you to route it through a party process and that process because you want everybody to feel confident and it should be external external oversight of such complaints external uh you know authority to to address those complaints, empowered by the board to do so, with, you know, oversight from constituency presidents, whatever we think would actually calm the waters there. Probably also looking at, you know, an accounting firm or something like that. And by the way, we didn&#39;t mention, but one of the reasons people always go to accounting firms is, you know, they&#39;re a professional body, and they&#39;re required to act with a certain code of ethics. And if they don&#39;t, then they lose their licenses. It&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s not just because accountants are good at counting uh although that doesn&#39;t hurt either uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh so yeah i mean what you need to do is embrace the messiness and have a very neutral separate from the leader process for dealing with any messiness if you&#39;re running it clean if</span>

Because the alternative is, you know, show up at every parade and put yourself at the front. It makes me wonder if the seven MLAs that were there explicitly told Brian, don&#39;t be there And keeping in mind that I got that lovely robo today from Drew Barnes, you know, Drew&#39;s obviously got his own leadership aspirations.

            <span class="text">Corey, I need to ask you about other MLAs in the UCP caucus. About four or five months ago, I don&#39;t even remember when, we did our session regarding you guys providing advice to the hospitality suites, to those who wanted to, you know, potentially be the next leader. I just want to go back to that and stress test it. If you&#39;re sitting side by side with Jason Kenney today in the UCP, is it still celebrating him, applauding him, doing whatever you can to keep the leader? Are you making any tweaks to your advice based on what you see? This is kind of going to be my segue into how fucked is Jason Kenney, which we should get to in a second. But let&#39;s start with the others. And I&#39;m going to throw out names not knowing anything, but if I&#39;m a Doug Schweitzer or others on that front bench who might have ambitions again, Am</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">supported me and allowed me to do this great work I&#39;ve done in my ministry. And look how kick-ass the outcomes are in jobs, economy, and innovation as a result of all of the good actions I&#39;ve taken as minister. Me, me, me. Turn it on you. A good speaker, a good politician is going to be able to take whatever tee up they give, very quickly brush it aside in a way that&#39;s not going to cause trouble for the leader, hit the kind of mandatory checkbox exercise of being loyal, but not dwell on it, not become seen as somebody who is three feet up Jason Kenney&#39;s ass. That&#39;s something that they should be able to do. And if not, well, they&#39;re probably not going to have a good chance of being leader anyhow, right?</span>

Because ultimately what&#39;s going to occur at the end of this very messy process, I suspect, I&#39;m not 100% sure, and we should actually talk about some of the scenarios that could or could not spill out of this in terms of if Jason Kenney wins even by a bit or whatnot. But they say there&#39;s a leadership contest just for the sake of the conversation here.</span>

Whatever those divisions are, they&#39;re going to be looking for a candidate to split right between the middle there. So you also don&#39;t want to be too associated with one side, which I want to stress is not the same as being disloyal. You can be loyal, and</span>

That&#39;s why I ran. That&#39;s why I continue to be proud of the service that Jason Kenney and I am providing to the great province of Alberta. It&#39;s had bumps. It&#39;s been a nightmare. But it&#39;s been a nightmare primarily because we&#39;ve been hit by an external force. That external force is COVID COVID at the same time as we had a massive, massive downturn in our economy.

That was the most obvious solution because it essentially keeps the SGM framework, just spreads it out to multiple locations. You&#39;ve still got your results that day. You&#39;ve still got a conclusion that weekend. That is the most obvious solution. So to go to a mail-in vote was to say we&#39;re going to do something different than the most obvious solution. And there&#39;s not a lot of reason you would do that unless you were trying to find an advantage somewhere. It doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that advantage is in Jason</span>

The best way to win this and the best way to look when you lose this, if you lose this, is the exact same. Remind everybody why you did this. Let&#39;s go back four years to when you started to put the parties together. Because when you were putting these parties together, it wasn&#39;t for the self-aggrandizing nature of Jason Kenney becoming the premier. It was to rescue, you know, quote unquote, rescue a province from the grips of negative outcome from not having real political leadership. You&#39;ve make the case that you haven&#39;t seen real political leadership since the days of Ralph Klein. So how are you going to how</span>

            <span class="text">the leadership candidates that are coming after you don&#39;t have the ability to actually showcase or show how they would be different. So I think that that&#39;s the opportunity is to get in there and say, this is, you know, show how high minded you are and how moral you are. Um, and get in there and, and actually create, uh, an outcome, uh, that is based on, you know, those original principles that you put in place, uh, four years ago.</span>

            <span class="text">um, it is the opposite of the advice I give Brian Jean in many ways, right? Right. It&#39;s to paint yourself against the alternative, because one of the things that comes up in basically every conversation I have with what I would call moderate conservatives in this province is there&#39;s a real fear of whatever comes after him. As much as people may be fed up or exhausted with Jason Kenney, like what comes next seems legitimately scary to a lot of people. And one of the things we haven&#39;t touched on was there was this piece of reporting today by Elise von Scheele, of course, because she breaks all of the major news in</span>

            <span class="text">in Alberta legislature at this point is rapidly becoming a legend, where it was Jason Kenney speaking to caucus staff, saying that he&#39;s trying to keep you open with this saying, right? He doesn&#39;t need this job. He&#39;s trying to keep the lunatics from running the asylum. And one of the things you said, and I hope you don&#39;t mind that I&#39;m just going to throw it out on the pod, is you said, oh, I wonder if that was intentional. Oh, you mean in our track</span>

He is pretty candid in moments when he&#39;s talking to officials and I assume when he&#39;s talking to staff. So I don&#39;t have trouble imagining this being a normal conversation by Jason Kenney.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I, you know, but it&#39;s the kind of messaging that might work. And that&#39;s what&#39;s given me a pause. Like this messaging is actually quite constructive if you are trying to make a case that it&#39;s you or anarchy. Right. And you are just trying to keep this party from getting absolutely wrecked by extreme elements that would otherwise come in and take control of it here. So my advice to Jason Kenney, if he wants to maintain this, is that he&#39;s going to have to find the center in a way that he&#39;s never really found the center in the past. He&#39;s been pushed into it over COVID often against the more right-wing flanks of his party. He has always been more of a pragmatist than his caucus when it comes to some of these issues, which is not saying a lot. I just really want to underline that. But it&#39;s true. And maybe if he creates this whole clash within the party argument where it&#39;s moderation and acceptability to Albertans versus convoys</span>

The now expanded pack of folks that hold a UCP membership that can now vote. They might be either less engaged or satisfied with Jason Kenney or not as motivated or mobilized, to Corey&#39;s point. If you&#39;re helping Kenny, what campaign is he running with those members? He probably has a decent understanding of who they are, who hasn&#39;t signed up. Are you actively now continuing on the micro-targeting, digital-ass campaigns? Construct it for me right now, like two of you. What are you doing with the—I shouldn&#39;t call them less engaged, but let&#39;s just call them the Tier 2 members. They&#39;re not Tier 2 in any other way other than that they didn&#39;t register to go Boots on the Ground and Red Deer, so maybe less engaged in that regard. What are you doing if you&#39;re Jason Kenney, knowing that even if that&#39;s a 60-40 in your direction, that&#39;s better than perhaps what you were going to get with the folks that were going to show up in that Tier 1 boots on the ground to Red Deer membership?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah well absolutely Absolutely. And so it really is about trying to frame it out for both parties. And I actually think Jason Kenney is maybe, I won&#39;t say better at framing out that argument, but his argument is at</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">at least more novel in the sense that people haven&#39;t sat and processed it in the same way. And people have really thought about what they think about Jason Kenney. So there&#39;s maybe an opportunity for him there to sort of reframe the question in people&#39;s minds that improves every time Brian Jean talks, frankly. So what you want to be doing if you&#39;re Jason Kenney is setting the stakes as civilization itself. If you&#39;re wanting to be Brian Jean and the rebels, you&#39;re trying to make it seem like the friendliest rebellion you&#39;ve ever fucking seen. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">previously, there&#39;s dozens of them. Is there a strategic advantage for Kenny there and perhaps a disadvantage? Or you might say the other way around, is there an advantage for the rebel camps to be so disjointed? Or do they need to get under one dome, one comms plan, you know, pool resources, whatever resources means, I think, in this case, generally capacity, right? and start communicating in one drumbeat? Or is their disparate approach, their renegade-style approach that signed up so many members, arguably, we&#39;re assuming, for Red Deer, will that not now work on the Tier 2 membership who are now looking for mobilization and not necessarily perhaps raw anger and perhaps hatred of Jason Kenney? So tell me about their strategy and their splintering, so to speak, because we&#39;re now getting into this very strange, almost writ period for the conservative race, where you&#39;ve got a splintered Rebels group and a Jason Kenney looking to mobilize two different streams of people. Some might say that the group that signed up for Red Deer leans more towards the Rebels group. The group that sits on the sidelines that didn&#39;t sign up leans more towards Kenney. What is the Rebel group, groups plural, thinking about doing right now? Well,</span>

You may not love me, but imagine what happens to this party if Drew Barnes takes over. Imagine what happens. We&#39;ve already seen what happens to this party with Brian Jean in charge. That&#39;s called an NDP government.</span>

He&#39;s out there in his own place. And we don&#39;t want to go back to Doug Schweitzer. We don&#39;t want to go back to Tyler Chandra. We don&#39;t want to go back to, you know, that&#39;s Ed Stelmack and Allison Redford territory. We saw where they took us. They&#39;re just liberals under a different name. So you may not like us all like me, but you can get in and you can push hard to push away from from these other people that may be able to draw large support groups.

And there&#39;s ways that the big battleship can kind of pick you off one by one, ping, ping, ping, but also point to you and the behavior that you – when you&#39;ve got 20 groups, one of them is guaranteed to be an asshole. And he can make that indicative of all the behavior.

            <span class="text">There is going to be a lunatic fringe group. In fact, we&#39;ve already seen some of them saying like, we&#39;re going to blockade the roads to Red Deer. That&#39;s what we&#39;re up against people, right? That&#39;s what we&#39;re up against people. And you&#39;re able to pick the most extreme behavior of this group and you can point to it and you can say that is representative of all opponents of me. And you can conflate and you can expand. And even if these people are actually a fringe of opponents to Jason Kenney, they become standard bearers for them. In many ways, it&#39;s sort of what Russia is doing in Ukraine, right? There&#39;s fascists who got 1.5% of the vote in the Ukrainian election, which is fewer people on the far right than have got the vote here in Canada. But you point to them, and you can point to legitimate fascist acts, and you expand it, and you make the entire country about that, and then you act in. And look, I&#39;m not saying Putin and Kenny are anywhere near in the same leagues here, but it&#39;s a tested and true tactic to just point to one of your opponents and say all of your opponents are like this.</span>

Like the motivation to leak, the motivation to poison the well, the motivation, at least from those who know you the closest and may have turned on you, is highest right now. And I&#39;m not saying that the stories that we&#39;re seeing recently of kenny are all because of ucp or rebel leaks but there&#39;s probably some stuff that&#39;s going to happen how do you prevent against that from like uh communications and uh strategy perspective and i&#39;m kind of broadening the scope here when you know bad shit about you is going to come out or potentially could come out while you&#39;re still trying to win over a group uh</span>

            <span class="text">about if you&#39;re if you&#39;re kenny in this regard well you don&#39;t try to stop it it&#39;s just going to to come. And one of the advantages you have is that whenever this stuff is coming out at this moment, everybody looks at it with a bit of a jaundiced eye because it all seems driven towards the moment. And so you actually get a little bit of benefit too, to be able to say, yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah, of course, of course, this is the conversation. And in some ways it allows you, if you&#39;re Jason Kenney to reinforce, they will do anything, no matter how bad it is for this party, no matter how bad it is for this province to get what they want. But what they want is not what you want. It&#39;s not what I i want it&#39;s not what this province needs and so uh just be ready for it um i&#39;m not saying that you just sit there and limply take the punches but you</span>

Our next segment, Selling Out. Guys, we now have the details of the Liberal NDP Supply and Confidence Agreement. agreements the parties have struck a deal to uh pass particular pieces of legislation supply and confidence pieces through the parliament between now and 2025 the parties have agreed to work together on key policy areas in situations that both parties want the same quote medium term outcome while avoiding an early election call according to the deal the key policy areas include you ready for this carter i am so</span>

Carter, when we recorded last time, we recorded just as this story broke. We talked about the different dynamics that could be at play. Tons of ink has been spilt since then on who won, who lost, how the liberals and Justin Trudeau is selling out his party to go now further further march to the left, how Jagmeet Singh is selling out his party by allowing liberal kleptomania and is doing this for his legacy on being the co-author of pharmacare and dental care.

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really revising much of what I said. I think that the big problem with what I said earlier is that I was pretty focused on the lack of detail. And of course, we were getting that information in kind of real time, right? So we didn&#39;t really know what was coming.</span>

I&#39;m not sure what What Justin Trudeau gave up, what he sold out, I feel like this is a pretty good deal for Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party. And, you know, if there has to be a winner and loser, I guess that means that the loser is, you know, Jagmeet Singh. But even then, you know, he could conceivably get, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to come to you in a second. But Carter, here&#39;s, you know, the Justin Trudeau argument that you&#39;re hearing a lot of. He sold out because he&#39;s marching even further to the left, getting in bed with the NDP, giving away the center position while Pierre Polyev strikes even further to the right, creating a massive hole, even more so than he&#39;s done in the middle, and blowing through all fiscal guardrails because this is going to be a spend, spend, spend legacy. He wants to be the care prime minister, child care, pharmacare, dental care. This is just a bunch of money. And he&#39;s now all in good to the Pierre Polyarv argument, the first NDP prime minister this country&#39;s had. That&#39;s what the argument of Trudeau selling out is. Do you agree with that? No,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I don&#39;t. I think that that just is a simple. First of all, where&#39;s this not his agenda? Where&#39;s this not what he was talking about? I mean, half of these things, more than half of these things, I think almost all of these things were in his platform. This is not, you know, he moved to the left when he ran. He was this guy. He never presented any sort of, and why is he losing, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah more no leaves because more no says i want more fiscal uh accountability more fiscal responsibility trudeau&#39;s response appears to be interesting that&#39;s not what i want off you go so this isn&#39;t this doesn&#39;t feel to me like it&#39;s out of step with what trudeau wants i think that frankly that&#39;s one of the criticisms that the conservatives have leveled towards him is you&#39;re not being fiscally conservative and his response is yeah yeah, I&#39;m not. And he moves on. So I don&#39;t think that this is actually a criticism that sticks because Trudeau is not being that fiscally responsible prime minister. That is not the legacy that he&#39;s seeking to have.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I do. Actually, I think it played out very much that way, in my opinion, the last couple of days. Because of course, the Conservatives will get to fundraise off this like crazy, and they can shout and they don&#39;t have to worry about bringing a government down when they don&#39;t need or have the ability to run an election. The NDP get a number of concrete wins that they can point to. I mean, saying</span>

            <span class="text">saying that they were the party of Medicare was was getting a little stale 60 years out so now we have some some additional things that we can bring forward to say this is the benefit of a government that is liberal backed up by the ndp right and fair enough i mean these are some pretty significant policy wins for the ndp and it plays into what i what i can sort of see forming as a strategy of of jagmeet singh saying you</span>

I think part of me feels like the glue here is less about what gets done, but the two men who&#39;ve signed it, co-authored it, and their personal legacies. I feel like Jagmeet Singh is a guy who knows he&#39;s never going to become prime minister, and the best he can do is co-author pharmacare and dental care. And for Justin Trudeau, this buys him the runway to land the plane on all the legacy projects that he wants wants to be known for over the course of a potential decade. So Carter, do you see that as fail points on objective grounds, the policy measures they need to collectively hit? Or do you feel like the glue could be both men have effectively now co-signed a plan to chart their own political futures and legacies?</span>

If anything, I think that the risk may balance more on the liberal side in two ways. The first way is relative to the NDP because</span>

And then Albertan said, yeah, that sounds fine. What you have to keep in mind is when you look at the polling, people who are willing to vote liberal are generally also willing to vote New Democrat. And people who are willing to vote New Democrat are generally also willing to vote liberal. And the first NDP prime minister is not a scary notion to literally most of this country. Okay? okay so so like to throw it out there as an attack in the general public is fucking dumb it&#39;s fucking dumb and it misses the point and you&#39;re so far in your own bullshit that you can&#39;t actually smell anything else and there&#39;s a whole valley of roses beyond here so uh dumb if it&#39;s for the general public but if you&#39;re playing to this base who actually wakes up every morning and and gets scared about the idea did socialism creep over the border overnight then yeah okay okay, maybe it&#39;s fine.
