I mean, we talked at one point about the five major centers plus Calgary and Edmonton. That&#39;s certainly a lot of work, but at the same time, it could be managed. You could live stream Jason Kenney&#39;s remarks. You could live stream the election preparedness pieces. And then you could allow every single member the opportunity to vote in person. And if you really wanted to go crazy, then certainly every constituency association is up and running within the UCP. They don&#39;t have, you know, like oftentimes the Alberta Liberal Party or the Alberta Party or even the Alberta NDP may not have all 87 ridings up and running. but the the ucp does i&#39;m sure that they could have run a simple process to ensure that everybody had the ability to vote in this in person but they didn&#39;t choose that which</div>

I&#39;ve seen it many times, and it is something, you know, people have been sent to jail because of it. And I remind you that four years ago, there was a mail-in ballot process that resulted in the current leader of the UCP, the person who&#39;s advocating for this new process, being investigated by the RCMP for the last four years. Now, it does beg the question, why does it take four years? But here we are.</div>

          <div class="said">Let me start with Brian Jean. His, you know, aggressive calls now with inside the UCP, claiming that Jason Kenney is doing just what Carter said, cheating, that he&#39;s bending the rules in his favor. Is Brian Jean just wise to your earlier commentary on this podcast and elsewhere to shut up and remove himself from the picture because his constant propositioning of himself as a replacement, even when he&#39;s talking about perhaps legitimate things like the rules, doesn&#39;t help the case? Or is Brian Jean on the right wavelength here in your mind from what you see in terms of trying to call out the premier in this process from a strategy perspective? No,</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">I think he&#39;s wrong to make it about him. I said that at the end of last episode. I still believe that. One of the things that Jason Kenney would really have going for him is if people saw this as a vote between Jason Kenney and Brian Jean, both flawed individuals rather than Jason Kenney and this perfect candidate that may or may not exist out there who has all of the virtues you&#39;re looking for. So Brian Jean, if he wants to be successful, he needs to think about this stepwise. Step one is to vacate the office of leader. Step two is to run for leader. It&#39;s not to do the both of them concurrently. That&#39;s not an optimal strategy. That&#39;s not to say it won&#39;t work, but it&#39;s not an optimal strategy.</div>

          <div class="said">One of the things, I mean, a lot of what Carter is saying is there&#39;s a lot of innuendo out there. There&#39;s suggestions, could this vote be appropriate or not? I think last time, if I&#39;m not mistaken, UCP wasn&#39;t mail in, it was mail out, like they mailed out a code to vote, and then they voted on on like computer, right?</div>

          <div class="said">I could be wrong about that. I&#39;m sure someone will correct me if I am. There were, of course, like multiple leadership contests in there with the PC leadership, and then the UCP leadership. But, you know, again, these processes, it&#39;s not the mechanics of the actual thing. And I don&#39;t think Stephen and I are disagreeing on this point. It&#39;s a lot of the things around it, right? Who&#39;s on those lists? How did they get on those lists? Did they know they were on those lists? Did they vote themselves? Is this actually their vote? Is this actually a membership they paid for? All of these things that are, you know, not just party rules, but actually start to bleed into election rules. and so uh</div>

          <div class="said">uh with with the innuendo that was out there in 2017 plus these rule changes plus everything else i guess the macro point step back because we don&#39;t know we don&#39;t have perfect knowledge as to who&#39;s acting in a toward or untoward fashion out there this</div>

Craziness between now and then. Gene won&#39;t stop. He won&#39;t take Corey&#39;s advice. No offense, Corey. He&#39;s not going to take your advice. He&#39;s going to do it. And if not others, more demonstrations like we saw today with UCP MLA speaking out within the legislature on the footsteps of the legislature. They might grow in number. They might stay as small. But the family drama continues. And it continues until Until May 18th, Carter, at least, because we don&#39;t know what happens on the back end of that vote. I bring up the two questions, right? Logistics, OK, let&#39;s say they&#39;ve solved that. Legitimacy, still very much on the table on the 18th.

Carter says, listen, working hours, we focus on our political wins not bad advice carter and then let people do what they need to outside of that don&#39;t use the media it&#39;s a closed process cory what are you adding to that how are you keeping discipline how are you keeping this thing together and not fraying even more if you believe that&#39;s at risk akin to what carter does so</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">because if you are actually running it clean there are a number of things that i would recommend one of them is actually signal this will be a weird time there are tens of thousands of members there are going to be mistakes with memberships going to the wrong place to the wrong name ballots not showing up all of those things and when they happen we&#39;re not asking you to keep quiet about it we&#39;re asking you to route it through a party process and that process because you want everybody to feel confident and it should be external external oversight of such complaints external uh you know authority to to address those complaints, empowered by the board to do so, with, you know, oversight from constituency presidents, whatever we think would actually calm the waters there. Probably also looking at, you know, an accounting firm or something like that. And by the way, we didn&#39;t mention, but one of the reasons people always go to accounting firms is, you know, they&#39;re a professional body, and they&#39;re required to act with a certain code of ethics. And if they don&#39;t, then they lose their licenses. It&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s not just because accountants are good at counting uh although that doesn&#39;t hurt either uh</div>

I just want to go back to that and stress test it. If you&#39;re sitting side by side with Jason Kenney today in the UCP, is it still celebrating him, applauding him, doing whatever you can to keep the leader? Are you making any tweaks to your advice based on what you see? This is kind of going to be my segue into how fucked is Jason Kenney, which we should get to in a second. But let&#39;s start with the others. And I&#39;m going to throw out names not knowing anything, but if I&#39;m a Doug Schweitzer or others on that front bench who might have ambitions again, Am</div>

I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m marking my ballot yet. I&#39;m going to listen to everybody. I&#39;m going to meet with everybody, and I&#39;ll make my decision as late as possible, frankly.</div>

Now, they may have made a calculation that it was impossible to change them to any degree without getting backlash. So in for a penny, in for a pound.

Or as Carter alluded to that what we often in Alberta think of as the five major centers outside of the big cities, plus Calgary and Edmonton. That was the most obvious solution because it essentially keeps the SGM framework, just spreads it out to multiple locations. You&#39;ve still got your results that day. You&#39;ve still got a conclusion that weekend. That is the most obvious solution. So to go to a mail-in vote was to say we&#39;re going to do something different than the most obvious solution.

Let&#39;s go back four years to when you started to put the parties together. Because when you were putting these parties together, it wasn&#39;t for the self-aggrandizing nature of Jason Kenney becoming the premier. It was to rescue, you know, quote unquote, rescue a province from the grips of negative outcome from not having real political leadership. You&#39;ve make the case that you haven&#39;t seen real political leadership since the days of Ralph Klein. So how are you going to how</div>

Like this messaging is actually quite constructive if you are trying to make a case that it&#39;s you or anarchy. Right. And you are just trying to keep this party from getting absolutely wrecked by extreme elements that would otherwise come in and take control of it here. So my advice to Jason Kenney, if he wants to maintain this, is that he&#39;s going to have to find the center in a way that he&#39;s never really found the center in the past. He&#39;s been pushed into it over COVID often against the more right-wing flanks of his party. He has always been more of a pragmatist than his caucus when it comes to some of these issues, which is not saying a lot. I just really want to underline that. But it&#39;s true.

The now expanded pack of folks that hold a UCP membership that can now vote. They might be either less engaged or satisfied with Jason Kenney or not as motivated or mobilized, to Corey&#39;s point. If you&#39;re helping Kenny, what campaign is he running with those members? He probably has a decent understanding of who they are, who hasn&#39;t signed up. Are you actively now continuing on the micro-targeting, digital-ass campaigns? Construct it for me right now, like two of you. What are you doing with the—I shouldn&#39;t call them less engaged, but let&#39;s just call them the Tier 2 members. They&#39;re not Tier 2 in any other way other than that they didn&#39;t register to go Boots on the Ground and Red Deer, so maybe less engaged in that regard.

So what you want to be doing if you&#39;re Jason Kenney is setting the stakes as civilization itself.

          <div class="said">previously, there&#39;s dozens of them. Is there a strategic advantage for Kenny there and perhaps a disadvantage? Or you might say the other way around, is there an advantage for the rebel camps to be so disjointed? Or do they need to get under one dome, one comms plan, you know, pool resources, whatever resources means, I think, in this case, generally capacity, right? and start communicating in one drumbeat? Or is their disparate approach, their renegade-style approach that signed up so many members, arguably, we&#39;re assuming, for Red Deer, will that not now work on the Tier 2 membership who are now looking for mobilization and not necessarily perhaps raw anger and perhaps hatred of Jason Kenney? So tell me about their strategy and their splintering, so to speak, because we&#39;re now getting into this very strange, almost writ period for the conservative race, where you&#39;ve got a splintered Rebels group and a Jason Kenney looking to mobilize two different streams of people. Some might say that the group that signed up for Red Deer leans more towards the Rebels group. The group that sits on the sidelines that didn&#39;t sign up leans more towards Kenney. What is the Rebel group, groups plural, thinking about doing right now? Well,</div>

And you&#39;re able to pick the most extreme behavior of this group and you can point to it and you can say that is representative of all opponents of me. And you can conflate and you can expand. And even if these people are actually a fringe of opponents to Jason Kenney, they become standard bearers for them. In many ways, it&#39;s sort of what Russia is doing in Ukraine, right? There&#39;s fascists who got 1.5% of the vote in the Ukrainian election, which is fewer people on the far right than have got the vote here in Canada. But you point to them, and you can point to legitimate fascist acts, and you expand it, and you make the entire country about that, and then you act in. And look, I&#39;m not saying Putin and Kenny are anywhere near in the same leagues here, but it&#39;s a tested and true tactic to just point to one of your opponents and say all of your opponents are like this.</div>

And in some ways it allows you, if you&#39;re Jason Kenney to reinforce, they will do anything, no matter how bad it is for this party, no matter how bad it is for this province to get what they want. But what they want is not what you want. It&#39;s not what I i want it&#39;s not what this province needs and so uh just be ready for it um i&#39;m not saying that you just sit there and limply take the punches but you</div>

Carter, when we recorded last time, we recorded just as this story broke. We talked about the different dynamics that could be at play. Tons of ink has been spilt since then on who won, who lost, how the liberals and Justin Trudeau is selling out his party to go now further further march to the left, how Jagmeet Singh is selling out his party by allowing liberal kleptomania and is doing this for his legacy on being the co-author of pharmacare and dental care.

          <div class="said">Corey, I&#39;m going to come to you in a second. But Carter, here&#39;s, you know, the Justin Trudeau argument that you&#39;re hearing a lot of. He sold out because he&#39;s marching even further to the left, getting in bed with the NDP, giving away the center position while Pierre Polyev strikes even further to the right, creating a massive hole, even more so than he&#39;s done in the middle, and blowing through all fiscal guardrails because this is going to be a spend, spend, spend legacy. He wants to be the care prime minister, child care, pharmacare, dental care. This is just a bunch of money. And he&#39;s now all in good to the Pierre Polyarv argument, the first NDP prime minister this country&#39;s had. That&#39;s what the argument of Trudeau selling out is. Do you agree with that? No,</div>

And he moves on. So I don&#39;t think that this is actually a criticism that sticks because Trudeau is not being that fiscally responsible prime minister.

And for Justin Trudeau, this buys him the runway to land the plane on all the legacy projects that he wants wants to be known for over the course of a potential decade. So Carter, do you see that as fail points on objective grounds, the policy measures they need to collectively hit? Or do you feel like the glue could be both men have effectively now co-signed a plan to chart their own political futures and legacies?</div>
