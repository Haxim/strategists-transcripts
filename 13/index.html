        <div class="desc"><p>Zain Velji returns to set things right with this 90 minute grab-bag based on a number of recent Alberta issues: a judge ruling certain advice to cabinet from Chief Medical Officer of Health Deena Hinshaw must be made public; problems filling classrooms and hospitals; and the last days of a mail-in ballot - what should be done, when and why. The pronunciation of the letter Z guest stars.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter take on a grab-bag of political issues in Alberta that illustrate points around cabinet confidentiality, governments fighting "multi-front wars" and the dying days of mail-in ballot races. Should the public know what an official's advice to cabinet is? Will a big speech in the dying days of a mail-in ballot help you or hurt you? And is Corey drinking with the Pope again? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>
