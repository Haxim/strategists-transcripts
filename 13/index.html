        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Zain Velji is on assignment in the United Kingdom so Stephen and Corey take the opportunity to talk about Alberta&#39;s essay contest fiasco and debate how likely Danielle Smith and Pierre Poilievre are to win their respective leaderships. PLUS: fucking Donald Trump, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen and Corey discuss an essay contest in Alberta that became an international embarrassment, how presumptive the front-runners are in the UCP and Conservative Party of Canada leadership contests - and what Donald Trump&#39;s no-good, very-bad week could mean for America. How could an essay with such awful views on women and diversity win third place? Could mishandling nuclear secrets tank Trump? And is anybody else excited for when the copyright expires on all The Strategists&#39; podcasts? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

And more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the systems we use (and have used in the past) to choose political leaders. Why don&#39;t we have delegated conventions anymore? Shouldn&#39;t the caucus have a say in who their boss is? And is one-member-one-vote the worst system... until compared to all the others?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the things the federal Liberals, Conservatives and NDP - plus the Alberta UCP and NDP - should be watching out for in these dog days.

Also, they check in on the corpse in the field that is the Ontario election. Yup, still dead. But maybe not after this week!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about next steps for the UCP - the party, the contenders, the cabinet members, the soon-to-be-former leader. Plus, the gang checks in on the Ontario election. What the hell happened (in Alberta, not Ontario)? How successfully is Jason Kenney &#34;writing his own obituary&#34; (in Alberta, not Ontario)? And is Stephen Carter the next kamikaze candidate (maybe both)? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang headed up to Edmonton for a chat with 400 of their closest friends at the Maharaja Banquet Hall. There was music. There was fancy dress. There was analysis of the UCP leadership review results, Kenney&#39;s resignation and speculation about what comes next. There was a very long drink line. Only the third on that list is actually apparent in this audio file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Alberta UCP&#39;s leadership review Kenney&#39;s not-resignation resignation and what&#39;s next for the UCP in this live show recorded in Edmonton, Alberta. How did the UCP get to this point? Does Jason Kenney have a next act? And should we be concerned about that leak (from the ceiling above Zain&#39;s head)? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our thanks to the Maharaja Banquet Hall, Ryan Sauvé, Zain Velji&#39;s tailor and the parents of our live studio audience, for this star-studded spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

Significant improvements are made to the podcast in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Eric Grenier give instant reaction to fresh UCP leadership results that saw Jason Kenney narrowly survive - only to resign his leadership. What comes next for the Alberta UCP? Should Jason Kenney stick around until his replacement is chosen? And why is a normal day in Alberta politics so much more interesting than an interesting day in Ontario politics?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang decides it&#39;s time to dig into the Ontario election and Stephen Carter decides its time to pick fights with Ontario political podcasts. Topics include: message discipline (or lack thereof), controlling your brand (or failing to do so), debate moderation (and the ignoring of the same) as well as storytelling in politics and why sometimes - usually, in fact - the biggest tactical mistake you can make is hating your opponent. PLUS: how to make everything about housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter watch the TVO Ontario leader&#39;s debate so you don&#39;t have to. What&#39;s our take on the state of the Ontario provincial election? Are the Liberals and NDP strategically misfiring? And what does it reveal about Stephen that he was so quick to assume David Herle was talking about him?

Did the takes improve? Maybe. Did they change? Probably. Do we have sound effects? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter follow up a morning media appearance by doing it all again, but better - discussing the Conservative Party debate and oddsmaking Jason Kenney&#39;s chances of surviving his leadership review next week. Was the &#34;sad trombone&#34; the best innovation since the Saturn V rocket? Do more signs point to Kenney winning or losing on the 18th? And how long until we can lose 36% of our money to crypto volatility directly from our nearest ATM machine?

The pronunciation of the letter Z guest stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter take on a grab-bag of political issues in Alberta that illustrate points around cabinet confidentiality, governments fighting &#34;multi-front wars&#34; and the dying days of mail-in ballot races. Should the public know what an official&#39;s advice to cabinet is? Will a big speech in the dying days of a mail-in ballot help you or hurt you? And is Corey drinking with the Pope again?
