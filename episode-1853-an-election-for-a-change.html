            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Because the audience is stupid, Zane. I mean, not our audience, but the audience of voters in general are not smart. And as a result, they haven&#39;t even started to pay attention yet. So this idea that the polls really are reflecting something that&#39;s real and that it&#39;s all already pre-baked, that&#39;s just not true. because the general population isn&#39;t even aware that Mark Carney&#39;s the prime minister yet instead of Justin Trudeau there&#39;s so many layers to go through or if they are aware they&#39;re like oh I heard that Mark Carney exists that&#39;s a great thing you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know and they and they&#39;re making wafer thin determinations and who knows what they&#39;ll be making their wafer thin determinations on in</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter comes out punching for why this election is an election as the party against the question. Corey, your opening statement.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I&#39;m not sure any election&#39;s an election anymore. We&#39;ve talked a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">a bit about this.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Powerful. I don&#39;t think that we have a clue how people change their minds anymore. I think we&#39;ve seen from a lot of recent elections, including the U.S. presidential, including including the Alberta election, including the BC election, that polls at the start are just as or even more predictive than polls at the end. I got a couple of theories why that&#39;s the case. So maybe we do most of our deciding in the lead up to elections now, and we&#39;re just trying to get those yokels with their wafer thin determinations in the last bit, but they were always going to determine based on what the people around them said. You know, the people they lend their trust to say, I don&#39;t know who to vote for, Jim, who are you going to vote for? But Jim has made up his mind. Jim is done. Jim is baked. So maybe the next 35 days don&#39;t matter, except for the fact that we&#39;re now recording three times a week and the content machine must be fed. Maybe</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Maybe that&#39;s it. Carter, what ended up starting as a bullshit question might now end up being the greatest podcast episode of all time. It is now singularly up to you, Stephen Carter, to yes and this and and rebut Corey&#39;s pretty compelling point about why this election is not an election. Listen,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Listen, I have to agree with Corey that the polls at the beginning tend to be more reflective of the election outcome than</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">than the polls at the end. But his rationale for why is completely wrong.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So what he needs to understand is that things can move in cycles, right? They move up, they move down, and then they return back to benchmark. Right now, the benchmark is completely blown up, And I&#39;m just dying to know how this actually all unfolds. Will, you know, Mark Carney continue to hold everybody&#39;s attention? Will Pierre Polyev be the next Trudeau? These are the big questions that I think this election will actually answer in the course of the five weeks of the actual election. So, Carter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, your point is that you agree with Corey that polls can be similar looking at the start as what they are in the end, but there&#39;s a bunch of stuff that happens that is actually determinant to lead the election back to where it started. Is that the case that you&#39;re making here? yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah number one is when the election is itself the election day actually is when all of our communication is targeted we we try and target and communicate with people in the last 72 hours to 72 seconds of the actual campaign and that is uh that means that everything returns back to baseline and that&#39;s what i&#39;m talking about is the actual baseline so the baseline can we can vary five points up five points down but the baseline is right there cory</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Steven, as long as I&#39;ve known you, it&#39;s been a campaign strategy of yours that when there&#39;s a poll in the field, you get all of your supporters to make sure they answer their phone. Make sure that they&#39;re replying to those text messages because you want to show momentum. So everyone&#39;s realized that they can manipulate polls. They&#39;ve realized that they can go in and by just putting a little bit of effort into their supporters they can make a poll swing one way or another but it&#39;s not real it doesn&#39;t mean that more people out there support you or not and so we get whipsawed by the random number generator and by the stephen carters of the world doing things or not doing things based on how the pollster polls in the first place that can affect things and then the other challenge is um it&#39;s just become a lot harder to poll people so this you&#39;re getting increasingly selection biases which means people are increasingly having to do all sorts of wild weightings and as those weightings go on as there&#39;s a million polls in the field the demographics that are least inclined to answer polls become pretty fatigued and they become even less likely to answer polls and you end up with these extremes and so polls start to reflect enthusiasm i think more than they should as a result because everyone&#39;s like fuck the 18th poll from ipsos i think i&#39;m over it except for the people who have been told by the stephen carter on their campaign make sure sure you answer that poll, make sure you say that our candidate&#39;s the one.</span>

Or do you feel like it&#39;s going to naturally pick up a certain narrative arc as it relates to Team A is ahead, Team B is behind. But by single digits. Team B will come close enough to Team A. They will say that they&#39;re now ahead. They will use that as a momentum builder. It will be an excuse to spend more money. And then they&#39;ll fight, you know, like, do you think this narrative is pre-baked or just the outcome is pre-baked? I guess is what I&#39;m getting at.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. But I do think that we all have our beats. The media has their beats, the campaigns have their beats. You&#39;re going to see in week one, one party is dominating the narrative based on who started strong, right? And then in week two, oh, is something happening? Maybe the start is weakening here, right? And then the media will push towards the narrative of the other team doing better and finding their footing and moving forward. Then you&#39;re going to have the debate and the debate is going to confirm the point of view that was probably there at the start. And before you know it, you&#39;re in the closeout week and it just feels like chaos and nobody knows what&#39;s going on. And everybody gets a little nervous about calling anything in a close election and what could be anything too close to call, you know? Yes, they&#39;re ahead based on the the polls but the polls have been wrong before and you get the same story and then the result comes in and the result will probably be not too distant from where it is right now however that being said you</span>

You&#39;re trying to, you&#39;re trying to have your cake and eat it too. Message discipline is not putting your message into everything you say and in the process muddying every other message. That&#39;s a very facile view of message discipline. Message discipline, I always, I like to describe it as it&#39;s like sculpting, you know? So there are, you can paint and paint is adding layers onto things, right? You&#39;ve got first layer of paint, you go, you put on your second layer of paint, third layer more detail work until you&#39;ve got a picture. That is not what messages are. You do not keep adding to messages until you&#39;ve got everything that you could possibly say. Message discipline is sculpting. Message discipline is saying, what can I take out of this to leave only what&#39;s essential? And you don&#39;t have two messages. You have one message. The other way to think about key messages is this. Key messages are like locks on a door. One is usually pretty good. Two, Two, you&#39;re getting into a weird place. Three, you&#39;re in a bad fucking neighborhood. And right now, the conservatives are in a really bad neighborhood because their slogan has two messages.

            <span class="text">think we would each do it differently. But if we&#39;re working on it together, I think it&#39;s an interesting question, for sure. Like if we were doing it ourselves, trying to come up with it and pitch at a meeting, I think that&#39;d be different than a collective process if we were the room. Not to get too different, but I think it&#39;s important to make mention. So let&#39;s do it as if we were the room. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. So let&#39;s just say, you guys have heard me say this before, but often when I&#39;m doing a creative exercise, I like to take a bit of a double diamond approach. And so first thing you want to do is you want to make sure that you&#39;re building the right thing and then you want to build the thing right. So where Carter was going with what are we trying to say, that&#39;s the most essential work to begin, right? What is the brand we&#39;re trying to have for Pierre Poliev? What is the overall message we want to leave with Canadians? What are their current and desired sentiments? Like you go through what&#39;s effectively a creative brief to understand the answers to all of those questions. And then you go, it&#39;s called double diamond because you go from narrow to big and then narrow to big. So we&#39;d go really big with</span>

            <span class="text">with trying to get everything on the table of what we think PR is supposed to be. Then we would distill it into like one sentence, maybe a couple of sentences of exactly what we&#39;re trying to do in terms of current and desired sentiment brand. And then we would just start throwing spaghetti at the wall, right? And it&#39;s hard not to jump immediately to spaghetti, but my caution</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">anybody out there doing this is it&#39;s not going to be a very focused or useful exercise and any success will be accidental unless you know what you&#39;re trying to do. Because Carter&#39;s talking and the first thing I want to say is like, oh, maybe putting you first, right? Maybe putting you first is the message the Conservatives want to go with. And then he&#39;s talking a little bit more. I&#39;m like, oh, Canada&#39;s strong. Maybe we&#39;re saying Canada&#39;s strong when Canadians are strong. Maybe that&#39;s the message. Maybe we work in that space. and maybe both of those are fine ideas that are building on his and as you&#39;d say yes and in steven carter but back the bus up like what are what is he actually trying to say to canadians because even in those two i gave you the putting you first and canada&#39;s strong when canadians are strong one of them is a message about canada and strengthening canada to me that feels like you&#39;re walking right into a frame the liberals are going to win you</span>

            <span class="text">months ago, I pitched Canada Strong for the Conservatives, which the Liberals then took, and then the Conservatives went with Canada First. Crazy times. But putting you first maybe is a little more in that space because you&#39;ve got to have a frame that&#39;s separate from the Liberals. So I&#39;ve ping-ponged around. I&#39;ve ended up back where we are. But I think the exercise has to start with what the hell are you trying to say? And I think the result that we have right now from the Conservatives is they just went straight to spaghetti. And worse, they said, we are throwing spaghetti at the wall, but every piece of spaghetti we throw has to have this meatball called everything we&#39;ve said for the last two fucking years.

It&#39;s making people feel something about you. And in the context of an election specifically, making people feel like you are the answer to the question, And you&#39;ve probably set the question too, in the context of all that work. So I</span>

But at the end of the day, you&#39;re just trying to make people feel things. You&#39;re trying to make them feel an anxiety about a specific issue, set the ballot question, and you&#39;re trying to make them feel like your candidate is the only answer. And if you&#39;ve done your job right, you&#39;ve set a question where your candidate is, of course, the only answer. And what we&#39;re seeing right now from the conservatives, I think, is an inability to pivot. You&#39;re seeing just an awful lot of work that they need to do a pretty aggressive job</span>

I want to talk about Mr. Mike Myers making an appearance with Mark Carney in his first campaign ad. I want to talk about the star candidates that that have been recruited by Mark Carney, two six-footers, and Gregor Robertson and Evan Solomon to lead the pack as their star candidates. We discussed this a few episodes ago, where we talked about the liberals going down other partisan stripes. This is not that, but this is something in the star direction. And then I want to talk about the star power of the first minister of our province, Danielle Smith. We&#39;ll end the show there with her Breitbart interview, interview what that does to the race, the strategies for Carney, Polyev, and Smith, and was this actually accidental or was this part of a bigger play for her? I think it&#39;s also worthy of examining given our Alberta sort of context. But let&#39;s start with the celebrity endorsement. Stephen Carter, we already have one.</span>

You can bring out the biggest names and the biggest artists and the biggest acts in your country, and it won&#39;t necessarily move the needle. Is Mike Myers any different?

There are others, but I&#39;m going to throw these three into the mix just to get the conversation started. Where are we at with star candidates? Is this useful to the liberals strategically?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">All right. Well, let&#39;s talk about, there&#39;s two types of star candidates in my mind, right? One is star candidates who have had political office before. And one</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is people who are just such big names, they&#39;re star candidates. And often you can be both, right? I think Gregor</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Robertson counts as one. So he certainly does in Edmonton. Evan Solomon is one of those two categories, right? He&#39;s the name</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that people know. know the benefit of a political star candidate is they can run an organization they they will get volunteers out there&#39;s some enthusiasm and frankly they&#39;ve proven they know how to do it at big levels usually and win absolutely so the conventional wisdom is always what a star candidate gets you what five to ten percent steven that&#39;s basically what people say doesn&#39;t fundamentally change the game but it&#39;s not quite fair to say it becomes a game of inches because because 5-10% can be pretty material in an election, and even an election that we would deem not that close becomes either very close or flipped based on a star candidate being in there. The celebrity star candidates is a bit more of a crapshoot, because they actually, they, in my experience, often run the other way. They are used to being famous and popular and loved, but they don&#39;t know how to run a fucking campaign, and it can be very difficult for them them to reconcile the actual grunt work of being a candidate which let&#39;s be really clear is not glamorous it&#39;s knocking on a lot of doors it&#39;s making a lot of phone calls it&#39;s going around and getting yelled at by people in church basements as you know a woman with enormous mole on her face is spewing chicken from her chicken salad at you as she&#39;s talking about an issue that&#39;s not even in your jurisdiction like this is the reality of politics and stars have a lot of trouble with that in my experience and so sometimes they can cut back the other way but they have a halo and the hope is that that halo gets them more votes as well like more people will come out i really think the real benefit of star candidates generally speaking is if there is vote to be consolidated if you have a situation i&#39;m going to use an example here let&#39;s just say i where&#39;s so he running i forget the writing uh</span>

By having a star there, you are signaling viability in a huge way, and most of that NDP vote is going to run to Sohi because they&#39;re going to see him as clearly the best option rather than two people they have never heard of before. So that&#39;s the real value of star candidates, in my opinion.</span>

I, you know, I think that Gregor is great. I think that Amarjeet, so he, well, he needs to be doing something in the next year. So, you know, this is, this is, it&#39;s not a great, not a great crop of stars, but I don&#39;t think you need a great crop of stars if you&#39;re Mark Carney. I think I said that last time.

Of course, I&#39;m going to use whatever context is most appropriate to move that ball forward, whether I&#39;m talking to officials in Washington, DC, whether I&#39;m talking to right wing media outlets, of course, my goal has never deviated, which is to remove the threat of tariffs and reduce the threat of tariffs. And that&#39;s exactly what I did. And I&#39;m not going to apologize for that.</span>

So I don&#39;t want to lead you down that path, but do you feel like this is related to that? Do you feel like she&#39;s trying to make the case, lay the groundwork for the case, that we might be into a national unity crisis or that Alberta wants in or out? note, like, whatever that version looks like. I know these sound crazy, but we&#39;re in crazy times where the Premier&#39;s saying crazy things, Carter.

            <span class="text">the feeling, you know, I&#39;m sure somebody could, you know, give me a list of all of the questions and say, Oh, no, no, you&#39;re not right. The weight wasn&#39;t how you felt it. But my feeling was Pierre Polyev&#39;s questions were largely about how do we know we can trust you to stand up for Canada a lot of variations on that and Mark Carney&#39;s questions were how are we going to make how do you feel about these ways that Pierre Polyev is not standing up for Canada like if your goal is to set the frame day one was such a home run for the liberals because everybody was talking not just about Canada and the need to stand up for Canada but questioning whether Pierre Pierre Polyev can. And that was a huge assist, huge fucking assist from Danielle Smith on that particular one, right? Like, I can only imagine the rage that they were feeling behind the scenes there. But then you pile on Doug Ford, clearly not enthusiastic about Pierre Polyev, a lot of reporting that was coming out over the weekend of the conservative war room saying, how do we get a message to Donald Trump to not make it look like we&#39;re too chummy? And then, of course, that very thing happens. So there&#39;s a lot of conjecture as to, did the Conservatives succeed at doing that? Like, this is a nightmare start for them. And so as they are dealing with this immolation, my point remains, I don&#39;t need to do anything as Mark Carney. I think I just sit back and I don&#39;t get accused by the Corey Hogans of the world of trying to be partisan about a matter of statecraft, right? Just let the media eat the guy alive.
