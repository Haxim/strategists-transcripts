We&#39;re doing back-to-back episodes with you tonight and with Annalise tomorrow morning to talk about, while we are a national podcast, we do have a lot of listeners in our home province of Alberta. And you are, I think, the number one get to talk about municipal politics in Edmonton.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>

Seems like a quasi-meme candidate, but is getting double digits, low double digits in some of these polls and is starting to, you know, who knows where his vote cratered to or where his vote exists? There&#39;s an interesting sort of question I have for you there. But your insight regarding, A, the class, right? So let me just walk folks through, right? You got Andrew Dacko you&#39;ve mentioned. He&#39;s the incumbent councillors since 2013. Cartmel, also an incumbent incumbent counselor. He&#39;s also representing a political party, which we&#39;ll get to in a second from 2017.

I don&#39;t have a name I&#39;m just kind of making that sort of general composite profile. None of those people said it&#39;s time for me to kind of do it.

            <span class="text">And if no one is seeming like running to win, I wonder if that&#39;s why we also have a sleepy election.

            <span class="text">are like, you know, running for mayor, but not like running for mayor, not like aggressively wanting to be mayor with a hopeful, propositional, exciting future message, I think the electorate kind of gets that message too and acts accordingly.

Is this that election? What would dictate that in your mind? Just give me a sense on council right now.</span>
