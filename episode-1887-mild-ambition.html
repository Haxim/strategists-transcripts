        <p>Chris Henderson finally unmutes his mic to do a deep dive on the surprisingly competitive Edmonton mayoral election. Why could this race be the closest one in 30 years?  What happens when there's no clear ballot question and voters tune in at the last minute? And how did a dentist's cringe rap video evolve into a legitimate protest campaign? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.<br /><br />You can also watch this episode on YouTube.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod">https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod</a></p>
