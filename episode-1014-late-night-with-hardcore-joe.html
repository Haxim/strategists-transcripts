Let&#39;s start with Twitter Because, Corey, a lot of things have changed at Twitter. Elon Musk has introduced the new $8 blue verified check. He introduced the official badge. He took away the official badge. Now everyone can be, according to an incredible meme, BBC News Alert, because you just pay $8 and you just get to do whatever the fuck you want. But it has led to Twitter being, and I say this without exaggeration, fucking incredible. I have never seen Twitter be as amazing. It&#39;s never been this good. It&#39;s never been this</span>

            <span class="text">good. It&#39;s never been this bad, but it&#39;s never been this good. It is actually now doubling down on all the problems that it&#39;s had. But let&#39;s also talk about the fact that the chiefs of information security and privacy and compliance have quit. it. Elon Musk has now asked all employees to come back to the office in an email. Later in the day, he&#39;s told all individuals who don&#39;t show up to the office that your resignation is tendered and accepted. He&#39;s also just casually inserted that the company might be on the brink of bankruptcy.</span>

            <span class="text">to keep up. Trump, Daniel Smith levels of activity that he&#39;s putting out there. What&#39;s the corporate advice today for Elon Musk? Last time, if I will, can I paraphrase yours just so I can remember? Was it something about direction and action, right? To not equate those two things. What would it be now for this guy alongside</span>

            <span class="text">still? Fucking still that. You mentioned the official badge and the retraction of the official badge yesterday. day. Within the last two hours, they&#39;ve reintroduced the official badge. Oh, it&#39;s back. Okay. After Elon Musk saying, I killed it, it was a bad idea. Less than 24 hours later, this thing is back, at least for now. We&#39;ll see if it&#39;s back when Elon Musk wakes up in the morning. It&#39;s impossible to say. Executives have been fleeing the company left, right, and center. They had something like six other high-profile resignations today, including their chief information security officer. Their lawyers are telling them they&#39;re no longer in compliance with an ftc um you</span>

The social media company was running a negative cash flow of several billion dollars, Mr. Musk added, without specifying if that was an annual figure. He mentioned bankruptcy.

You know, it just blows up in your face. And half the time, the insiders are saying, you know, we&#39;ve been railing for these types of changes and management wouldn&#39;t listen to us. And your job as a consultant is often just to listen to what the employees have been saying, shave off some rough edges, and make some recommendations. This guy walked in, knew all the answers. I mean, he&#39;s basically a walking advertisement for the Donning-Kruger effect. He thinks that because he knows everything about these subjects, he must know everything about Twitter. um about twitter and the problem is uh that he doesn&#39;t he he may be a brilliant engineer the jury&#39;s still out but he sure is not a brilliant marketer for social media</span>

After reading that statement from Donald Trump, I&#39;m going to say the answer is yes, because it is terrible. It is just random capitalizations of random things. I won&#39;t get into that. I want to actually talk about the midterms in this frame. And I want to see if you guys have any thoughts on this. Corey, I want to talk about the midterms, less about the results, because there&#39;s so much commentary about the results. What happened? Why did Oz lose? Why did Vance win? Is DeSantis actually special? Lots of hand-wringing. We&#39;ll talk about that. Talk</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Talk to me about how narratives congeal and form leading up to the midterms and whether we should be trusting those narratives or not. Because what I found most interesting was a couple of things happening. Number one, a lot of commentary that said the red wave was coming. A lot of commentary that said this is going to be disastrous for the Democrats, combined with that their current message on abortion and democracy is not working, that they should have been sticking to economy, that it&#39;s not going to motivate their base. It&#39;s not going to motivate the ring around their base, the folks that they need to show up. And then we&#39;re starting to learn that a lot of the late breaking polls that started to craft this red wave narrative were Republican sponsored. There were partisan polls in that sense. So talk to me about, in your mind, some of the things that our our listeners should understand around narratives forming, because despite the media being what it is, pretty powerful, the narrative that is kind of ultimately formed or was formed in this midterm election, and not necessarily bearing out in that sense.</span>

So when you craft a narrative, when the media is crafting this narrative, and let&#39;s be clear, I think that this is mostly a media narrative that is embraced by the Republicans and fought by the Democrats. That narrative is not wrong. So often, it&#39;s very It&#39;s very easy to see why someone would grab that narrative. The narrative makes sense on its face. Every time this happens, every time a president is where Biden is, people lose.</span>

And I think that Corey pointed that out in a couple of our podcasts along the way that starting in September, we started to see a return to the norm. And the question was, did Dobbs happen too early in the summer? And did people move away from that issue and towards the other issue of the economy? And let me answer the question. Yes, they did. They did both of those things. In areas like Florida, where they put abortion on the side, because they were able to pass a 15-week abortion ban, which most Americans feel is adequate. There&#39;s not a huge uproar about, you know, we need to get to 20 weeks or it&#39;s, you know, the end of the world. A 15-week abortion ban seemed acceptable to most Americans, certainly to most Floridians. That</span>

In the places where they showed the story, where they had real clear evidence that this person was an election denier and it was clear, or that abortion was literally on the ballot, they did much better. And the reason I think think they missed this, is an over-reliance on national polling. National poll takes 1,200 to 1,500 people and projects the outcome of the elections. For the most part, it works very well when it&#39;s a national style of an election. When it is a state</span>

But if you were to take the 2015 results and transpose over them, like say what would the results have been if you took the wild rose vote, the UCP vote, or sorry, the wild rose vote, the PC vote, the NDP vote, what you&#39;d see is that in 2015 during what we&#39;ll call that orange wave, the NDP got about 23% of the vote in that area.
