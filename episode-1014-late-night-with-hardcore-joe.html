          <p>The gang get together late in the night to talk Twitter (Corey's obsession), the US midterms (Carter's obsession) and Carter's most recent massage (Zain's obsession).</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss continued chaos at Twitter, the US midterm elections and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's by-election win in Brooks-Medicine Hat. What have we learned about the Alberta general election? Are the Democrats overdoing it when it comes to declaring victory in the midterms? And how hardcore can a boss be before they're too hardcore? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Let&#39;s start with Twitter Because, Corey, a lot of things have changed at Twitter. Elon Musk has introduced the new $8 blue verified check. He introduced the official badge. He took away the official badge. Now everyone can be, according to an incredible meme, BBC News Alert, because you just pay $8 and you just get to do whatever the fuck you want. But it has led to Twitter being, and I say this without exaggeration, fucking incredible. I have never seen Twitter be as amazing. It&#39;s never been this good. It&#39;s never been this</div>

But let&#39;s also talk about the fact that the chiefs of information security and privacy and compliance have quit. it. Elon Musk has now asked all employees to come back to the office in an email. Later in the day, he&#39;s told all individuals who don&#39;t show up to the office that your resignation is tendered and accepted. He&#39;s also just casually inserted that the company might be on the brink of bankruptcy.</div>

Less than 24 hours later, this thing is back, at least for now. We&#39;ll see if it&#39;s back when Elon Musk wakes up in the morning. It&#39;s impossible to say.

            <div class="said">the meeting on thursday mr Mr. Musk warned employees, by the way, this was his first meeting with Twitter staff. At the meeting on Thursday, Mr. Musk warned employees that Twitter did not have the necessary cash to survive, said seven people familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The social media company was running a negative cash flow of several billion dollars, Mr. Musk added, without specifying if that was an annual figure. He mentioned bankruptcy. Mr. Musk added that he had recently sold Tesla stock to, quote, save Twitter. He has sold nearly $4 billion in Tesla shares recently, according to regulatory filings this week. Yeah, fucking crazy.</div>

            <div class="said">Talk to me about how narratives congeal and form leading up to the midterms and whether we should be trusting those narratives or not. Because what I found most interesting was a couple of things happening. Number one, a lot of commentary that said the red wave was coming. A lot of commentary that said this is going to be disastrous for the Democrats, combined with that their current message on abortion and democracy is not working, that they should have been sticking to economy, that it&#39;s not going to motivate their base. It&#39;s not going to motivate the ring around their base, the folks that they need to show up. And then we&#39;re starting to learn that a lot of the late breaking polls that started to craft this red wave narrative were Republican sponsored. There were partisan polls in that sense. So talk to me about, in your mind, some of the things that our our listeners should understand around narratives forming, because despite the media being what it is, pretty powerful, the narrative that is kind of ultimately formed or was formed in this midterm election, and not necessarily bearing out in that sense.</div>

They did both of those things. In areas like Florida, where they put abortion on the side, because they were able to pass a 15-week abortion ban, which most Americans feel is adequate. There&#39;s not a huge uproar about, you know, we need to get to 20 weeks or it&#39;s, you know, the end of the world.

We talked about it through the lens of Beto O&#39;Rourke and Stacey Abrams, national figures trying to run and win viability regionally. I think this election, once again, kind of proved that America&#39;s, whether you say two countries or four countries, this is a regional, you know, we&#39;re entering this regionalization phase. Carter mentions here. What do you think the lesson is to learn on media narrative here, to learn on endgame narrative as we saw play out in these midterms?</div>
