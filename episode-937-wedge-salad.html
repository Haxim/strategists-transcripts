          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is uh this is what we do uh this is all we talk about we&#39;re skipping the fast food talk and we&#39;re going into our first segment our first segment flavor of the week yes it sounds like a fast food segment it is not we are not ranking fast food although we all know harvey&#39;s is right at the top carter i&#39;m going to do this segment every sunday uh i want to talk about what the flavor of the week was what was the week that that passed we&#39;re now at sunday sunday to sunday we can kind of compare a week uh we&#39;ll also then talk about a bit of polling and then we&#39;ll talk about one sort of a strategic item that I want to discuss each week that we do this recap segment. So let&#39;s start here. Let&#39;s get your guys&#39; takes very cleanly. Carter, define the last week for me. What was the flavor of it for you? And there&#39;s many narratives out there. I&#39;ll throw a few out if our listeners haven&#39;t heard them just yet. You know, one about the conservative surge, the O&#39;Toole platform strategy, Jagmeet Singh&#39;s palatability and promise, the liberals really hobbling and maybe questioning why they&#39;re doing this election. The fact that no one&#39;s paying attention, that&#39;s come up multiple times. But for you, Carter, as a strategist, what was the flavor of this week? What would you kind of capstone and define this week as from the terms and the experience that you bring to the table?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that every</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">every election is about the frontrunner. Every election is about who&#39;s in front and who&#39;s behind, if you will. And that&#39;s the narrative that the media love to take and um that means that this narrative was about the liberals being unable to answer the question uh why did you call the election um not only did they seem to be unable to answer the question why did you call the election they seem to be unaware that elections are a moment when you have to have new ideas and people pay attention to those new ideas you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know the rumors that were popping out of liberal land uh that justin trudeau was asking asking in writings, what&#39;s a really good big idea that we can talk about? That says to me, unbelievably, that the party that called the election seems to be the least prepared for the actual election.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, we&#39;ll talk about the quote-unquote big new thing that Stephen Carter is referring to. But Corey, flavor of the week, define the week that was for us from your strategist&#39;s perspective.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the Liberals, Carter&#39;s right. Right. Like every election really is about who&#39;s in the lead and the other</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">other parties pile on and they say this is why they shouldn&#39;t be in the lead. The party in the lead tries to maintain that lead. And he is entirely correct that they seem to have been caught flat footed by their own election, which to me is not a sign that should give a lot of liberals great comfort because it says either the liberals said, well, we got to go now because we think it&#39;s going to get worse. Or there was just this sense of inertia we&#39;ve talked about in the past. You</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You plan for an election and that makes an election more likely, even if it is just contingency planning. But here they are. And they seem to have come into week one, maybe not on autopilot, but they seem to have been surprised by the dynamics of their own election. And that&#39;s a bit surprising. But the liberals have done their best to serve us a wedge salad this week, right? We&#39;ve seen accusations of the conservatives really being dangerous on vaccine mandates, on abortion, on guns. And now today, we&#39;re also seeing private health care. And Andrew Coyne on Twitter, I think, kind of nailed it. Like, they&#39;ve hit a lot of panic buttons for such an early time in the campaign. And maybe their intention was almost the inverse of how we said Aaron O&#39;Toole needs to define himself early. A lot of Canadians don&#39;t know him. This is the chance they&#39;re going to be looking. And maybe the Liberals said, this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is our chance to really put the nail in the coffin for Aaron O&#39;Toole and define him and put all of these things out there. But it&#39;s coming across, at least to me, and I suspect I&#39;m not alone, and certainly we&#39;re seeing from the polls, preliminary though they may be, that it&#39;s not really working. But it seems to me that it&#39;s not landing,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">landing, right? And people are reacting to it in kind of a cynical sense. Here the liberals go again with all of these things, because it doesn&#39;t necessarily come across as something that they&#39;re deeply concerned about. It comes across as something they&#39;ve been waiting to throw out there and torque as much as they possibly can. So the liberals have to be careful about that. I would say this wedge salad has not been particularly appetizing main course, as we&#39;re seeing in the tracking polls. Hey,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Hey, Carter, let&#39;s talk about polling for a second, because as it relates to the polls, what do you feel like your thought is based on all the poll tightening that you&#39;ve seen? You&#39;ve seen Graves, you&#39;ve seen Nanos, I believe also Abacus, all telling a similar story, that O&#39;Toole&#39;s done a good job in the first seven days closing the gap or at least making it much tighter. Do you buy what&#39;s being sold on the daily tracking, and how much of it do you buy in terms of what&#39;s being sold in the daily tracking?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m super nervous about daily tracking. I&#39;m super nervous about polling in general. And I&#39;m really nervous about polling when there&#39;s a low attention span. So there&#39;s a non-response bias to polls. And pollsters will tell you that the non-response bias is something that just gets, that statistically doesn&#39;t matter because you wind up getting the responses and the responses are just statistically valid. And I think that there&#39;s some truth to that. But I also think that when there are periods of, you know, real moments when people aren&#39;t paying attention, that non-response bias matters more. That, you know, the fact that certain people aren&#39;t responding to polls that normally would have responded to polls. This is a period of time when no one&#39;s moving. Nothing is happening. And yet, at the same time, we&#39;re seeing significant shifting in the polls. And that makes me very wary of the numbers that are coming out. I think it is more likely that the people responding to the polls are different. The non-response group is larger in some fashion than the response group. And so everything is changing. And that is probably what&#39;s causing this more than a fundamental shift in the electorate. um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so i i if i were if i were a tool i&#39;d be minimizing this impact i&#39;d be saying this isn&#39;t real yet we will wait and see what things look like in the second week of september uh because that&#39;s when things will start to get real um because i&#39;m not sure that this this bump isn&#39;t a polling and not a polling error more than it is an actual shift in the um in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in the polling in in the fundamental who wants to vote for whom uh tracking that we would normally see</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, daily tracking, I&#39;ve got a bunch of sort of follow-up questions, but I want your initial insight. What do you make of pole tightening from the multitude of pollsters that we&#39;re seeing across the country?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, we have two tracking poles that have shown a pole tightening, ECOS and NANOS.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And I think that when you have two, that should give you a reason to raise your eyebrows a bit. Both, I believe, use the same methodology. It&#39;s a telephone methodology, and so if there is a bias inherent in that methodology, that&#39;s going to show up. although in the past couple of elections phones haven&#39;t done too too badly and it really depends on the online panel and how how well it&#39;s being curated but I don&#39;t entirely agree with Stephen Carter about the non-response bias comments he said statistically that pollsters will say it doesn&#39;t matter that much I don&#39;t think they would I&#39;m not entirely sure that&#39;s what they would say at least what they do is they try to correct for a non-response bias in general they they weight things right so it&#39;s harder to get a hold of 18 to 30 year olds by phone phone so the few that you do get a hold of their opinions matter an awful lot more as it goes forward the other thing with tracking polls is they&#39;re often multiple days and if there is one really wild day it&#39;s going to take a few days for it to get out of the system and it can create a sense of momentum that&#39;s entirely false for those days as uh as it continues to be there so you&#39;ve got to watch out for that as well good</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">good pollsters will also really try to get a hold of people multiple times to call the same phone number 10 times on their list or or what have you in order order to try to deal with that non-response bias on a more foundational level. But it is too soon to say. Obviously, the polling that we have, limited though it is, is telling a consistent story. You can talk about those tracking polls, which we have, which shows either a tightening race or in the case of ECOS, I believe, the Conservatives getting ahead of the Liberals</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for the first time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Although keep in mind, last election, the Conservatives got more popular vote and still lost the seat count. So that&#39;s not everything. We also have the fact that the The NDP has said they won&#39;t prop up the Conservatives, so the Conservatives may need a majority to get any government.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the other polling, though, is even though it&#39;s coming out in dribs and drabs, it&#39;s telling a similar story. Ipsos and Global are sort of teasing out their polling that shows Canadians don&#39;t trust Justin Trudeau very much. That&#39;s pretty consistent with the idea that things aren&#39;t landing. We&#39;ve seen other polling that shows that Justin Trudeau has taken a few dents in his approval rating overall, a few dents in his most popular PM. PM, similarly, we&#39;ve seen best choice for PM Aaron O&#39;Toole go up on some of these things. It&#39;s all telling a story that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that you can kind of hand wave away if you&#39;re inclined to hand wave it away. But on net, the polling seems to say at the very least, the Liberals are not hurting the Conservatives. The Liberals, at best, are where they were last week, which is not too, too bad for them because they&#39;re leading. But it&#39;s not a good week of polling for the Liberals. Carter,</span>

Carter brought up a very interesting conversation on what O&#39;Toole should do. Okay, week one, O&#39;Toole. He narrows the gap and or is ahead. Carter says, if you&#39;re in team O&#39;Toole, you don&#39;t want to acknowledge that this is real. You&#39;re probably happy with the situation. One would assume you would be, that people said you could get nothing done and you had a pretty good week. What are you kind of strategically doing in team O&#39;Toole right now, Corey? Are you acknowledging that this is real? Are you only acknowledging it to a sliver of of your audience, i.e. your donor base, and trying to churn more money out? What are you kind of doing mechanically with polling numbers that say you&#39;re either a point or a half a point ahead, or that you&#39;ve closed the gap and that the viability threshold is starting to at least meet expectations for you as it historically has in previous elections?

They&#39;re going to tell you that Justin Trudeau has got this in the bag. We can see right now through the polls, through our internal polls, and through these public polls, we are in the game. So that donor message goes out right away, and we try and make some money off of this. The second thing is that we go to the individual campaigns. So there&#39;s high-performing campaigns, there&#39;s low-performing campaigns, and then there&#39;s campaigns right in the middle.

That&#39;s one of the reasons I said at the beginning of this, I wouldn&#39;t be making a big deal out of this if I was Aaron O&#39;Toole. Because the bigger deal you make of it, the more it becomes a problem when voters start to switch, when they start to care a little bit more. And they suddenly start to, you know, in Calgary Skyview or Edmonton Millwoods or Edmonton Center, shift to whoever they think the winner will be to stop the conservative candidate or the other candidate. There is a huge group of anybody but voters that will shift around and try and find their feet, either for the NDP or the conservatives or the liberals. liberals, and those</span>

And in this case, I want to talk about a strategic item regarding campaign planning. There&#39;s been so much talk about this election regarding two weeks in August, you know, you got Labor Day, you got kids going back to school, early voting mail-in deadline and a september 20th election is there even time for anything so cory maybe i&#39;ll start with you give me your general sort of outline in terms of how you&#39;re planning this election is this like any other 36 day or for you or are there some weird curveballs that you&#39;re accommodating for and maybe we&#39;ll kind of use it a few points mainly around opposition research and when you want it to land and announcement of big key policy points and crescendos on this campaign. Where do you see both of those optimized with at least what I think is a weird cadence this cycle? You may disagree, but curious to hear from you based on all the defining and perhaps unpredictable factors of this 36-day race. How are you planning for it if you&#39;re team agnostic planning this election?</span>

In fact, one of the challenges is there&#39;s so many variables that are not like normal that it it becomes difficult to isolate and say, this is how I&#39;m going to act if all other things were held equal because of this thing, like because it&#39;s an August election, because it&#39;s a COVID election, because there are no tools, a relatively unknown commodity, you name it. And you&#39;ve got a bunch of things that would force you to act perhaps in a different fashion. And every campaign is going to have the theory of the campaign, how it&#39;s going to play out. It is a reasonable theory of campaign to say, nobody&#39;s going to pay attention until Labor Day, so don&#39;t waste your time. It is a reasonable theory of campaign to say, actually,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, let me just throw a counter theory out here. And I&#39;ll preface this all by saying the parties will ideally have polling on who&#39;s paying attention now, who&#39;s planning to vote early. And that will drive a lot of their decisions around the messaging they&#39;re putting out now, if there&#39;s something distinctive</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">distinctive about either of those groups, right? If it&#39;s a high information voter, maybe that does speak to an early platform launch. If planning to vote early, just to sort of drift into my theory here, is</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is because they&#39;re worried about COVID-19, well, that tells you something about how you&#39;ve got to talk to the voters who are going to be the first up, the first voting, right? So if you&#39;re voting first because you&#39;re most nervous about COVID, that suggests to me that liberal and NDP voters are the most likely to vote early, not conservative voters. That&#39;s what I would say right off the bat. And if that&#39;s the case, then it could very well be that that sprint at the end favors the conservatives, not the liberals or New Democrats in that case. Because if 27% or so, almost a third of ballots are cast by mail by people who are worried about COVID, COVID is a top issue of theirs, then that end conversation will look very different than if it were a situation where people are feeling like they&#39;re voting early because they&#39;re older, which is historically how we&#39;ve tended to think about mail-in ballots.

It is here. If you&#39;re new to this segment, it is very easy. Here&#39;s what I do. I give Corey and Stephen an item. It could be a news item, a policy announcement, something that happened this week. And in a case, if it&#39;s applicable, I&#39;ll give them which party that they should view that story through. And they will tell me whether it&#39;s fine, whether it&#39;s fabulous, a solid strategic move, or it&#39;s fucked. And the one final thing to remember is that we&#39;re mostly going to be looking at these through the strategy lens, which is what we do on this show. So let&#39;s just get right into it.

We&#39;re assuming it&#39;s a policy announcement. We&#39;re not guaranteed it&#39;s as such. As you know, we&#39;ve talked about the dead cat on the table many times. So it could very much be in that particular strategy realm. But Stephen Carter, for the liberals to be searching for a big new thing, is it fine? It&#39;s totally acceptable. Is it fabulous that they&#39;re telegraphing that they want this thing and it&#39;s being linked to the media? Or is this fucked?

But I was involved in a similar problem in 2012 with the Progressive Conservative Party here in Alberta, where we didn&#39;t have the big idea. And people, you know, we were lurching around trying to find it for the first couple of weeks of our campaign. And it is super duper hard if you don&#39;t have that. And I do think that this verges, this is fine for now, but it very well could lurch towards fucked, depending on how the liberals respond to it and what their next week looks like. Because if they&#39;re still, you know, reaching around in the dark, trying to find a reason for calling this election or, you know, making the election question something that favors them, then they very easily could lurch towards fucked.</span>

So if that if a lot of ifs here, right, if that story is true, the liberals have a problem organizationally. If that process story seeps into the opinion class, the liberals have a problem there. And again, this was all an own goal. If that senior liberal source had just kept their mouth shut, what does that story look like? It&#39;s just one person&#39;s opinions about what the election is.

The reason why I wouldn&#39;t say it is fabulous, fabulous, is because you&#39;re not in your box, right? You were talking about a liberal issue. And while it might be a good shield, and it might be a good way to remind people that there is a conservative climate plan, and it&#39;s strong enough that at least some people within his party object to it, it&#39;s not an issue that&#39;s going to win you the election at the end of the day.

You know, there is a couple of points that I look at Aaron O&#39;Toole and think he&#39;s really in trouble on. One of them is climate. The other one is China. You know, they&#39;ve taken positions that are difficult to understand, difficult to explain, and ultimately could paint them into a really negative position should they form the government because their climate plan just simply isn&#39;t enough to deal with the climate emergency that we&#39;re looking at right now.</span>

I think he&#39;s far more susceptible on privatized health care. I think he&#39;s far more endangered by climate change. Those types of issues, you know, Corey&#39;s point, choose one or two. You can get abortion under health care if you need to. You can get abortion, you know, but you can focus on a couple or three issues. You know, I&#39;ve expanded it from Corey&#39;s one or two.

I think we mentioned as late as last episode, I believe, Corey, you&#39;d mentioned some derivative of that regarding O&#39;Toole, that he&#39;s not doing that based on what you&#39;re seeing, that he&#39;s not just going back to the well of old-time conservative strategies. How do you decipher, based on what we&#39;re seeing with Trudeau here, between tried to true tested wedges and what you guys have mentioned as a cautionary tale of fighting the last battle? And maybe I&#39;m taking us down a little bit of an abstract path for a second, but I would love to kind of discuss that, because this abortion conversation can be viewed as either of the two, that it&#39;s been, it&#39;s three elections old, and what the fuck are we doing still here? Or it&#39;s tried, tested, and true, and these guys haven&#39;t adopted their stance, i.e. the conservatives, and it&#39;s still a solid wedge to go on. Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. How do you view it between the distinction of, are we running the old race, or is this just what you got to do and you do it often and early as much as you can because these guys fucking fall for it every time yeah</span>

But regardless, health care is something that keeps us up at night, quite literally. We worry about our loved ones.

            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s move it on to our next one. This one also on Jagmeet Singh. He says that his NDP will crack down on rent evictions, effectively financializations against big landlords from jacking up rents, in addition to providing 5k in rent help, which can go towards rent for those who have less who spend more than 30% of their income on rent. That money can go towards rent or other related costs for individuals in precarious situations. Corey, for you, as a suite of policies on housing for Jagmeet Singh, according to the rental vote, fine, fabulous, or fucked from what you see?</span>

I will say, when I first saw this policy yesterday, bereft of the details, like if you have to be paying more than 30% of your salary towards renting, I was horrified.</span>

I thought it was just a horrible policy that was going to do nothing but make landlords&#39; lives better because then they would have an excuse to raise rents on people. Knowing it&#39;s means-tested helps because there are ways you can provide rental supports. I still think it&#39;s a fairly crass policy. I still think it&#39;s not a good policy because ultimately what it is, is it&#39;s paying people more money to deal with. Okay. Let&#39;s put it this way. If the NDP&#39;s hypothesis is landlords are acting in a way that&#39;s not market force driven, but it&#39;s just kind of shady,</span>

That&#39;s just rewarding the people who are acting badly. And if it is not about that, And if you don&#39;t believe that, if you believe that actually this is just market forces at play and they&#39;re driving people out of the market, then</span>

And you don&#39;t do that by creating all of these penalties on people who are building buildings, because as much as you can say they&#39;re building these elite, fancy rental units. Well, you know who fills those people who are in lower quality rental units before, which creates spaces around there.

And if you are going to break the market&#39;s ability to provide supply, you are going to regret that. It&#39;s already pretty difficult to build rental units in areas like Vancouver with all sorts of nimbyism in these lower density communities becoming higher. You</span>

If you want to deal with poverty, then you should develop a poverty strategy, not a housing strategy. And the second is affordable housing, which, again, Corey and I are both on the same side of this issue. We both think that there should be more affordable housing. This does not create more affordable housing. And the fact that you&#39;ve got another policy on another page of your policy book that says, don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re going to create affordable housing, just create the affordable housing. Don&#39;t fuck up everything else. And this makes things worse, not better, times two, or, you know, squared. I think that if you want to deal with poverty, you should deal with poverty. If you want to deal with affordable housing, you should deal with affordable housing. This messes with both sides of it, and it doesn&#39;t make things better, except for potentially the people who get $5,000 checks, which, to</span>

This is what you get with the Liberals. It&#39;s not driven by a desire to make Canada better. It&#39;s a desire to make their caucus bigger. And we can&#39;t have that. We need politics to be driven by more than that. It needs to be driven by principles. principles and in in some ways my big advice to him would be don&#39;t don&#39;t overdo it in this first bit you don&#39;t want to seem scary to people the liberals benefit when it&#39;s uh when it&#39;s a big clash of civilizations election so keep the lens as much as possible on justin trudeau throw things back to justin trudeau talk about how he&#39;s doing these things because he&#39;s worried about the support he&#39;s bleeding to the ndp liberal seats are going to flip to ndp this is what&#39;s causing justin trudeau to stay up at night and see if you can&#39;t get that gap between the liberals and the the NDP a little bit closer, make it a little bit harder for the liberals to make their traditional call for NDP voters that&#39;s going to come later in the election here.

I might credit the wrong news outlet, but who cares? Ford and Trudeau have a moratorium of sorts. We&#39;re not a journalistic podcast, Corey. They have a moratorium, apparently, that they&#39;re going to have a non-aggression pact against each other, which is different than the story of 2019 when of course Trudeau was also creating a wedge salad and using Ford as one of those wedges against Scheer what do you think of this a moratorium where they won&#39;t attack each other during the next what 30 some odd days overrated underrated in your mind Corey for</span>

Neither the deal nor the fight. So I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s a particularly savvy move by the liberals per se. Maybe they&#39;re just trying to keep the number of fronts down, but why?

And then people say, well, why not us? And why not us? And the more details you have, the more questions you&#39;ll have. But if you don&#39;t provide the details, it just seems like a total ignorance of economics. They could have done without this $5,000 renter thing. That said, when you look at the polls, he seems to be, you know, in a couple of the tracking, he&#39;s dipped a bit. But if you step back, he&#39;s doing okay.
