            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">This is The Strategist, episode 530 from sunny Las Vegas. This is Zain Velji, alongside Stephen Carter in Ottawa, Corey Hogan in Calgary. Guys, how are you doing? I&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m good. You guys missed all the fun. You missed all of the fun of the election.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">We left so that we wouldn&#39;t have bad mojo. There</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">There is absolutely no fun to be had. Guys, there&#39;s so much to talk about. What was once impossible about a month ago, improbable two weeks ago, and is now reality. The San Antonio Spurs are out of the NBA playoffs. I want to talk about that for the next 90 minutes, but instead there&#39;s something called this Alberta election. So, before we get into it, because I know you guys are going to be chomping at the bit, I was doing some scrutineer training last weekend, and it struck me that, as a general, people don&#39;t have a good understanding of what Election Day really is, what the parts in motion are, what the back and forth is, what all that data is about. So before we get into it, since you guys were both in on the back end in 2012, lay it on me, lay it on our listeners. What exactly happens on Election Day? Corey, first you and then Carter.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, Election Day is the culmination of all of the work that we&#39;ve done previous, right? It&#39;s all about taking that 27 days of identified vote and then ensuring that they get out and vote. You know, nowadays we throw in a couple of social media plays and whatnot, you know, go vote, you know, Twibbins and all of that stuff. But for the most part, it&#39;s the same as it&#39;s been for years, just with new databases and new ways to organize it, which is you&#39;ve got a list of people, they told you they&#39;re going to vote for you, now get their asses to the polls.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, and I think that it&#39;s interesting now because I think this election, this provincial election, actually mirrored the 2010 Nancy election a lot, where the NDP didn&#39;t have the world&#39;s strongest GOTV campaign, and they were still able to win just by the simple size of the wave that they were able to generate during the campaign. campaign uh so the the campaign period itself generated its own momentum that was uh that overshadowed uh the traditional gotv uh that would be required to win especially those close races i think it was what uh two races in calgary uh or in the southern alberta region that were won by less than 20 votes and one that was absolute tie which</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">which is like unheard of absolutely</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">absolutely you know carter that&#39;s a great segue to talk about what we really want to chat about the ndp yesterday with the the majority, 53 seats, 41 percent of the vote. This was an absolute orange wave, literally in Edmonton, but elsewhere in the province. They made gains like they have never seen before. Guys, what happened? I mean, what exactly did we see yesterday? Historic by all accounts, but Carter, what was that?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It was anger. It was absolutely an angry wave of people who decided that they didn&#39;t want to elect the same government that they&#39;ve been electing. I think I proposed it in the last podcast that we were looking at uh 10 different or 10 years of people not wanting to vote for the progressive conservatives and that finally came to a head uh yesterday and and that was something that&#39;s that&#39;s unusual in politics uh alberta i think might be the only test cases of a place where we literally will build up anger for a decade before we will act</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what do you make?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, 41% of the vote for the PCs, 28% or the other way around, 41% for the NDP. See,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">See, you&#39;re used to saying it only one way, are</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">are you not? Yeah, it was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was not at all shocking. Let&#39;s just put it right there. It was not shocking. Anybody who says it&#39;s shocking was paying no attention for the last month because the polls steadily climbed from day one to the NDP all the way to day 28. and the polls at the last moment showed pretty much exactly what we got and to me so to me what i find more interesting i think than the dramatic outcome and i do find it really interesting is that everyone is shocked by it well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i think that people were expecting 2012</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">again right so 2012 all the polls tell us it&#39;s going to be one way it&#39;s going to be the wild rose majority and then most people will wake up on Tuesday morning after the election and go, what? We didn&#39;t get that wild rose majority? Because they didn&#39;t see what was actually happening in the election campaign, which was a shift back. And that shift back never occurred in this election. The polls, the conclusion I think we have to reach is that the polls weren&#39;t wrong in 2012. We shifted the vote. The vote never shifted back in 2015. It was fun to watch.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so let&#39;s talk about that a bit more, because I think you guys hit on a very important point. You know, on this podcast, Carter, last episode, the last question I asked you is what happens on election day, and you said a PC minority. Now, I was also on social media flailing back and forth between a PC minority and an NDP minority, disingenuously hedging my bets, as</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">as I always do. But, you know, one of the factors, and I think there&#39;s a couple, but one of the factors that we gave the PCs a little bit of credit for was their ground game. Now, let&#39;s talk about that, because the PCs, although only securing 10 seats, got 28% of the vote ahead of the official opposition, Wild Rose Party. So they did get votes. And, Corey, you&#39;ve mentioned this before, that voter efficiency is only efficient until it isn&#39;t. But we did give some credit to the ground game. why did that not materialize anything beyond the 10 states well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i&#39;ll tell you why because ground game i&#39;m going to give you an extreme example imagine an election where two people turn out out of a million it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">pretty important to identify those two people and get them out now imagine an election where a million people turn out out of a million your ground game&#39;s not going to make a lick of difference right the more people who show up the less important a ground game is and we had turnout of about 60 you start to get to it was great yeah you start to get to to a point where ground game does</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">does not matter that much. In a place like PEI, where they got 84% in Saskatchewan, where they regularly get 70s, 80s,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">ground game&#39;s not the same thing there. It&#39;s not a big deal because if everybody votes, ground game doesn&#39;t matter. And that&#39;s what happened. People were mad and they showed up. And as a result, that edge</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">edge that the PCs had, that vaunted ground game edge, didn&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">didn&#39;t matter at all.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, we might identify 6,000 voters or 10,000 voters is in writing in a really well-organized ground game offensive. Ten would be amazing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Of those 10,000 people, first of all, you&#39;re only going to reach about 4,000 to 6,000 on election day. So just let&#39;s call it half. And then of those people you reach, most of them are going to go vote anyways, because they&#39;ve already told you who they&#39;re going to vote for. So that increasing, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it doesn&#39;t make a huge difference unless it&#39;s close. And it wasn&#39;t close. blokes. The orange wave, the 41% of voters who voted for the NDP just eclipsed the other parties in most ridings. And they did it everywhere, which I think was just absolutely amazing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">So both of you guys were on CBC last night. Corey, you were on the panel to do analysis. Carter, you were sitting in Andrew Coyne&#39;s chair up in Ottawa. The poor man&#39;s version of Andrew coin for last night. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s right. I was on the sub network. Andrew was on the main network and it gave us a really good idea of who was good and who was me.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">I think we&#39;ve had that idea for a very long time. So let&#39;s chat a little bit more about what last night was like for you guys. At what point, Corey, did you know?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">point did you know last night? You were sitting on that analysis panel. Rob Brown came to you with only a few writings in, the PCs were up yet you were still optimistic, what did you know and at what point could you make the call in your head?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I went into there you know and the war rooms are doing the exact same thing, I just had a poor man&#39;s version I went into there with two lists, one was eight writings to watch and I assumed if they&#39;d won four of those eight writings then it was going to be an NDP majority and the other was a power ranking that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that actually our friend Brendan Wade put together other and i modified a bit but it was this idea that from</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">from 1 to 87 what&#39;s the most likely ndp pickup to what&#39;s the least and when those first results were in there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there was you know minor drama in the studio as everyone&#39;s like oh wow ndp three seats to the pcs 10 on very few polls but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but what was interesting was of the three that were there for the ndp two were in rural alberta and they had no</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">no business being in the running so when you looked at it you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you could kind kind of tell right from the first results it was going to be an interesting night and i think that you know that ticker tape that banner was misleading and i think people got misled but we didn&#39;t have to wait long before that thing turned and and i never i can honestly say never thought the ndp were in trouble yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i was the same way in fact there were three writings that reported right away um and they were all mobile polls so mobile polls for those people who really really don&#39;t hang out on the Elections Alberta website and check out the actual results as they&#39;re coming in. Mobile polls are polls that literally go to a senior&#39;s home, like a facility housing a number of seniors and collect the votes from the seniors that are in that home so they don&#39;t have to travel to a polling station. And what struck me is that the PCs were winning the polls to be sure, but they were not winning by the margins that they should have been winning by. And I think that right off the bat, I thought there was going to be an NDP government. And it just, after I think 15 minutes, there was absolutely no question. And, you know, I was funny. I was sitting beside the decision desk at CBC. And they were trying to figure out when to call an NDP majority. And I&#39;m like, just call it already. It&#39;s done.</span>

And let&#39;s actually, you know, on some of them, dig a little bit deeper. So both of you guys said that the Alberta party would win a seat yesterday, and both of you were correct. Now, Carter, I won&#39;t mention that you had changed your vote, but that doesn&#39;t matter because we&#39;ve all changed our minds every once in a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s true. We&#39;ve got no point scoring system here. Let&#39;s talk about this a little bit more because I think that&#39;s what&#39;s the interesting part. Greg Clark wins a seat in Calgary Elbow against then or I guess former education minister Gordon Dirks, who I think ran the microcosm campaign of the PC campaign at large in that it was very poorly run. A lot of mistakes all over the place, but credit to Greg and his campaign team full of excellent people. Guys, what does this mean for the Alberta party going forward?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well yeah i don&#39;t know i mean it would have meant a lot if it was still a pc government but now we have an ndp government the pcs are in real trouble if i was if i was greg clark today and this is not what i would have recommended to greg clark six months ago and in fact i i recommended the opposite i think six months ago to greg clark i i told him at the time it&#39;s the center left that&#39;s your play</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, that&#39;s absolutely right. But the problem that they have is no one&#39;s looking over to their corner. You know, you&#39;ve got the big NDP on one side and you&#39;ve got got the falling destruction that is the PCs. The Wild Rose has done, I think, exceptionally well, given that their leader&#39;s been there for, what did I hear today, 35 days, 37 days or something like that. They&#39;re going</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to have to find a way to get oxygen. That means that Greg&#39;s going to have to be really efficient and be really good in order to get that oxygen. I think he&#39;s got that capacity. Again, they still struggle. Is the Alberta party going to be a political party? a la the NDP, because that&#39;s what the NDP is, a political party, or are they going to be this quasi-movement that always says we do politics differently, which I equate to we don&#39;t do politics at all.</span>

            <span class="text">Yes, you guys both agree. Okay. So you guys both said that the Achilles heel of the NDP will actually, Corey, you said it was going to be their ground game. And Carter, you said it was going to be the baggage that there were socialist hordes. Now, I don&#39;t know where to score this one, so I&#39;m going to both punch you in the gut because neither necessarily seem to be right. But let&#39;s talk a little bit about that baggage because not all of that is clear yet. There&#39;s many, many steps to go. So let&#39;s chat a little bit more about what that could mean in terms of policy. Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, let me start off and say that I am, in fact, right, because the socialist horde argument came out today. Sadly, no one is getting elected right now, but you can see ... I mean, this gives you just a sense of how ineffective the PC war room was. Today out come all the pictures of all the Facebook captures of the candidates that are winning in Calgary Bow or Calgary-</span>

And I&#39;m not allowing you to give me a punch in the gut because exactly what I said was going to happen, happened a day too late, which is staggering.</span>

But I actually want to talk about that a little bit more because, Carter, you mentioned the information that came out today about a candidate in Calgary, Beau, that&#39;s going to be the new representative of many people in Calgary. What happened to that war room? Corey, you just asked that question, but what is that a sign of in</span>

They&#39;re a bigger deal now because they&#39;re actually elected. That&#39;s part of it. That&#39;s part of it.

            <span class="text">I mean, utterly ridiculous that the PC war room was unable or unwilling to find things that would actually work against the NDP. You know, one of the things I said today is they pulled out their only way of attacking the NDP was to point out all the other NDP governments that have failed in every other province. So they said, look at the NDPs in British Columbia destroying the economy. They destroyed the economy in Saskatchewan. They destroyed the economy in Manitoba.

Now, Corey, when I asked you how many seats the NDP needed in Calgary to claim victory, you said seven. And for context, they did win 14 as far as my last count goes. Now, there is one up in the air in Calgary Glenmore, which is a tie on the nose. And Carter, you said they needed two. Now, you</span>

            <span class="text">you abused the rules last time, So I&#39;m going to give you a punch in the gut this time. But, Corey, you know, seven was would definitely have done the trick. Tell me a little bit more about the wave that came through Calgary, because, man, oh, man, was that I&#39;m going to say unexpected. Corey, you&#39;re going to abuse me for that, but I&#39;m going to say it. I think most people did not expect</span>

And number two, and this is one we haven&#39;t talked about, so maybe we want to chat about this, there were people on this list of PC candidates at loss that were, like, not elder statesmen, but stables of the PC party.

            <span class="text">two other items i want to discuss around this in terms of guys&#39;s predictions now both of you guys had predicted a score score of seven or eight on the legit meter, if you remember that, for the IVR phone polling system. I want to talk about polling a little bit more because, Corey, you were an absolute believer about polling. And you were standing right there, side by side, making every prediction in this election for the last couple of weeks with the polls. The rest of us weren&#39;t so convinced. And effectively, the polls turned out to be right. All 20 of them that signaled the same thing. That&#39;s a healthy dose of skepticism from the rest of Alberta. Let&#39;s talk about the IVR phone polling system and polling at large. Is it back? Is it now credible? What space does it sit in right now as it relates to political campaigning?</span>

            <span class="text">So it&#39;s gotten a lot better. What they&#39;ve understood between 2012 and now is that you can&#39;t just call everybody and assume that&#39;s a sample. They do weighting on IVR that&#39;s a lot more sophisticated than it was in 2012. And when I was talking to a pollster friend of mine who had writing by writing numbers, what they told me today is they They were really</span>

            <span class="text">really excited, not just about the overall number tracking so closely to what they were saying, but on a riding-by-riding level, they were right the vast majority of the time. I think that IVR is back, at least for now, but I think in the long term, IVR is fundamentally a doomed polling method.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know. I mean, I still get very skeptical of polls because polls are measuring yesterday. It&#39;s not necessarily that I object to the polls. It&#39;s how we use the polls. Everybody says if an election were held today and then they project forward 10 weeks or Ten days, five days, three days, two days. And in politics, on these types of elections, things change in 72 hours. And polls,</span>

You know, there is a delay between putting out an action and actually having it resonate with the public. is a poll not two days before the election not the most valid thing you can you know put your hat on in terms of betting when it gets to what the final result is going to be i</span>

And they don&#39;t like it when we behave like entitled brats. And he was starting to behave like an entitled brat. And when he brought over Danielle Smith, there were two things about bringing over Danielle Smith and the rest of the Wild Rose. Number one, it just fundamentally undermined democracy. And number two, he screwed her. He screwed her and he screwed the entire Wild Rose caucus that came over. They were made, promises were made to those folks and promises were broken. And I think that Albertan said, you know what, maybe we can&#39;t trust this guy if he&#39;s going to screw over the very people that he&#39;s bringing over to help. Do</span>

I remember some polling came out around the time that the crossers went over to the PCs, and it seemed like all of the credit was going to Prentice and all of the blame was going to Smith. And at that moment in time, even when she lost her seat and a couple other crossers lost their seat, it seemed like he was doing fine. I&#39;m not challenging you on that, but I think it&#39;s interesting that it went so quickly and so rapidly, this demise. Well,</span>

You know, Jim Prentice got a little bit too smart for half. And at the same time, there was tons of mistakes here on the PC side. But when you look at the the ndp campaign the word that&#39;s being described quite a bit is that they ran a flawless campaign and cory you were just mentioning right now that if it wasn&#39;t rachel notley it would could have been brian gene that captured these votes and took home the big prize number one i guess it&#39;s two-part question did the ndp run a flawless campaign and number two why was it rachel notley</span>

They&#39;re going to need to talk about what&#39;s going to activate that, what they&#39;re hoping to get out of that, who&#39;s going to be on that panel. I think those details, they&#39;re going to have to settle by the fall. I do.</span>

            <span class="text">Lots to talk about at the NDP, but we&#39;ll leave it there for now. We&#39;ll discuss it on future episodes. That was the birthday party. Let&#39;s talk about the reincarnation of the Wild Rose Party. Now, you guys mentioned this earlier. They got no seats in any of the major urban centers, but, man, did they do quite well. They picked up seats from where they stood even in 2012.</span>

            <span class="text">What do you make of Brian Jean&#39;s, what I&#39;m going to call a contextual victory, as leader of the opposition yesterday? And how do you see this dynamic playing both in the legislature but also from a campaign perspective? What is your analysis of the wild rose?</span>

            <span class="text">His performance in the leaders&#39; debate was horrendous. And then you contrast that with his speech last night, his victory, or his, you know, I&#39;m going to be the official opposition speech. His speech last night, who is that guy? People would love that guy. If that guy had shown up in the debates, I think things would have gone much differently for them. So on the one hand, it&#39;s got to be a victory. You increase your seat total. You have a leader that&#39;s been in there for uh less than 50 days um very impressive on the other it is a bit of a missed opportunity if if they&#39;d been able to uh uh</span>

I don&#39;t really like their policies, but that kind of flinty, we&#39;re going to do it ourselves, roll up our sleeves, hey, check out this terrible backdrop and this terrible podium that looks like my kid made it. There&#39;s something so damn endearing about that and so on brand with this small government, no taxes thing they&#39;ve got going on.
