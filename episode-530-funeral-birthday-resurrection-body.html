          <div class="said">There is absolutely no fun to be had. Guys, there&#39;s so much to talk about. What was once impossible about a month ago, improbable two weeks ago, and is now reality. The San Antonio Spurs are out of the NBA playoffs. I want to talk about that for the next 90 minutes, but instead there&#39;s something called this Alberta election. So, before we get into it, because I know you guys are going to be chomping at the bit, I was doing some scrutineer training last weekend, and it struck me that, as a general, people don&#39;t have a good understanding of what Election Day really is, what the parts in motion are, what the back and forth is, what all that data is about. So before we get into it, since you guys were both in on the back end in 2012, lay it on me, lay it on our listeners. What exactly happens on Election Day? Corey, first you and then Carter.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, Election Day is the culmination of all of the work that we&#39;ve done previous, right? It&#39;s all about taking that 27 days of identified vote and then ensuring that they get out and vote. You know, nowadays we throw in a couple of social media plays and whatnot, you know, go vote, you know, Twibbins and all of that stuff. But for the most part, it&#39;s the same as it&#39;s been for years, just with new databases and new ways to organize it, which is you&#39;ve got a list of people, they told you they&#39;re going to vote for you, now get their asses to the polls.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, and I think that it&#39;s interesting now because I think this election, this provincial election, actually mirrored the 2010 Nancy election a lot, where the NDP didn&#39;t have the world&#39;s strongest GOTV campaign, and they were still able to win just by the simple size of the wave that they were able to generate during the campaign. campaign uh so the the campaign period itself generated its own momentum that was uh that overshadowed uh the traditional gotv uh that would be required to win especially those close races i think it was what uh two races in calgary uh or in the southern alberta region that were won by less than 20 votes and one that was absolute tie which</div>

          <div class="said">absolutely you know carter that&#39;s a great segue to talk about what we really want to chat about the ndp yesterday with the the majority, 53 seats, 41 percent of the vote. This was an absolute orange wave, literally in Edmonton, but elsewhere in the province. They made gains like they have never seen before. Guys, what happened? I mean, what exactly did we see yesterday? Historic by all accounts, but Carter, what was that?</div>

          <div class="said">It was anger. It was absolutely an angry wave of people who decided that they didn&#39;t want to elect the same government that they&#39;ve been electing. I think I proposed it in the last podcast that we were looking at uh 10 different or 10 years of people not wanting to vote for the progressive conservatives and that finally came to a head uh yesterday and and that was something that&#39;s that&#39;s unusual in politics uh alberta i think might be the only test cases of a place where we literally will build up anger for a decade before we will act</div>

          <div class="said">was not at all shocking. Let&#39;s just put it right there. It was not shocking. Anybody who says it&#39;s shocking was paying no attention for the last month because the polls steadily climbed from day one to the NDP all the way to day 28. and the polls at the last moment showed pretty much exactly what we got and to me so to me what i find more interesting i think than the dramatic outcome and i do find it really interesting is that everyone is shocked by it well</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">again right so 2012 all the polls tell us it&#39;s going to be one way it&#39;s going to be the wild rose majority and then most people will wake up on Tuesday morning after the election and go, what? We didn&#39;t get that wild rose majority? Because they didn&#39;t see what was actually happening in the election campaign, which was a shift back. And that shift back never occurred in this election. The polls, the conclusion I think we have to reach is that the polls weren&#39;t wrong in 2012. We shifted the vote. The vote never shifted back in 2015. It was fun to watch.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Okay, so let&#39;s talk about that a bit more, because I think you guys hit on a very important point. You know, on this podcast, Carter, last episode, the last question I asked you is what happens on election day, and you said a PC minority. Now, I was also on social media flailing back and forth between a PC minority and an NDP minority, disingenuously hedging my bets, as</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">as I always do. But, you know, one of the factors, and I think there&#39;s a couple, but one of the factors that we gave the PCs a little bit of credit for was their ground game. Now, let&#39;s talk about that, because the PCs, although only securing 10 seats, got 28% of the vote ahead of the official opposition, Wild Rose Party. So they did get votes. And, Corey, you&#39;ve mentioned this before, that voter efficiency is only efficient until it isn&#39;t. But we did give some credit to the ground game. why did that not materialize anything beyond the 10 states well</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">well i&#39;ll tell you why because ground game i&#39;m going to give you an extreme example imagine an election where two people turn out out of a million it&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">yeah i was the same way in fact there were three writings that reported right away um and they were all mobile polls so mobile polls for those people who really really don&#39;t hang out on the Elections Alberta website and check out the actual results as they&#39;re coming in. Mobile polls are polls that literally go to a senior&#39;s home, like a facility housing a number of seniors and collect the votes from the seniors that are in that home so they don&#39;t have to travel to a polling station. And what struck me is that the PCs were winning the polls to be sure, but they were not winning by the margins that they should have been winning by. And I think that right off the bat, I thought there was going to be an NDP government. And it just, after I think 15 minutes, there was absolutely no question. And, you know, I was funny. I was sitting beside the decision desk at CBC. And they were trying to figure out when to call an NDP majority. And I&#39;m like, just call it already. It&#39;s done.</div>

Now, tie goes to the Flames. Corey, you were wrong. The Alberta Liberals only picked up one seat. We can talk about the Flames, but let&#39;s talk about Dr. David Swan and what that was like. Yesterday, he gave a very, I don&#39;t know what to call it, strange speech by kind of taking backhanded credit for the NDP winning. He declared</div>

I want to talk about polling a little bit more because, Corey, you were an absolute believer about polling. And you were standing right there, side by side, making every prediction in this election for the last couple of weeks with the polls. The rest of us weren&#39;t so convinced. And effectively, the polls turned out to be right. All 20 of them that signaled the same thing. That&#39;s a healthy dose of skepticism from the rest of Alberta. Let&#39;s talk about the IVR phone polling system and polling at large. Is it back? Is it now credible? What space does it sit in right now as it relates to political campaigning?</div>

He made some good moves during the leadership. They won the three straight by-elections, a couple of them close ones. At the same time, he got the wild rose to cross over in what many were calling a political masterstroke. How did something so</div>

And people, when you&#39;re making all those political moves, one of the things we have to remember and keep in the back of our minds is people don&#39;t actually like politics that much. And they don&#39;t like it when we behave like entitled brats. And he was starting to behave like an entitled brat. And when he brought over Danielle Smith, there were two things about bringing over Danielle Smith and the rest of the Wild Rose. Number one, it just fundamentally undermined democracy. And number two, he screwed her. He screwed her and he screwed the entire Wild Rose caucus that came over. They were made, promises were made to those folks and promises were broken. And I think that Albertan said, you know what, maybe we can&#39;t trust this guy if he&#39;s going to screw over the very people that he&#39;s bringing over to help. Do</div>
