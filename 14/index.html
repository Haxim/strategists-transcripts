Plus: Corey shows off prodigious knowledge of mid 1990s Simpsons trivia and Stephen laments that he&#39;s not celebrating Anzac Day in style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are asked to walk through how they would overhaul the public-facing parts of Jean Charest&#39;s leadership campaign before the gang turns their attention to increasing temperatures in the UCP leadership review. How should Charest overhaul his approach to events, media and message? Is there anything normal about political staff publicly attacking members of their own caucus? And why would The Strategists record on such a big day for Australian football?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Stephen Carter is live on location in Surrey, B.C. tonight but his takes are as local as ever. The gang goes through a few quick headlines, dwells a bit on Pierre Poilievre&#39;s rental property ownership and then spends most of the time talking about political &#34;fixers&#34; and fixer-adjacent activities like issues manager, opposition researcher and spin doctor. Also some tough questions about whether Corey Hogan and Pierre Poilievre have ever been seen together in the same room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Pierre Poilievre&#39;s rental property before diving into political &#34;fixers&#34;, using allegations against a former Alberta Justice Minister as a launching off point. Does Poilievre owning rental properties kneecap his housing affordability message? How common are political fixers anyhow? And could Pierre and Corey at least dress differently? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But first, the headlines...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;For this Easter Monday edition of the podcast we dive deep into political process stories - why they can work, how they can be a distraction - and specifically their utility in the Conservative Party of Canada leadership race for one Mayor Patrick Brown. Plus, Zain drags the gang back to their &#34;political rules for Covid-19&#34; that Stephen and Corey set in January. Do they still hold? Or do they need a light dusting or deep clean? All this, plus the return of the fourth strategist, the sound board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use the Patrick Brown campaign as a launching off point to talk about political process stories, as well as revisit their &#34;political rules for Covid-19&#34; in the light of the sixth wave. Do process stories add from campaigns or detract from them? Is &#34;don&#39;t turn off your brain&#34; still good Covid-19 management advice? And if nobody shows up at the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thestrategistslive.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;May 19th live show in Edmonton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, will Corey and Zain blame Carter&#39;s ad read? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re reading this before April 21, you can also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/posts/65303607&#34;&gt;watch the live feed of the recording&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like: Corey is overdressed, Zain is underdressed, Carter has a camera angle that betrays his advanced age. But does it work? Oh, you bet.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

Is it a problem a third of the Liberal cabinet owns rental properties? Why is the soundboard applause so long?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about one hundred issues (ninety-nine of which are related to the price of housing) in a supersized version of &#34;Fine, fabulous or f--ked&#34;. Why has the price of housing absolutely consumed Canadian politics? Can Charest course correct and beat Poilievre? And why does anybody live in a place where it gets down to -10C in mid-April?

After recording Episode 981, the gang kept going to run through a few more issues-of-the-day and answer audience questions, including: what do we think of Boris Johnson&#39;s trip to Kyiv? Is the idea of Elon Musk joining the board of Twitter good for anybody at all? And if you had five minutes with any Canadian politician - and they had to take your advice - who would you talk to and why? Zain Velji and the audience, as always, split question asking duties and keep everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also want to give a shout out to &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Sauvé&lt;/strong&gt; - who captured the entire proceedings on camera. While you might not see his amazing video work we are all benefiting from his amazing audio. He took some pretty rough files and turning them into auditory - well, silver if not gold. Because of technical difficulties at the venue his backup was all that remained of the recording for the main show and his mixing and retouching work on the overtime show was, in the words of Stephen Carter, &#34;wait, people can do that?&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk Brian Jean&#39;s by-election win, the effect on Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership review and police oversight before turning to the federla Conservative Party candidate&#39;s launch websites and what they tell us about brand, tactics and more. Can we expect logistical chaos in Red Deer on April 9? Does Canada have a policing problem? And is there a better medium to discuss websites than a podcast?
