            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We need to decide what we have is available for strengths. We need to understand our opponents&#39; strengths and weaknesses. We</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We have to look at the public as a whole and see where their sentiments are right now. And from that, we need to construct a winning coalition. But we can&#39;t construct a winning coalition on bad data.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So the way I construct strategies is it&#39;s all a ladder or a staircase. You&#39;re starting from this ground place, And then you are trying to add the next easiest set, the next easiest set, the next easiest set. And maybe you get to majority. Depends on how far you get prior to the election actually happening.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so you&#39;re constructing a strategy in concert. Corey, you mentioned situational analysis of the ground and the land around you. Explain that. Normally when we talk about data, people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">hear data and they think polling, but it&#39;s more than that. We need to look at the demographics that are out there, past election results, the resources the parties have on hand as far as the amount of money which tells us an awful lot about what we can expect them to do certain things are just off the table if you don&#39;t have any local resourcing same with</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">with local resourcing in the sense of staff we need to pull together a picture that tells us this is our areas of opportunity these are our areas of weakness so i think one of the first things we need to do as we take a look at the land is is we need to look at the electorate what does the electorate feel about these things and i think that&#39;s going to take some polling</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s take some polling. We&#39;ll do some polling. Corey, you also mentioned in terms of data, it&#39;s understanding demographics. We&#39;ll get deeper into that, understanding which type of voters are going to be accessible to this Liberal Party. So it&#39;s Thursday.</span>

            <span class="text">but i&#39;ll give you that comment But I guess I told you that&#39;s rarely true. And let&#39;s see how this goes. This is our liberal special. We are now digging in a little bit more into the data. We are trying to figure out how the liberals, the party in third place in this tight race, can tee it up from there. Exciting stuff. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And to give some context, what we&#39;ve done since we were last talking about this a few days ago, we have gone into the field. We&#39;ve pulled together some public research. We&#39;ve pulled together some private research. research and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ve done some custom research in order to really lock down some of the big questions we were wrestling with viability accessibility intent issues things of that matter where</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s where this can happen because public polls aren&#39;t going to tell you that can</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">can i just can i add a caveat sure so i mean we&#39;ve pulled all these things together but we&#39;ve done it with about one-tenth of the budget in about one quarter of the time than we would normally do a strategy. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">hey, we all get paid to do this for a living. I&#39;ll tell you, if a client came and said, we&#39;d like a strategy for a national campaign in four days, including polling,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think we&#39;d take that. I wouldn&#39;t. Well, hold on.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">would. How much money is it? Carter might do it. Because if it&#39;s enough money, I&#39;ll take that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">There you go. Well, there you go. That&#39;s a great pitch for Stephen Carter Services.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Jerry Butts, Carter is willing to be that whipping boy for you if you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">to follow the guy. Regardless of how long or how short you need him, he will do it. Absolutely. When it needs to be right. Anything else you wanted to mention there? I think we wanted to get into this right away.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">So, Stephen, tee us off a little bit. Let&#39;s start with what our assumptions were and a little bit of our situation analysis as well. Have we reached a verdict, is effectively what I want to say, as to what our situation is. Let&#39;s talk about that. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, there&#39;s the common understanding of what the situation currently is. And Corey alluded to it a second ago. And that is that the Liberal Party of Canada is in third place and they&#39;re the underdogs for this election. That&#39;s quite a turnaround from where they were about six months ago, where they were the leaders. So I think that the situation analysis that I would rather put forward is it would focus on the electorate rather than on the parties themselves. themselves so i think that the big thing with the electorate is how</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">how volatile they currently are right and the number of undecideds are staggering so we&#39;re looking at over one in three women saying that they&#39;re undecided one five men saying that they&#39;re undecided right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">those are 33 percent</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">percent of women so there&#39;s a huge difference between the two yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah there is there&#39;s a 10 point difference between men and women undecided um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um plus i prefer not to say subset of women that&#39;s really big right And so you get these numbers of the electorate that are prepared to shift. Now, conventional wisdom,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">wisdom, why don&#39;t we take it from there, is that, well, okay, so let me put it this way. There is conventional wisdom, and then there&#39;s conventional wisdom, what strategists conventionally say, and then there&#39;s what appears to be the truth in this case, which is much different still. So people like to say when they look at a poll, oh, yeah, okay, you&#39;ve got those guys in the lead, but look at that, 30% undecided. If they all break to the liberals, they&#39;re going to win. That&#39;s stupid. I hope none of you out there are that stupid.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">counterpoint is something that strategists often say. I know I&#39;ve said this myself many times, is that undecideds tend to break along the same lines as the decided voters. And that kind of makes sense, especially when you look at it from a statistical standpoint. You&#39;ve got a sample of 60% voting one way and a sample of 40% who share a lot of similarities with that 60%. How are they going to break? because it&#39;s not like the 40% who don&#39;t vote are entirely common in other</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But now let&#39;s talk about this time. Let&#39;s talk about some of the numbers we&#39;ve said. I don&#39;t want to get too far into them right now, but I&#39;ll tell you right now, undecideds are not undecided between the Liberals, New Democrats, and Conservatives. They&#39;ve written off the Conservatives. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so if you&#39;ve decided to vote Conservative, you&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re voting Conservative. If you haven&#39;t decided, you&#39;re not going to decide now to vote conservative in the same number. So that puts this play between the liberals and the New Democrats. And I mean, foreshadowing as we move forward on this, there are some real limitations on the New Democrats. OK,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">OK, that was very, very cool stuff and a lot to unpack there. I do want to quickly summarize for people that may be catching up on on all the things that we just talked about. So number one, high level of undecideds, right? Overall, across the board, high level of undecideds. Number two, Stephen, you&#39;re mentioning that the disparity between gender on undecideds tends to favor women with more of them being undecided. That&#39;s number two. Corey, you mentioned that there&#39;s also this factor that the undecideds do not seem to be breaking the way the decideds are. That&#39;s factor number three. And we&#39;re now talking about how that may split across all of the provinces or may have particular leanings to specific provinces, right? Right. Right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Right. And I think you might be listening to me and saying, like, well, what do you mean the undecideds are breaking a different way? But we talked about this a bit earlier and kind of our tee up for this. We&#39;re not just looking at voting intent and this is their intent is undecided. But we also look at accessibility and viability. Accessibility is who would you consider voting for? Viability is who do you think is going to win? Right. Right. And what you find is that the options that the undecideds are considering are much more likely to be liberal or New Democrat than have conservative in the mix. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So we&#39;re agreed on that. We&#39;re good. Right. You guys feel like that as provides us enough of a base to start with a situation analysis to some degree. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

This is the way it&#39;s going to happen. This right now we&#39;re over-representing the conservative vote because we&#39;re underestimating how the, how the undecideds are actually going to break.

And that&#39;s crystallizing between between us what the goal should be for the liberals at this point, and crystallizing that and getting that in place. And, and I should explain to listeners how we want to and how we&#39;ve planned to do this. And let&#39;s see how we execute it on on this show is we want to kind of have Stephen Corey go about what they think the goal should be or what they think some of these other elements should be. And we&#39;ll kind of duke it out on the show. And we&#39;ll hopefully have some sort of consensus that we come to. And so so maybe Corey, tee us off as to what what you think the goal of this strategy should be. You&#39;re writing the strategy. What&#39;s your byline on goal? The</span>

But the conservatives in our polling and in our trends are really starting to drop in New Brunswick. And up come the NDP. But I don&#39;t think the NDP are going to sustain it. I think that we&#39;re looking at three seats for sure in New Brunswick and as many as six. So that becomes kind of our first, oh, here&#39;s some seats that we could grab.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Let me kind of agree with you, I guess, by way of looking at the accessibility numbers. When you look at New Brunswick, when you look at everywhere in Atlantic Canada, the Liberals&#39; accessibility numbers are totally off the charts, both in general and then with the undecideds. In a good way. Yeah, in a great way. Like at New Brunswick, we were just talking about 50% of voters said they&#39;d consider voting liberal, 59% in Newfoundland, 52% in Nova Scotia. Those are high numbers. I mean, I know we haven&#39;t gone through everywhere yet, but liberal accessibility numbers are higher in Atlantic Canada than anywhere else in the country. I think their ceiling is pretty high. If anything, I think you&#39;re underestimating their ceiling in this context. Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that, first of all, because there&#39;s only 32 seats, giving them a maximum set of 24 seems to make the most sense when some of those are ironclad Conservative and some of them are ironclad NDP at this stage. At this particular moment in 2011, it was a Conservative-Liberal fight for most of the seats in Atlantic Canada. At this stage, if the Liberal Party is going to take more seats, they have to be more worried about the New Democrats than they are about the Conservatives.

Lower than Saskatchewan, lower than Alberta, lower than anywhere. The Liberals are very polarizing. what the conservatives have become to so much of the rest of the country the liberals have been for a generation to quebec and they have a real hard ceiling in quebec and that hard ceiling is around 30 percent that&#39;s while the new democrats are looking at a hard ceiling of almost 60 percent wow twice that number yeah</span>

Toronto itself is a fight between the liberals and the New Democrats. And then Southern Ontario is not exactly out of play either.

Corey mentioned this right off the top where we started to talk about, is it a question of availability or is it a question of viability? And I suspect that Ontario is going to go to the party that they think has the best chance of actually winning this election. Forming government, right. The problem for the Liberals, the</span>

And by doing that, I don&#39;t mean we need to walk away from the economic or the infrastructure announcements that have been so foundational to liberals to this point. But I want to reframe all of that. And I want to reframe it all as families first. I want to make the liberal party the family first party that puts why are we looking at bringing in infrastructure construction? because this is the time to invest in our future for our families, for our children. Why do I want to be taking care of the middle class? Because it&#39;s about families. It&#39;s about middle class families. It&#39;s not just about the middle class. I want to now make it about middle class families. Why is the Liberal Party the party that cares about refugee families? Because it&#39;s ultimately about families and the families that we bring to Canada. And I want to add in one more thing that they have to put in, in my opinion, and</span>

So obviously we&#39;re the head of the household. and and there was voting patterns that reflected that in the 1950s we would see voting patterns where the male of the household would make a determination of who they were going to vote for and then they would vote for them now my my parents generation in the 1970s 80s 90s uh they started to to cancel each other&#39;s votes out and it was kind of oh yeah dad voted conservative and mom voted liberal ha ha ha funny funny now what we&#39;re seeing is that the matriarch of the family is having a tremendous influence not just on her vote but on her children&#39;s vote and the votes above you know to her to her parents and to her spouse&#39;s vote so now if the matriarch of the family is deciding of a certain vote she will be a significant influencer not just on her vote but on her entire family pod so the way that we used to see the patriarch in the 1950s we</span>

I see the Liberals as not really having a gender edge one way or the other, but there&#39;s a natural edge to women in elections because they are more likely to vote. Bottom line, five points higher than men in every age group until you hit about 74 years of age. And frankly, none of those guys are voting for the Liberals or New Democrats. Exactly.</span>

To move towards Stephen Harper on the economy, to work, to work, to become Stephen Harper&#39;s mirror opposite of what he&#39;s doing. And I&#39;ll take care of your economy that enables the wedge issue, the health care issues, the other things to be dropped in by the liberals and be more effective.

So they&#39;re keeping track of the waitlist now. So now they know how long you wait. That&#39;s about it. And now it&#39;s time for a government to actually step forward and say that the federal government, as per the Canada Health Act, has a role to play in health care and we are going to play it and we&#39;re going to play it with a vengeance.</span>

Can&#39;t be end of life because at the end of the day, everybody&#39;s going to agree with them about right to death and a lot of the things around there.

So when we go all the way to the end and we take right to die, we completely miss the actual reality. So there&#39;s a thing in healthcare called the 565. So the 565 is 5% of the population costs 65% of our health care dollars, and they turn over every two years. You know why they turn over every two years? Because they die.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s one thing to have these areas and know what the accessible voters want. As we&#39;ve kind of talked about in the last section, it&#39;s quite another that turned that into a grab bag of policies that you can announce on a regular basis. But I think that&#39;s what we would be talking about next, is rolling out a policy platform that plays into that. Now, normally, when you have policies that test well, sometimes people have the very mistaken urge to just announce them in some random order. But what we want to do is make sure they&#39;re layering into a broader campaign narrative now. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">if I can take the reins for a second here, if we&#39;re talking about a basic approach of social issues and we think we&#39;re going to be having healthcare as the cornerstone of that approach. Correct, yes. The other parts, though, including education, I&#39;m sure some other social protections, getting people back to work tangentially. If we&#39;re talking about the economy, it&#39;s going to be about what it means in</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. I mean, it&#39;s going to be down to the absolute person, which is what you were trying to get me to with the healthcare. What&#39;s in it for me? Yeah. This is a selfish electorate. Yes, you listening, you&#39;re selfish. We&#39;re fine with that. So we need to tell you in explicit terms exactly what you&#39;re going to get from each of these policies. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So we&#39;ve talked about a couple of buckets, and I think we&#39;d want to stick to those buckets. You know, maybe next week is education week, and then the week after that, the economy and getting you back to work or making sure you have a job. But, you know, I mean, one of the huge policies that could be considered by someone somewhere is like the minimum living wage. But let&#39;s throw that aside. I throw that out there as like a grenade in the middle of the conversation.</span>

            <span class="text">conversation. Mr. Mr. Orange Corey comes right in, right in by the end. I mean, I think I think there&#39;s there&#39;s one more thing, Zane, that we need to talk about, which I wear from here. And that&#39;s the these last six weeks. Right. I would spend a week right off the bat getting into British Columbia and really getting a foothold. You&#39;re starting to see some upward momentum in the polls. Not that we&#39;re listening to the polls, but let&#39;s get to British Columbia and let&#39;s get as many votes as we can get. Then the next step that we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to take a jump from BC back to Ontario, and that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to announce a significant policy in two weeks. And that&#39;s where you&#39;re really going to feel the shift. shift. Trudeau needs to get his acting under control, and then we can start to see, I think, the best possible shifts.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">tell you that that&#39;s the strategy as it is, and it&#39;s done. At this point, what we would normally do is we would go back out and do more research, right? And then we would do field testing of of these issues right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right right i mean we would we would go out and especially when we&#39;re talking about this regional component we&#39;d have a ton of research on the ground we&#39;d go and we touch our organizers on the ground and get their feedback uh we kind of alluded to that earlier there are going to be organizers listening to the this podcast if you would send us your information your feedback based on what we&#39;ve given you uh it would go a long ways to helping us flush out a large number of uh the points that we&#39;ve made if you&#39;re in a riding and you think Like, yeah, we&#39;re in a riding that is traditionally conservative, but with the liberals are really – don&#39;t give me your partisan crap. Don&#39;t just give me the we&#39;re in it this time stuff. There&#39;s got to be some sort of evidence that you&#39;re in it. Don&#39;t just play this like Calgary, Rocky Ridge, we&#39;ve got it this time. No, you don&#39;t.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Okay. So this is good. This was an exciting discussion. I do want to tease it back from the top. So we started this thing by forming some hypotheses at the beginning. We talked about the grassroots support, about the urban areas that the Liberals may be strong at. We then went into the field. We got data and we tried to back this up, which informed our situation analysis, which we completed today. It was about the goal. We put our goal at forming government, right? That was what Corey said, forming government and the 120 seats. From there, we went into our strategic opportunities for where we need to go. Carter, you took us across the country. B.C., Ontario stood out as the main grounds that we needed to go. When we look at the how now, we&#39;re looking at a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">a social-based policy or social-based policies targeting B.C. and Ontario where you&#39;re now getting viability off the table and you are now having the issues of trust being put into play. That&#39;s where we are today. Corey, anything I missed right there?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, I think that&#39;s a pretty good summary. These things are always more complicated than that. In fact, there&#39;s a lot of data we skipped over in our own analysis because</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">perhaps we figured it wasn&#39;t germane at the end of the day. But I will say this. Ultimately, if this strategy is going to be successful for the liberals, any strategy, it has to align Justin Trudeau&#39;s strengths with the opportunities available in the electorate. And I think Carter and I, I don&#39;t want to speak for you, but I think we see there is those opportunities. We</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think the challenge right now, I mean, if you&#39;re a very liberal strategist in Ottawa today, you should know that this election is yours to win if you put your mind to it.
