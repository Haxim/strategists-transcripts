        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the preliminary BC election results, the federal election that almost happened and violence against Mi'kmaq lobster fishers in Nova Scotia. What have we learned from the BC election? Are we destined for a federal election? And when will Stephen and Corey finally rebel against Zain's rating systems? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, our first segment, how the West was won maybe in two weeks. Okay, so we have an election results. We know John Horgan has become premier again of British Columbia becoming the first consecutive two-term premier for the NDP. It seemed like the difference maker for the NDP in this election was A, that they had an election, B, that they flipped old liberal strongholds, including those that the NDP were not competitive in for a very, very long time. But I want to talk about quite a few things here. And first and foremost, Corey, you know, this has been being covered in the media as a gamble. John Horgan&#39;s gamble paid off. He rolled hold the dice with this election, and it paid off. You know, 2020 hindsight being what it is, was this a gamble for John Horgan calling this election?</div>
        </div>

            <span class="ts">2:21</span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">It might have been a gamble, but it was a smart gamble. And there wasn&#39;t an awful lot of downside risk. It&#39;s like when we look at the US election right now, and if you go to 538, it says Donald Trump has a, I think, 17% chance of winning right now.</div>

          <div class="said">they were facing a very similar gamble when they were looking to run this election. There wasn&#39;t a lot of reason to believe that everything was going to break in Wilkinson&#39;s direction. Even if it did, odds were good that Horgan was going to win given the lead he had, and everything did not break in Wilkinson&#39;s direction. So I guess</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">guess the word gambled is overused in politics there&#39;s always chance when you make a decision like this certainly we especially as albertans we have seen people walk into the polls with big leads and just get clobbered i mean there&#39;s a reason why we don&#39;t have premier jim prentice right now and it was because he went to the polls one year ahead of an election with a lead that was somewhat comparable to the one that horgan had these things do happen but they don&#39;t happen that often and the tales we tell ourselves tend to be the outliers the reality is you go into an election with a a lead as big as John Horgan had, you&#39;re probably going to come out of it the other side, still the premier.</div>

          <div class="said">I had hoped that it was. I had hoped that there would be a political price to be paid for calling an election in the middle of a pandemic. But when you look at BC&#39;s pandemic numbers, he did very well through the course of the last four weeks of the election. There was no significant outbreaks. There has been significant changes in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta regarding the pandemic. So I think that he was able to emphasize the pandemic as a strength, whereas it very easily could have gone against him. Maybe it&#39;s because of good management. Maybe it&#39;s because of good luck that the pandemic didn&#39;t become the central issue of this campaign. I had thought that it was a dangerous thing to do because it very easily could have turned into Quebec, where your numbers skyrocket out of control. It could have turned into Ontario,</div>

I mean, Andrew Wilkinson spent three weeks talking about Bozo eruptions, for lack of a better term. You know, so, you know, whatever. I was disappointed, but no, he didn&#39;t pay a price.</div>

The guy&#39;s got a degree in law, a degree in medicine. He&#39;s a Rhodes Scholar, if I&#39;m not mistaken. I think you may want to correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that particular one. And we have a premier who&#39;s called an election in the middle of a pandemic and you have a doctor on the other side. This should have been a perfect sort of recipe for Wilkinson.

And what is maybe a lesson about candidates like Wilkinson that perhaps parties need to be aware of, maybe even liberals specifically going forward, need to be aware of going into their eventual leadership race? Is there a lesson to be learned around candidates that look unbelievable on paper like Wilkinson, but that just couldn&#39;t deliver?

All Calgarians had helped him get to that place where he went to Harvard, right? He went to public school. He rode on public transit. He studied in our public libraries. He was the best of what we could give him, and he was a reflection of what we gave him. And I want to address one more other thing, one more thing that Corey brought up, and that&#39;s Donald Trump. Keep in mind that people were identifying with Donald Trump because Donald Trump speaks like I do. He talks the way I do. Right.

It&#39;s fairly evident that the B.C. liberals aren&#39;t working anymore. You know, this composite, you know, this is not a real party. This isn&#39;t a traditional liberal party. It&#39;s not a conservative party. It is a liberal conservative so-called consortium that has been compiled over time that has people who were attracted to being elected, not necessarily people. And so this happened in Alberta when we lost the PC party. When it collapsed, it was because ultimately if you&#39;re out of power for, you know, or if you, well, we weren&#39;t out of power very long. But if you have no common values except being in power, you don&#39;t stick around together very long. So getting a party builder is going to be super important.

And then to the first original question that I asked Carter, if the BC liberals are looking for a new leader, what&#39;s kind of the composite profile you think of what they should be looking for in that leader?</div>

And then secondly, maybe strategic lessons if I&#39;m a Justin Trudeau watching the results here. Now, we talked about opportunism. We talked about, you know, electorate maybe not paying the price for calling a pandemic election.

The liberals, this seems like weeks ago, but it&#39;s just last week, the liberals declared the vote on that conservative motion a matter of confidence. which then put Jagmeet Singh in this box. So I want to talk about strategy. And let&#39;s go through all of the key players that we saw here. And Corey, you&#39;ve alluded to some political outcomes already in your previous answer. So let&#39;s hold off on that for a second. First, Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you. What did you make of the federal liberal strategy, the government strategy, Trudeau&#39;s strategy, to make this committee, the kickstarting of this committee, a confidence motion? What did you make of that strategy? Good strategy, bad strategy? And either way, why? I guess</div>

          <div class="said">guess it worked. So it must be a good strategy. The Trudeau strategy appears to be this is over now. And it seems to be in line with what generally Canadians seem to think this is over now. There was a time when maybe this was a big issue. You know, we&#39;d watch the polling trends and the polling trend would have little peaks for the conservatives and things would start to get close. But now I don&#39;t think anybody cares. I don&#39;t think that anybody is looking at this thinking this is still the thing that Andrew Scheer told us it was. And Pierre Polyev hasn&#39;t become any more effective at selling it to us.

          <div class="said">liberals say, how can we dispense of this? I know, let&#39;s amp it up. Let&#39;s increase the consequence of voting yes by making it a confidence motion. And we&#39;ll force, I mean, as Corey alluded to, just bully Singh into supporting the government and problem solves itself. And they were right. Problem solved itself. It didn&#39;t have any negative consequences. I mean, maybe we&#39;ll see two weeks from now that there&#39;s a shifting in the polls. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. It was really good strategy. It was one of the stronger pieces of crisis management that we&#39;ve seen from the liberals. but it also shows that the strength of their crisis management comes about two and a half months after the crisis. So that&#39;s not great crisis management, but they&#39;re getting out of it now. And if they can use this or something similarly benign to launch an election campaign, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;d be delighted.</div>

In fact, a lot of the commentary that was coming out of Ottawa in the night that we all thought maybe an election could happen was that it didn&#39;t seem to be a lot of good faith bargaining by Justin Trudeau. It was like, no, we&#39;re not going to do that. No, we&#39;re not going to move on this matter. And Singh decided to back down. He blinked. He veered. He swerved into that ditch. And Justin Trudeau drives on. gone the the thing is though i continue to believe that the liberals if the liberals were willing to fight an election on this they are willing to fight an election on most anything they are going to govern like a majority for sure for the next few months unless these polls change in in any kind of material sense and um they&#39;re not going to take shit from anybody they&#39;re just going to run through anything in their platform they think is mildly contentious and effectively dare people to vote against them especially if they think that the thing they&#39;re moving through is something That could have resonance with the public.

So building on Stephen&#39;s point about what you want the party to be, there&#39;s a lot of things the party could be, and there&#39;s a lot of things that the NDP could extract from the Liberals, but they should be trying to extract them now, and effectively almost daring the Liberals the other way.

I want to put that to the people. Then at least it comes from a position of strength. Um, this isn&#39;t the time or, you know, these weak, these weak positions always anger me.

But there are things I want more than stable government. I want ethical government.

But I&#39;m sure they&#39;re much more prepared to go to the polls than the NDP are, and they should be.

Guys, I want to talk about the issue that is currently active in Nova Scotia with the Mi&#39;kmaq indigenous people and the commercial fishermen out there. So to summarize this story, on one side, we have commercial fishermen who say that the indigenous Mi&#39;kmaq are threatening their livelihoods by trapping lobster outside of the federally regulated lobster season. And on the other side, we&#39;ve got the Mi&#39;kmaq lobstermen who say they&#39;re being attacked with impunity for exercising their legal right to hunt and fish through rights negotiated in a centuries-old treaty and backed up by a decades-old court decision. It&#39;s currently, you know, started as an escalating fight that&#39;s now seen certain elements of fighting, certain elements of physical violence. We&#39;ve seen police escalation in the sense of more officers there to try to control what has become a very tense situation out in Nova Scotia. And then on the political side, we&#39;ve seen an emergency debate in parliament. Carter, going to you from a high level, how big of a deal is this for the liberals? I</div>

          <div class="said">tries to avoid that. So on those two fronts, I think those are both bad issues for Justin Trudeau. I think both of those issues make him look, the policing issue makes him look weak. The Indigenous rights issue, my goodness, is Indigenous rights ever a good topic to be talking about if you&#39;re a federal politician? It&#39;s an issue that is pervasive. It has no easy solution. And when it flares up, it takes a long time for us to walk away from it and figure it out. So I think that both of these issues, both sides of this issue, if you will, are problematic for Trudeau. And I don&#39;t see an easy solution. I don&#39;t think that we can just simply say to people, well, you know, this is the indigenous right. This is the indigenous right to do this and say to the fishermen, you know, good luck. But that&#39;s the answer. I mean, this is an indigenous right. But what now do we then do for the commercial fishermen? Because when people are facing economic strife, they get scared and they get violent and they get angry and they shouldn&#39;t necessarily do those things.

They kind of get squeezed from both ends in a situation like this. They can&#39;t lean too much left. They can&#39;t lean too much right. They&#39;re trying to maintain this central position.

When it matters most, Justin Trudeau just can&#39;t make a decision. Now, they haven&#39;t said which way, right? But they&#39;ve actually kind of pinned him to this, that this is a guy who delays, you know, says things, but just can&#39;t act. And I wanted to get two things from you. Number Number one, a response to what you heard from Corey, but number two, the effectiveness of that line of Trudeau&#39;s inaction or Trudeau&#39;s lack of action on big ticket items, on value items like this that require more than just symbolism, so to speak.

You know, so maybe the decision is I have to walk into the RCMP commissioner&#39;s office and lay down the law, you know, remind them of what the laws are and what their job is in this country. And one more RCMP staff sergeant or whatever the titles are, who stands out and says, you know, essentially there are good people on both sides, as they did here in Alberta, that&#39;s the ballgame. You&#39;re done. We&#39;re getting a new RCMP commissioner who can come in here and fix this force up. Maybe that&#39;s the decision. But there is no decision. As Corey has said, their rights are black and white. This isn&#39;t an untested right. They have the opportunity to fish these waters.

          <div class="said">know, because Husky almost bought Mag Energy a while back and then didn&#39;t and blamed the inability of getting oil to market here. Now, that sort of burned Husky for any future acquisitions, which is part of why Husky is now the one who&#39;s going as the acquired to the altar. But the problem with that is that that oil company, now very large, Synovus plus Husky, is not going to want you to say it&#39;s bad. And so if you are Jason Kenney, you&#39;re kind of between a rock and a hard place here. You&#39;re not going to want to say anything at all. You&#39;re not going to want to say it&#39;s good because it results in job losses. You&#39;re not going to want to say it&#39;s bad because you&#39;re essentially saying this very large corporate presence</div>

We&#39;ve got a ton of five-star reviews, which by the way, doesn&#39;t surprise us at all. They&#39;re well-deserved and we know it. But next time you leave one, or if you have a question on your mind, leave us a review on iTunes with your five stars and ask your question. We&#39;re happy to read it as part of our over, under, and our lightning round. And that&#39;s a wrap on episode 827 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velji, with me as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter, and we&#39;ll see you next time.</div>
