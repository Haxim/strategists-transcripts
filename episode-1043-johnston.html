They want the winning strategy for the NDP and the losing strategy, which Corey Hogan&#39;s going to do, for the UCP. So a winner in me and a loser in Corey. Very important that you have winners and losers in these things. Also, going back in the eras, we&#39;re going to have you go back to this 500 series when you just first joined us.

The strategistlive.ca will lead you to a website where you can get different types of tickets, which you should maybe also buy, but buy them after you go to strategistlive.ca. Okay. Now, if you go to strategistlive.ca, when you load that seating map, many of you will notice that there&#39;s some tickets left in the middle section, just very few. And there&#39;s some tickets left on the right-hand and the left-hand section now carter these look like a straight line so a a person a less thoughtful person might think that they&#39;re sitting uh in in a seat just by themselves uh but that&#39;s not the case that is actually not the case with these particular tickets right as we head into minute six of the podcast can we explain well those</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, the Liberals&#39; ambition was they were trying to win, and that was their big mistake. They should have been trying not to lose. And they should have been looking at it not through like who&#39;s got the most upside, but who has the least downside. And again, a simple Google search would have identified some potential downside to the David Johnston pick. And that was a mistake because ultimately the Canadians you were trying to convince and assure that the election is going to be just fine, David Johnson is not a household name to them, Zane. He&#39;s simply not. And many of them will now only know him through the filter of people complaining about his connections to the Trudeau Foundation, you know, his neighbor connection to Justin Trudeau and, you know, the lifelong, I&#39;ve known this guy forever stuff, which is not going to be a good look when you consider what most people think that this inquiry is about, which is, what did the government know, and when did they know it, and why did they not act? You can&#39;t have that kind of connection in that kind of situation there. On Stephen&#39;s overall timeline, I think that he identifies a point, but I come at it a little bit differently here. I would say that the 10 days where Trudeau said, we&#39;re not going to do anything, you kind of brushed over, because it wasn&#39;t just, we&#39;re not going to have a special inquiry, it was, shame on you for even suggesting there was a problem with Canadian elections.

So I&#39;m going to have this looked at by a committee of parliamentarians. And we&#39;re also going to get this special repertoire. And then he said it would be a couple of weeks. And no doubt in my mind, it was a couple of weeks, not so they could exceed expectations brilliantly by coming in a few days later, but because they were hoping temperatures would lower over that. time. Temperatures did not lower over that time. It was not enough. It was not enough to deny the calls for an inquiry, which is why they then brought out a name in spirit of trying to win by showing how fucking awesome this rapporteur could be. We&#39;re going to pick a name that everybody knows and Stephen Harper appointed him and that&#39;s going to fuck those guys. And we got them. We got a mission accomplished gang, except</div>

And if they wanted to make this look like it was an acceptable approach, it had to be built from more of a defensive point of view than the offensive point of view, which is what they did. And this goes back to their original sin, their fundamental problem. The liberals are deep in politics on this one. They tried to call Polyev Trump. They tried to go on the offensive for the first 10 days. That fucking failed. They went after that with their special rapporteur and their their committee that didn&#39;t really work either so then they decided they were going to go and find somebody that they thought would really stick it to the conservatives because how could they possibly possibly refute somebody like david johnson and that fucking failed they need to understand they&#39;re on the defensive on this one and the best defense is not despite what every platitude you&#39;ve ever heard has said always the best offense they need to understand the serious risk they&#39;re in right now and start behaving appropriately carter</div>

You want them to be complaining still that there&#39;s not an inquiry, but not having really anything that they can gripe about in terms of the process that you&#39;ve created through the rapporteur.

            <div class="said">so cory carter&#39;s carter&#39;s ultimately saying that david johnson doesn&#39;t wear the blue jersey he&#39;s not on the team so to speak he he didn&#39;t get the the the tap on the shoulder to be on the team, so to speak, in that sense. And he doesn&#39;t have that political air cover that perhaps the liberals would have expected conservatives to kind of be like, no, no, he&#39;s a no-go, when in fact, he was definitely a go.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">So that&#39;s a really important point. And the thing to underline is when Stephen Harper was saying nice things about David Johnson, I had no doubt that he thought nice things about David Johnson, but he was really saying nice things about himself. He was saying, I&#39;m such a smart prime minister i&#39;ve appointed this person who is so perfect for the job right look at me i&#39;m a great guy who&#39;s good at picking non-partisan people to be governor general and you got to consider the context of previous governors general and the complaints that conservatives had about them in particular that they were perhaps not not administrators they were a little bit of that liberal mold of being these aspirational ggs that were supposed to say something about the country you know we&#39;ve actually talked about this yeah we have liberals like to appoint governors general that say something about Canada. They&#39;re supposed to speak to our better angels. And Conservatives don&#39;t. Conservatives want to get somebody who&#39;s kind of like this steady, stable, very traditional person</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">person in the role. And so the nice things that were said were really just a way of reflecting the virtues that Stephen Harper thought were important in a Governor General. So that&#39;s number one, and that&#39;s really important. But I also want to say, and I said this on Twitter too,</div>

            <div class="said">just because you think somebody is good for one job does not mean you are giving them a pass to be great at every job going forward here. You know, I might think really highly of my accountant, not going to let him do heart surgery. I might think somebody would be a great judge, fantastic judge, not going to let them oversee a trial of their cousin, right? We&#39;re not giving blanket endorsements when we endorse people. And just because we think they&#39;re people of integrity doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to allow them to be in positions where that integrity might be called into question. And it doesn&#39;t mean that we never can complain about them or criticize them going forward, because we&#39;ve said nice things at least once before. And so I think that was the thing. Like, it would be different if Harper had appointed Johnson to Stephen&#39;s point in a political role. It would be different if he had appointed Johnson in a role that was specifically to this, like to oversee an inquiry. The job of the GG is not that, right? And they had proven, you know, and Johnson had proven that he was very capable in that, and he got tons of accolades for it. But no, he was a ceremonial figurehead many years, well, not many years ago, it was pretty recent, he was governor general. And, and then he wasn&#39;t, and now he&#39;s being appointed to an entirely different role, overseeing foreign interference. In a way, it&#39;s a bit wild. old no given his background as a university administrator and a you know a law professor and let&#39;s face it university administrators are great they&#39;re</div>

            <div class="said">you know i uh i don&#39;t know how i feel about about this appointment of rapporteur. I&#39;ve got concerns about how close they are to the Trudeau government. It&#39;s something I&#39;ll be watching very closely here as we move forward. But I got to tell you, one of my concerns right now is that by not calling this inquiry, Justin Trudeau has created a situation where we&#39;re all having to react and respond and talk about these issues when there are really important bread and butter issues that we should be focusing on as a parliament. Unfortunately, the security of our country is not something we can put aside. And Justin Trudeau&#39;s desire to continue to drag this thing so painfully through the weeks and months is doing an absolute disservice to this to you know this fine nation uh i i&#39;m going to be trying to juggle the ball and you know watch two things go in at the same time i will certainly continue to be deeply engaged on foreign interference but i also want to talk about the interference of grocery stores and prices and i want to make sure that right now we are also looking at what&#39;s happening um you know at the at the supermarket i want to make sure we understand what&#39;s happening with insurance prices We can&#39;t lose sight of affordability, and frankly, we can&#39;t afford to, just because Justin Trudeau has gotten himself into such a mess with the foreign interference. And by the way, shame on Pierre Polyev for absolutely no ability to raise himself above this and talk about what matters to Canadians. He&#39;s only talking about cheap political points with Trudeau. i&#39;m never going to lose sight on and focus on what matters which is you and your livelihood and that doesn&#39;t mean that uh i give a pass to justin trudeau here but it means we got to be able to walk and chew gum and unfortunately i don&#39;t see either of the other two leaders remotely able to do that</div>

            <div class="said">well as a policy i i really like it and i think it does speak to um some things that conservatives have pushed for many decades i feel like we don&#39;t talk enough about interprovincial trade barriers it&#39;s funny how much easier it is in some ways to trade with to work in the united states through nafta than it is sometimes through uh you know provinces that are just next door and the harmonization of these these rules is vitally important. And Stephen, I think that, I mean, this is the perennial conversation and debate, but look, I mean, this is simple economics. You make it easier for people to make that move to Alberta. Over time, that will reduce wages in Alberta. That will balance things out through the system. And over time, it makes it work better for the other provinces as well. As a country, I just think it makes sense. And it will help level off some of these massive inequalities that we have we have found have generated over time um you know where where alberta has gdp per capita way above other provinces for example right so so yeah you know people should be able to make use of that money and and i i don&#39;t i don&#39;t begrudge anybody that and i think that as canadians we should have the kind of mobility that this sort of uh policy introduces as politics i don&#39;t know that it&#39;s actually that sexy or that interesting and of Of course, the PCs in the 90s used to talk a lot about interprovincial trade barriers, and no one gave a shit, because the stuff that really engages the political class is not this, and that&#39;s why the Reform Party gets to get in the headlines with things like Tripoli Senate back in the day, and that&#39;s why, you know, you can talk about Chinese interference, and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to be driving the headlines right now. I also think that Stephen has put his finger on some anxieties that will exist around this particular policy. So, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to move too much. I think it&#39;s a super, you know, sensible if you&#39;ve got a conservative worldview policy. I think it&#39;s just a generally sensible policy if you believe in economic theory. And I don&#39;t fault it, but I don&#39;t think that its politics are going to be uplifting and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to change the terrain in Canada. Corey,</div>

Is this better or worse for the liberals in terms of the federal stage? How do you kind of, if you&#39;re assessing it from their perspective, better or worse in your mind that there is now interference in a different order of government in a specific city that is now kind of being unearthed and revealed into the into the public consciousness better or worse for the liberals carter way worse i</div>
