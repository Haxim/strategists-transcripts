            <span class="text">might be right for us to own an airline. Certainly between the collapse of the financial sector and the overall anxiety in the airline sector, there&#39;s room to maneuver, I think is what I would say. But it takes time. It takes time. And sometimes you use time as pressure to get the deal that you want. And there&#39;s a bit of an arc in any negotiation that goes from it looks like the deal is close to the deal is very far away at the 11th hour to look, we found a deal. And you&#39;ve got to sometimes use the clock in order to get what you want in negotiations. And so, look, anything more, I think, would perhaps jeopardize our own negotiating strategy at the table. but um you</span>

It is a URL that leads to a live show, Stephen Carter, a live show where you and Corey Hogan will be competing, we&#39;ll be debating, we&#39;ll be squaring off, we&#39;ll be providing the highest level insights sites for the upcoming Alberta election, you will be dueling off with strategies for the NDP versus the UCP. Carter, talk to us about this live show. Talk to us about the state of ticket sales. Talk to us about why they haven&#39;t gone faster in your mind. What do you think the issue there was? And talk to us about which side you and Corey are going to be representing in just two Sundays. We&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;re in a very competitive market. I don&#39;t know if you guys know that. there&#39;s a young woman named Taylor Swift who</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">also launched a huge tour and she seems to have drawn all the ticket buyers but I have learned something from Taylor Swift yeah</span>

They want the winning strategy for the NDP and the losing strategy, which Corey Hogan&#39;s going to do, for the UCP. So a winner in me and a loser in Corey. Very important that you have winners and losers in these things. Also, going back in the eras, we&#39;re going to have you go back to this 500 series when you just first joined us. And you&#39;re going to be even more boring. you&#39;re not even gonna like there won&#39;t be jokes or anything you&#39;re just gonna be zane</span>

            <span class="text">let me talk about some misconceptions about these tickets okay this is where i was hoping both of you would go to to. If you go to strategistlive.ca, by the way, do not go to the strategistlive.ca. The strategistlive.ca will lead you to a website where you can get different types of tickets, which you should maybe also buy, but buy them after you go to strategistlive.ca. Okay. Now, if you go to strategistlive.ca, when you load that seating map, many of you will notice that there&#39;s some tickets left in the middle section, just very few. And there&#39;s some tickets left on the right-hand and the left-hand section now carter these look like a straight line so a a person a less thoughtful person might think that they&#39;re sitting uh in in a seat just by themselves uh but that&#39;s not the case that is actually not the case with these particular tickets right as we head into minute six of the podcast can we explain well those</span>

But then I said to myself, you know what? Fuck the patrons. Let&#39;s get back. Let&#39;s give the people what they want and let&#39;s give them these tickets. So there are tickets side by side. And I will tell you, if it&#39;s going to help us, there are</span>

So if people buy the tickets and sell us out before Thursday, here&#39;s what I&#39;m planning to do. We reverse the seat. So we&#39;ll change the whole order. So if you buy your tickets now, you could be in the splash zone with Corey and I.</span>

Then we have a discussion, we debate it, we strip it down, we try to make it a 10. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to try to stick to this time. We&#39;re going to try to give it a score.

Tell me what this was for the liberals. And then we&#39;re going to have a big discussion around it. But give me your one to 10 scale. They announced to some background that the special rapporteur would be named in weeks. It would not take a long time. Well, they were pretty quick in naming it.

There just simply wasn&#39;t. There&#39;s no way that Pierre Polyev or the media is going to give Trudeau this opportunity to kind of choose his own investigator to kind of quote Andrew Coyne. And really, that&#39;s where the problem lies. This isn&#39;t someone who&#39;s investigating Justin Trudeau. This is someone who&#39;s investigating foreign interference into Canadian elections. So Justin Trudeau, last I checked, isn&#39;t a foreign entity interfering in our elections. But, you know, Coyne got a little confused and it looks like Corey got a little confused, too.

What I&#39;m saying is they actually needed to collaborate on this particular one. They needed to get people to agree that the individual was acceptable from a baseline integrity point of view before they proceeded any further with this. And the idea that Johnson is just looking at foreign interference, ergo, of course, there&#39;s no problem that there&#39;s a conflict with Trudeau or a potential conflict with Trudeau is patently absurd. absurd because that is the anxiety that underlines all of this and it is just delusional to pretend otherwise and if canadians are going to have faith in the outcome of this it needs to be with the view uh that it is not based on somebody&#39;s personal relationships how could they possibly have come up with someone else i don&#39;t know probably one of 100 different federal judges would have been a bitter pick maybe a supreme court justice maybe a failed supreme court justice like mark nadon you know There are names out there that are still tied to Stephen Harper that are nonpartisan, that are judicial, that could have done this in a way that would have not gotten the blowback that the liberals got.

Says we&#39;re doing a special rapporteur. Mandacino says we&#39;re going to announce it in a couple of weeks. This is a matter of weeks, not months. And a couple of days later, David Johnston.

The liberals absolutely want to move on this.

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the Liberals&#39; ambition was they were trying to win, and that was their big mistake. They should have been trying not to lose. And they should have been looking at it not through like who&#39;s got the most upside, but who has the least downside. And again, a simple Google search would have identified some potential downside to the David Johnston pick. And that was a mistake because ultimately the Canadians you were trying to convince and assure that the election is going to be just fine, David Johnson is not a household name to them, Zane. He&#39;s simply not. And many of them will now only know him through the filter of people complaining about his connections to the Trudeau Foundation, you know, his neighbor connection to Justin Trudeau and, you know, the lifelong, I&#39;ve known this guy forever stuff, which is not going to be a good look when you consider what most people think that this inquiry is about, which is, what did the government know, and when did they know it, and why did they not act? You can&#39;t have that kind of connection in that kind of situation there. On Stephen&#39;s overall timeline, I think that he identifies a point, but I come at it a little bit differently here. I would say that the 10 days where Trudeau said, we&#39;re not going to do anything, you kind of brushed over, because it wasn&#39;t just, we&#39;re not going to have a special inquiry, it was, shame on you for even suggesting there was a problem with Canadian elections. Sure, yeah. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, yeah, really aggressively say not a problem, Trump like suggesting otherwise, only to decide 10 days later after Canadians just were not having it, that he was going to say, Yes, this is serious. So I&#39;m going to have this looked at by a committee of parliamentarians. And we&#39;re also going to get this special repertoire. And then he said it would be a couple of weeks. And no doubt in my mind, it was a couple of weeks, not so they could exceed expectations brilliantly by coming in a few days later, but because they were hoping temperatures would lower over that. time. Temperatures did not lower over that time. It was not enough. It was not enough to deny the calls for an inquiry, which is why they then brought out a name in spirit of trying to win by showing how fucking awesome this rapporteur could be. We&#39;re going to pick a name that everybody knows and Stephen Harper appointed him and that&#39;s going to fuck those guys. And we got them. We got a mission accomplished gang, except</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And they they should have been thinking about the downside of that particular decision as they went along there. And if they wanted to make this look like it was an acceptable approach, it had to be built from more of a defensive point of view than the offensive point of view, which is what they did. And this goes back to their original sin, their fundamental problem. The liberals are deep in politics on this one. They tried to call Polyev Trump. They tried to go on the offensive for the first 10 days. That fucking failed. They went after that with their special rapporteur and their their committee that didn&#39;t really work either so then they decided they were going to go and find somebody that they thought would really stick it to the conservatives because how could they possibly possibly refute somebody like david johnson and that fucking failed they need to understand they&#39;re on the defensive on this one and the best defense is not despite what every platitude you&#39;ve ever heard has said always the best offense they need to understand the serious risk they&#39;re in right now and start behaving appropriately carter</span>

Like we&#39;re on the mat now, I want to be off the mat, I want to throw the other guy to the mat. And you know what, sometimes your job is just about minimizing downside. And it&#39;s tough, it stings, you know, it takes swallowing your pride to do it at that point. But sometimes the right response is minimize downside.

            <span class="text">yeah it would be difficult for conservatives to say they had bad judgment in that sense. I think a judicial appointment made by a conservative or an attempted one by a conservative in the case of, you know, a failed Supreme Court justice appointment, Nadon, right? I think it was Nadon, would be the, would be kind of a sensible approach in that way. But you want them ultimately not to have a bunch of things to complain about. You want them to be complaining still that there&#39;s not an inquiry, but not having really anything that they can gripe about in terms of the process that you&#39;ve created through the rapporteur. Now, you&#39;ve got a situation where that becomes almost a proof point in why they still need a public inquiry.</span>

But you know, he&#39;s already got a bit of a work plan going. He&#39;s going to be talking to witnesses here. He&#39;s going to be looking into these areas. He&#39;s going to be relying on these people as well and there&#39;s ways you can bolster some of the criticisms against him he&#39;s already brought in a team that includes a number of ex-justices who will be specifically looking at components to make sure he doesn&#39;t have a blind side to them there are many ways you can shore things up on the side and we don&#39;t need to create them all here but you know the other thing i would say about it is um well in many ways there&#39;s not any other approach for them to take at this point right if somebody puts a microphone in front of his face and says you know what do do you think about this either to the prime minister or to manichino of course they&#39;re going to have to say the things that you&#39;ve just described but if</span>

But it&#39;s a difficult situation to be in for sure. And sometimes this becomes a situation where you do exactly what Stephen said, is rather than sit there and increase the rhetoric, you start giving them a little bit more substance down the road. Start changing the conversation to the nuts and bolts rather than the, you know, you move them past the decision and start talking about the roll on from the decision.

And I&#39;ll talk about the Polyev communications in a second and in terms of how hard they went and some of their messaging lines, etc. I want to get your read on that. But what was the political misread on the Harper side of things? Was it the fact that Harper doesn&#39;t have that same political power? Was it the different political eras? What was it? Carter, both of you want to go first on this, which</span>

            <span class="text">which means I&#39;ll let Carter go first on this because his desperation level is definitely a 10. It&#39;s definitely a 10 on that scale of 1 to 10.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The Governor General is, you know, it doesn&#39;t imply that Stephen Harper thought that this is the best guy politically. This was a, you know, this is a person who held well-rounded credentials, similar to your mother-in-law, for being appointed to the LG. But it&#39;s not political. It&#39;s not like your mom, your mother-in-law was appointed because she had really strong relationships relationships uh with um with the government of the day the the point of the exercise is these people are in some fashion unrelated to the government and so you don&#39;t get any of that stephen harper uh protection because it actually wasn&#39;t a stephen harper decision you know it wasn&#39;t a stephen harper political decision i would imagine that the governor the governor general has thought about for about 15 or 20 minutes when the decision is being made you know is this going going to hurt us yes or no oh no great because the lg is going to do the lg and the gg do what they&#39;re told to do period end of sentence um and so there was no real upside to be gained i think would probably be the simplest way to put it there was no upside to be gained from making this particular gg decision so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so cory carter&#39;s carter&#39;s ultimately saying that david johnson doesn&#39;t wear the blue jersey he&#39;s not on the team so to speak he he didn&#39;t get the the the tap on the shoulder to be on the team, so to speak, in that sense. And he doesn&#39;t have that political air cover that perhaps the liberals would have expected conservatives to kind of be like, no, no, he&#39;s a no-go, when in fact, he was definitely a go.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s a really important point. And the thing to underline is when Stephen Harper was saying nice things about David Johnson, I had no doubt that he thought nice things about David Johnson, but he was really saying nice things about himself. He was saying, I&#39;m such a smart prime minister i&#39;ve appointed this person who is so perfect for the job right look at me i&#39;m a great guy who&#39;s good at picking non-partisan people to be governor general and you got to consider the context of previous governors general and the complaints that conservatives had about them in particular that they were perhaps not not administrators they were a little bit of that liberal mold of being these aspirational ggs that were supposed to say something about the country you know we&#39;ve actually talked about this yeah we have liberals like to appoint governors general that say something about Canada. They&#39;re supposed to speak to our better angels. And Conservatives don&#39;t. Conservatives want to get somebody who&#39;s kind of like this steady, stable, very traditional person</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">person in the role. And so the nice things that were said were really just a way of reflecting the virtues that Stephen Harper thought were important in a Governor General. So that&#39;s number one, and that&#39;s really important. But I also want to say, and I said this on Twitter too,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just because you think somebody is good for one job does not mean you are giving them a pass to be great at every job going forward here. You know, I might think really highly of my accountant, not going to let him do heart surgery. I might think somebody would be a great judge, fantastic judge, not going to let them oversee a trial of their cousin, right? We&#39;re not giving blanket endorsements when we endorse people. And just because we think they&#39;re people of integrity doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to allow them to be in positions where that integrity might be called into question. And it doesn&#39;t mean that we never can complain about them or criticize them going forward, because we&#39;ve said nice things at least once before. And so I think that was the thing. Like, it would be different if Harper had appointed Johnson to Stephen&#39;s point in a political role. It would be different if he had appointed Johnson in a role that was specifically to this, like to oversee an inquiry. The job of the GG is not that, right? And they had proven, you know, and Johnson had proven that he was very capable in that, and he got tons of accolades for it. But no, he was a ceremonial figurehead many years, well, not many years ago, it was pretty recent, he was governor general. And, and then he wasn&#39;t, and now he&#39;s being appointed to an entirely different role, overseeing foreign interference. In a way, it&#39;s a bit wild. old no given his background as a university administrator and a you know a law professor and let&#39;s face it university administrators are great they&#39;re</span>

It&#39;s something I&#39;ll be watching very closely here as we move forward. But I got to tell you, one of my concerns right now is that by not calling this inquiry, Justin Trudeau has created a situation where we&#39;re all having to react and respond and talk about these issues when there are really important bread and butter issues that we should be focusing on as a parliament. Unfortunately, the security of our country is not something we can put aside. And Justin Trudeau&#39;s desire to continue to drag this thing so painfully through the weeks and months is doing an absolute disservice to this to you know this fine nation uh i i&#39;m going to be trying to juggle the ball and you know watch two things go in at the same time i will certainly continue to be deeply engaged on foreign interference but i also want to talk about the interference of grocery stores and prices and i want to make sure that right now we are also looking at what&#39;s happening um you know at the at the supermarket i want to make sure we understand what&#39;s happening with insurance prices We can&#39;t lose sight of affordability, and frankly, we can&#39;t afford to, just because Justin Trudeau has gotten himself into such a mess with the foreign interference. And by the way, shame on Pierre Polyev for absolutely no ability to raise himself above this and talk about what matters to Canadians. He&#39;s only talking about cheap political points with Trudeau. i&#39;m never going to lose sight on and focus on what matters which is you and your livelihood and that doesn&#39;t mean that uh i give a pass to justin trudeau here but it means we got to be able to walk and chew gum and unfortunately i don&#39;t see either of the other two leaders remotely able to do that</span>

So you use paid to get that repetition.

            <span class="text">well as a policy i i really like it and i think it does speak to um some things that conservatives have pushed for many decades i feel like we don&#39;t talk enough about interprovincial trade barriers it&#39;s funny how much easier it is in some ways to trade with to work in the united states through nafta than it is sometimes through uh you know provinces that are just next door and the harmonization of these these rules is vitally important. And Stephen, I think that, I mean, this is the perennial conversation and debate, but look, I mean, this is simple economics. You make it easier for people to make that move to Alberta. Over time, that will reduce wages in Alberta. That will balance things out through the system. And over time, it makes it work better for the other provinces as well. As a country, I just think it makes sense. And it will help level off some of these massive inequalities that we have we have found have generated over time um you know where where alberta has gdp per capita way above other provinces for example right so so yeah you know people should be able to make use of that money and and i i don&#39;t i don&#39;t begrudge anybody that and i think that as canadians we should have the kind of mobility that this sort of uh policy introduces as politics i don&#39;t know that it&#39;s actually that sexy or that interesting and of Of course, the PCs in the 90s used to talk a lot about interprovincial trade barriers, and no one gave a shit, because the stuff that really engages the political class is not this, and that&#39;s why the Reform Party gets to get in the headlines with things like Tripoli Senate back in the day, and that&#39;s why, you know, you can talk about Chinese interference, and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to be driving the headlines right now. I also think that Stephen has put his finger on some anxieties that will exist around this particular policy. So, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to move too much. I think it&#39;s a super, you know, sensible if you&#39;ve got a conservative worldview policy. I think it&#39;s just a generally sensible policy if you believe in economic theory. And I don&#39;t fault it, but I don&#39;t think that its politics are going to be uplifting and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to change the terrain in Canada. Corey,</span>

So how, however soon that happens, he will not be in the job anymore, but I think that will be the, the quote unquote graceful exit is, well, we&#39;re doing this other thing now. We thank him for his service. Maybe he&#39;ll be involved in the inquiry in some way, shape or form, but not leading it. And that&#39;s, that&#39;s how it will all be. Do you</span>

Is this better or worse for the liberals in terms of the federal stage? How do you kind of, if you&#39;re assessing it from their perspective, better or worse in your mind that there is now interference in a different order of government in a specific city that is now kind of being unearthed and revealed into the into the public consciousness better or worse for the liberals carter way worse i</span>
