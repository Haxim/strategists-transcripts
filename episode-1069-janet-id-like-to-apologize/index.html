        <p>The gang start a series of reactions to the Alberta election by talking about the day after, unpacking just how differently things could have gone with only a few votes and beginning discussion about what the campaigns did well and could have done differently.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter give their instant reaction to the results of the 2023 Alberta election and talk about what happens the day after the campaign, how few votes separated an NDP majority from a 15-seat UCP majority, and begin unpacking what the NDP might have been able to do differently. Why weren’t Calgary-Acadia and Calgary-Glenmore the predicted bellwethers? How soon does the work for the next campaign begin? And is tonight the night Stephen Carter quashes all beefs? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

You&#39;ve got a list in advance so that you&#39;re hitting the ground running, especially if you want to have an early swearing in. The swearing in really dictates everything.
