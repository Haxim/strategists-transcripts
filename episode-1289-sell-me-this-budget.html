            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that yeah yeah straight okay great excellent thank you for for for really juicing the podcast with an extra minute of bullshit we&#39;re gonna move it on to our first segment carter our first segment why the fuck do we still do this this is the catch-all segment steven carter cory hogan that i put in stories of the day that are not Not necessarily stories of the day, but I ask you guys, the wizards, the sages of political strategy, ask you about a particular political policy point, a political practice that has become conventional wisdom, something that we see every now and then, but we just don&#39;t spend enough time on to maybe dissect whether it is a good idea or not, whether it is something that we value or we don&#39;t. It just so happens that it happens. Carter, I&#39;ve got another example to bring us to today. We have a by-election happening tomorrow in Durham. That&#39;s not the focus of this. The conservatives are more than likely going to win. Jamil Javani, the Tory candidate, is more than likely going to be the next MP from Durham. It&#39;s been a seat held by the conservatives for a very long time. time. What interests me, Carter, is the liberal candidate. You guys don&#39;t need to know anything about him, other than the fact that his name is Robert Rugg. He&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Carter, he flirted before becoming the liberal candidate, he flirted with seeking the conservative nomination in the riding. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And my question to you guys is, we&#39;ve seen this a few times, that there&#39;s a candidate that one party picks up and it comes out, or they voluntarily voluntarily disclose it. Like, I was thinking about the other party, just so you know, right? I was thinking about the other side was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">fuck do we still do this, is my question. Is this helpful to anybody? Is this helpful to the candidate? Because you could think of this in a couple of ways. One way is that, oh, I was wanted by a lot of parties, but with our sort of greater sort of delta between our political parties these days, is it even useful to kind of say that I was being courted by multiple sides? Carter, Carter, why the fuck do we still do this is my question. This could be a short and or a very long segment. I&#39;ll leave that up to the two of you.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, it&#39;s because there&#39;s an infinite amount of stupidity in politics. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">mean, could you imagine, you know, like you&#39;re going to the altar, right? You&#39;re about to get married and you say at the altar, oh, I could have married any number of women, but I chose you.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">some level that&#39;s better. To be clear, you guys were at my wedding and I did. You did do that. I did say to my first wife what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">what I did, which</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">which was actually correct. I still got in shit for it, but it was correct. Carter, keep going with your point.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, no, I&#39;m just, that was it. That was the whole point. That was the whole</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">all there is left. So to be clear,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you feel like either a campaign or a party or a candidate disclosing and perhaps celebrating the fact that they were wanted by others, it doesn&#39;t help strategically. Or</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Or is it situationally?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">no, because it basically says I am a political whore. I will go wherever someone wants me and I will go to the highest bidder. It&#39;s exactly how we got Corey on the podcast.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, no, it&#39;s true. I was going to be on the Hurley. I can be on the Hurley Burley. You just you just fucking say it. And tomorrow&#39;s episode, I&#39;m there. I&#39;m definitely not there. Corey, now, in this particular case, I want to give Robert Rock, you know, the full scope of his comments, right? Right. He said, listen, I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the conservatives. They were moving hard. Right. Et cetera. Like most people would kind of see the writing on that wall when you would be considering the nomination for that party. But he said, you know, the liberals align to my values. But, Corey, same question to you. Why the fuck do we still do this? Is it actually a helpful political practice? Is it a strategic one? What do you think?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Can be. Can be. So, listen, there&#39;s I can think of three reasons right off the top of my head why you might do this. One of them we&#39;ve already kind of talked about. But it&#39;s the ego getting in the way. They think they&#39;re such a big deal. They need you to know they&#39;re a big deal, that they had other options, right? So that&#39;s number one.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Number two, getting more into the forgivable and understandable space is to say, I&#39;m a moderate, you know? I&#39;m not one of those crazy liberals. I&#39;m a liberal who could have been a conservative in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But, you know, I&#39;m a moderate. And so you, the good voters of Durham, you can vote for me. I know you usually vote conservative. I have those conservative values, but I&#39;m voting liberal because they&#39;re too crazy. So that&#39;s number two. And the third is actually a word that came out of your lips already, Zane. Disclosure. If he was actually talking to the conservatives at any point along the way, it&#39;s a ready-made attack for them to say, yeah, he&#39;s a political whore. He was just going to go run for us until we didn&#39;t want him, until we got Jamil Javani. So now he&#39;s going to run for the liberals. so he&#39;s defanged that by disclosing like one of the things that we always say in the green</span>

            <span class="text">you can run if you&#39;ve had a bankruptcy you can run if there was some sort of like weird academic fraud at some point in your past as long long as it&#39;s part of your story, and it&#39;s been addressed, and it&#39;s been disclosed, right? And so if you are sitting there, and you&#39;re contemplating running for the liberals, and you fill out all of the paperwork, and you say, full disclosure, I was also talking to the conservatives at one point, it&#39;s not crazy to me that a campaign organizer of some sort would say, that&#39;s fine, but it needs to be disclosed, so that we can get out ahead of it. And you can use it as a bit of an attack on them, as he&#39;s done there. So those are the three reasons that I immediately... Because Corey&#39;s kind of a little bit more aligned</span>

Yeah, that&#39;s just the headlines. Those are just the extractions. Carter, we have a new budget. It projects a $367 million surplus here in Alberta, I should say, but we&#39;ll also borrow cash to meet those obligations that they have outlined. line. The average Albertan likely doesn&#39;t have time to shift through the hundreds of pages of financial tables, but it includes the income tax delay, the election promise, the taxes that I mentioned on vaping, smoking, and electric vehicles, specifically a $200 tax to apply to electric vehicles to make up for the fact that they don&#39;t pay the fuel tax, and a new levy for land titles registration as well. But Corey, the headline is really the fact that there&#39;s a spending cut. When you look into the fact that Alberta will grow, population will grow, inflation adds current numbers when you take the government for their word, there&#39;s a spending cut. And the reason I know this is because of you. You&#39;ve done a lot of tables. You&#39;ve done a lot of math. You&#39;ve kind of put this out on Twitter. So, Corey, maybe start us from where you want to start us in terms of your analysis of the budget. And then I want to get into a bit of strategy</span>

And if a government doesn&#39;t want you to understand what that means, it&#39;s pretty easy for the government to hide what that means. But when you do that math, when you say, okay, well, what are we expected to grow by? And those numbers are in the budget. If we say, well, what do we expect inflation to be? And those numbers are in the budget, it starts to tell a story of an austerity that I don&#39;t think the government wanted us to be talking about, and certainly not one that they wanted to be be putting in the front window and so i&#39;ll give you kind of the top lines here in 2024 dollars like if you want to adjust things for inflation the government is spending per albertan you</span>

You know, there&#39;s nothing quite like being in the second quarter and being absolutely shocked that you&#39;ve got a $5 billion surplus. How many times have we seen it, Corey? I mean, almost every time that oil goes up in price, we get a significant bump in the amount of money that comes into the treasury, especially now that we&#39;ve reached payout on so many projects. I mean, look at those bitumen numbers they&#39;re you know bitumen royalties are over 12 billion dollars except they were report you know they were forecast to be over 14 million so we&#39;re</span>

You&#39;ve got one guy who works for the Edmonton Journal, who understands Excel, bring them to the lockup and get them to do it for the entire press corps. In a rapidly growing province, even with moderate inflation, it can look like they&#39;re spending more and they can be gutting the place. Like they can be taking the copper out of the wires. Now that said, I don&#39;t know that this spin is going to be sustainable over the next three years. They can&#39;t hide this. People are going to see it in their kids&#39; classrooms when they walk in and say, Jesus, there&#39;s 40 people in here. People are going to see it in the ER waiting rooms. They are going to hear the horror stories out there. It&#39;s not the kind of thing you can hide from because the one thing we haven&#39;t mentioned here yet is it&#39;s already in pretty bad state. The, uh, the amount of spending on K to 12 is already per student, the lowest in the country. And it&#39;s going to go lower now. It&#39;s going to go lower now. And you can&#39;t hide that forever. It&#39;s like if it&#39;s like, Like if your kitchen&#39;s on fire, you can&#39;t hide that forever to the guests that are sitting in the living room. So I think that&#39;s a reality that this government is going to have to contend with within this election cycle. So I certainly, if I were them, hey, congratulations, pretty good communications job.

One is people will see it. So like, we don&#39;t have to actually spend a lot of our time oxygen right now.

They got away with it on week one, quote unquote, right? You can&#39;t let them get away with it. And then the other sort of school of thought is, you know, it&#39;s a bit of both, right? You chip away at what&#39;s important now and then once people feel it, you bring in another wave and say, it&#39;s what we told you so. Go back to, you know, previous comments. We&#39;ve been on this beat for a while. How would you start thinking about this? And not to say that the media is the natural sort of opposition they&#39;re not right like they&#39;re but they&#39;re the accountability mechanism and the official opposition how would you start thinking about it around which questions you&#39;d ask and when and and how carter well</span>

And like I worked for the government for four of these budgets that we&#39;re talking about here. And it made me want to light my hair on fire there too. But, you know, Treasury Board really loved it. We always put it in there. And it&#39;s this chart about Alberta&#39;s tax advantage, the Alberta advantage over other provinces here. I want to paint a bit of a picture, especially for our non-Alberta listeners, but I actually think it&#39;s important for our Alberta listeners, too. In our budget, we brag that all of our taxes, all of our fees, everything put together, they</span>

No, because the conservatives themselves are the ones who passed the law that says that it&#39;s got to go to referendum. And I mean, that&#39;s a big lift.

I think this is an interesting conversation when you&#39;re trying to refocus a bunch of spin. You clearly don&#39;t have the resources of the government. You have a leadership race, but you don&#39;t have the resources of the government to counter spin and change weather patterns like they&#39;re trying to.

It was clearly engineered to get people calling Stephen Carter and then laughing on the phone, which is what I did after you didn&#39;t pick up my call. But as it relates to what it was trying to be, and to be clear, it is also a $200 tax, which is what it is, but there&#39;s also political calculus to it. Are you in or out in terms of of what it was trying to do for the UCP.</span>

            <span class="text">Listen, I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a crazy policy. It is true that I don&#39;t pay any fuel taxes as an EV driver. Now, in Alberta, they just go into general revenue. They don&#39;t actually pay for roads directly. And most jurisdictions say, hey, that&#39;s a cool incentive. That&#39;ll help get people onto EVs. If Alberta doesn&#39;t want to do that, that&#39;s fine. But I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly punitive. I did kind of napkin calculations. And while I don&#39;t think that I would have been spending the equivalent of $200 if I were driving a truck, you know, it was close enough. It was like 150 bucks or something like that. So whatever. It actually doesn&#39;t bother me very much. I</span>

I want to see the people driving their F-250 super duties have to pay this thing. I want to see, you know, everybody have to make the choice about how many axles they have and what the impact is. If we want to be consistent with this policy, I&#39;m all in on this policy. I think it actually makes a great amount of sense that on registration, you pay for these kinds of things, but let&#39;s fucking do it, right?
