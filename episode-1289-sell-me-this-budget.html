        <p>Zain. Stephen and Corey get together to talk about the Durham by-election, the Alberta Budget and how two out of three of them had brunch yesterday.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about candidates bragging about almost joining other parties before discussing Alberta's Budget - the sneaky austerity, how it's framed and the downstream consequences. Are there any good reasons for candidates to talk publicly about almost joining other parties? Did Danielle Smith get away with framing austerity as investment? Or is this budget all about "two unrelated facts"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

It just so happens that it happens. Carter, I&#39;ve got another example to bring us to today. We have a by-election happening tomorrow in Durham. That&#39;s not the focus of this. The conservatives are more than likely going to win. Jamil Javani, the Tory candidate, is more than likely going to be the next MP from Durham.

One way is that, oh, I was wanted by a lot of parties, but with our sort of greater sort of delta between our political parties these days, is it even useful to kind of say that I was being courted by multiple sides? Carter, Carter, why the fuck do we still do this is my question. This could be a short and or a very long segment. I&#39;ll leave that up to the two of you.</div>

I&#39;m definitely not there. Corey, now, in this particular case, I want to give Robert Rock, you know, the full scope of his comments, right? Right. He said, listen, I wasn&#39;t comfortable with the conservatives. They were moving hard. Right. Et cetera. Like most people would kind of see the writing on that wall when you would be considering the nomination for that party. But he said, you know, the liberals align to my values. But, Corey, same question to you. Why the fuck do we still do this? Is it actually a helpful political practice? Is it a strategic one? What do you think?</div>

          <div class="said">Can be. Can be. So, listen, there&#39;s I can think of three reasons right off the top of my head why you might do this. One of them we&#39;ve already kind of talked about. But it&#39;s the ego getting in the way. They think they&#39;re such a big deal. They need you to know they&#39;re a big deal, that they had other options, right? So that&#39;s number one.</div>

          <div class="said">Number two, getting more into the forgivable and understandable space is to say, I&#39;m a moderate, you know? I&#39;m not one of those crazy liberals. I&#39;m a liberal who could have been a conservative in</div>

I have those conservative values, but I&#39;m voting liberal because they&#39;re too crazy. So that&#39;s number two. And the third is actually a word that came out of your lips already, Zane. Disclosure. If he was actually talking to the conservatives at any point along the way, it&#39;s a ready-made attack for them to say, yeah, he&#39;s a political whore. He was just going to go run for us until we didn&#39;t want him, until we got Jamil Javani. So now he&#39;s going to run for the liberals. so he&#39;s defanged that by disclosing like one of the things that we always say in the green</div>

And so if you are sitting there, and you&#39;re contemplating running for the liberals, and you fill out all of the paperwork, and you say, full disclosure, I was also talking to the conservatives at one point, it&#39;s not crazy to me that a campaign organizer of some sort would say, that&#39;s fine, but it needs to be disclosed, so that we can get out ahead of it. And you can use it as a bit of an attack on them, as he&#39;s done there. So those are the three reasons that I immediately... Because Corey&#39;s kind of a little bit more aligned</div>

So if you are not going to win, don&#39;t you just want a partisan? Don&#39;t you just want someone who kind of bleeds red in some ways rather than the guy that&#39;s like, yeah, I could have gone to the other side sort of thing. Fuck, I may go to the other side after the end of this thing. Fuck it, I&#39;m here for 30 days, so who the hell knows? Now, of course, he hasn&#39;t said that, right? But I&#39;m kind of extrapolating this case.

Yeah, that&#39;s just the headlines. Those are just the extractions. Carter, we have a new budget. It projects a $367 million surplus here in Alberta, I should say, but we&#39;ll also borrow cash to meet those obligations that they have outlined. line. The average Albertan likely doesn&#39;t have time to shift through the hundreds of pages of financial tables, but it includes the income tax delay, the election promise, the taxes that I mentioned on vaping, smoking, and electric vehicles, specifically a $200 tax to apply to electric vehicles to make up for the fact that they don&#39;t pay the fuel tax, and a new levy for land titles registration as well. But Corey, the headline is really the fact that there&#39;s a spending cut. When you look into the fact that Alberta will grow, population will grow, inflation adds current numbers when you take the government for their word, there&#39;s a spending cut. And the reason I know this is because of you. You&#39;ve done a lot of tables. You&#39;ve done a lot of math. You&#39;ve kind of put this out on Twitter. So, Corey, maybe start us from where you want to start us in terms of your analysis of the budget. And then I want to get into a bit of strategy</div>

And if a government doesn&#39;t want you to understand what that means, it&#39;s pretty easy for the government to hide what that means. But when you do that math, when you say, okay, well, what are we expected to grow by? And those numbers are in the budget. If we say, well, what do we expect inflation to be? And those numbers are in the budget, it starts to tell a story of an austerity that I don&#39;t think the government wanted us to be talking about, and certainly not one that they wanted to be be putting in the front window and so i&#39;ll give you kind of the top lines here in 2024 dollars like if you want to adjust things for inflation the government is spending per albertan you</div>

You&#39;ve got one guy who works for the Edmonton Journal, who understands Excel, bring them to the lockup and get them to do it for the entire press corps. In a rapidly growing province, even with moderate inflation, it can look like they&#39;re spending more and they can be gutting the place. Like they can be taking the copper out of the wires. Now that said, I don&#39;t know that this spin is going to be sustainable over the next three years. They can&#39;t hide this. People are going to see it in their kids&#39; classrooms when they walk in and say, Jesus, there&#39;s 40 people in here. People are going to see it in the ER waiting rooms. They are going to hear the horror stories out there. It&#39;s not the kind of thing you can hide from because the one thing we haven&#39;t mentioned here yet is it&#39;s already in pretty bad state. The, uh, the amount of spending on K to 12 is already per student, the lowest in the country. And it&#39;s going to go lower now. It&#39;s going to go lower now. And you can&#39;t hide that forever. It&#39;s like if it&#39;s like, Like if your kitchen&#39;s on fire, you can&#39;t hide that forever to the guests that are sitting in the living room.

You chip away at what&#39;s important now and then once people feel it, you bring in another wave and say, it&#39;s what we told you so. Go back to, you know, previous comments.

Would you be pugilistic or would you look like you&#39;re overreacting if you&#39;re pugilistic? Like, give me your advice on tone here. Like, would you use expletives or would that be over the top? I think this is an interesting conversation when you&#39;re trying to refocus a bunch of spin. You clearly don&#39;t have the resources of the government. You have a leadership race, but you don&#39;t have the resources of the government to counter spin and change weather patterns like they&#39;re trying to.

It was clearly engineered to get people calling Stephen Carter and then laughing on the phone, which is what I did after you didn&#39;t pick up my call. But as it relates to what it was trying to be, and to be clear, it is also a $200 tax, which is what it is, but there&#39;s also political calculus to it. Are you in or out in terms of of what it was trying to do for the UCP.</div>

          <div class="said">Listen, I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a crazy policy. It is true that I don&#39;t pay any fuel taxes as an EV driver. Now, in Alberta, they just go into general revenue. They don&#39;t actually pay for roads directly. And most jurisdictions say, hey, that&#39;s a cool incentive. That&#39;ll help get people onto EVs. If Alberta doesn&#39;t want to do that, that&#39;s fine. But I actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly punitive. I did kind of napkin calculations. And while I don&#39;t think that I would have been spending the equivalent of $200 if I were driving a truck, you know, it was close enough. It was like 150 bucks or something like that. So whatever. It actually doesn&#39;t bother me very much. I</div>

I want to see the people driving their F-250 super duties have to pay this thing. I want to see, you know, everybody have to make the choice about how many axles they have and what the impact is. If we want to be consistent with this policy, I&#39;m all in on this policy. I think it actually makes a great amount of sense that on registration, you pay for these kinds of things, but let&#39;s fucking do it, right? Now that&#39;s the policy in terms of bait wonderful bait because what they&#39;re doing is actually pretty reasonable see my previous comments and so anybody who freaks out too much about it just looks like an entitled smug cocktail environment electric people owning that&#39;s why</div>

It&#39;s so interesting to see some of these tributes on the Sunday morning programs or even later in the day on Thursday when it was announced that he had passed to kind of see the Globe and Mail had put out an accidental tweet talking about his, I think the word was contentious or divisive. Other people thought it was NAFTA and free trade, the GST. Some people People thought it&#39;d be what it&#39;d be afterwards and his sort of statesman-like behavior. But for Stephen Carter, longtime political observer, longtime political strategist, what is the Mulroney legacy for you?</div>

Obviously, NAFTA. Obviously, his environmentalism. You know, there are so many things you can say about him. Obviously, the GST, the fucking collapse of the PCs that followed with Kim Campbell. All of this can be laid at his feet. He was a very, very impactful prime minister. He was a very important prime minister. I think I&#39;ve said on this show, I think the two most important prime ministers of my lifetime were Mulroney and Trudeau the Younger, only because I was born after the big drama of Trudeau the Elder.
