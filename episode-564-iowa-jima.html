            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Just because I hate you. Our first segment, Iowa what? What the hell happened last night? I know, Corey, you&#39;re revving up going. So let&#39;s give people some context, right? Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. The Iowa caucuses were last night. This is the first actual votes cast in the U.S. primaries. Now, that&#39;s not even. You&#39;re using</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">using the word vote loosely. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s not even that true. So what happens in a caucus state to differentiate between caucuses and primaries in the United States? And there&#39;s a whole grab bag of different ways they select delegates to choose their party&#39;s candidate. But in a caucus state, you are getting together almost like a party meeting. You&#39;re electing somebody up. And in this case, those people you&#39;re electing are then going to your county convention who are electing people who are going to your state convention who are going to be determining your delegates for the presidency. So it&#39;s a bit removed. And so all of the counts that you saw last night were not</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">not that important, except for in the momentum game, which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get to in a second. Now, in fact, four years ago, there was kind of an embarrassing situation where the winner of Iowa a couple of weeks later turned out they did not get the most delegates. So that does happen. And there is some question as to whether or not just because somebody squeaks out in either the votes as the Republicans show their votes or the delegates that are elected locally as the Democrats do, they don&#39;t release their vote totals. Whether that will actually be reflective of the number of delegates at the end of the day remains to be seen. It actually should be pretty familiar to Canadians who ever were involved in a delegated leadership convention. Very similar. And so there are alternates and there are whether or not people show up to convention and all these other considerations, which will ultimately determine the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the number of delegates Iowa sends for either Sanders or Clinton or Rubio or Trump or whatever. I&#39;m going to call Trump whatever because he doesn&#39;t deserve a human name. And from</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">from there, I think we just have to say, that&#39;s great. So let&#39;s just talk about momentum, because that&#39;s really all that anybody else in the United States or Canada cares about when they think of Iowa. Okay,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so that&#39;s exactly what I want to talk about here. We&#39;ll discuss the results a little bit more. Stephen, I&#39;ll let you tee people up on that. But the discussion on this segment is about the strategy of momentum and how the respective candidates on both the GOP and the DNC side take this momentum going forward. And I&#39;d love to get your guys&#39; thoughts on what momentum is. Is it something that you just find? Is it something you create? And we&#39;ll talk about that in a second. But before we do, let&#39;s tee up where the situation stands today.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Bernie Sanders, Corey, you know, was not supposed to play in Iowa, was supposed to play. What does that look like? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it depends on your frame of reference. As of nine months ago, he absolutely was not supposed to play. If you said a week ago, I mean, there was a CNN poll that showed him up almost 10 points. So he was supposed to play. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And last night ends up in a virtual tie, 49.8% for Clinton, 49.6% for Sanders, effectively a virtual tie. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, we&#39;re using percents kind of loosely, because again, it&#39;s not votes, it&#39;s delegates elected. And that was the breakdown. But I mean, Clinton got six of her delegates through coin tosses. That&#39;s how close it was. If those coin tosses had even just broken based, you know, statistically average, each of them winning half of them, Sanders would have won. I mean, that&#39;s how close it was. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Stephen, let&#39;s talk about momentum on the other side, the GOP side. We had Ted Cruz winning by four points over Donald Trump or also known as whatever. And Marco Rubio declaring effectively victory by coming in third place as now the institutional non-Trump, non-Cruz candidate. Anything you want to add on commentary on that? Well, this is the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the beauty of these processes. You don&#39;t have to win to win. You can come in second, you can come in third. I mean, this was actually the Nenshi strategy. We didn&#39;t care about winning the election at the beginning. What you wanted to do is you actually wanted to be in third place. If we could be in third place by the time September rolled around and a municipal election that was going to be held in the middle of October, we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we wanted right after Labor Day there to be polls, and those polls would come out having Nenshi in third place.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Third place obviously isn&#39;t winning, but third place puts you in a different type of conversation. If you&#39;re sitting down at the bottom of the field, if you&#39;re sitting where Santorum or Chris Christie or Mike Huckabee, those people are going to have a very difficult time translating this, especially if they don&#39;t perform well in New Hampshire. So their momentum is nonexistent, especially Huckabee and Santorum, both of whom have won the Iowa caucuses before. So you&#39;ve got a situation where people who&#39;ve won have shown tremendous negative momentum. And I think you&#39;re going to see candidates on the Republican side start dropping out relatively quickly when their money is going to run out now. Right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right. So I think you make a great segue there. And I should note that Iowa, as much as we provide importance to it, hasn&#39;t necessarily been that great of a bellwether. We haven&#39;t seen nominee Santorum or Huckabee show up in the last two cycles. But at the same time, there&#39;s something to discuss here around momentum. Do you not agree, Steve? You wanted to chime in on something. thing well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i mean i don&#39;t think either new hampshire nor iowa are necessarily good bellwethers like the winners of those of those um caucuses or in the new hampshire state the the primary those don&#39;t necessarily uh go on to win the election they don&#39;t necessarily even go on to win the the the the battle but they do start winning money yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right so they are going to be more uh in the game it&#39;s second and third place that are really the ones that you have to put and watch closely sanders came in second right but it was a really close second now did he fall 10 points like cory mentioned before that there was a pull out uh you know a week ago saying</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">he fall 10 points that&#39;s what the clinton people made us believe right so the clinton people for which obviously cory&#39;s an agent because he was talking about how great sanders was going to do every</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">reasonable human being would say that was amazing but the spin today is this was actually a victory for hillary because her ground game was obviously much stronger than people thought because she was able to stop the upsurge of bernie sanders and that&#39;s the win oh that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s the game no No, no, no. That&#39;s spin. And we&#39;ll see if that gets spun out the way you&#39;re talking. Oh, I&#39;m sorry.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fact is the one</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one poll that showed Sanders up 10 points was an outlier. And in fact, the poll of polls, the average showed Hillary Clinton up by three points. Right. That&#39;s not what happened at the end of the day. So, yeah, he still outperformed expectations. I do have to tip my cap to the Clinton campaign. It is amazing to me that we are sitting here talking about whether or not this is bad for Sanders. Sanders got – Sanders took on the establishment. Hillary Clinton had this thing locked up. You talk about money. You talk about organizers. You talk about it all. Those were all things that were in Hillary Clinton&#39;s corner and yet somehow Sanders pulled it to a drop. Like honestly, we&#39;re talking about coin tosses where the difference between winning or quote-unquote losing that state last night. Totally amazing. But it is a good lesson in momentum and expectation setting because – well, it&#39;s funny, right? Like Rubio won by coming in third. Trump</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and coming in second. So that&#39;s – Corey, you make a great point. And I know we want to talk more specifically about this, but let&#39;s talk about that formula for momentum. It&#39;s the combination of expectation setting. What else goes into it in</span>

The difference between a successful campaign and a failing campaign is a successful campaign is one that understands how momentum will be created and how momentum will matter.

So you&#39;ve got the highest population of people who care are your activists. Then your money is paying attention. So when you don&#39;t meet expectations, those two groups are let down.

            <span class="text">Interesting. Corey, here&#39;s what I&#39;m hearing on momentum. Number one, it&#39;s expectations. You have to ensure that you&#39;re not over-promising and under-delivering. So expectations is one. Number two, I&#39;m also hearing it&#39;s a framing thing where both people can get one delegate or you can get the same, yet you can really position it. I want to understand what are the other universals that go into momentum. When you&#39;re on that campaign trail, trail. Whether you&#39;re Steven who&#39;s trying to create momentum, and I&#39;m not going to put this badly, or you&#39;re Corey trying to fight against that momentum when you&#39;re in that 2012 campaign.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you talk about expectations. The fact is, it&#39;s just, are you moving away or towards expectations? That&#39;s the nature of momentum. And at some point, you swing past them. And that&#39;s That&#39;s when you&#39;re really in trouble if it&#39;s on the downswing. And that&#39;s where Trump has to worry about right now. But beyond that, it&#39;s a fairly simple concept. I do think it&#39;s interesting, though, that, you</span>

Stephen Carter, let&#39;s talk about leveraging momentum, because this is something we briefly touched on. You&#39;re Marco Rubio right now. You stand there giving a very Barack Obama-esque speech, saying that you&#39;re going to now bring life to the Republican Party. You are the institutional, non-Trump, non-Cruz candidate. How does someone like him leverage this momentum going forward?</span>

They&#39;re building him up to fail and this is the problem with momentum. Marco Rubio has to move as quickly as humanly possible to to become the single candidate but if he moves too much he&#39;s going to find himself in the exact same spot as trump see what happens is when the media elevate you up to that star status</span>

But that was really over the top, and that does risk setting expectations sky high. The establishment might say, our lord and savior, he&#39;s managed to come and protect the Republican Party from the wolves. But he lost to the two wolves. Yeah, yeah. First place, Cruz. Second place, Trump. Combined vote, well over 50%.

We do that every single day in the province of Alberta where we take money from essentially the big cities and we redistribute it to rural Alberta where they don&#39;t have the taxation base to support their school systems.

It has nothing to do with whether you live in Quebec or whether you live in Alberta. Everybody pays the same federal taxes. And so when we talk about what&#39;s this giant transfer payments or better yet equalization, first of all, we&#39;re conflating those two things. Equalization last year, or I guess this fiscal year, is $17 billion.</span>

            <span class="text">Is that less than the $3,000 or so that Quebec got? Yeah, it is. But again, keeping in mind the gross domestic product, we didn&#39;t get any equalization, but we got the same amount of money that everybody else got for health care. We got the same amount of money that everybody else got for other programs like the Canadian Social Transfer. This is – the only thing that we were different in is equalization. It&#39;s only $17 billion of the budget. It&#39;s like – it&#39;s a fraction of the overall spending and it&#39;s designed to help areas that are disadvantaged be able to provide the same services that we get in the advantaged areas.

It&#39;s distribution. It&#39;s not like the money was given to us and then we have to give it to somebody else. That&#39;s redistribution. This is just the federal government deciding to put more money into different areas of the country. It never hits Alberta accounts. You can&#39;t say Quebec has to give back equalization because if they were giving it back, they would be giving it to the federal government, not to Alberta. And you know what? I think that if the equalization program was not based on provinces but like on metropolitan areas or something, people wouldn&#39;t even know to be mad about it. But there&#39;s this sense that provinces get it and therefore it&#39;s a bad thing. But Stephen&#39;s right. Every province does a form of equalization. Every country sort of does a form of equalization. Every</span>

Fundamentally, though, I do wish that – I can&#39;t give too high of a mark if it came to that conclusion after that much time. Like if this had been what they rolled out in late November or December, I would have said, oh, man, home run all across the board except for the fact that I still believe in my heart of hearts that we need to be charging higher oil royalties. Just to hear that we are competitive with other regimes doesn&#39;t say that we&#39;re getting our fair share. That just means we&#39;re in a race to the bottom and we don&#39;t want to lose it.</span>
