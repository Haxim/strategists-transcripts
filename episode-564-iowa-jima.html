        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about political momentum and Iowa caucuses before a hard pivot to equalization payments. When is victory contextual? How much can you control the context? And who has the more on-point but off-topic rant - Stephen or Corey? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, that&#39;s not even that true. So what happens in a caucus state to differentiate between caucuses and primaries in the United States? And there&#39;s a whole grab bag of different ways they select delegates to choose their party&#39;s candidate. But in a caucus state, you are getting together almost like a party meeting. You&#39;re electing somebody up. And in this case, those people you&#39;re electing are then going to your county convention who are electing people who are going to your state convention who are going to be determining your delegates for the presidency. So it&#39;s a bit removed. And so all of the counts that you saw last night were not</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">not that important, except for in the momentum game, which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get to in a second. Now, in fact, four years ago, there was kind of an embarrassing situation where the winner of Iowa a couple of weeks later turned out they did not get the most delegates. So that does happen. And there is some question as to whether or not just because somebody squeaks out in either the votes as the Republicans show their votes or the delegates that are elected locally as the Democrats do, they don&#39;t release their vote totals. Whether that will actually be reflective of the number of delegates at the end of the day remains to be seen. It actually should be pretty familiar to Canadians who ever were involved in a delegated leadership convention. Very similar. And so there are alternates and there are whether or not people show up to convention and all these other considerations, which will ultimately determine the</div>

          <div class="said">Okay, so that&#39;s exactly what I want to talk about here. We&#39;ll discuss the results a little bit more. Stephen, I&#39;ll let you tee people up on that. But the discussion on this segment is about the strategy of momentum and how the respective candidates on both the GOP and the DNC side take this momentum going forward. And I&#39;d love to get your guys&#39; thoughts on what momentum is. Is it something that you just find? Is it something you create? And we&#39;ll talk about that in a second. But before we do, let&#39;s tee up where the situation stands today.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, we&#39;re using percents kind of loosely, because again, it&#39;s not votes, it&#39;s delegates elected. And that was the breakdown. But I mean, Clinton got six of her delegates through coin tosses. That&#39;s how close it was. If those coin tosses had even just broken based, you know, statistically average, each of them winning half of them, Sanders would have won. I mean, that&#39;s how close it was. And</div>

          <div class="said">And Stephen, let&#39;s talk about momentum on the other side, the GOP side. We had Ted Cruz winning by four points over Donald Trump or also known as whatever. And Marco Rubio declaring effectively victory by coming in third place as now the institutional non-Trump, non-Cruz candidate. Anything you want to add on commentary on that? Well, this is the</div>

          <div class="said">the beauty of these processes. You don&#39;t have to win to win. You can come in second, you can come in third. I mean, this was actually the Nenshi strategy. We didn&#39;t care about winning the election at the beginning. What you wanted to do is you actually wanted to be in third place. If we could be in third place by the time September rolled around and a municipal election that was going to be held in the middle of October, we</div>

          <div class="said">we wanted right after Labor Day there to be polls, and those polls would come out having Nenshi in third place.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Third place obviously isn&#39;t winning, but third place puts you in a different type of conversation. If you&#39;re sitting down at the bottom of the field, if you&#39;re sitting where Santorum or Chris Christie or Mike Huckabee, those people are going to have a very difficult time translating this, especially if they don&#39;t perform well in New Hampshire. So their momentum is nonexistent, especially Huckabee and Santorum, both of whom have won the Iowa caucuses before. So you&#39;ve got a situation where people who&#39;ve won have shown tremendous negative momentum. And I think you&#39;re going to see candidates on the Republican side start dropping out relatively quickly when their money is going to run out now. Right.</div>

          <div class="said">Right. So I think you make a great segue there. And I should note that Iowa, as much as we provide importance to it, hasn&#39;t necessarily been that great of a bellwether. We haven&#39;t seen nominee Santorum or Huckabee show up in the last two cycles. But at the same time, there&#39;s something to discuss here around momentum. Do you not agree, Steve? You wanted to chime in on something. thing well</div>

It is amazing to me that we are sitting here talking about whether or not this is bad for Sanders. Sanders got – Sanders took on the establishment. Hillary Clinton had this thing locked up. You talk about money. You talk about organizers. You talk about it all. Those were all things that were in Hillary Clinton&#39;s corner and yet somehow Sanders pulled it to a drop. Like honestly, we&#39;re talking about coin tosses where the difference between winning or quote-unquote losing that state last night. Totally amazing.

You have to ensure that you&#39;re not over-promising and under-delivering. So expectations is one. Number two, I&#39;m also hearing it&#39;s a framing thing where both people can get one delegate or you can get the same, yet you can really position it. I want to understand what are the other universals that go into momentum. When you&#39;re on that campaign trail, trail. Whether you&#39;re Steven who&#39;s trying to create momentum, and I&#39;m not going to put this badly, or you&#39;re Corey trying to fight against that momentum when you&#39;re in that 2012 campaign.</div>

We got the same amount of money that everybody else got for other programs like the Canadian Social Transfer. This is – the only thing that we were different in is equalization. It&#39;s only $17 billion of the budget.

It&#39;s distribution. It&#39;s not like the money was given to us and then we have to give it to somebody else. That&#39;s redistribution. This is just the federal government deciding to put more money into different areas of the country. It never hits Alberta accounts. You can&#39;t say Quebec has to give back equalization because if they were giving it back, they would be giving it to the federal government, not to Alberta. And you know what? I think that if the equalization program was not based on provinces but like on metropolitan areas or something, people wouldn&#39;t even know to be mad about it. But there&#39;s this sense that provinces get it and therefore it&#39;s a bad thing. But Stephen&#39;s right. Every province does a form of equalization.
