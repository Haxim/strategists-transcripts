We were in a stage one kind of recovery that moved to stage two, which was a partial stage two because we didn&#39;t have the numbers that we&#39;d said we needed at the beginning in order to make that stage two happen. But Jason Kennedy was so hellbent on recovery, on the economic recovery, that he enabled us to move faster than perhaps we should have. And then he&#39;s moved us back into stage one.

            <div class="said">We&#39;re all going to take personal responsibility. In some fashion, things are going to work out. It hasn&#39;t worked, right? He&#39;s, you know, he&#39;s been wearing his mask. You know, Minister Shandro pumps the hand sanitizer every time he&#39;s about to speak, every time he&#39;s taking off his mask. It&#39;s all very performative, but it is not changing behavior. It is signaling, It is sending a signal out there, but it is not finding an audience that wants to hear it. And I suspect that the suspension of the legislature is going to be just another performative element that does not land with any specific audience because it&#39;s not actually impacting my life. It doesn&#39;t change things for me. You know why? We talk all the time about trying to find things that actually change things for people, and this is performative. It does not change anything for me, right? It&#39;d be like the premier saying, I am not going to eat vegetables for the next six months out of solidarity with the beef industry. It&#39;s not going to change my behavior. The Jordan Peterson diet, Carter. Yeah, it&#39;s not going to change my behavior, but it may change his. He might get more grumpy, I suspect. Anyways, I mean, these things don&#39;t matter to me. What I&#39;m thinking this actually signals, what my thinking is behind this, is he actually thinks things are going to get better in two weeks. He actually thinks that if we just stay out of the legislature for two more weeks, things are going to get better and we&#39;re not going to have to deal with the opposition and Rachel Notley taking us to task. I&#39;m not going to have to deal with the COVID-18 because keep in mind, he knows the right things to do. He knows what to do. He just knows that it&#39;s unpalatable to his base and therefore he will not do it. That is not a complex model for him. He has just made a choice that he would rather not deal with his party splitting in two. And I think that that&#39;s a massive abdication of leadership.</div>

There&#39;ll be enough cynics around saying, yeah, sure, we know why he really doesn&#39;t want to be here. But obviously, it is all part of a package, and it reinforces exactly what he&#39;s been saying. So when, you know, he doesn&#39;t have, let&#39;s just say there&#39;s a couple of caucus meetings by Zoom over the next couple of weeks, and people are saying, well, we&#39;re not talking enough. He says, well, yeah, because I told you, this is deathly serious, and I&#39;m very busy right now, as is the Minister of Health, as is everybody else around here. I think it&#39;s really important we stay connected. I&#39;m talking to the caucus chair every day.

The COVID-18 in your caucus, those rural constituents, what would that require from a behavioral change perspective? And you might even touch a bit into policy, but I know both of you talk about this quite a bit and look at it from this communications, psychology, quasi lens.

I&#39;m going to do everything in my power. And that begins with a real lockdown and a real kick out of the COVID-18. You know, the six people who are in my caucus who can&#39;t get on board with this have left. They are out. We will talk about whether or not we allow them back into the caucus at a later date. For now, I will not be distracted. The people who went to the rodeo, the RCMP are next time authorized to bring in water guns. We are going, you know, not water guns, but the real, the big ones, not the little ones, not the little squirt guns, but the big water guns. You know, we are going to disperse these people because we are taking things seriously and there has to be consequence.

And Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on that.

If you recall, the initial spots that they ran right after he won the leadership was that, you know, we got the true blue guy. And I remember when we recorded that O&#39;Toole time episode, you were, I think, cautioning us back then that that same caricature paintbrush that you put on Scheer doesn&#39;t really work as neatly with O&#39;Toole. This might be, you know, some evidence of that, perhaps.

The team that is developing that is team conservative, they are more zealous and they are more ingrained in politics and they have more fears. And because they bring all of that to the table, they are also more willing to fund. shifting years ago to the small donor model of everything being underneath 1500 and individual donations i&#39;m off on the specifics of the number but i&#39;m not off by much um that is forced that forced the liberals and the conservatives into different styles of fundraising and</div>

It doesn&#39;t favor the conservative two and a half times. It doesn&#39;t favor the conservatives for $5 million over $3 million. And that&#39;s where the problem lies for the liberals right now. Sure, they&#39;re raising $1.5 million more a quarter. That makes total sense. They&#39;re raising $5 million more a quarter. You&#39;ve got a structural problem in your party. And you better figure out how to solve it.

Of course, it was also the election that elected Stephen Harper again and moved the liberals to a distant third. But I want to focus on the NDP for a second. If the NDP, you know, that latent election was perhaps the height of the party over the course of the last decade, if the party had a time machine to go back over the last 10 years, what do you think they would have done differently? Name one thing for me. Would it have been keeping Toml Kerr as their leader? Would it have been moving forward in a particular policy direction? Wouldn&#39;t it have been, you know, some sort of merger with the liberals? What do you think would have made this current reality better for the federal NDP?

This was not just, oh, this is where the red wave is now. Now, there was a legitimate enthusiasm for Jack Layton. That was his time. It was an opportunity where he had connected with Canadians, and it was a moment. It was not fake. It was not exactly what Stephen Carter is claiming here. And it&#39;s been 10 years, so maybe he&#39;s just forgotten. But it was real. It was real from the debates onward. It was real.

But it&#39;s this concept of paid sick leave that seems to be gaining momentum, certainly in Ontario, even Rachel Notley in her message today against Jason Kenney bringing it up. Corey, is this policy, paid sick leave, from its political standpoint, is it overrated or underrated in terms of the mileage it might have have in provincial legislatures and perhaps in the national discourse? So I&#39;m asking you about a policy, but I&#39;m asking you about its politics and its political mileage, overrated or underrated?</div>

This is one of these things where I could kind of flip off a flip answer, but I don&#39;t think I would be doing a service to the issue. Let me argue two points, one for and one against here. On the four, there are a large number of people hundreds of thousands in alberta who would absolutely benefit from such a policy it would also allow for healthier workplaces people wouldn&#39;t feel necessarily like they need to to uh you know come to work you know and cough their way through a day even if we weren&#39;t in covid times right i i think that there&#39;s something to be said for if you&#39;re sick it makes sense that you stay home now on the other side putting aside even the fact that um you know employers would not be that wild about having to pay for this because you know presumably you can structure this and all all sorts of different ways.</div>

I didn&#39;t really see that turn into a lot of votes at the end of the day. And I&#39;m not really quite sure why. But fundamentally, maybe it just comes to this general optimism bias of, well, I was going to get there anyways, or I&#39;m not going to get that sick. And you know, now maybe I&#39;m not going to have a job or the answer. I don&#39;t know. But it seems that these things have not been the absolute vote winners. And maybe it&#39;s a volume question. Maybe the NDP just didn&#39;t talk about it enough. But maybe it&#39;s not. So not sure. Certainly, it would be quite, quite a shift for employers.</div>
