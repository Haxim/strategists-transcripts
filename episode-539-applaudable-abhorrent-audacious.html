            <span class="text">This is The Strategists, episode 539. With me, as always, Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan. Guys, how are you? I&#39;m good. I&#39;m excellent. We are off the heels of recording episode 538 in celebration of the nation down south. How do you think that went, Corey?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I always like talking about our American friends, especially Trump, crazy bastard that he is. But I think on certain instances, we betrayed a bit of an ignorance of our neighbors. Very American</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Very American of us. You were right on point in that sense. In fact, if anybody asks about any of those mistakes we made, any of those omissions we made. We didn&#39;t make them. Well, I&#39;m going to tell you right now, that&#39;s like eating a cheeseburger with a hot dog and potato chips on it. It&#39;s just American.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">opinion. First of all, I mean, I think that our listenership would take an all-Trump episode. And I&#39;m going to ask that our moderator consider that at some point. Because the Trump Express, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going up or down, but it&#39;s going somewhere. Somewhere, for sure. We&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;ll have to cover it at some point. But at the same time, guys, we&#39;ve got a very interesting election happening right now. And I&#39;m calling it that. Frankly, the election has begun. I mean, we were thinking that this summer was going to be summer barbecue season, but the attack ads are out and there&#39;s a lot to cover. So let&#39;s move it right along to our first segment about federal politics called Applaudable, Audacious, or Abhorrent. I&#39;m going to give you six political items that are now in the Zeitgeist federally, and you need to give me your analysis. Are they applaudable, audacious, or abhorrent? Are you ready? We&#39;re good? Okay, let&#39;s do this. First thing right here. Brad Wall&#39;s recent comments at the Council of Federations suggesting that Rachel Notley is handing Quebec a veto vis</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">vis-a-vis the Alberta oil and gas industry through the Alberta&#39;s environmental plan. Corey, I know you&#39;re chomping at the bit, so I&#39;m going to let you go first. Ah, it&#39;s abhorrent.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You had the Premier of Quebec and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and the Premier of Alberta essentially agreeing. You know, Couillard saying, I think I found a partner in Premier Notley. premier notley saying i want to work with you the premier of quebec saying you got to clean up your act though premier not like saying i agree let&#39;s just do this and then brad wall out of nowhere like it&#39;s like he comes up and he&#39;s photobombing almost it&#39;s the political equivalent of this and he just starts making snide remarks about sending money down the pipeline and it&#39;s like why are you spoiling this agreement with a fight what are you doing here carter what do you sit on this i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i think I think it was absolutely audacious for him to stand up and stand essentially right beside Christy Clark, who is essentially created not one veto for</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for the pipeline to go through her funds, but five vetoes. She has put forward five conditions under which she will accept a pipeline, which we know is not true. I mean, she doesn&#39;t have a say in whether or not a pipeline actually happens, but she&#39;s done it anyways. So where&#39;s Premier Brad Wall standing up and saying, no, no, we won&#39;t allow that. that i mean it&#39;s just totally a double standard and it was it to me it&#39;s ridiculous that he did that um so i think it&#39;s audacious that he was that he was able to find it in himself to stand up and make that type of statement cory</span>

            <span class="text">cory what do you think this makes this work and i know you&#39;re you&#39;re clearly not on the side of defending it but clearly there are a lot of people who are both in the media and politically what makes it work or doesn&#39;t make it work there&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">We work in politics, so we know that at some point, regardless of how ignorant you seem to the political class, that things will resonate to everyday people. On that level, Corey, why do you not think a move like this, which has defenders from across the country standing up and applauding Brad Wall, is a good thing, is a good political move, especially in the wake of a very volatile election that could have him potentially looking at leadership of one of the political parties federally?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">federally? Well, and I got to assume that&#39;s why he did it. Not just the money here in Calgary, but to kind of stake ground as the defender of a broader conservative vision. But ultimately, I think when you go down, when you were presented as a politician with the choice of acting the statesman, and let&#39;s be clear, this was a move where the premier of Alberta and the premier of Quebec, neither of which really have a ton of authority in interprovincial pipelines, agreed to play nice and agreed that they would all pretend like they were in charge. But when you decide you can be the statesman and let kind of this politics of aggrandizing your colleagues play out, or you can be a demagogue and start attacking it simply because you know it&#39;ll rile up a base you need in the future, and you choose demagoguery, you are going to reap what you sow, my friend. Because down the road, if you do want to be the prime minister of Canada, if you do want to be the leader of the Conservative Party, you&#39;re going to have to get past this hurdle called 25</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">25% of the votes for leader are from Quebec, and you&#39;ve just decided to crap all over the notion that they have any responsibility. Carter, do people have</span>

There are a series of operators in Quebec that will be disinclined to work for Brad Wall, but Brad Wall was never going to win any votes in Quebec. Brad Wall knows that he&#39;s going to win all of his votes in British Columbia, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan. That&#39;s his whole thing. Maybe he gets a few in Ontario. And that, in the next leadership for the Federal Conservative Party, that&#39;s going to make things interesting. That&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">the Conservatives have continued their attack viciously against Justin Trudeau, despite the fact that Tom Mulcair and the NDP have been in the lead for the last 10 days federally. And this is before the election has even started. So I&#39;ll go with you, Carter, first. Applaudable, audacious, or abhorrent? What do you think of that strategy? It&#39;s applaudable.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">applaudable. I&#39;m on the record saying that the conservative campaign team is the best campaign team in Canada because they write out their game plan probably two years in advance and they execute it page after page after page. And it is consistent and they don&#39;t care what today&#39;s polls say or what the pundits are saying. They execute their plan because they believe that is their best chance to win. Corey? I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s abhorrent. I think that there&#39;s two mistakes people make when it comes to plans in politics. One is not making a plan, and the other is sticking too rigidly to a plan. And if you&#39;re working off a plan you made two years ago, you&#39;re going to get into a lot of trouble at this point. Two years ago, Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau was riding high in the polls. Two years ago, Tom Mulcair was Tom Who. And a lot has changed since then. We now find ourselves in a situation where, and it&#39;s not just the last 10 days, but since the Alberta election, you have seen the New Democrats leading the occasional poll and certainly trending up. Yeah, but the opposite</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">opposite side of that is where you see other political parties, namely the liberals, where they seem to be developing their entire platform based on tomorrow&#39;s polling information. What did we learn in the poll today? Let&#39;s make sure we have a platform for that. Let&#39;s make sure we have a plan for that, for whatever the poll tells us today.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">today. I think you&#39;ve both done a good job highlighting the extremes that are in place, right, between taking a plan that&#39;s developed years or many months in advance versus basing your plan in the moment. But is there, and I think just for a listenership to understand what a political strategy looks like, what is the level of agility a plan needs? Carter, you&#39;re pretty much saying that you believe the conservatives have the best data and the best plan that they wrote, let&#39;s say, many months ago, ergo that they have the best campaign going forward today in this moment with this volatility?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s two things that I think a good strategy includes. Number one is the mathematical method</span>

          <div class="turn">

I understand what they were trying to do when they did things like Bill C-51 and coming out in favor of it, but they&#39;ve been too clever by half with execution, too complicated in execution. They have executed poorly, and I take no joy in that. But I think when you look at a party that was at 40 percent in the polls and leading for a year, you&#39;ve got to ask why they&#39;ve ended up where they are now, and it comes down to execution.
