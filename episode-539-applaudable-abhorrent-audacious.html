Frankly, the election has begun. I mean, we were thinking that this summer was going to be summer barbecue season, but the attack ads are out and there&#39;s a lot to cover. So let&#39;s move it right along to our first segment about federal politics called Applaudable, Audacious, or Abhorrent. I&#39;m going to give you six political items that are now in the Zeitgeist federally, and you need to give me your analysis. Are they applaudable, audacious, or abhorrent? Are you ready? We&#39;re good? Okay, let&#39;s do this. First thing right here. Brad Wall&#39;s recent comments at the Council of Federations suggesting that Rachel Notley is handing Quebec a veto vis</div>

I mean, she doesn&#39;t have a say in whether or not a pipeline actually happens, but she&#39;s done it anyways. So where&#39;s Premier Brad Wall standing up and saying, no, no, we won&#39;t allow that. that i mean it&#39;s just totally a double standard and it was it to me it&#39;s ridiculous that he did that um so i think it&#39;s audacious that he was that he was able to find it in himself to stand up and make that type of statement cory</div>

On that level, Corey, why do you not think a move like this, which has defenders from across the country standing up and applauding Brad Wall, is a good thing, is a good political move, especially in the wake of a very volatile election that could have him potentially looking at leadership of one of the political parties federally?</div>

Not just the money here in Calgary, but to kind of stake ground as the defender of a broader conservative vision. But ultimately, I think when you go down, when you were presented as a politician with the choice of acting the statesman, and let&#39;s be clear, this was a move where the premier of Alberta and the premier of Quebec, neither of which really have a ton of authority in interprovincial pipelines, agreed to play nice and agreed that they would all pretend like they were in charge. But when you decide you can be the statesman and let kind of this politics of aggrandizing your colleagues play out, or you can be a demagogue and start attacking it simply because you know it&#39;ll rile up a base you need in the future, and you choose demagoguery, you are going to reap what you sow, my friend. Because down the road, if you do want to be the prime minister of Canada, if you do want to be the leader of the Conservative Party, you&#39;re going to have to get past this hurdle called 25</div>

There are a series of operators in Quebec that will be disinclined to work for Brad Wall, but Brad Wall was never going to win any votes in Quebec. Brad Wall knows that he&#39;s going to win all of his votes in British Columbia, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan. That&#39;s his whole thing. Maybe he gets a few in Ontario. And that, in the next leadership for the Federal Conservative Party, that&#39;s going to make things interesting. That&#39;s</div>

One is not making a plan, and the other is sticking too rigidly to a plan. And if you&#39;re working off a plan you made two years ago, you&#39;re going to get into a lot of trouble at this point. Two years ago, Pierre Trudeau, Justin Trudeau was riding high in the polls. Two years ago, Tom Mulcair was Tom Who. And a lot has changed since then. We now find ourselves in a situation where, and it&#39;s not just the last 10 days, but since the Alberta election, you have seen the New Democrats leading the occasional poll and certainly trending up.

I think you&#39;ve both done a good job highlighting the extremes that are in place, right, between taking a plan that&#39;s developed years or many months in advance versus basing your plan in the moment. But is there, and I think just for a listenership to understand what a political strategy looks like, what is the level of agility a plan needs? Carter, you&#39;re pretty much saying that you believe the conservatives have the best data and the best plan that they wrote, let&#39;s say, many months ago, ergo that they have the best campaign going forward today in this moment with this volatility?</div>
