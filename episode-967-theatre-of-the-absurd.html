I mean, it wasn&#39;t expensive, but it was confusing and it was logistically complex. So, working with Flair Airlines, we&#39;re happy to announce that anyone, anywhere in Canada where Flair Airlines flies can fly to Abbotsford for free if they book in the month of February and fly before February 28th. Just a little deal that we&#39;ve cooked up for you here. You don&#39;t need any special codes. Our listenership being as vast as it is, Flair agreed that the introduction of, you</div>

You know, one thing I will say is last episode we did provide some feedback to Flair Airlines, our sponsor, about how they could do a better job. Bob, we remember the mean tweets, Carter. I do, I do. I suspect our listeners do as well. Well, this promotion that they have struck with us, the free base fare to Abbotsford, is brilliant because, Stephen Carter, can you actually complain to Flair Airlines when you&#39;re getting a flight for free? It is genius. It is the most gaslighting, perfect move. I have not seen corporate communications and a promotion this clever or this savvy since, oh, I don&#39;t know, Stephen Carter, Zellers, when they had buy one, get one free.</div>

And before I dig into the politics of it, because there&#39;s a lot to unwrap regarding the politics, Carter, let&#39;s talk about the convoy. Let&#39;s talk about just your general thoughts and feelings. I want to start here. You see Saturday and Sunday, freezing temperatures in Ottawa, not the promised witnessed hundreds of thousands of people but a decent sized audience um protesting uh carrying flags of all sorts uh desecration of certain monuments um what was your thought and your feeling from either a political or democratic or cultural or even just like moral perspective when you saw what you did over the course this weekend let&#39;s start here and then Then we&#39;ll jump into the politics thereafter.

Yeah, it&#39;s like, oh, my God, this is just embarrassing for them. And and then they get there and you know that it&#39;s kind of a hodgepodge collection of humanity. humanity um you know you&#39;re seeing the interviews and people are are looking like idiots and and and uh then you throw in a sprinkle of hatred uh and you&#39;ve got this kind of lunacy plus hatred plus you know free men on the land kind of feel to it and uh but it very quickly turned from from clarity to just downright disgust and then as the disgust faded uh in came anger um and so i&#39;ve I&#39;ve kind of gone through a number of emotions this week and, you know, to even see the complimentary protests in Calgary and on Highway 4 and here in Alberta, across the country, you know, and then to watch them also just kind of peter out. I mean, they don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re doing next. You know, what is the great the next move? I mean, their next moves have always been a little bit suspect, but all of this has just kind of left me. um i</div>

Talk about your emotions over the week. We&#39;ll dig into the facts a little bit more, the warnings, the political sort of ups and downs over the course of the week.

And then as this quote-unquote convoy was making its way across the country, you saw, yeah, we&#39;re talking dozens of trucks, maybe a couple of hundred at different peaks, but obviously probably about 1,000, I think, in Ottawa has been the estimate there, But not the big, big numbers that were decreed by protesters, which shouldn&#39;t surprise us. It shouldn&#39;t surprise us any more than when Donald Trump falls flat on his face when he&#39;s promising a big rally or any of these random characters who do this. Because let&#39;s face it, organizing is not their strong suit. Rage is their strong suit. But rage can carry the day sometimes, as we saw.</div>

You know, one of the groups affiliated with the convoy, Canada Unity, they produced a memorandum of understanding that it wanted to present to the Governor General Mary Simon and the Senate, which it believes would force the government to rescind these COVID-19 public health measures. The Gigi wouldn&#39;t dismiss this as part of cabinet. Of course, many people saying this is outlandish, it&#39;s crazy. Also understanding and exploring that many of the folks at the core of this, Corey, as I mentioned earlier, had some white nationalist background to what they&#39;re trying of new separatist backgrounds. So that kind of adds to Carter&#39;s theory of outlandishness or extreme. I&#39;ll ask you the same question that Carter kind of put on the table.

Well, what in the world does Ottawa have to do with any of that, right? Like, this is not Justin Trudeau&#39;s circus, and it&#39;s not his elephants. So that doesn&#39;t make any sense at all. And then this absolutely outlandish plan that you would somehow get the governor general in this, and I don&#39;t even fucking know the logic train, as broken as it is, that leads to believe that the Senate can somehow override the House of Commons to do fucking anything at all. You know, they&#39;re not even allowed to pass money bills, for Christ&#39;s sake. It&#39;s like an appointed body, appointed by the way by the prime minister like none of this makes any sense i mean it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the theater of the absurd but because of that because there is no way to meet these demands because there is no way for any of these things to kind of naturally square and move on to the next thing we&#39;re all sitting here saying what the fuck is going to happen next right what is going to happen monday in ottawa that&#39;s</div>

Nobody thinks about the Tea Party being about that. And it was kind of a dumb thing for it to be about. But sometimes these things become much, much bigger than the specific issue that they&#39;re at least on paper about. And so many Canadians have latched on to this as being just in general about frustrations with COVID-19 government actions and maybe even just their frustrations about COVID-19 period, which is kind of dumb because the virus doesn&#39;t care whether you&#39;re frustrated or not. But it seems to be an outlet for that frustration that a lot of Canadians are feeling right now, maybe even beyond the 10% that are unvaccinated.</div>

And they both, the first Black Lives Matter, especially, they came without leadership. They came without coordination. The second Black Lives Matter came with leadership, coordination, focus, intensity, And has been far more successful. Right. The first Black Lives Matter petered out because it again, they tried to put everything on to this Black Lives Matter mechanism. And I think the Black Lives Matter is about 10,000 times better a cause, but infinitely better. But nonetheless, we wind up, without leadership, without a clear message, things tend to fall apart. And Corey, as much as you&#39;re pointing to the Tea Party, the Tea Party also had a very clear message. It became about taxes. It became about government largesse on your taxes. And whether or not that morphed into federal taxes, state taxes, local taxes, the Tea Party could always find a tax that they hated. This</div>

I know Occupy Wall Street has been thrown around for their lack of leadership and eventual lack of direction, but also about its political influence that it had on the issue of income inequality, et cetera, and maybe being a supercharger to the social democrat movement. But before I do that, Corey, I want to talk about this everyday people sort of add on still a bit more, which is there was success there to be had. It attracted people from every grievance. But at the core of it, you know, we do know there were some radical organizers. Why do you think it was still able to do that with an organizing core and an organizing philosophy that was still kind of batshit? Like, when you look at it on the terms of, like, what this group wants, it&#39;s crazy. It&#39;s not going to happen. And it&#39;s dangerous and radical. Yet it still attracted people on my Instagram feed, people on my Facebook page. I&#39;m sure people we mutually know. Some people were even double, triple vax being like, this is the only thing I have. This is the only vehicle that I can attach myself to.

Do you feel like that still rationalized away some very dark stuff that we witnessed this weekend? it. And I hope we don&#39;t witness more, but we very well might in the coming days.

And the reason I say that is just by looking at the people who decided to throw themselves at these people and try and win their support, right? So when Aaron O&#39;Toole and his caucus are throwing themselves at this group to try and win their support, that leads me to believe that they didn&#39;t think really bad things were going to happen.

I wonder if this was less about downside risk and more – less of a sword, so to speak, for O&#39;Toole to try to gain some points, but more of like a shield to keep his job. Do you think there&#39;s any merit in that angle?</div>

          <div class="said">I mean, it&#39;s the only hypothesis that makes even remote sense to me, right? right? It&#39;s that he, look, if you want to, this might hurt him becoming prime minister, but you don&#39;t get to be prime minister if you&#39;re not party leader. We&#39;ve said a version of that in different contexts. Now, you know, good moral character sometimes says it&#39;s a bridge too far, but obviously he&#39;s not decided that it is a bridge too far for him. And maybe he sincerely supports this group too, who the hell knows, right? I&#39;m not in the guy&#39;s head. But the idea idea has to be at least floating around there. I&#39;m sure many people suspect that this is in part because he wants to keep his caucus from drifting further away from him. You know, it&#39;s not as though he&#39;s got an iron grip on it at this point.</div>

And the political advice probably to him is, why the hell back down? 90% of this country is vaccinated. Do you feel like the political calculation is just that simple for Trudeau, despite the fact that this convoy and the people that are angry, it&#39;s more textured than just a simple 90-10 wedge issue? Do you feel like the political math still works in Trudeau&#39;s favor. And then let&#39;s talk about what we&#39;ve just you&#39;ve put on the table.

We have talked about polling, softening for strong COVID measures in the past month. And I think that&#39;s something Trudeau needs to think about. Our advice to people in terms of dealing with COVID is make sure you know where the center is and stick with that center. And it may be moving rapidly at this point. So I think there&#39;s a reality there. But in some ways, I sort of dispute your kind of your frame, Zane, because one of the things that I wanted to say that was really interesting to me about this weekend is how little we&#39;ve seen Trudeau.

In his statements where he started using more forceful language about it and it became more, I don&#39;t have his statement in front of me here, but it became less about everybody&#39;s good and more about everybody deserves to be heard. And so I think you can continue to see that pivot. And I think that pivot&#39;s a sensible one, which is to say, he can effectively take the approach that I&#39;m almost cautioning Trudeau about here, which is like, you&#39;re going to have to deal with this at some point. He can say, we&#39;re going to have to deal with this at some point. Do I find this onerous? You bet your ass I do. But we&#39;re going to have to resolve this. This is what politicians have to do. Politicians have to find a path forward through some pretty brutal situations. And our prime minister, I understand he has COVID. I wish him a speedy recovery, but he still has a voice and his voice needed to be heard in Ottawa this weekend. And he was derelict in that. And he would be happy to run this 90-10 wedge and say it&#39;s a successful wedge for me and the Liberal Party can be reelected forever on this.</div>

They had a lot of things lined up for them. They got media attention. They had money. They were able to expand it beyond truckers in some ways. Sure, did they over-promise and under-deliver? Yes.
