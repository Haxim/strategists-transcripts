            <div class="said">Zane, to piggyback off what What Carter&#39;s saying there, what is Trump thinking? He&#39;s seemingly been disciplined and been quiet on this subject. And then Wednesday, as Carter says, nothing new, but the Carney campaign&#39;s done a good job of making things new with a lot of headlines about the call. So we&#39;ll start with the Trump part. What do you think he&#39;s thinking here?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">I wouldn&#39;t call it discipline because I don&#39;t think it can credit it as that. I bet he just forgot about the fact that he had mentioned it and then went back to his Rolodex of greatest hits and realized, oh, fuck, this one hasn&#39;t been played for a while or no one&#39;s talked to me about it. So I don&#39;t credit him with any sort of like political sort of discipline or any of the Internet rumors that, you know, the conservatives have gotten into Trump and then told him to lay it now so they can have their affordability. Like, no, I don&#39;t believe any of that shit. it. And the fact is that right now Carter&#39;s right on the top line that any sort of injection of Trump into the campaign is definitely useful and helpful. But I also contend with another thing you&#39;d kind of put on the table that the liberal campaign has done a good job of kind of leveraging it. In fact, I think like unless it&#39;s been fucking new and explicit, like this most recent comment The liberal campaign hasn&#39;t been all that good at taking raw material from Trump 30 days ago, 25 days ago, and extending it into the back half of this campaign. In fact, I think that&#39;s been a fundamental weakness to which we could now see a potential minority government because Quebec&#39;s kind of maybe being desensitized or forgetting about the scope of the threat. So, yeah, Carney&#39;s super lucky, continues to be. I mean, we talked about this every week since the last three, but fuck me, right? And he continues to be lucky, not just because Trump is getting him fresh content with saying the same shit over and over to reinforce to people that this threat is still real, but he continues to be lucky that yesterday, which I think was</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">was a really fascinating day with the Radio Canada or the RADCAN report. Because to me, that was like Corey talks about Rorschach test. That was one. If you if you are against Carney, that story was very much look at this deceitful, untrustworthy leader. And if you were for Carney, the thing was, well, the core story here is that this is a guy with discretion, took Trump&#39;s sort of bluster and kind of parked that to its side, didn&#39;t mention it because that would actually be obviously manipulating the election and went with the facts that Trump respected our sovereignty. So look at how – what a great, discreet, reliable, sensible leader he is. I also think yesterday&#39;s story was a nice proxy to your like headspace as a progressive campaigner or a liberal campaigner. If you felt like that was negative, you&#39;re probably more anxious about the future. And if you felt like that was a story to – that was very much a sword, you were definitely more assertive about the future. And I mean the future as in the next couple of days trying to wrap this thing up. But once again, I think that story, should it have landed 10 days ago, really would have had enough time and legs to be able to have the untrustworthy argument be made by all of the parties because you would have seen all of them jump on it. It could have been the core of a new ad campaign. It could have been the core of a new microsite. It could have been the core of a new leaflet. You can do a lot in 10 days in a campaign. And then, Carter, it becomes impossible to do anything in two days on a campaign, especially when people are voting on Monday. So once again, a story that more than likely, I don&#39;t know this, probably was leaked from internal liberal sources or liberal friendly sources to inject the Trump question. I think that was a poor call, should that have been the case. And if that was the case, doesn&#39;t harm Carney, because I think it was a complete error for them to have that narrative out there, so to speak, should they have put it out there themselves.</div>

And then the more I thought about it, and perhaps this was logical to others from the beginning, of course, this came to liberals. The more I think it is probably the case that they had this in their back pocket and campaigns often do this, Carter, right? They have stuff in their back pocket. And when they have no time on the clock, what do they do? Most of them don&#39;t have the discipline enough to say, okay, this will never see the light of day. Most of them fucking throw it out there because they&#39;ve been spending time, effort. They&#39;ve been just thinking about it. And I remember this is on the NDP campaign, 2019, the campaign we knew we were going to lose, that the last five days of the campaign, everything</div>

It wasn&#39;t too long ago that we were talking about shitty buttons at the Manning Center conference, right? So, no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about whether you&#39;re ahead or behind. I think campaigns, regardless of their status, have a certain sort of culture where people have done work and they want that work to see the light of day sort of thing and find some breathing room somewhere in the conversation. I suspect, I could be wrong, Carter could tell me that he disagrees with this assessment, the speculative assessment, but I suspect this kind of falls into that category.

Carter and I, if we were on the campaign, the liberal campaign, we would have had a fight about this. This would have been one of those. I would have won. And I think justifiably so. I think this would have been an issue. And I&#39;m really curious if people have feedback. I think this would have been an issue where it becomes trust versus Trump. Do you want to undermine your trust, right, and your lack of disclosure? And it&#39;s – by the way, to be clear, I&#39;m going to say it again. I respect the move, but politics is not actually about the move that Carney made. It&#39;s about what people can mold into it. And two weeks is enough on the clock that the NDP can get a couple of points back and the conservatives can do what they have not been able to do, which is find a lane on Carney. It wouldn&#39;t have been worth the risk. I would have made that point very, very loudly two weeks ago. I would have made it less loudly with three days to go, right? But I would have still made it. But two weeks ago, it&#39;s a no-brainer for me that this is like fight-worthy in front of the campaign team.</div>

And I think when you&#39;re in rooms with those people, even if you strongly believe like I do, that this is the wrong thing to do and that there might be other people around the table, it&#39;s often very difficult on the campaign. This is important for people to understand that often these decisions are less about collaborative what we should do and more so anyone want to take me on any big disagreements if not we&#39;re moving on and doing this. And there&#39;s There&#39;s been, in my time working with folks like that across the board over multiple campaigns, that&#39;s how often these decisions get made.

            <div class="said">I would. I would. I think this one would be worthwhile enough to at least get whoever&#39;s leading the campaign to say, can you ask half a dozen other people without any retribution to them to see should we do this or not? And you may or may not value that person&#39;s opinion and you may still make the call, But just canvass a few other folks that you have brought around this table that you feel like are talented at what they do to see. Do they see the error of the ways here or do they see? And by the way, this does not need to be consensus on two fronts. The campaign strategist and the campaign manager does not have to get a consensus in order to make the call. But also, to be clear, we&#39;re talking about marginal 20% shift in what we see the strategy. Like I see the value of doing this. Like do not get me wrong. And Carter, he&#39;s never acknowledged it, but I can just tell with his eyes. sees the values of the point that I&#39;m trying to make around trust. So we&#39;re talking about a 60-40 here. We&#39;re not talking about consensus like 100% either way. If everyone in the office doesn&#39;t give it the thumbs up, we&#39;re not doing this. But if you&#39;re getting universally negative feedback, it might take a bit more examination, right? That&#39;s the sort of stuff I&#39;m talking about.</div>

You&#39;re probably doing an email blast sort of thing.

It&#39;s a common tactic at this point is you burn all the lists that you have. If you need money, now&#39;s the time to do it.
