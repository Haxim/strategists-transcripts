He didn&#39;t like that at all. You know, like the actual where the vote would have to come from for if he was going to lose. He didn&#39;t like it. He&#39;s so into himself. He can&#39;t do the theory anymore. He&#39;s not a strategist. He&#39;s a candidate, and it&#39;s embarrassing to watch. What&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s good. I like this. It&#39;s like the newest innovation in doorbells are doorbells that don&#39;t work. So it&#39;s like we&#39;ve come full circle. We&#39;ve come from analog doorbell to ring doorbell to doorbells that don&#39;t work. And that is where we&#39;re at right now. So it&#39;s a good analogy for our times, Carter, and why we&#39;re probably so alone. Because Annalise is ready to talk to you, but</span>

I felt like it was a bit at the beginning. It&#39;s been a little bit quiet, not on tariffs, obviously, but a little bit quiet. And then Wednesday, he&#39;s chatting with reporters, brings up 51st State again. And then we see the Radio Canada leak yesterday and the stories from there. So I want to talk about this. Carter, what is your take here on the fact that we&#39;re talking about Trump again?</span>

Just a fantastic opportunity for Carney to stand up again to the big bully from the United States. And it wipes Pierre Polyev off the front pages at a time when he needs to be on the front pages. It&#39;s nothing new, ironically, right? Like there is no particular new news here. I mean, he was talking about the 51st state. Well, before the election started, he&#39;s talking about the 51st state. now at the very end of the of the election and the fact the only thing that has changed is that he was quiet um</span>

            <span class="text">Zane, to piggyback off what What Carter&#39;s saying there, what is Trump thinking? He&#39;s seemingly been disciplined and been quiet on this subject. And then Wednesday, as Carter says, nothing new, but the Carney campaign&#39;s done a good job of making things new with a lot of headlines about the call. So we&#39;ll start with the Trump part. What do you think he&#39;s thinking here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I wouldn&#39;t call it discipline because I don&#39;t think it can credit it as that. I bet he just forgot about the fact that he had mentioned it and then went back to his Rolodex of greatest hits and realized, oh, fuck, this one hasn&#39;t been played for a while or no one&#39;s talked to me about it. So I don&#39;t credit him with any sort of like political sort of discipline or any of the Internet rumors that, you know, the conservatives have gotten into Trump and then told him to lay it now so they can have their affordability. Like, no, I don&#39;t believe any of that shit. it. And the fact is that right now Carter&#39;s right on the top line that any sort of injection of Trump into the campaign is definitely useful and helpful. But I also contend with another thing you&#39;d kind of put on the table that the liberal campaign has done a good job of kind of leveraging it. In fact, I think like unless it&#39;s been fucking new and explicit, like this most recent comment The liberal campaign hasn&#39;t been all that good at taking raw material from Trump 30 days ago, 25 days ago, and extending it into the back half of this campaign. In fact, I think that&#39;s been a fundamental weakness to which we could now see a potential minority government because Quebec&#39;s kind of maybe being desensitized or forgetting about the scope of the threat. So, yeah, Carney&#39;s super lucky, continues to be. I mean, we talked about this every week since the last three, but fuck me, right? And he continues to be lucky, not just because Trump is getting him fresh content with saying the same shit over and over to reinforce to people that this threat is still real, but he continues to be lucky that yesterday, which I think was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">was a really fascinating day with the Radio Canada or the RADCAN report. Because to me, that was like Corey talks about Rorschach test. That was one. If you if you are against Carney, that story was very much look at this deceitful, untrustworthy leader. And if you were for Carney, the thing was, well, the core story here is that this is a guy with discretion, took Trump&#39;s sort of bluster and kind of parked that to its side, didn&#39;t mention it because that would actually be obviously manipulating the election and went with the facts that Trump respected our sovereignty. So look at how – what a great, discreet, reliable, sensible leader he is. I also think yesterday&#39;s story was a nice proxy to your like headspace as a progressive campaigner or a liberal campaigner. If you felt like that was negative, you&#39;re probably more anxious about the future. And if you felt like that was a story to – that was very much a sword, you were definitely more assertive about the future. And I mean the future as in the next couple of days trying to wrap this thing up. But once again, I think that story, should it have landed 10 days ago, really would have had enough time and legs to be able to have the untrustworthy argument be made by all of the parties because you would have seen all of them jump on it. It could have been the core of a new ad campaign. It could have been the core of a new microsite. It could have been the core of a new leaflet. You can do a lot in 10 days in a campaign. And then, Carter, it becomes impossible to do anything in two days on a campaign, especially when people are voting on Monday. So once again, a story that more than likely, I don&#39;t know this, probably was leaked from internal liberal sources or liberal friendly sources to inject the Trump question. I think that was a poor call, should that have been the case. And if that was the case, doesn&#39;t harm Carney, because I think it was a complete error for them to have that narrative out there, so to speak, should they have put it out there themselves.</span>

I respect Carney not mentioning Trump talking about 51st state, extracting all the positives, keeping the other part aside, probably helped the Trump response. Definitely, it was It was savvy.

The more I think it is probably the case that they had this in their back pocket and campaigns often do this, Carter, right? They have stuff in their back pocket. And when they have no time on the clock, what do they do? Most of them don&#39;t have the discipline enough to say, okay, this will never see the light of day. Most of them fucking throw it out there because they&#39;ve been spending time, effort. They&#39;ve been just thinking about it.

It wasn&#39;t too long ago that we were talking about shitty buttons at the Manning Center conference, right? So, no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s about whether you&#39;re ahead or behind. I think campaigns, regardless of their status, have a certain sort of culture where people have done work and they want that work to see the light of day sort of thing and find some breathing room somewhere in the conversation. I suspect, I could be wrong, Carter could tell me that he disagrees with this assessment, the speculative assessment, but I suspect this kind of falls into that category.

Carter and I, if we were on the campaign, the liberal campaign, we would have had a fight about this. This would have been one of those. I would have won. And I think justifiably so. I think this would have been an issue. And I&#39;m really curious if people have feedback. I think this would have been an issue where it becomes trust versus Trump. Do you want to undermine your trust, right, and your lack of disclosure? And it&#39;s – by the way, to be clear, I&#39;m going to say it again. I respect the move, but politics is not actually about the move that Carney made. It&#39;s about what people can mold into it. And two weeks is enough on the clock that the NDP can get a couple of points back and the conservatives can do what they have not been able to do, which is find a lane on Carney. It wouldn&#39;t have been worth the risk. I would have made that point very, very loudly two weeks ago. I would have made it less loudly with three days to go, right? But I would have still made it. But two weeks ago, it&#39;s a no-brainer for me that this is like fight-worthy in front of the campaign team.</span>

You&#39;ve probably met the version of yourself prior to you becoming yourself, right? And I say this just in service of the listeners, that that persona of like, and that personality, and rightfully so, to Carter&#39;s sort of credit, because you need to get shit done. It&#39;s less about what do we think of this idea when they bring up a play like this Let&#39;s use this one as an example. And it&#39;s more so a anyone</span>

You have a bit of that, right? And there&#39;s a half a dozen to a dozen people in this country that have that personality. And I think when you&#39;re in rooms with those people, even if you strongly believe like I do, that this is the wrong thing to do and that there might be other people around the table, it&#39;s often very difficult on the campaign. This is important for people to understand that often these decisions are less about collaborative what we should do and more so anyone want to take me on any big disagreements if not we&#39;re moving on and doing this. And there&#39;s There&#39;s been, in my time working with folks like that across the board over multiple campaigns, that&#39;s how often these decisions get made. Either you don&#39;t hear about them and or even if you do, it&#39;s very much who wants to take me on on this because, you know, I&#39;ve got all my talking points ready. So</span>

And you may or may not value that person&#39;s opinion and you may still make the call, But just canvass a few other folks that you have brought around this table that you feel like are talented at what they do to see. Do they see the error of the ways here or do they see? And by the way, this does not need to be consensus on two fronts. The campaign strategist and the campaign manager does not have to get a consensus in order to make the call. But also, to be clear, we&#39;re talking about marginal 20% shift in what we see the strategy. Like I see the value of doing this. Like do not get me wrong. And Carter, he&#39;s never acknowledged it, but I can just tell with his eyes. sees the values of the point that I&#39;m trying to make around trust. So we&#39;re talking about a 60-40 here. We&#39;re not talking about consensus like 100% either way. If everyone in the office doesn&#39;t give it the thumbs up, we&#39;re not doing this. But if you&#39;re getting universally negative feedback, it might take a bit more examination, right? That&#39;s the sort of stuff I&#39;m talking about.</span>

You&#39;re probably doing an email blast sort of thing. So you&#39;re thinking about digital tactics that you&#39;re scheduling, 24 hours to vote, 12 hours, six hours, two hours, one hour, 30 minutes, figuring all that out, annoying people, burning your list. It&#39;s a common tactic at this point is you burn all the lists that you have. If you need money, now&#39;s the time to do it. In the sense of final dollars, give us some money so we can make a final GOTV push. We&#39;re so close, etc., etc. And if it&#39;s not for any of the things I just mentioned, then you&#39;re probably at the doors to kind of doing your thing, helping out the campaign, joining a phone bank, and or twiddling your thumbs.</span>

These are the last three days to actually change the course of the of the campaign. And it&#39;s true to a large extent. Like if the great unwashed and the ones that we don&#39;t talk to form the base, then if you&#39;re expecting to win by 200 to 2000 votes, then these liberal IDs and the IDs that the conservatives have are the most important votes that you have in the election. You&#39;ve got to get, you know, leaving 500 votes on the table might change the outcome of the election. So you want to get as many people out as possible. That&#39;s why Corey&#39;s literally been working the telephone calls every single day. It&#39;s funny because he calls people, and then if he doesn&#39;t reach them, he sends them a text, right? And he gets stopped back to him every once in a while because he does— It&#39;s the auto one? They think it&#39;s the auto text, but it&#39;s actually him making the text because— The real Corey</span>

Uh, if you want to find out where the victory party is, you&#39;re going to have to go to one of the sessions between on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, right? Right. You have to actually do the work to get invited to the to the party, because that&#39;s I mean, ultimately, at this stage, it&#39;s all hands on deck. And if you have, you know, if you&#39;re not doing something, if you&#39;re the advertising guy and your job is finished and I fall into the same role, like there&#39;s nothing strategic left. There&#39;s not a strategic thought in my head that&#39;s going to change this election. It all boils down to how many volunteers can we get? And so my job has been to call volunteers, too.</span>
