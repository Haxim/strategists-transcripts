So when you&#39;re door knocking, you&#39;re out there and they knock on the door and you say, which mayoralty candidate would you support? And this gives us the right answer. My team is able to say Brian Thiessen. Communities First gets to say Sonia Sharp. And that elevates both the party, the individual council candidate, And the mayoralty candidate. So because you&#39;ve got a singular answer, because it&#39;s always going to be the same, you&#39;re able to elevate to the highest possible level. So sometimes the council candidate is going to lift up the mayoralty candidate. Other times the mayoralty candidate is going to lift up the council candidate. And in a perfect world, both of the candidates are working to lift the other. And that&#39;s, I think, one of the reasons that I&#39;m a big fan of the party system. didn&#39;t</div>

There&#39;s some unique elements in Calgary that we&#39;re not talking about in Edmonton. Calgary, we just launched a water utility policy that I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s talking about.
