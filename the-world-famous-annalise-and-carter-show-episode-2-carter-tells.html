So for those who are still listening, who are interested in municipal politics, a part of why I wanted to talk municipal is that it&#39;s different this year in Calgary and Edmonton specifically. So last year, Daniel Smith&#39;s UCP government tabled legislation that introduces political parties to our municipal elections only</span>

            <span class="text">showed more than 70% of respondents opposed to adding political parties. And there&#39;s been other polling that shows the same thing. Alberta municipalities have done polling that shows similar. So in Calgary, we have the Calgary Party, which Stephen Carter can tell us more about. But is it fair, Carter, to call the Calgary Party center, center-left? What are we calling it?</span>

And I guess worth mentioning in the race for mayor is our incumbent mayor, Jody Gondek. Jeremy Farkas, who was a city councillor who ran last time for mayor, came in second. And Jeff Davison, who also was a city councillor who ran for mayor last time, came in third. So both of them have had a term away from council. And then also running for mayor is Sonia Sharp, who is running with Communities First, who is a current city councillor. And then Stephen Carter&#39;s guy, Brian Thiessen, he&#39;s been everywhere this stampede, who&#39;s running with the Calgary party.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s two reasons. The first is the inherent advantage that the rules give you. So the rules have been changed dramatically. So it used to be Annalise Klingbeil could give $5,000 to every one of my 14 candidates. Not</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So you can only give from one corporation. Now that dramatically reduces the amount of money that was going out.

            <span class="text">About 80% of the doors that you knock ask one question, and that is, which mayoralty candidate are you going to support when you&#39;re a councillor? So when you&#39;re door knocking, you&#39;re out there and they knock on the door and you say, which mayoralty candidate would you support? And this gives us the right answer. My team is able to say Brian Thiessen. Communities First gets to say Sonia Sharp. And that elevates both the party, the individual council candidate, And the mayoralty candidate. So because you&#39;ve got a singular answer, because it&#39;s always going to be the same, you&#39;re able to elevate to the highest possible level. So sometimes the council candidate is going to lift up the mayoralty candidate. Other times the mayoralty candidate is going to lift up the council candidate. And in a perfect world, both of the candidates are working to lift the other. And that&#39;s, I think, one of the reasons that I&#39;m a big fan of the party system. didn&#39;t</span>

It is an impossible time to get media attention. Even during the writ, we&#39;re going to have to come up with stunts instead of actual news to get media attention. And you know how it goes.

Both markets have been talking about public safety and housing, which is quite interesting because significant ports of public safety and housing rely on the provincial government. And, you know, it&#39;s kind of been downloaded to the city. You know, like we&#39;re not talking very much about city issues at all. I would say that, again, both markets are kind of going with a back-to-basics model. I think that we are talking about the same three things most of the time. There&#39;s some unique elements in Calgary that we&#39;re not talking about in Edmonton. Calgary, we just launched a water utility policy that I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s talking about. But, you know, we&#39;re putting forward a proposal just to look a little different and to have kind of more of a fullness of the conversation. Really good stuff.
