        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Donald Trump&#39;s COVID-19 diagnosis and the Vice Presidential debate. Can getting COVID-19 work to Trump&#39;s advantage? Does this change our thinking about the Supreme Court fight? And has Stephen Carter invented a new type of negative ad?

Will pushing through a Supreme Court nominee backfire on Trump? What is the strategy behind floating cuts to supports for the severely handicapped? And most importantly did Stephen Carter start the petition to remove Matt Wolf from office?

What does wrapping up WE say to Canada? Can we expect fireworks from the Liberal cabinet retreat? And how long did Corey and Stephen need to cram to fuel their deep dive into NB politics? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

When and why do governments use trial balloons? How should oppositions respond to them? And has there ever been a better metaphor than a bunch of MAGA boats at the bottom of a lake?
