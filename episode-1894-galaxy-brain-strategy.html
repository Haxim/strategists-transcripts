        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips break down the federal budget vote that saw the Carney government survive with a razor-thin margin of 170-168. What do the strategic abstentions from NDP and Conservative MPs really mean? What lessons can the federal NDP learn from the recent BC NDP convention? And can Carter ever recover from the live show beatdown, or will Corey's facial expressions haunt him forever? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

However, the other sources of drama also didn&#39;t manifest. And I&#39;m not saying you said this would happen, but you did say on a previous episode that a way for a conservative to leave would be on the budget vote. We didn&#39;t see that.

But the Conservatives getting through this moment, is that a bit of a strategic victory for Polyev here? Is that one of the hurdles crossed as we revisit some of the work that we did in the previous episode talking about Polyev&#39;s three acts and what he needs to do?</div>

He doesn&#39;t necessarily need to have a whole bunch of floor crossers when the NDP knows that if they fall at this, if they go to an election at this stage, I mean, how can it get worse? Well, let&#39;s find out, right? So, So I think that there&#39;s a reality that says that this isn&#39;t going to go to an election. This government&#39;s not going to an election until such time as Mark Carney wants it to go to an election. Because in the near term, it doesn&#39;t benefit the conservatives and it doesn&#39;t benefit the NDP.</div>

Elizabeth May is always a fun conversation topic. And then, of course, the general topic of the no vote slash abstention, which we can clarify in a moment here.

But Matt Gennaro, and again, I&#39;m throwing in Shannon Stubbs, you know, them choosing not to vote or not being able to vote or whatever, also sent a clear signal of support of this budget. it so for me this is a um you know 170 to 168 a great victory for the liberals uh and the ndp and the conservatives both both live to fight another day they don&#39;t want to go into an election uh this close to christmas this close this this soon after there was some polling that came out i think it was lege that had like the liberals ahead in alberta uh after the</div>

          <div class="said">25 hard minutes on Motherfucker. Tanya Furr, who&#39;s a UCP MLA and minister, she left a voicemail for a constituent regarding the teacher strike. After the constituent hung up, she continued recording, accidentally captured her using an expletive, I believe was Motherfucker, referring to someone else, the next person she was going to call. The voicemail was leaked online. There&#39;s a series of steps in between, but the person who got the first voicemail sent it. The second person leaked it online, turned out to be a columnist. The voicemail leaked online over the weekend and widely circulated sparking controversy. Furr has apologized for the language, calling it a lapse in judgment caused by frustration with ongoing political conflict. A subnote or a subtext to this is that once the person who was referred to as a motherfucker called Tanya Furr out on this, she then made him listen to, or volunteered for him to listen to, multiple voicemails she received where people were calling her expletives and in very aggressive fashion as well.</div>
