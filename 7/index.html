        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;&#39;Twas the night before the Alberta Sovereignty Act and all through the Pod, Carter was stirring while Annalise played god. Hogan&#39;s arguments laid out in brief and with care, with the hope unlike Stephen he wouldn&#39;t lose his hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a looming use of the Alberta Sovereignty Act, the year-end interview and a grab bag of topics in an extended lightning round. Is the Sovereignty Act a &#34;temper tantrum masquerading as law&#34;? Who gets more out of the political year-end interview - the media or the politician? And who will join us on our walk to Ottawa? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she&#39;s got you covered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

What does the weekend&#39;s events tell us about power dynamics generally? About leadership? And what are we supposed to make of Corey defending Suncor CEO Rich Kruger?

Does that idea has any merit? And regardless of that - how it could be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter deep diver on whether the Alberta NDP should consider a name change and how - if that was somebody&#39;s desire - it should be done. How important is the name of a party when it comes to brand perception? What&#39;s the optimal timing for such a move? Is this something a leadership candidate could or should take on?

Was the win for Sunak that we aren&#39;t leading with Suella Braverman being fired? Do incremental increases in support for an Alberta Pension Plan matter?

Is Take Back Alberta Danielle Smith&#39;s biggest strength or biggest problem? Is there a path forward for Justin Trudeau that doesn&#39;t involve a walk in the snow? And why has Corey declared war on people who wear political t-shirts, a group that could be charitably described as 95% of our listening audience?

These men and women promptly escaped from jobs where they could do no damage to the Ottawa elite. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as senior staffers. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you don&#39;t care how it turns out....maybe you can hire The D-Team.&#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

How did the Liberals end up here? How do they turn this seemingly one-off action into a coherent policy - and coherent political strategy?
