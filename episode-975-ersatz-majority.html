            <span class="text">is on strategistlive.com. Now, that is where you order tickets. Now, one thing that we mentioned in great detail on the previous episode is which website to not go to. And that website, Stephen, Steven, is thestrategistlive.com. Now, that website was taken, was it not? It</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It was taken. Very upsetting. Competitors and people making fun of us. It hurts. It hurts when people do that. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So strategistlive.com for your tickets April 10th, as Corey mentioned. I mean, this is a great value. It&#39;s going to be a great show. You know, Corey said six years since we&#39;ve done it. Just, you know, come see how we&#39;ve aged. Come see how we&#39;ve aged and not matured. It is going to be the same type of show that those who were privileged, I would say, Carter, harder uh some more than half decade back we&#39;ll get uh we we make it up as we go this is not pre-recorded stage programming that we just sit there like a dj kind of spinning our tracks and greatest hits no no we create a new show for you on the stage while all of you sit in seats side by side facing the same direction i mean this is groundbreaking here</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">here anything else i don&#39;t want to go in more detail because we have done that on the previous episode if you listen to 974 you&#39;ll get at all the details, the background, the context. But we&#39;ll leave that there and we&#39;ll move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, keep your friends close and keep your enemies running in a leadership race to define whatever the fuck they are as a political party. Guys, I want to talk about the breaking news. No, not the Strategist Live, Corey. No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. I am talking about, once again, strategistlive.com. I&#39;m talking about the federal liberals and the NDs have worked on a tentative agreement that, if finalized, would keep Prime Prime Minister Trudeau&#39;s government in power until 2025 in exchange for progress on longstanding NDP priorities, i.e. making progress, quote unquote, on pharma care and dental care. The deal worked out by party leadership is still pending the sign off from NDP MPs. But we&#39;re told that the liberal cabinet had an emergency or special meeting tonight. Carter, when you saw this headline come by, give me your initial thoughts. I&#39;m going to ask you for the same. What are you thinking when you saw this deal that the Indies and the Liberals federally tried to get off the ground or some version of this back in November? I mean, now it seems like sources are certainly saying that it&#39;s pretty close to the finish line here. Your first thoughts when you heard about this, Carter?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I thought it was a pretty good deal for the Liberals. I mean, I&#39;m not sure what make progress means, but it&#39;s not the same as implement full pharmacare and other initiatives, right? So I thought it was a interesting</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">interesting phrasing, But I think it also just kind of formalizes what we all know, and that is that the NDP are not likely to enable</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">enable an election that might put the conservatives into power. So they like this arrangement, formalizing their own ability to put some power into this and to give themselves some more power, as limited as it is, is actually probably a pretty good idea for both the liberals and the NDP.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, your initial thoughts when you saw this headline break an hour or so ago, what were you thinking? Or what did you think?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, details TBD, and the devil is always in the details for these kinds of things. But my sense is this could be not just win-win, but maybe even win-win-win for the liberals, NDP and conservatives, because the liberals get stability.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">They don&#39;t get to just act as a de facto majority government. They get effectively a majority government. The NDP gets some longstanding initiatives, and Jagmeet Singh gets the ability to say and take credit for some of the liberal policy initiatives, some which were already liberal policies, such as taxes on banks, increasing that wealth tax. But I can say this was part of the deal for support. And the conservatives get to freak out for the next few years without risking the fall of the government in an election they&#39;re not ready for. So everybody gets a little bit of something here. And of course, the conservatives will talk about this dreadful liberal</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">liberal NDP coalition. It&#39;s not a coalition, but it&#39;s probably close enough for a lot of lay people. And I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be able to fundraise a ton off it. But ultimately, I think there&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s reason based on where every party is right now, and what every party is looking for right now, that you could say everybody gets out ahead. ahead carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">carter if you wanted to extend it you could almost say it&#39;s a win for the block as well who kind of sit pretty with their seat count uh in in a real sense do you agree with cory&#39;s sort of a thesis here that this could be a win-win-win uh even for the conservatives so to speak yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean the conservatives always want to to shake their fists and rattle their you know their little noisemakers about trying to to you know push for a new election and how you know the majority or or most Canadians, more Canadians want the Conservative government. They&#39;re not in any shape to fight an election. They&#39;ll get through their leadership, and then whoever becomes the leader is going to take some time to craft the Conservative Party in his or her image. I guess it&#39;s just his right now, but maybe we&#39;ll get a female candidate at some point. But I think that having the election on the fixed cycle probably suits everybody&#39;s needs. Carter,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, help me message this. Help me message this from the liberal perspective. If you are going out, let&#39;s say this gets confirmed tonight by the NDP. If you are going out tomorrow morning as the liberals, the governing party, what are you saying? And why are you saying what you&#39;re saying to justify, to promote, to spin this as coming from strength, not necessarily weakness? How would you position this to the general public if you&#39;re the liberals? Government</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The people spoke in the last election and what they asked for, what the vast majority of people asked for, was a progressive agenda that tackled big issues like pharmacare and other economic issues. The vast majority of Canadians want to see action like the action that we achieved last night. This</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">This is an agreement between two political parties simply to reflect the will of the people.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And if you can do that while creating good policy, I think that you&#39;re in a great spot. And this is a great deal for Canada.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, is this from the NDP perspective a joint statement with the government? What would you advocate if you were currently in the federal NDP fold and said, OK, we have been touted as being kind of weak with Jagmeet in certain cases, that he&#39;s been absent in some of the big conversations over the last couple of months? How are you messaging this from the NDP perspective? And are you doing and advocating for a joint statement with the liberals from a messaging strategy perspective?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, that depends on where you want to go, Zane. So one of the things that I think naturally spills out of an agreement like this is, are</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">are there plans for longer-term cooperation on some of these things? Is electoral cooperation possible?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You mean beyond a minority government that we find ourselves in? And I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

But we know that the federal NDP especially, they take a lot of pride in their identity. They take a lot of pride in being independent, the left flank, the moral conscience, so to speak. This agreement probably makes practical sense, but there&#39;s probably questions that many of them have. If you&#39;re an NDP MP looking at the future of your party, what questions are you asking?

One of the thoughts I had was, you know, what does the structure of this deal look like, the milestones, the granular details as we talk about? The second thought, and there may be no meat on the bone here, but let me explore it for a second, was, is this, like,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">like, this reporting, could it fundamentally change the structure of the deal? And what we haven&#39;t spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about is what the impact of media leaks or media reporting and sourcing is to ongoing negotiations, right? The ink isn&#39;t dry here on this thing. There&#39;s still being things approved. approved i&#39;m kind of wondering from your perspective when you read this did you read this as like reporting on a formality that was going to happen or or did you kind of read this as like you know shit could change here and because of this reporting that&#39;s come out in advance of the ink being dried and all the the rubber stamps being put in and maybe kind of leads to a broader conversation on on on what leaking does or what what sourcing and reporting does and i don&#39;t know if anything was leaked here is to be totally clear to to ongoing negotiations So just your thoughts on that, based on how you read it. I know that&#39;s a very convoluted statement, but I thought I&#39;d just get you to react to that.</span>

So, and by people, I mean both the NDP MPs and the Liberal MPs, as well as analysts or general population. Everybody gets that initial headline and the initial headline then forms our general consensus and our general opinions. So if that headline is accurate, if that information is accurate, then our initial response to that information is going to be stuck there. If it&#39;s not accurate, it&#39;s still going to be stuck there. And now you&#39;ve got to move us. Right.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the response to this information may be negative because people will have to be reassured that it&#39;s not just make progress. It&#39;s something totally different. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m you know, I&#39;m always concerned about. That&#39;s why people always say in our business, get the information out first, own the narrative, right? Put your narrative out there first, because as soon as your narrative goes out, then that is the one that other people have to try and defeat. So that&#39;s the big question here. Whose narrative is this? And is this narrative 100% accurate? it.</span>

            <span class="text">Great. Just your reflections on that, just whether it&#39;s on the specifics here or just a more general on reporting going out while negotiations are still happening. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve experienced this, seen this happen, probably seen things change because of it, but your just thoughts on that, not knowing exactly the specifics here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So it&#39;s sometimes fine, right? As long as everybody is acting with perfect information and everybody is presenting things in a way that that both parties would agree with. Where you run into trouble is when one side is saying, hey, we&#39;re having these negotiations and they&#39;re going this way. And the other side says, that&#39;s not at all how I feel the negotiations are going. So as long as the negotiations were managed well, and they got to a point where they said, we are going to say these things to our caucus, no surprises is what we&#39;re going to communicate. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a ton of risk there. However, of course, if the liberals have presented this in a bad faith way or in a way that shows that maybe they&#39;re not willing or interested in being totally forthright with their caucus. That&#39;s a problem internally in the Liberal Party, for sure. But that&#39;s also a problem in negotiations, because then you can&#39;t really trust your counterparty in the same way. And where this could really blow up is if people start using saying things like, is a better deal for us than the NDP, right? Because then people in the NDP may start feeling the same thing. What I imagine both of them are doing, because there&#39;s going to be savvy negotiators on both side is saying, this is is a win-win deal the ndp get this we get this it&#39;s to everybody&#39;s benefit i&#39;ve signed off on this but we won&#39;t do it without your support as well and um we just we just don&#39;t know enough and this is a funny one because we&#39;re doing an episode right now it&#39;s 10 p.m mountain time which is the official time zone of canada as we all know as we know correct on on monday march 21st by this time tomorrow i&#39;m sure all of these details will be spilled out all of these details will be spilled out another thing i want to say though not surprising the leaks would come from the liberal side first because it&#39;s a bigger caucus i mean it&#39;s as simple as that yeah if if you considered an equal amount of leaking probability per mp the</span>

And all of a sudden now we&#39;re doing this. Like, why? What&#39;s in the advantage for us? I mean, this just feels like we&#39;re giving up on some level. and we want to be the party that governs.

I know you&#39;ve talked to win, win, win, but it&#39;s an interesting question. It almost seems like it&#39;s bringing the NDP back to life and giving them legitimacy on some of the most leftward things that that even your party has suggested you wanted to do or have stolen from the ndp to be honest over the years your thoughts to what carter&#39;s saying so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so for sure people are going to ask that and i think that&#39;s where my point is you need to stick to the script of your leadership you need to say it&#39;s not about advantage it&#39;s about reflecting the will of the people we both get something we want and don&#39;t take the bait on that because that&#39;s the kind of thing that can poison the deal before the deal has been signed off on if people start hearing like yeah the prime minister Mr. said, it&#39;s a great deal. We fucked the NDP. They&#39;re screwed for a generation because that ding dong Jagmeet Singh agreed to just sell out his party. Right? Can&#39;t do it. Can&#39;t do it if you want the deal. And especially, you know, we talked about if there&#39;s kind of a longer term play here, not saying there is, but that would be really quite poison if that was the case. I actually don&#39;t think, however, that that&#39;s the biggest argument against doing this deal. On the liberal side, you mean? Because that argument&#39;s kind of bullshit, you know, political game stuff. That&#39;s who wins, who loses. Yeah.</span>

Is the political crass version of it. The more principled one is we believe in moderate government. They believe in more extreme government. We&#39;re being now a half extreme government. Why? And I think that is if I were in the liberal caucus where my anxieties would be. And I think that&#39;s where a certain group of liberal MPs will probably be feeling some unease tonight. night.</span>

Jean Charest called by many the, you know, try to occupy the more PC lane here, the more traditional conservative lanes here. Does this message differ a lot from what Carter said here that a blue liberal inside the caucus might say versus Jean Charest, who kind of wants to lead the conservative party with the perhaps a tinge of red or perhaps more of the center as part of his coalition?

            <span class="text">Well, you bring up an interesting point, and maybe it&#39;s not the point you wanted to dig into, but one of the best things Justin Trudeau has going for him in terms of party unity and not necessarily bleeding those blue liberals somewhere else, that is a giant gap to leap over to join today&#39;s conservative party, right? They have really put themselves in a relatively extreme extreme position. And, and I suspect that if you had somebody like Jean Charest as the leader of the conservatives, yeah, they would have trouble keeping their rightward flank together, but might be much more appealing to some of those blue liberals who, who would never join, for example, even the O&#39;Toole Conservative Party, certainly not the sheer Conservative Party, certainly not the Harper Conservative Party. So it&#39;s tough to say, like, all of this is so very much in flux But if I were Jean Charest, I know I would be using it as a bit of a proof point that the center is opening up.</span>

You can promise infinite amount of health care, but you can&#39;t pay for an infinite amount of health care. And that&#39;s what makes the Conservative Party under a charret leadership different. Charret balances the social need with the cost. The Liberals don&#39;t. I mean, when the Liberals start falling in line with the NDP that have never cared about the cost of a program, that is a serious problem. It&#39;s a serious problem problem for Canadians. It&#39;s not a problem of socialism, which is, you know, what Pierre Polyev is screaming about tonight. It&#39;s a problem of affordability.

Stephen Carter, you know, ink to be spilled, ink not yet dry in terms of what the UCP are going to do. There&#39;s much speculation. Is it more polling stations in Red Deer on April 9th?

            <span class="text">Look, I&#39;m of two minds. One is that it is unclear who it benefits because, keep in mind, the rebel constituencies who brought forward the resolution that the UCP executive largely ignored besides just saying, okay, we&#39;ll move this up a little bit of time, asked that this be a vote where people could vote anywhere, that it would be as expansive as possible. So if your lens is, I don&#39;t like Jason Kenney, and I believe calling for a vote anywhere is to my advantage, plus Jason Kenney&#39;s executive says, I do like Jason Kenney, and I believe a narrower vote that drags you to Red Deer is to our advantage, then it&#39;s not necessarily immediately clear to me that expanding the franchise is good for Jason Kenney and bad for everybody else. That said, all warfare is based on asymmetry, and there is a big asymmetry of information here.</span>

There are undoubtedly people in this province who thought, yeah, you know what? I&#39;m not going to Red – I would have bought the membership. I would have paid the registration fee, but I&#39;m not going to Red Deer. That&#39;s pretty far. And I hear there&#39;s already 14,000 people, and it&#39;s going to be chaos.
