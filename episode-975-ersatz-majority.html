          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the rumours of a Liberal/NDP deal to maintain the current parliament through 2025 - plus an update on the ever-growing UCP leadership review. Who wins in the reported deal? Should blue Liberals be nervous? And did everybody purchase tickets to the live show on April 10 yet? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

You know, Corey said six years since we&#39;ve done it. Just, you know, come see how we&#39;ve aged. Come see how we&#39;ve aged and not matured. It is going to be the same type of show that those who were privileged, I would say, Carter, harder uh some more than half decade back we&#39;ll get uh we we make it up as we go this is not pre-recorded stage programming that we just sit there like a dj kind of spinning our tracks and greatest hits no no we create a new show for you on the stage while all of you sit in seats side by side facing the same direction i mean this is groundbreaking here</div>

But we&#39;ll leave that there and we&#39;ll move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, keep your friends close and keep your enemies running in a leadership race to define whatever the fuck they are as a political party. Guys, I want to talk about the breaking news. No, not the Strategist Live, Corey. No, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about. I am talking about, once again, strategistlive.com. I&#39;m talking about the federal liberals and the NDs have worked on a tentative agreement that, if finalized, would keep Prime Prime Minister Trudeau&#39;s government in power until 2025 in exchange for progress on longstanding NDP priorities, i.e. making progress, quote unquote, on pharma care and dental care. The deal worked out by party leadership is still pending the sign off from NDP MPs. But we&#39;re told that the liberal cabinet had an emergency or special meeting tonight. Carter, when you saw this headline come by, give me your initial thoughts. I&#39;m going to ask you for the same. What are you thinking when you saw this deal that the Indies and the Liberals federally tried to get off the ground or some version of this back in November? I mean, now it seems like sources are certainly saying that it&#39;s pretty close to the finish line here. Your first thoughts when you heard about this, Carter?</div>

            <div class="said">They don&#39;t get to just act as a de facto majority government. They get effectively a majority government. The NDP gets some longstanding initiatives, and Jagmeet Singh gets the ability to say and take credit for some of the liberal policy initiatives, some which were already liberal policies, such as taxes on banks, increasing that wealth tax. But I can say this was part of the deal for support. And the conservatives get to freak out for the next few years without risking the fall of the government in an election they&#39;re not ready for. So everybody gets a little bit of something here. And of course, the conservatives will talk about this dreadful liberal</div>

            <div class="said">like, this reporting, could it fundamentally change the structure of the deal? And what we haven&#39;t spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about is what the impact of media leaks or media reporting and sourcing is to ongoing negotiations, right? The ink isn&#39;t dry here on this thing. There&#39;s still being things approved. approved i&#39;m kind of wondering from your perspective when you read this did you read this as like reporting on a formality that was going to happen or or did you kind of read this as like you know shit could change here and because of this reporting that&#39;s come out in advance of the ink being dried and all the the rubber stamps being put in and maybe kind of leads to a broader conversation on on on what leaking does or what what sourcing and reporting does and i don&#39;t know if anything was leaked here is to be totally clear to to ongoing negotiations So just your thoughts on that, based on how you read it. I know that&#39;s a very convoluted statement, but I thought I&#39;d just get you to react to that.</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah. So it&#39;s sometimes fine, right? As long as everybody is acting with perfect information and everybody is presenting things in a way that that both parties would agree with. Where you run into trouble is when one side is saying, hey, we&#39;re having these negotiations and they&#39;re going this way. And the other side says, that&#39;s not at all how I feel the negotiations are going. So as long as the negotiations were managed well, and they got to a point where they said, we are going to say these things to our caucus, no surprises is what we&#39;re going to communicate. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a ton of risk there. However, of course, if the liberals have presented this in a bad faith way or in a way that shows that maybe they&#39;re not willing or interested in being totally forthright with their caucus. That&#39;s a problem internally in the Liberal Party, for sure. But that&#39;s also a problem in negotiations, because then you can&#39;t really trust your counterparty in the same way. And where this could really blow up is if people start using saying things like, is a better deal for us than the NDP, right? Because then people in the NDP may start feeling the same thing. What I imagine both of them are doing, because there&#39;s going to be savvy negotiators on both side is saying, this is is a win-win deal the ndp get this we get this it&#39;s to everybody&#39;s benefit i&#39;ve signed off on this but we won&#39;t do it without your support as well and um we just we just don&#39;t know enough and this is a funny one because we&#39;re doing an episode right now it&#39;s 10 p.m mountain time which is the official time zone of canada as we all know as we know correct on on monday march 21st by this time tomorrow i&#39;m sure all of these details will be spilled out all of these details will be spilled out another thing i want to say though not surprising the leaks would come from the liberal side first because it&#39;s a bigger caucus i mean it&#39;s as simple as that yeah if if you considered an equal amount of leaking probability per mp the</div>

            <div class="said">so for sure people are going to ask that and i think that&#39;s where my point is you need to stick to the script of your leadership you need to say it&#39;s not about advantage it&#39;s about reflecting the will of the people we both get something we want and don&#39;t take the bait on that because that&#39;s the kind of thing that can poison the deal before the deal has been signed off on if people start hearing like yeah the prime minister Mr. said, it&#39;s a great deal. We fucked the NDP. They&#39;re screwed for a generation because that ding dong Jagmeet Singh agreed to just sell out his party. Right? Can&#39;t do it. Can&#39;t do it if you want the deal. And especially, you know, we talked about if there&#39;s kind of a longer term play here, not saying there is, but that would be really quite poison if that was the case. I actually don&#39;t think, however, that that&#39;s the biggest argument against doing this deal. On the liberal side, you mean?

Jean Charest called by many the, you know, try to occupy the more PC lane here, the more traditional conservative lanes here. Does this message differ a lot from what Carter said here that a blue liberal inside the caucus might say versus Jean Charest, who kind of wants to lead the conservative party with the perhaps a tinge of red or perhaps more of the center as part of his coalition?

            <div class="said">Well, you bring up an interesting point, and maybe it&#39;s not the point you wanted to dig into, but one of the best things Justin Trudeau has going for him in terms of party unity and not necessarily bleeding those blue liberals somewhere else, that is a giant gap to leap over to join today&#39;s conservative party, right? They have really put themselves in a relatively extreme extreme position. And, and I suspect that if you had somebody like Jean Charest as the leader of the conservatives, yeah, they would have trouble keeping their rightward flank together, but might be much more appealing to some of those blue liberals who, who would never join, for example, even the O&#39;Toole Conservative Party, certainly not the sheer Conservative Party, certainly not the Harper Conservative Party. So it&#39;s tough to say, like, all of this is so very much in flux But if I were Jean Charest, I know I would be using it as a bit of a proof point that the center is opening up.</div>

Charret balances the social need with the cost. The Liberals don&#39;t. I mean, when the Liberals start falling in line with the NDP that have never cared about the cost of a program, that is a serious problem. It&#39;s a serious problem problem for Canadians.

Stephen Carter, you know, ink to be spilled, ink not yet dry in terms of what the UCP are going to do. There&#39;s much speculation. Is it more polling stations in Red Deer on April 9th? Is it remote polling stations in Calgary, Edmonton, and other parts of the province on that day, but now also thinking other days, including the entire weekend? The deadline to become a member, to be clear, has ended. You could still register to go for the special meeting, the leadership review, but a deadline to be a member has elapsed. Stephen Carter, top line, regardless of what the vote change is or the rules change is, does a rule change have distinct winners and losers here in your mind? Let&#39;s start there and then we&#39;ll dig into what the rule changes could be.

So if your lens is, I don&#39;t like Jason Kenney, and I believe calling for a vote anywhere is to my advantage, plus Jason Kenney&#39;s executive says, I do like Jason Kenney, and I believe a narrower vote that drags you to Red Deer is to our advantage, then it&#39;s not necessarily immediately clear to me that expanding the franchise is good for Jason Kenney and bad for everybody else.
