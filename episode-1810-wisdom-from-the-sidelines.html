And it sort of ties into some of the bigger changes in politics where leaders&#39; offices have become so omnipotent and candidates are just little cogs in the machine. And it&#39;s interesting to me because I think if somebody actually wants to break that model down the road, they&#39;re going to need to, as an MLA, kind of take on for themselves the role of organizer again. Because I think the average MLA has abandoned the role of organizer. And so it&#39;s pretty tough for me to say that</span>

            <span class="text">they&#39;re going to get any power back. Like the power comes from the membership. And they&#39;ve shown in this case, and almost every other case I can think of recently, that the caucus is not the source of membership power. It&#39;s really interesting. So I think that&#39;s one of the things that I&#39;m kind of interested in. And I think that when you have so many MLAs who were not on the kind of endorsement side, I do think it creates a dynamic, not one that&#39;s necessarily dangerous for Nahed Nenshi. Like I said, he won with 86% of the vote, but how many MLAs are fucking panicking right now? Like not, oh my God, I&#39;m going to lose my job, but I&#39;m no longer at the center of power in this party. So, you</span>

            <span class="text">you know, a nickel&#39;s worth of free advice for Nahed Nenshi, who I guarantee you is not listening, is reach out to all of these people. Make sure that they, you know, it&#39;s one thing to say these words in a speech. It&#39;s quite a different one for the leader to reach out and have sincere outreach and create those connections. And it&#39;s a big caucus. It&#39;s going to take a lot of work. But I think that&#39;s one of the dynamics I&#39;m looking at. And then the final one, frankly, is with a super, super majority like 86%, what&#39;s he got in mind? Because, yeah, we&#39;ve talked a little bit about the connection to the federal NDP. There&#39;s been models where it&#39;s as simple as a checkbox. There&#39;s obviously bigger disassociations possible, but fuck it, he could do anything with 86%. Like anything. He could make himself god king of the party with kind of perpetual mandate if he wants. That&#39;s a lot. a vote so is he going to use that in any kind of party sense or is that just not where his focus is going to be zane probably knows not asking him no no you know what i what i</span>

So you got to sort of watch out for that. But obviously, when the membership is giving the direct mandate, it has a little bit more of a durability. And we&#39;ve seen that as well in other jurisdictions, like in the UK, where the caucus hated Corbyn, and</span>

Now, did they get into the race thinking that they could win? Yeah, I think they did. And then when the Nenshi entered, um, the the math changed. And we saw that with Raki Pancholi. She decided not to run for the party. She decided to run to Nenji and that worked for her. So good for her and good for the others for staying in there and hopefully not leaving with debt.

            <span class="text">No, not at all, because there are branches of every political party, and often you will see somebody say, well, you&#39;ve got to represent this branch, right? You&#39;ve got to go and you&#39;ve got to wave the flag for the fiscal conservatives, the social conservatives, the environmentalists, the labor wing of the party, right? And Gil McGowan, probably a great example of labor in this most recent race. You&#39;ve got to represent labor. The NDP race right now looks like it&#39;s a bunch of new, new Democrats. Where&#39;s labor? And so Gil McGowan enters the race. I think that that&#39;s a really important one, too, and it manifests in a different ways. And I say the cause, because the cause might not even be something like labor or a policy or a philosophy. Sometimes the cause is different.</span>

            <span class="text">different. Sometimes it&#39;s more personal. And I think an example of that would be the race that Daniel Smith won. One, Travis Taves came in second. He was the finance minister.</span>

He didn&#39;t necessarily have his heart in it, but he was considered like the grown-up in the room, like a very serious, credible fellow of the Jason Kenney mold. And a lot of the people around Jason Kenney said, you&#39;ve got to run. You&#39;ve got to support basically this philosophy of the UCP. And so sometimes the cause is as simple as that. Sometimes the cause is the people around you and saying, you know, we&#39;re all going to be in this together because we&#39;ve always been in this together. And you see this a lot in leadership races, right? Like I can think of the 2006 liberal race where the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">where I think candidates get themselves into trouble is where, and where I think they start to board the delusion train that Stephen&#39;s talking about, is when they decided they were going to run for one reason, and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">steven said all of these people joined the party to win or like join the race to win and then only one of them realized when they couldn&#39;t win that maybe they shouldn&#39;t be in the race and i think racky played this brilliantly for what it&#39;s worth i think she&#39;s one of the real winners here she was just made deputy leader today that all tracks for me but i think that uh if you ran to win and now you&#39;re running for the party and you some of of your supporters came on to win and you&#39;re running for a different reason, maybe you&#39;re not being 100% truthful with people, maybe your communications don&#39;t match that, maybe there&#39;s a big disconnect. Problems in communications, problems in politics come from when two people have an entirely different understanding and yet the same end goal. And so it can cause things like people spending money they don&#39;t have because they think they&#39;re going to win, right? And so they run up debts. It can cause situations where somebody doesn&#39;t try that hard because they don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to win but the people around them are going to the mat and then that might create resentment down the road so i it&#39;s really challenging when you drift from one of these categories into the other accidentally and without intentional strong conversations in that spot and let me just sort of wrap by saying if</span>

And it&#39;s just kind of gone up with inflation. So the rules are very constrained on how much money you can raise, but they&#39;re not constrained on how much money you can spend. So you can lend yourself basically as much money as you want. That coupled with the fact that everybody is spending for</span>

            <span class="text">And Stephen, you said at one point, lend yourself money. Well, in most jurisdictions, you really can&#39;t anymore, because that was one of the ways that leadership candidates got incredible debts. This has really become more of an accounts payable, accounts receivable problem. You&#39;ve talked about the spending of the $10,000 three different ways.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Part of the problem is that $10,000 might not actually be in hand yet. It might be a pledge for $10,000. Maybe it&#39;s going to come in over three months or something like that, right? And you&#39;re spending multiple times money that&#39;s not even in the door yet. And political parties in general tend to have pretty lax financial controls. It&#39;s something political parties need to get way better at, and they&#39;re supposed to be better at it, but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re not very good at it because political parties are built, including leadership campaigns and leadership candidacies, are built to last for like a few months. They&#39;re not these rocks upon which you can build whatever the fuck you want. They are designed to fall to pieces in front of you after 30 days, after 90 days, after 120 days, because any time and money you spend in durability is wasted time and money because the thing doesn&#39;t need to exist the day after the election.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s really interesting, Corey, and an interesting piece of analysis by both of you in regards to how it can hang on. And the Carter the Merrill side is interesting. I guess the question I have regarding campaign financing, Carter, is at the end of the day, um do you have to have a system in place even if you have this campaign being built for like a very small process for very small number of weeks months that that you you have a rule of money coming in has to uh hit the bank before money goes out or is that just not the way modern politics can work. And I know that&#39;s not the way. No, no, no organization. No,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I know that. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question. And do we need to do politics in this case differently? Because there&#39;s another interesting question that Carter talked about, which is this aspect of the limitations of money. If you&#39;re unpopular, 500 grand can do very little in certain cases to kind of boost that popularity or bridge that popularity towards viability. But talk to me about processes here, Carter. I know we&#39;re getting a bit nerdy on this, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked about this before. What would Stephen Carter do on his financial controls process in a leadership race? Because I think that is quite interesting to me.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And there is only one person on the campaign that can approve the expenses. That person doesn&#39;t have signing authority on the account. So that person is removed from being the person who can sign the checks right so the person who is responsible for for saying yes or no is this independent arbiter who is literally in control of the entire spending process and is on the fundraising team so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

Let&#39;s just have the full argument. Let&#39;s have the full conversation here. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going on. Here&#39;s what I think.

So you can say, this is not a hypothetical. This is exactly the situation we faced last time. And we were okay. I&#39;m not saying we were okay because of like just some sort of natural gravity and inertia. It&#39;s going to take some hard work, but let&#39;s fucking talk about this. You know what&#39;s going to guarantee the liberal party to implode and be back to where it was in the Ignatiev days or worse? If we all lose our heads. And so let&#39;s talk about what can really occur in the next year and the best thing we can do is be a strong team with a good product that will ultimately deliver at the polls will it be government i sure hope so i believe there&#39;s a way but even if it&#39;s not if we play a fundamentals game we&#39;re</span>
