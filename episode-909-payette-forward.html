            <span class="text">This is a strategist episode 909. My name is Zain Velji. With me as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Guys, an emergency episode. Massive, massive news here in Canada. I mean, listen, this is no joke. Our governor general has resigned. We are on the verge of a constitutional crisis.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">So I&#39;m not even going to let you speak. I&#39;m going to move it on to our first segment. Redo at Redo. Guys, Julie Payette is gone. Stephen Carter, this is big, big news. A big stain, a scar on the Trudeau government. Tell us what you&#39;re thinking. How are you processing this? What&#39;s going through your head?</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, Corey. Corey, I mean, Corey, we&#39;re in the middle. We&#39;re in the verge. We&#39;re right at the edge. Constitutional crisis. Julie Payet is gone. A scathing report that&#39;s going to be leaked to the public. This has to be something that the Trudeau government wishes that they didn&#39;t get into. What&#39;s your take? What are you thinking?</span>
