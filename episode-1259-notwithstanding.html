            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">politicians are incented to read the room and deal with the event in front of them but at some point when beyond that whether it&#39;s 24 hours or two weeks later the continuum does fucking matter like it does like and like and i&#39;m not even talking about the continuum historically backwards i&#39;m now talking about forwards and i think that like this carte blanche that western nations in large part have given to israel is</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is going to i&#39;m just going to say for now is going to be interesting to observe and that&#39;s the lightest touch i will give it because i i think this is going to be a it&#39;s already a humanitarian crisis um and and it&#39;s bordering on war crimes if if not already is, in terms of what they are doing to innocent Gazans and Palestinians right now.</span>

            <span class="text">in this situation. And when I say someone like me to bring folks up to speed, yeah, like, okay, so and this is where I think conversations were getting reductive. This is one example where someone accused me of, you know, being a rational, empathetic person, but like, because I&#39;m Muslim, I had to pick this certain side. I don&#39;t agree with that. It&#39;s more so that like, being Muslim is one of my several identities. It is one of the several things I am. It informs my perspective. It doesn&#39;t decide my perspective. And to boil this down is to simply, simply a</span>

            <span class="text">is I think oversimplifying it. So I am glad that we had that conversation. I could speak where I was at. I did text some friends afterwards, send some messages to friends, you know, Jewish friends that didn&#39;t know how to deal with the situation in the sense of like what to say to them, how to say that. so yeah i mean i think it was helpful did the public find it helpful i don&#39;t give a fuck i never have so um here we are carter</span>

Yesterday was the one-year anniversary of when Daniel Smith was sworn in as premier following the UCP leadership race. I don&#39;t know if you guys know this. She celebrated her one-year anniversary with a 1,500-word year-in-review statement posted kind of like as a government news release, highlighted all she&#39;s accomplished. That&#39;s one anniversary. Another one is coming up next week, Carter. You might know about this one. Next week, two-year anniversary of when Calgary&#39;s current city council was sworn in. So they&#39;re two years in. They have two more years to go before the next election. So I don&#39;t want to necessarily talk about the specific city council, Daniel Smith, but kind of the broader topic of anniversaries. And I want to pick your guys&#39; brains about kind of the strategy. strategy from a strategy point of view do</span>

Today is the most important day in any politician&#39;s career. It is the moment we were, you know, we talked about this last episode with the whole Israel piece. I mean, you have to be responding in the moment to whatever is happening in the moment. That</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That is part of our jobs as politicians, but no one keeps track and no one keeps score. What are the elements that we actually achieved? what do we actually do no one else is keeping score the media used to do some of that score keeping they used to do report</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah they used to do the report cards they used to do those those kind of here we are a year in review what happened um what&#39;s going to happen where you know where are we on the plan they don&#39;t have the resources to do that anymore so it&#39;s kind of fallen on the individual politician um to you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Conversely, and Zane, I&#39;ll bring you in here, like, what if you haven&#39;t achieved a ton? And I think about perhaps, and Carter, maybe you have thoughts on this, but the city council thing, like, you know, next year, let&#39;s say the next week, let&#39;s say there&#39;s counselors saying, yeah, totally two years in, and then you have the public saying, like, well, what has been accomplished in two years? Zane, anniversaries, your take? Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, man, that&#39;s a good question. Like, what if you haven&#39;t achieved much? Because, you know, it goes back, maybe I&#39;ll start with that answer. Because I think it goes back to the fundamentals that I think at least you would understand better than that even Carter and I around the media and the accountability. because these anniversaries are made-up milestones that give you an excuse to broadcast political victories, real or not. And what&#39;s gone beyond the report cards that the political media used to provide to the public as a public service is that we&#39;ve also lost a couple of things that have really given politicians very frictionless runway to celebrate anniversaries and to become their own news source, so to speak, right? So any political backlash in terms of misusing government resources to celebrate even</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">even capital P partisan victories, we don&#39;t really care. We don&#39;t even care if it has an erosion of public trust, or if there&#39;s even sort of like selective memory, or if we&#39;re kind of molding things, if we&#39;re prematurely saying something thing was a success, right? Like, the fact is, outside of a few big files where success is going to be delivered based on a suite or a singular outcome, most things that governments promise to do, they have set internal markers that allow them to declare success. And even if they haven&#39;t, who gives a fuck, right? Like, we&#39;re in this era where the lack of accountability to doing that, whether that be wasting public resources or that selective memory, allows people to tell the story. So the cynical political operative in me would be to say, if you feel like you haven&#39;t achieved anything, who&#39;s to say you haven&#39;t achieved anything, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right? Right? We would say, like, no, you actually have. In fact, you want to take the piece of this, piece of that, make this a broader story. You mold it. You mold it, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Am I a fan of them? As a political operative, perhaps supporting a politician, I think I am. I think Carter makes some really good points around why they&#39;re useful, despite some of the things I&#39;ve said. And maybe I&#39;ll kind of add a couple to the list, because Carter&#39;s really done, and you&#39;ve done a good job on scorekeeping, because no one else is doing it. It&#39;s legacy building.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s legacy building in the moment. You&#39;re telling a broader story about yourself, and you&#39;re molding it in a way that allows to strengthen that personal brand, perhaps engage with your supporter base, raise a couple of bucks, highlight your successes, but also legacy build. And I think the politicians—and we&#39;ve talked about legacy at length on several pods around how do you frame it, how do you do it, do politicians hold off too much to the end to make the last run of their—or the last, you know, chapters of their political career purely on legacy. Legacy is built early and often, and I think using the tools given to you, especially with access to government, allows you to build some of that legacy as well. And I think that&#39;s another important one. And perhaps one of the bigger ones, if I am advising a politician on not what just today looks like, but what the capstone of their leadership looks like, as we&#39;ve discussed, because there&#39;s reasons you&#39;ll need another job someday, you&#39;ll need something to define yourself on, you&#39;ll need something to go back to the electorate on to be even more practical about it. That legacy building on the government dollar.</span>

            <span class="text">i think i think it is people know i think it&#39;s a huge problem right we&#39;ve seen this in the last decade that political entities, well, we&#39;ve seen a couple of things. Let&#39;s summarize over the course of the last two decades, right? A, ongoing campaign. We&#39;ve talked about that constantly. We&#39;re always in campaign mode. Most politicians worth their salt, either whether they&#39;re part of the party infrastructure or a single shingle counselor, they have a political machine. Small or big, they understand the value that has become normal, right, in our politics these days. Number Number two, we&#39;ve talked about the erosion of media. And number three, we&#39;ve talked about the erecting of political parties starting their own media. We&#39;ve seen that in a couple of ways. We&#39;ve seen failed slash quasi-successful experiments like Doug Ford&#39;s own PCTV, I believe that&#39;s what it was called, during an election, and then into the new year. In fact, I think he even tried to use government resources to create his own mini YouTube channel. I don&#39;t know how long that lasted, but you&#39;ll see. And this would be a perfect conversation for Corey, who could explain to me what a government sort of ongoing communications broadcast looks like, because most public engagement and public affairs bureaus, whatever they&#39;re called across the country, provincially, have some version of that. And if you want to make that simplistic, they&#39;re trying to run their own TV network, right? They&#39;re trying to run their own, and you might, I haven&#39;t used the P word yet, but there is propaganda associated with that. Everyone does it across the board, regardless of Jersey color, right? So is there a cost to this? Yes, because we&#39;re losing objectivity. We have this one-sided, in the spirit of communicating to the public, including successes, not just what you get, and we&#39;re now kind of going into this lane of governments having endless opportunity to communicate unabated, right? Of course, you&#39;ve got opposition parties, we can talk about them. The second thing here, though, as it relates to what this could mean for the team, I just want to quickly jump in on this, because I think Carter and I perhaps have a very similar philosophy. In fact, I would argue, Carter, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever discussed this on the pod, you and I probably have a very similar style to campaign managing, which is find the A players and let them skate. Is that fair? Like, for the most part? And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you do that beyond the talent is, you know, you mature the pipeline, you have people take over the campaign so that we don&#39;t have to fucking do these things until we&#39;re Carter&#39;s age, right? Right, but as part of that, though, any good leader, whether they&#39;re a chief of staff in an office or a manager of a campaign or the principal politician themselves, wants to use these anniversaries as motivation and retention. They want to use them as team building. They want to publicly acknowledge, you&#39;ll see the best do this well, publicly acknowledge who on the team helped cross certain things off the list, make huge gains. it doesn&#39;t matter jack shit to the public it matters the world to the person right that is huge especially in this line of work where um where many people feel like it&#39;s thankless and the day-to-day is a fucking grind and then the last sort of thing i&#39;d kind of add that i find interesting to your question at least is this concept of identity and belonging one</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">one of the things that like i think these successes allow people to do solely but surely kind of like legacy building, is crystallize their identity, that the movement is having success, that our policies are moving forward. I still belong in this camp. It reminds them that they&#39;re not just part of a winning team, but a team that they have connection to. And it&#39;s those small things, I would argue, done repetitively, done often, that&#39;s solid. That&#39;s what makes a political base. I mean, I would love to do an entire pod one day about what makes a political base, but it is constant reinforcement of one&#39;s identity position to the point of sometimes fault where it could become like a vacuum and it&#39;s the only thing you ever hear in a silo but that is huge this sort of stuff is huge um to reinforce people&#39;s belonging and sense of belonging because that is what creates your base of support carter</span>

            <span class="text">is part of the overall scheme of things. You don&#39;t get anything in politics without asking for it. So you&#39;ve got to set up your narratives to show people what they want to see. I think that this is one of the key elements of politics. I was just chatting with someone about it today. You don&#39;t get anywhere without telling people exactly what they should be seeing. And it&#39;s something that&#39;s set up early in a campaign. And that&#39;s showing them what they&#39;re going to see is way more important sometimes than actually, you know, kind of the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Your question kind of reminds me of something I pitched to a politician once, and I&#39;m kind of curious to get you, can I, I&#39;m going to do it here and see you get your guys&#39; take. Oh, love it. Which was, I don&#39;t remember what the issue was, but I think it was municipal and I think it was Calgary. So maybe I&#39;m pitching Nahid about this, which rings a bell. But there was something that happened in the city, like a monumental policy success. And it was monumental because there was a lot of authors to it. It was monumental because it took a long time coming. and and my suggestion was we need to have like a big fucking party like a big blowout because i think we there&#39;s something really interesting about politics it&#39;s like we celebrate on election night the base celebrates at an agm once every couple years but we actually don&#39;t really get together and celebrate like we don&#39;t actually see one another as a as a group uh even whether we consider ourselves part of a base or a membership all that often and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and and i think that when we look at even more local level, and I know one of your topics, Annalise, is maybe to drill down on city council, but at a local level, the ability to celebrate successes is so easy because you&#39;re in the same geographical space. And it&#39;s not all that challenging on a provincial, if not national level. But the idea was very simple. You know, it&#39;s about everything. Express that gratitude, have that promotion and positivity, that positive culture. But like, get together, together have people celebrate the success getting something across the finish line and use it as like an a a ability to like carry on for the next chapter and i don&#39;t think we fill people&#39;s gas tanks enough from like a pure organizing perspective and i don&#39;t mean to make this organizing school but like there there could be there is a world where i could see politicians not taking victory laps being like this is a big fucking deal housing for example like at city city council. We&#39;re going to bring every stakeholder who made this happen. We&#39;re going to figure out how to pay for it. We&#39;ll figure that shit out, like that stuff can be taken care of. But we want all these people together to get that media coverage, to get that ability to get to know one another and to showcase what the lift is. We just don&#39;t do that enough. And I don&#39;t understand why. Because we know from all of our corporate culture, sort of research, academic and otherwise, wise that celebrations actually add so much disproportionate fuel then they actually take away from resourcing that i don&#39;t know why politics has not embraced this this this mantra uh so to speak do</span>

And I was like, this requires like one of those national election night style parties because something big just happened. And I&#39;m happy to give up whatever political costs that symbolism would have celebrating like a mission accomplished, but fuck it, get all of us in a room, make sure we&#39;re all like happy about something and then say there&#39;s another chapter. It also reinforces leadership in an amazing way because you&#39;re also like convening, right? Like, and maybe this is just my leadership style that I&#39;m like trying to impress, but like the power to convene is fucking unparalleled and and so anyways i can go on for a while and this is not supposed to be that but yeah carter</span>

            <span class="text">makes such a good point, right? Like, there&#39;s some, like, one-on-one lessons here that, like, as a political leader, you want to make everyone around you, as many as you can, stakeholders in your success. And the way you do that is you also hand them the W. One of the things we kind of think of is, like, not to use psychology terms, we kind of think of things in a scarcity model, that prescribing many authors to a victory dilutes the victory. It actually compounds the victory, because all those folks become</span>

            <span class="text">become a stakeholder in your Pure success, right? Because at the end of the day, there&#39;s only a half a dozen of us that are on a ballot somewhere. Yes, and if I can own a victory as much as you can, elected official, it helps. And I&#39;m talking here as a third party civilian, not even as a staffer or someone who&#39;s paid to kind of push a particular thing up a hill and get it across the finish line. So, I mean, the main lesson for me here is that I think, you know, I haven&#39;t read what Danielle Smith has written, and I don&#39;t even think that&#39;s part of the point, at least, right? It&#39;s this concept of, like, if this is a tool that she&#39;s using to prescribe credit, to bring people in, to give people credit for what crossed the finish line and to recharge their batteries, power to her. Like, easy, simple political tool rooted in culture and HR, like, we don&#39;t use it enough.</span>

Right. The name recognition and the ability to mold and tell your own story while greater and less friction today do that than ever before was always a key foundation to securing election or reelection.

Give them the counterproposal. That&#39;s fine. But from the public perspective, the advice I would give is pick the soft tissue. What here is actually a liability that they&#39;re calling a win and what here is missing? And what then converges with what the public demands of this government? Because you can be a government, write 1,500 words, call everything a success, and people can still call you a failure right that is your fucking job what is the soft tissue here right it might be it may not be any one of these policies it might be one of these policies it is to find out what the soft tissue is and attack that at scale and so i think the whole list is a trap it&#39;s kind of equivalent to you know the opposing counsel sending you multiple boxes of discovery right it&#39;s your job here is to find the one thing the two things that matter that tell a broader story don&#39;t get caught caught up in all of it okay</span>

We&#39;ve discussed this on the pod. But the fact that like, oh, yeah, as parents should, I mean, people give half a second enough thought to this and the fact is the framing is in his favor and this is a shortcut to a strong man strategy you need a shot in the arm we talked about motivating your team holy fuck something like this motivates your team um but if the framing catches them on the wrong side which is my hope and hoping to work on that in some way shape or form around this is an abuse of power and picking on trans kids, while knowing it causes them irreparable harm, it&#39;s</span>

Do you want to make this about the constitutionality and legality of the Notwithstanding Clause, for which I should mention, to add to Carter&#39;s historical description, I think we can say, and perhaps even an oversimplistic term, has largely almost, and if not exclusively, been used to undermine minority rights in this country. I can&#39;t think of one option, one scenario where it has not, right? So if we&#39;re looking at it this way, we can talk about who&#39;s next. It&#39;s trans kids today, who&#39;s tomorrow? Is it going to be workers? Is it going to be you? Is it going to be a specific group of folks? That&#39;s a pathway to talk about it. Or if you want to talk about the issue at hand, the big mistake that I think the group&#39;s trying to, maybe not mistake, but perhaps strategic oversight or maybe not aligned on messaging, is that this is not about you and I as parents.

And he can be that defender, and he feels like he&#39;s going to succeed based on that.

They&#39;re not going to know where to go with this. Some are going to try to fight it on the parental rights frame. That seems to be a loser. some of them are going to go on a notwithstanding clause and its broader scope and abuse of power there may not be enough there and others will try to reframe the debate but he&#39;s suggesting it&#39;s already baked that&#39;s that&#39;s my my take i&#39;m curious if carter agrees yeah</span>

Yes. Yes, I would. Would you like to see government increase taxes? No, no, I wouldn&#39;t. That&#39;d be bad. Would you like to see services cut?

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right that he can shift minds is that people don&#39;t know what to think or how to think. And what Blaine Higgs started and Scott Moe is leaning on is an easily digestible framework that allows people to think about the issue. What they may not realize is that it&#39;s a deeply social conservative way about how to think about the issue. And it is quite divergent from how other social conservative issues have been internalized within the Canadian political zeitgeist, right? Like, it&#39;s very clear what what people thought around family values or sex education or pro or anti-abortion. This is an interesting issue because you have some like hardcore transphobes in the core of it that make the base and then a lot of what I&#39;d call reasonable people.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">are actually all, like, much more conflicted about our positions than we give other people credit for, right? So, like, on an issue, we&#39;re usually 60-40, 70-30 on an issue. That&#39;s enough comfort for us to be like, yeah, yeah, like, you know, insert any issue. I&#39;m probably 70-30 on it, right? There&#39;s some issues that I&#39;m like 100%, but, you know, 30% of me, like, kind of like, Like, you know, I make peace with it. We&#39;re all like that. But what we often criticize the other side of doing is just being 100% doubling down committed to it. And what I think the mistake for, if I can call us progressives, or folks who are against this particular policy, is to not make the mistake that there are multiple concentric circles. There is a base of homophobes, of transphobes. Fuck them. But there&#39;s a second circle that may even present like the first circle. They may even use the same lingo because they may feel like this is how they need to present to be part of this group. We talked about identity and belonging earlier. We can&#39;t write those folks off, right? So this is an organizing principle of like, that is where the opportunity is. And this is why I think, Stephen, if I&#39;m not mistaken, you think it&#39;s so malleable, right? There&#39;s this ability. The second and third concentric circles who have bought the frame, have mindlessly ingested it, not even thought about it, can be flipped if the frame shifts. The question I then have goes back to the point I made earlier, has the frame been locked in, especially given the timeline for Moe, in Moe&#39;s case, from a longitudinal perspective in this country? No, I&#39;m very optimistic. But from Moe enacting this, notwithstanding, and getting the political success between now and whenever he has an election, 12, 11 months from now, I don&#39;t know.</span>

People have been—this is a novel concept on its own right. People have needed a frame. You have a winning frame currently. It&#39;s not going to last forever if the other side of this equation starts figuring out a consolidated strategy to shift that.

That is fundamentally different than everything else that you&#39;ve tried to force down the throats of Canadians that are social conservative policy. policy and so the the folks that you think are your base on this are not your base on this that would be my warning and frankly partially my hope um</span>
