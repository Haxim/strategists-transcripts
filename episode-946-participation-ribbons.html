Okay, so we&#39;re a couple days removed, so a lot of the analysis has been given, so to speak. But of course, with the podcast that finishes number one on the charts on Election Day, I&#39;m sure people expect higher of us, at least two of us, right, Corey? Oh,</span>

Did they overperform? Did they underperform? What&#39;s their future? Maybe we&#39;ll kind of use that as a basic skeleton. You&#39;re nodding your head as if you&#39;re listening, but I know you are not, especially after your expose last episode where you mentioned you don&#39;t listen to anything I said. So, Stephen Carter, maybe just repeat what I said before we move on.</span>

But this is this is crazy how little change, you know, you had one seat change for most of the parties, two seats for the Conservatives, two seats for the Liberals. It&#39;s nuts.

To lesser degrees and to lesser extents, but you&#39;re hearing leadership chatter for all three leaders and what this election means. So maybe we&#39;ll kind of, Corey, thank you for that frame.

And I think that each one of them is going to have to make a case to their members and supporters that they should stay. I think, frankly, Singh and O&#39;Toole should stay. I think Singh and O&#39;Toole should be given the opportunity to fight another election. But I think that Justin Trudeau, this is his third election, and he&#39;s won exactly one majority.

He didn&#39;t lose it. So it wasn&#39;t. So I&#39;m not going to pretend otherwise. But if I had ambitions on the leadership, I would be reminding people about how close that precipice was. And as much as you are seeing liberal partisans online rather breathlessly say, it&#39;s always worth it because it&#39;s a democracy. Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s not, you know, simple thought exercise for you here. If we called an election tomorrow, would that be worth it? Yeah,</span>

We&#39;ve got Bert Chen, one of the members of the Conservative Party of Canada, national sort of elected representatives, starting this online change.org petition, which has got about 2000 signatures to to recall Aaron O&#39;Toole. Now, that&#39;s not something they have in their constitution. So he&#39;s trying to trigger something, a new brand new process. But if you were on team, this guy isn&#39;t our cup of tea. He&#39;s not our pathway to success. What are some of the things you&#39;d be doing right now to stab the guy in the back, so to speak, if I can be so crass?</span>

And you bring in that energy and that venom from the PPC. Maybe like, look, I&#39;m not trying to be like the darkest man in the world and the most cynical political organizer ever. You don&#39;t need to take the absolute fringes of the PPC, but there&#39;s an awful lot of conservatives who went there. And I think if you could bring some of that energy into the campaigns and don&#39;t get me wrong there will be tensions on the local level as a result of this it&#39;s like fuck you you ran a candidate against me last time but if you can make uh the message that the real enemy here is erin o&#39;toole so to speak let&#39;s let bygones be bygones this is your last exit to do that because you do one more election like this these people will not be in the same room again for 10 years carter</span>

            <span class="text">carter i want to i want to get you to react to the Corey strategy, but maybe I want to put a slightly different challenge in front of you, which is, let&#39;s say you want to get rid of O&#39;Toole, okay? But you don&#39;t want to necessarily get rid of the lane that he picked in this election, the progressive conservative lane that he picked. So suppose you want to get rid of Aaron O&#39;Toole, but you actually think this centrist positioning that he had, not horrible. In fact, to your earlier point, what we need, He put out some things that are table stakes for a modern Canadian electorate. We need that. This fucker can&#39;t be the standard bearer for that. What is your strategy if that&#39;s your nuance take from what you believe? Because there&#39;s a few folks in the party that probably want to take the mantle from O&#39;Toole and be like, this fucker shouldn&#39;t be representing this PC brand. I should be doing it. Or this by proxy, this person should be doing it. So nuance challenge. Corey, I want to get your reaction to that afterwards, too. But Carter, you first. First of</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">We need to elect a leader that is the exact same in the leadership as they would be in the leadership or in the actual general election. Because that brand dissonance that we&#39;re creating is the reason that the PPC forms. It is the reason that Canadians don&#39;t trust Aaron O&#39;Toole. They don&#39;t trust the party. um so having you know having a a leader in in aaron o&#39;toole who is essentially duplicitous because he campaigned differently for the leadership than he campaigned for the actual election and canadians whether they are conservatives or not don&#39;t know who he is so he has to go and</span>

We are going to be true blue conservatives. And it may also have a leadership candidate that says, no, that&#39;s not the way we&#39;re going to run this. You know, it&#39;s James Moore. And he&#39;s saying we have to have a conservative party that can win in British Columbia on the coast of British Columbia. And that is a different conservative party than the one that Aaron O&#39;Toole ran to lead the leadership with.</span>

You&#39;re actually defining the problem rather than presenting the solution just yet. You&#39;re saying, and that problem is around duplicitousness, talking out of both sides of your mouth, et cetera. And then you eventually, you know, try your best to once again, occupy that lane, if I can paraphrase what you&#39;re saying. Is that fair,</span>

He&#39;ll take any position. Ultimately, his failure was because he tried to ride two horses with one ass. That&#39;s the general approach that Stephen has proposed here. And there&#39;s some logic to it. And in fact, you can start to point to the tensions within his campaign, the ones that we&#39;ve already pointed out, that caused some of those challenges. So you talk about, for example, the gun stuff. Well,</span>

And your problem is, well, that&#39;s a very, I think that&#39;s a pretty decent message for broad swaths of the public.

            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s move it on to the NDP. Jagmeet Singh, the NDP&#39;s performance, do both of them together. Your analysis on what you saw on election night. Some people say, you know, this guy is an expert at narrative versus numbers. He can, you know, dance away to the point where you&#39;re like, I guess he won something. But, you know, what he did win was once again, the power broker position, the kingmaker position in a minority parliament. So your reaction to, you know, the narratives about the NDP now, right? Is this once again, re-entrenching power broker? Is this a $25 million operation that needs to be shut down with this particular leader? What do you think of the NDP results and Jagmeet Singh by extension? I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">mean, I think that the NDP results are basically what the NDP results are. I mean, this is where they are because they&#39;re not seen to be likely to form a government. So at the end of the day, when the election day comes and everybody&#39;s going to go cast their ballot, the question is, do I want to elect an NDP member or do I want to elect a government member? And because they continue to struggle with their brand, they continue to struggle with who they are, they don&#39;t quite get there. And you know what? They appealed to youth before. They&#39;ve appealed to workers before. Their lack of a green policy, the fact that the green policy didn&#39;t reach the heights that it could have, really hurt them. And I think that Jagmeet Singh, frankly, appearing to be a rather significant child who is far more interested in trying to appeal to people on TikTok than appear to be a significant leader, really</span>

            <span class="text">really hurt them as well. Having said that, I think that Jagmeet Singh is growing into this job. I think that the people that are today watching TikToks, trying to decide who they&#39;re going to vote for, four years from now will be in a different position in their lives. A number of them will be married. Others will have children. They&#39;ll be facing different realities. And</span>

            <span class="text">if he is able to continue to build that relationship, I think that he could be someone who leads the NDP to another height. And I like the NDP for not throwing their leaders overboard with each performance. It feels to me like he&#39;s got one more good election in him to figure himself out. And I think that the NDP should have the patience to get them there. They&#39;re not a good party right now. They&#39;re not a good performer. But I think that they have the ability to get better. And if they commit themselves to that, that should be their course of action.</span>

And in fact, on this podcast, we have said that, you know, and I think, Corey, you have said, and I want to make sure it&#39;s in context. But, you know, depending on the circumstance, there could be merit for Jagmeet Singh to be the leader of this party for a very long time, especially as, you know, folks grow with him. But when we look at the performance of this election, they didn&#39;t, you know, their overall seat count may have grown a bit. Their vote poll didn&#39;t start with the number two, still in, you know, 16, 17%, if I&#39;m not mistaken, looking at the overall vote percentage. So it wasn&#39;t in the 20s. No evidence to show that the youth vote kind of came out in droves for Jagmeet. From your perspective on the NDP outcome, and by extension, what it might mean for Jagmeet Singh, and then we&#39;ll do the same exercise we&#39;ve been doing for O&#39;Toole and Trudeau.</span>

And the PPC signs here, I&#39;d say, were very competitive with the mainstream parties all across. Carter, I want to move on on the PPC. There&#39;s much to discuss there. We have to talk about Annemie Paul and the Green Party, right? Right. So to set the table, Toronto Centre, you know, she stayed there almost 95 percent of the campaign. She did not even come close to the vote totals that she had. This is her third time trying it, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Did not even come close to the vote totals she had during the by-election. The party as a whole secures Elizabeth May, loses Paul Manley and gets a seat in Kitchener. Primarily, if you want to put an asterisk on it, you can. And it might be well-deserved, primarily because the Liberal candidate, Saini, suspended his campaign and moved aside. Carter, the results for Annamie Paul in her riding, but then also the larger conversation on the Greens and their extremely depressed vote totals across the country, partially as a result of not fielding candidates in some key areas of the country. So, Carter, you know, absorb all of that and give me your take on the Greens as it stood from election night. The</span>

And that&#39;s a big deal. Because I don&#39;t think Elizabeth May has the kind of selflessness that Scott Bryson had when he stepped down for Joe Clark. You know, would Elizabeth May say to Anna Mae Paul, you know what, you need to come out here and I&#39;ll step out and you can take my seat because you&#39;re the future and I&#39;m the past. Does anybody think that&#39;s going to happen? Does anybody think that it&#39;s in Elizabeth May&#39;s wheelhouse to be that kind of selfless? I don&#39;t. I think that she&#39;s exactly the opposite type of selfish, and there&#39;s no way that that&#39;s ever going to happen.</span>

            <span class="text">By the final weekend, it was unlikely, knowing what we know now about the vote efficiency and how everything was playing out, that Aaron O&#39;Toole was going to win that election. He could have probably still held Justin Trudeau to a smaller minority and really made a strong case that it was the conservatives on the upswing. But there was just absolutely no chance to turn around what had become liberal momentum the minute the Jason Kenney story came out.</span>

            <span class="text">The narrative is, though, that Kenny is a convenient excuse for why O&#39;Toole lost the election. And for many here in Alberta, you know, the election was not what we were looking forward to on Monday. It was supposed to be the appetizer to the main meal, which was what was going to happen to Jason Kenney. The chattering class was alive and well. The volume on the fact that this guy is done, this guy is toast, it&#39;s all happening. And then, you know, right after the election, we hear that there&#39;s something happening. We&#39;re like, OK, is this the guy? Is he leaving? Has caucus pushed him out in advance of that caucus meeting on Wednesday? And what we hear, it&#39;s a cabinet shuffle. It&#39;s replacing the health minister, Tyler Shandro, with the labor minister, Jason Copping, and they would just do a job switch. Stephen Carter, what did you make of the cabinet, the mini cabinet shuffle, if we can call it that, that we saw here in Alberta? And specifically, it&#39;s very naked and perhaps obvious political goals of perhaps deflecting some of the anger against Jason Kenney, tying it to Tyler Shandro and saying that he&#39;s now, you know, resigned, and I&#39;ve accepted that resignation. And I&#39;m going to give Jason Copping, the Labor Minister, his role as the new Minister of Health. Do</span>

It&#39;s the cabinet shuffle, the Copping and Shandro trade, and then literally the day after when media were lined up to see, you know, when the leader was leaving, how he was leaving, who the new interim premier was, right? Right. This was speculation for those that are not familiar with the Alberta situation. This was all kind of bubbling through. We hear that Jason Kenney had effectively, you know, the vote of non-confidence at the caucus meeting was shut down and that a leadership review would be happening in March.

Are they, now that we have a date for a leadership review in March, which is earlier than it was supposed to be, because it was supposed Post initially, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, guys, beat March of 23. So it&#39;s moved forward, or I believe, if I&#39;m not mistaken, moved forward a year in a sense. Carter, you&#39;re the campaign manager for the rebels, right? This group that is made of distinct factions, have distinct ideologies, values, but might, should their anger still be true, believe the same thing. A, we need this guy out. B, because he&#39;s a massive liability heading into the next election. Walk me through some of the skeleton outlines, your stream of consciousness in terms of some of the things you&#39;re thinking about tactically, the strategies you have in mind, and some of the messaging and internal ploys you&#39;re thinking of as you now gear up for an internal campaign between now and March. And we&#39;ll continue to revisit this, but let&#39;s get a start of the conversation right now. And Corey, I&#39;ll come to you thereafter on the other team, which is Team Keep Kenny.</span>

The ability to get Albertans back to work, to ensure that we&#39;ve got the high paying jobs that we&#39;ve become accustomed to, to believe that we have a future in this province that is in excess of any other province. And that&#39;s where Jason Kenney&#39;s truly failed. He has been no different on the economy than the NDP were.</span>

He&#39;s got no more activity or no more concessions from the federal government. Instead, we&#39;ve just been able to coast on our COVID benefits. benefits. So he needs to stand up, he needs to do something economically, if he&#39;s going to gain our support. And that needs to be the party&#39;s position, because the party doesn&#39;t exist to just be a party that deals with COVID. They exist to be a party that deals with the economy.</span>

Because we&#39;re now in this really interesting position, where you&#39;re running an internal campaign of some kind, sometimes silent, sometimes explicit. against your leader or a campaign to prevent and defend your leader. So, Corey, give me your message. And then let&#39;s both you and Carter discuss tactics that we&#39;ve seen at play in the past and not very distant past here in Alberta as one proof point of that.

            <span class="text">In a way, your hand is somewhat freed by the actions of this week and with the calling of an obvious leadership vote, because in your contentious conversations Conversations with caucus from this point forward, you can say, well, take it up after the leadership vote, get stuffed, right? And so you have a little bit more ability to say to the fringes of your caucus, you&#39;re just not interested in hearing from them at this moment. They&#39;ve made clear their views, you&#39;re going to do what&#39;s right for Albertans. And so you have an opportunity to address your problems one by one with perhaps a little bit more range of motion than you did last week. Interestingly enough, right? So my view is Jason Kenney made two fundamental errors over the past couple of months. The first is the branding of the best summer ever, right?</span>

            <span class="text">Best summer ever. COVID&#39;s gone for good. Nobody was asking for these absolute statements. This was absolutely unnecessary, and they&#39;re being thrown back in his face an awful lot. And that&#39;s really, you know, that&#39;s the start of a public trust conversation. The other was, of course, disappearing in August and during the campaign and delaying, delaying, delaying to do what was necessary on COVID-19. And that was a decision that was quite literally fatal for Albertans, you know, many Albertans. And that&#39;s serious. And that&#39;s something that I think that is difficult to think about and difficult to address. But now, with your hands more freed, with the politics somewhat behind you, or at least resolved in the sense that March is coming, it&#39;s time to go hard on COVID-19. This needs to be very much in the rearview mirror come March.</span>

But you also need to clear the decks because you can&#39;t deal with any more of this bullshit incoming that you&#39;ve been having consequences on. So find yourself labor peace in the next couple of months here. Just buy that peace. Find yourself a bit of an accord with recipients of AISH. Find yourself some sort of way out of the curriculum mess that has been created.
