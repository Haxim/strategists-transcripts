        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter unpack the results from Election 2021 before turning attention to a week of high drama in Alberta politics. What do election results mean for the Liberals, Conservatives and NDP? Did Jason Kenney successfully thread the needle and live to fight another day? And why didn't Zain have a lighting round this episode? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

Each one of these leaders is now deservingly fighting for their lives because the question has to be asked, if this is the best they can do, is it good enough? And I think that each one of them is going to have to make a case to their members and supporters that they should stay. I think, frankly, Singh and O&#39;Toole should stay. I think Singh and O&#39;Toole should be given the opportunity to fight another election. But I think that Justin Trudeau, this is his third election, and he&#39;s won exactly one majority. This is the ballgame.</div>

I know we&#39;re in the moment, right? Like, so I want to acknowledge that. But this is also that malleable moment, and we&#39;re seeing it certainly in the conservative side of things, where petitions are out, knives are out, people People are jockeying, angling, trying to define the state of the leader. If you wanted to, you know, let&#39;s just say accelerate Trudeau&#39;s timeline, make sure he&#39;s got that one eye on, you know, succession planning. What would you be doing right now if you were in the Liberal Party and whether you or by proxy someone you know within the circle has ambitions to take over the job as the next leader of the Liberals?</div>

He didn&#39;t lose it. So it wasn&#39;t. So I&#39;m not going to pretend otherwise. But if I had ambitions on the leadership, I would be reminding people about how close that precipice was. And as much as you are seeing liberal partisans online rather breathlessly say, it&#39;s always worth it because it&#39;s a democracy. Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s not, you know, simple thought exercise for you here. If we called an election tomorrow, would that be worth it? Yeah,</div>

And you bring in that energy and that venom from the PPC. Maybe like, look, I&#39;m not trying to be like the darkest man in the world and the most cynical political organizer ever. You don&#39;t need to take the absolute fringes of the PPC, but there&#39;s an awful lot of conservatives who went there. And I think if you could bring some of that energy into the campaigns and don&#39;t get me wrong there will be tensions on the local level as a result of this it&#39;s like fuck you you ran a candidate against me last time but if you can make uh the message that the real enemy here is erin o&#39;toole so to speak let&#39;s let bygones be bygones this is your last exit to do that because you do one more election like this these people will not be in the same room again for 10 years carter</div>

          <div class="said">carter i want to i want to get you to react to the Corey strategy, but maybe I want to put a slightly different challenge in front of you, which is, let&#39;s say you want to get rid of O&#39;Toole, okay? But you don&#39;t want to necessarily get rid of the lane that he picked in this election, the progressive conservative lane that he picked. So suppose you want to get rid of Aaron O&#39;Toole, but you actually think this centrist positioning that he had, not horrible. In fact, to your earlier point, what we need, He put out some things that are table stakes for a modern Canadian electorate. We need that. This fucker can&#39;t be the standard bearer for that. What is your strategy if that&#39;s your nuance take from what you believe? Because there&#39;s a few folks in the party that probably want to take the mantle from O&#39;Toole and be like, this fucker shouldn&#39;t be representing this PC brand. I should be doing it. Or this by proxy, this person should be doing it. So nuance challenge. Corey, I want to get your reaction to that afterwards, too. But Carter, you first. First of</div>

He&#39;ll take any position. Ultimately, his failure was because he tried to ride two horses with one ass. That&#39;s the general approach that Stephen has proposed here.

But, you know, what he did win was once again, the power broker position, the kingmaker position in a minority parliament. So your reaction to, you know, the narratives about the NDP now, right? Is this once again, re-entrenching power broker? Is this a $25 million operation that needs to be shut down with this particular leader?

And because they continue to struggle with their brand, they continue to struggle with who they are, they don&#39;t quite get there. And you know what? They appealed to youth before. They&#39;ve appealed to workers before. Their lack of a green policy, the fact that the green policy didn&#39;t reach the heights that it could have, really hurt them.

And in fact, on this podcast, we have said that, you know, and I think, Corey, you have said, and I want to make sure it&#39;s in context. But, you know, depending on the circumstance, there could be merit for Jagmeet Singh to be the leader of this party for a very long time, especially as, you know, folks grow with him. But when we look at the performance of this election, they didn&#39;t, you know, their overall seat count may have grown a bit. Their vote poll didn&#39;t start with the number two, still in, you know, 16, 17%, if I&#39;m not mistaken, looking at the overall vote percentage. So it wasn&#39;t in the 20s. No evidence to show that the youth vote kind of came out in droves for Jagmeet. From your perspective on the NDP outcome, and by extension, what it might mean for Jagmeet Singh, and then we&#39;ll do the same exercise we&#39;ve been doing for O&#39;Toole and Trudeau.</div>

We have to talk about Annemie Paul and the Green Party, right? Right. So to set the table, Toronto Centre, you know, she stayed there almost 95 percent of the campaign. She did not even come close to the vote totals that she had. This is her third time trying it, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Did not even come close to the vote totals she had during the by-election. The party as a whole secures Elizabeth May, loses Paul Manley and gets a seat in Kitchener. Primarily, if you want to put an asterisk on it, you can. And it might be well-deserved, primarily because the Liberal candidate, Saini, suspended his campaign and moved aside. Carter, the results for Annamie Paul in her riding, but then also the larger conversation on the Greens and their extremely depressed vote totals across the country, partially as a result of not fielding candidates in some key areas of the country. So, Carter, you know, absorb all of that and give me your take on the Greens as it stood from election night. The</div>

It was supposed to be the appetizer to the main meal, which was what was going to happen to Jason Kenney. The chattering class was alive and well. The volume on the fact that this guy is done, this guy is toast, it&#39;s all happening. And then, you know, right after the election, we hear that there&#39;s something happening. We&#39;re like, OK, is this the guy? Is he leaving? Has caucus pushed him out in advance of that caucus meeting on Wednesday? And what we hear, it&#39;s a cabinet shuffle. It&#39;s replacing the health minister, Tyler Shandro, with the labor minister, Jason Copping, and they would just do a job switch. Stephen Carter, what did you make of the cabinet, the mini cabinet shuffle, if we can call it that, that we saw here in Alberta? And specifically, it&#39;s very naked and perhaps obvious political goals of perhaps deflecting some of the anger against Jason Kenney, tying it to Tyler Shandro and saying that he&#39;s now, you know, resigned, and I&#39;ve accepted that resignation.

And failing to see that, I think maybe we imagine it sometimes. That&#39;s the point that&#39;s sticking with me that Corey has made. Maybe he&#39;s right.

There&#39;s a group of folks that want to get rid of Kenny because he did too much. I&#39;m simplifying. There&#39;s a group of folks that want to get rid of Kenny because he didn&#39;t do enough. Are they, now that we have a date for a leadership review in March, which is earlier than it was supposed to be, because it was supposed Post initially, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, guys, beat March of 23. So it&#39;s moved forward, or I believe, if I&#39;m not mistaken, moved forward a year in a sense. Carter, you&#39;re the campaign manager for the rebels, right? This group that is made of distinct factions, have distinct ideologies, values, but might, should their anger still be true, believe the same thing. A, we need this guy out. B, because he&#39;s a massive liability heading into the next election. Walk me through some of the skeleton outlines, your stream of consciousness in terms of some of the things you&#39;re thinking about tactically, the strategies you have in mind, and some of the messaging and internal ploys you&#39;re thinking of as you now gear up for an internal campaign between now and March. And we&#39;ll continue to revisit this, but let&#39;s get a start of the conversation right now. And Corey, I&#39;ll come to you thereafter on the other team, which is Team Keep Kenny.</div>

And so you have a little bit more ability to say to the fringes of your caucus, you&#39;re just not interested in hearing from them at this moment. They&#39;ve made clear their views, you&#39;re going to do what&#39;s right for Albertans. And so you have an opportunity to address your problems one by one with perhaps a little bit more range of motion than you did last week. Interestingly enough, right?

This was absolutely unnecessary, and they&#39;re being thrown back in his face an awful lot. And that&#39;s really, you know, that&#39;s the start of a public trust conversation. The other was, of course, disappearing in August and during the campaign and delaying, delaying, delaying to do what was necessary on COVID-19. And that was a decision that was quite literally fatal for Albertans, you know, many Albertans. And that&#39;s serious. And that&#39;s something that I think that is difficult to think about and difficult to address. But now, with your hands more freed, with the politics somewhat behind you, or at least resolved in the sense that March is coming, it&#39;s time to go hard on COVID-19.

How do you keep the anger, the rage going if you still think this guy&#39;s a liability, despite the fact that he&#39;s going to apologize, make amends on a few things, maybe pull an equalization vote?
