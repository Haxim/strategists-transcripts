        <p>Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter dig into breaking news and unpack the Alberta Government’s plan to force teachers back to work. What should the strategic response look like from the opposition, educators, and the broader public service? How do you mobilize one of the province’s last truly connected social networks? And is Carter actually serious about putting on a live show? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

They have to remove fundamental rights that are yours and mine that will not apply to teachers starting as soon as this act is passed. And I don&#39;t think that people really understand. I think that when you think of back to work legislation, you think, well, you know, the government can order someone back and that&#39;s fine. fine um but if you&#39;re having to invoke the notwithstanding clause then people start to wonder okay well what is it that we&#39;re giving up and i think that that&#39;s what ultimately</div>

So this is not that, to be clear. That is still coming, this session. So there&#39;s a chance the notwithstanding clause makes a two-time appearance in the next, what, week?</div>

And we have yet to see that, but we won&#39;t see it until they&#39;re moving through the stages of the bill, which is happening as we speak. And once it passes, I think we will see the labor movement take some significant steps. But it&#39;s a question of how actors use their power in the system. Power sloshes around a system.

I&#39;ll put that in the third civil society bucket. Shannon, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s how you would define them. That&#39;s how I would, too. OK, let&#39;s start with the New Democrats, Carter. Carter. And let&#39;s start with what they need to do as it relates to in the legislature and then outside of the legislature, because they&#39;ll have a process here, I imagine, and both of you can tag team on this. I imagine it won&#39;t be a successful process, but they&#39;ll have things that they do. What do they need to do inside the legislature here? And what do they need to do outside?

I failed, but it&#39;s ultimately Danielle Smith&#39;s fault. This is bad. This is going to hurt people. This is a bad direction to go in. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m anticipating from inside.
