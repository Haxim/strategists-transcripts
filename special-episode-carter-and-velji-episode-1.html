For Danielle Smith, though, assuming that they play in the same lane-ish, you think it&#39;s helpful to her. You think that she could be just taking away these supporters who may have seen the sparkle in the eye of a Brian Jean and don&#39;t see it anymore and said, you know what?

They&#39;re trying to get publicity. They&#39;re trying to do it, and they&#39;re just failing.

If you&#39;re a politician right now, if you&#39;re Trudeau in the mic having the question asked to you about your reflections on this, is it just an easy sidestep to say, listen, we weren&#39;t listening to Indigenous voices? But if you&#39;re asked, was this apology enough? Does this do enough to now move it forward? What is your general framework as a prime minister now need to be? Because what I&#39;m hearing you say is that the runway on on on some of the the truth side and the rather than the the reconciliation side which we&#39;ve talked about before on the show and other politicians and and leaders have used in the indigenous community is where we need to get to is this a risk for justin trudeau that like they</span>

We had to wait for the apology from the Pope before we could fix fresh water, potable water on reserves. No, I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been waiting for.

What are you going to do to fix the relationship with First Nations in Canada? And the answer so far, and I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re conservative, liberal, or New Democrat, the answer is non-existent. All it has been is platitudes. No one has an answer.</span>
