          <p>It continues to be too damn cold in Alberta. The gang react to - and discuss the politics of - a text they and their fellow Albertans got asking them to conserve power on Saturday night before turning their attention to a sponsored trip to the West Bank for MPs and Trump's (incredibly good) prospects in the looming Iowa Caucus.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss electricity alerts in Alberta, the opportunities and perils of sponsored MP travel and preview the Iowa Republican Caucuses. Is the emergency alert asking Albertans to conserve power a "political Rorschach test"? Is sponsored travel the next big loophole in conflict of interest rules? And did Carter just "Jeb" Nikki Haley? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">like all Albertans last night, I re-recorded this on Sunday evening, last night being Sunday, we had an issue, an alert that was issued to all of our cell phones, Apple Watches, iPads, televisions, across radio by the Alberta Electric System system operator urging all of us to reduce our electricity usage to essentials only to prevent what they would call rotating outages. The alert came a few hours after the Alberta electric system operator declared that the grid alert did extreme cold, high demand, and low imports, almost a perfect storm, as they tried to clarify in some of their communication, Corey, around what was going on and why us as everyday Albertans should probably unplug that electric vehicle, probably probably not use unnecessary appliances. This came to people on a 7 p.m. on a Saturday evening, right? Like this was something that hit all of us. Corey, there&#39;s the policy, there&#39;s the complication of what happened, why it happened. And then there&#39;s also the fun politics, and I put fun in air quotes, because people have already selected sides. When this alert came to you yesterday, talk to me about, top line, what you assessed from a political lens. You can get into the policy lens of it and around the system breakdown, et cetera, if you&#39;d like. But from a political lens, when you saw it, did you chuckle? Did you sigh? And what was the chuckle and or sigh about?</div>

Like, is sending everybody in the province a turn off the lights text going to work? And And it seems like it did. But ultimately, while I&#39;m grateful that we didn&#39;t end up in a situation where we were shedding load and having to curtail and or having to curtail, you know, through rotating blackouts or brownouts or whatever you want to call them.

But instead, we have a hodgepodge of a system that has been created by successive governments years over years, and it doesn&#39;t work particularly well. And then, because people are partisan, they get to point the finger and say, it&#39;s actually because of renewables. It&#39;s not actually because of renewables. It&#39;s because we haven&#39;t done a good enough job on our carbon capture and sequestration we haven&#39;t done a good enough job generating more electricity through renewables we haven&#39;t done a good enough job on our batteries we haven&#39;t even done a good enough job on hydro so there&#39;s many different things that we can do to ensure that we&#39;ve got the power system that we&#39;re supposed to have but we haven&#39;t done them and cory now do you want to do cleanup on my stuff or do you want me just to to go back back and name names because i will i</div>

But one of the challenges here is these, the reason why a capacity market was looking more necessary is because we were going to have more intermittent power sources with solar and with wind, and we were going to need the ability to have capacity at the ready when, you know, when a moment like this occurred, or if a gas plant went offline or something like that. And we didn&#39;t do it. So we changed half the system, right? We didn&#39;t change the other half the system. And half is even being too generous with my fractions here because there were so many other actions that are that are a so and that our government should have been considering over the past few years as we sort of look at what&#39;s ahead of us here and if there&#39;s going to be more intermittent supplies like we&#39;ve got to be talking about smart grids we&#39;ve got to be talking about inner ties to other areas we&#39;ve got to be talking about the ways that we can just like the alert did although probably with less drama encourage people or direct people or pay people to reduce their demand at times when there&#39;s supply and we haven&#39;t done any of that that&#39;s</div>

Look at that. We can&#39;t even go above that. If it gets colder, if it gets warmer, we&#39;re not going to be able to supply and protect just as Danielle said.

It basically says, what percent of the time can you expect a plant to be up? And they&#39;re not super high for wind or solar. So when Carter talks about 20,000 megawatts of capacity, that&#39;s like the max possible. The capacity factors underneath that are always going to reduce that. And the more you have wind or solar in there, or frankly, even just unreliable old plants, you&#39;re going to see lower actual capacity factors take account here. you</div>

            <div class="said">know the the idea that renewables are at the heart of this in general i think you&#39;d say look there are a lot of other jurisdictions in canada and we are the only ones with this problem so you can blame the feds all you want but it seems the rest of our federation managed to weather this okay second thing i would point out is is the government themselves identified that there were problems as a result of canceling the capacity market. There were quotes from Daniel Smith to this effect. You can actually go back to Hansard and you can look at quotes that were done by then Minister of Energy, Sonia Savage, saying, oh, the government or the opposition is saying that if we do these things, these risks occur, but we think these risks are overblown. We&#39;ve got 25% additional capacity. We&#39;re best in class right now. Now, honestly,</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">honestly, I&#39;m not entirely convinced that the capacity market would have been the panacea here. But, like, the whole idea, if you&#39;re paying people for extra capacity, is maybe there&#39;s a reason to keep older plants online. Maybe there&#39;s a reason to sort of contemplate the time of year that these things are going to go down and, you know, govern yourself accordingly. It really depends on how you build these things out. But I think you&#39;ve got to move it onto the ground of, like, this is actually not about renewables, really, at all, right? right? We knew the wind wasn&#39;t going to blow. And we still had projected that we were going to be fine. What happened intervening there? Well, the problem is we&#39;ve got a little bit of a broken system. And it&#39;s broken because these guys broke it. And I think that that&#39;s more the argument you need to make. But I want to stress, it&#39;s a little harder. And I actually agree with Carter, I think that this is kind of a win for people who don&#39;t like solar or wind. I think that&#39;s just the way easier argument for the public. So</div>

Yes, we switched significantly from coal to natural gas. That was an NDP initiative. That shift happened, but it still didn&#39;t eliminate the primary problem. And the primary problem was then was invested in many years before by Ed Stelmack.

            <div class="said">There are Liberal and NDP MPs, Carter, that are going to be traveling to the West Bank to connect with Palestinians. This is an initiative completely paid for and sponsored by an organization called the Canadian Muslim Vote, a registered non-profit Muslim charity. Five MPs, as I mentioned, including two Liberals, are on this particular trip where they&#39;re going to meet with the Palestinian community, I should say, on the ground in the West Bank. The details of this are interesting, and I think it&#39;s worthwhile. And full disclosure, the Canadian Muslim Votes Organization, I&#39;ve, you know, helped in the past and know of. But that&#39;s not what I want to discuss here. I want to go to the strategy, Carter, the political tactics when we talk about advocacy</div>

            <div class="said">of hosting. I find this to be fascinating. We&#39;ve talked about things like government relations in the past, how to do good GR, how to move ministers on files, how to write a good and execute on good good persuasive letters, how to have a good meeting, how to go in for the ask. We&#39;ve talked about all that extensively. We&#39;ve talked about grassroots advocacy, this concept of building a public coalition so that MPs and others and decision makers are pressured to do the right thing, so to speak, because of the volume of their electorate and their voters that want a certain thing. And then we&#39;ve also talked about the broader sort of tools of advocacy ranging in from one-on-one meet and greets, events, etc. We have not talked about paying for someone&#39;s bill to go do something, go see something, and host them, make them your guest in that way. We&#39;ve done it in the small way, you know, attend my drinks sort of event in Ottawa at 5pm, you know, we&#39;ll host you on the hill. We&#39;ve talked about that. But this is fundamentally really, I think, kind of different, Carter. And we haven&#39;t talked about the strategy of hosting, paying for folks that are elected officials to go see a thing, do a thing, engage with the thing that is important to you. And in this case, this is a strategy taken on by the Canadian Muslim vote that, you know, I would say parrots in some ways, a strategy that has been taken on by Jewish individuals and outright groups supportive of Israel for many, many years. But Carter, I wanted to get your thought on this? There&#39;s a sort of expenses paid question. There&#39;s an effectiveness of the strategy question. Start with either of those two lanes. If there&#39;s a third one you want to carve out, let&#39;s do that. But there&#39;s a few things to discuss here that I think would be worthwhile for the listener.</div>

Because I almost look at sponsored travel as a technical word. I almost look at this as like sponsored experiences. They don&#39;t have to be overseas. They don&#39;t have to be about this particular issue, right? To Corey&#39;s point, if I take you somewhere, come see my site, come see the operations, I&#39;ll fly you over to wherever. Those sort of things for these backbench MPs, which are not an insignificant group to lobby and persuade and convince, would you make this more of your advocacy diet when you talk to clients about it? Because $10,000 is a lot, but we know the hundreds of thousands that are often spent on grassroots lobbying, on government relations, on other things. And to be able to isolate someone for a period of time, to Carter, to go back to one of your, to maybe even work it too well, to have that, you know, like attention for almost exclusively, there is value here. So as you look at it as a practice, and we haven&#39;t discussed this on the pod before, what would your take be as a practitioner advising a client, advising an institution on whether to do something like this, engaging in something like this more?</div>

You know, and there is to both of your perspectives, there&#39;s an important reason I brought this up now, not just because it was a headline. line. And I knew the elements of it not being accessible or permissible for ministers or parliamentary secretaries to engage Carter. But for months on this show, and the Canadian political pundit class has been talking about a change in government. And so when you are looking at the opportunity here to pursue the other side of the house, the conservatives, these are future ministers, exactly, future ministers, future leaders. And when you look at it, And I appreciate your point fully, Corey, that not all nonprofits or charities would have the access to $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 a pop. But some of them do. Some organizations and institutions do. And for many that are trying to get multi-billion dollar public policy change, $50,000, $200,000 all in is a drop in the bucket for the type of change that they&#39;re looking or the type of relationship they&#39;re looking to build, even more importantly, perhaps. And so this is why I kind of bring this up when we talk about a government in waiting. That isn&#39;t necessarily government. And by extension to the rules, even graze out the ethical conversation even more, which is like, well, are these future ministers in waiting? Because we could pick them out right now. Six, eight of them. We kind of know who&#39;s going to be on the front bench in a couple of years. Should everything head in the direction we think it&#39;s going to head in, Carter?</div>

You&#39;re first going to give me your political analysis, and then you&#39;re going to write statements for me on behalf of the Canadian government, okay? And I&#39;ll tell you what this topic is in a second. It will reveal itself. Carter, the Canadian government had 900,000 businesses sign up for the CBO loan, and that deadline, Stephen Carter, is coming. Now, many of those businesses are advocating that the feds give them more time. They&#39;re in a lot of debt. A lot of restaurant owners over the course of the last week or so have been advocating publicly that most of us operate at a loss. A lot of us are in significant debt. We need more time in order to pay back our CBA loan from the pandemic. Carter, let&#39;s talk about the politics. Don&#39;t worry about the haiku so much, but it&#39;s coming.

You&#39;ve got nearly a million businesses. You&#39;ve got, of course, lobby groups like the Canadian Federation of Independent Business calling on Ottawa to extend the CIBA deadline.

            <div class="said">Well, I think that there are way more risks for not extending the deadline than there are from following the deadline. I think that because of the volume of the businesses, the number of businesses that got this, we&#39;re dealing with kind of that heart of the economy, the small business people.

But the economic consequence compared to the political issue, it&#39;s inconsequential. Extend the deadline seems to be the smart play, which means, of course, if we agree that it&#39;s the smart play, it means the Trudeau government will, of course, impose the deadline.

That&#39;s how you build a country, right? You have people you can point to who are role models to us all, not just role models to new Democrats and role models to liberals or role models to conservatives. And I think that&#39;s great.
