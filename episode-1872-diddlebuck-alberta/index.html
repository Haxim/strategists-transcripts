        <p>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter dive into the latest polling numbers on Alberta separation sentiment, discussing their intensity and impact. Then they discuss the strategy and importance of managing separatist sentiment within Alberta politics. Is the current separatist situation in Alberta a unique one? What are the things to look for in the upcoming provincial by-elections? And what does FMM actually stand for? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

I want to talk about the by-elections in Alberta, And then I want to talk very quickly on the federal scene, what we make of this past week with Carney and the King. How did that visit go? Was there anything material you took out of it? Let&#39;s start with the separatist question, because that is what we did spend a significant amount of time last time the three of us were together discussing. In fact, I think it&#39;s the only thing we discussed when we walked through what our prospective</div>

That&#39;s where the separatist number stands. That number is not increasing from previous polling that Janet has done. But Carter, I&#39;ll start with you on this. The intensity of those that want to separate is deepening, intensifying. Yep.</div>

That intensity, because what we&#39;re doing is now we&#39;re activating social networks and people within those social networks are going to be more and more likely to be talking about separation. They are emboldened. They are seeing their premier talk about it. They are willing to talk about it publicly. Whereas before, if it was kind of a two or three on the Likert scale, it wasn&#39;t really something that they were going to talk about. uh now that it&#39;s number one they are absolutely going to talk about it uh they&#39;re going to talk about it within their own groups where it&#39;s which are easier to find because people are more engaged and more you know excited about it if you will and they will talk about it within groups that are not necessarily uh separatist leaning shannon</div>

I would say, though, that there&#39;s still a good chunk of those folks, even in the intensity of it. It&#39;s really hard to tell whether the intensity is I&#39;m pissed with the federal government, or I&#39;m out of here, right? Because there&#39;s still a lot of separatist, curious, kind of half-formed ideas out there. Uh, you know, of, and, uh, the biggest one of which is, um, we</div>

I think what it also means, though, on that intensity is there are more and more folks, if you can go find them, willing to sign a citizen initiative to put that question on the ballot. That&#39;s where the danger lies. also with as as soon as that intensity goes up even if you have even if you&#39;re stuck in in around 28 that&#39;s money right</div>

          <div class="said">it&#39;s a it&#39;s a full fracture and we do have to deal with it it is it is going going to be more important than anything else that we deal with because 30% is enough to start driving people away. It&#39;s enough to start driving uncertainty. And as soon as you start driving uncertainty, you have to deal with it. You have to make things certain again. The best case scenario is that no one&#39;s able to get 170,000 signatures and everything kind of bogs down before we we actually get to a 70-30 outcome. Because the other problem, Zane, is it&#39;s quite a push to assume that we wind up in the exact same spot again.</div>
