        <p>Episode 1906: Treason? Or Treason-Adjacent?</p><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss Alberta separatism going international after reporting reveals meetings with U.S. officials, and what the different levels of government can, and shouldn't, do in response. How does a fringe movement become a foreign policy problem? What's the right move when separatist politics go too far? And does a producer organizing events without asking the hosts count as treason?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

But given what you know, as her strategic limitations and the coalition she&#39;s trying to maintain, what could she have said that would have made a response better strategically in that sense? And I guess the other way to ask that question is, do you think her running to the flag, draping herself in it, and persuading people about the benefits of Canada would have been as strategic as what she&#39;s trying to do here?</div>
