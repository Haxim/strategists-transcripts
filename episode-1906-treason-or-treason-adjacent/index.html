        <p>Episode 1906: Treason? Or Treason-Adjacent?</p><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss Alberta separatism going international after reporting reveals meetings with U.S. officials, and what the different levels of government can, and shouldn't, do in response. How does a fringe movement become a foreign policy problem? What's the right move when separatist politics go too far? And does a producer organizing events without asking the hosts count as treason?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>
