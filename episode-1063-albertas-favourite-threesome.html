          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well um step one really is what you&#39;re trying to do in the debate right like who who you&#39;re trying to focus on the messages you&#39;re trying to get across but assuming you&#39;ve done that foundational groundwork which is kind of core to any campaigning that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that when we start talking about debate prep there are there&#39;s kind of two streams of activity that occur one of them is the support activity of the people who are going to assist the leader in getting everything ready so they&#39;re finding answers to every conceivable question that might be thrown at their leader they&#39;re starting to look at which messages resonated and which did not that they can then throw out against the other leaders you know those sound bites they&#39;re always looking for and the other stream of activity that&#39;s occurring is is essentially practice it&#39;s the mock debates it&#39;s the the leader going up and And having a series of sparring contests, essentially, with people who are pretending to be the other leaders to allow them to prepare and practice the delivery of their lines and make sure it seems natural, make sure that they&#39;re able to respond in real time and just sharpen themselves up in order to get ready for that debate.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Tell us a bit more, and Carter, jump in here because I know you&#39;ve been in those rooms, but that actual mock practice. Like, how many hours are we talking? How often do we get people that look like the people you&#39;re debating? like really really walk us through this well so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so the casting of the opposition is really important i&#39;ll start with that because it doesn&#39;t really matter that they look like them what does matter is that they are able to speak with the tone and the content so the person who is speaking a you know for danielle smith needs to be able to you know speak like danielle smith if we&#39;re prepping Rachel Notley, and vice versa, right? Like, it doesn&#39;t need to be, you know, a female, right? It can, or, you know, great debate prep has been done with women playing the roles of men. It doesn&#39;t matter how you look, it doesn&#39;t matter how</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">how you sound, per se, what matters is how you speak, the language that you&#39;re using. And we will actually, if you&#39;ve done really good debate prep, the language that you&#39;ve used in preparation will actually come up in the debate. The person that you&#39;re um you&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re playing the role of will say the land you know the the actual statement right the you know the ndp the job killing ndp right or whatever the the language is so getting that cadence getting that ability</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">ability and then the other thing that&#39;s super important is casting someone</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">who&#39;s not that deferential to your leader you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you need to cast someone who&#39;s going to fuck with them right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right they&#39;re going to go right after their achilles heel they&#39;re going to go after it over over and over and over again, and they are going to fucking hate you by the end of the prep.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Needless to say, I do a little bit of that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, can confirm, by the way, like I&#39;ve been the sparring partner multiple times for different leaders. And I&#39;ve actually gotten the comments like, geez, you really seem to believe that. And the side eye, like I was somehow like this sleeper agent who was just trying to take them down from the inside. But it&#39;s an important part of the prep is to go for it, to go for the jugular. One of the things that I always tell people who are doing debate prep is you&#39;ve</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;ve got to avoid caricature. Like the last thing you want is somebody to come in and be this broad cartoonish version of your opponent that&#39;s never going to show up in the actual debate. You need to be the best version of them. And being the best version of them means going for the throat. And you&#39;ve got to act like that leader. And it&#39;s really tied to that first stream of activity I was talking about, because one of the things the sparring partner should be doing is studying the game tape. For example, if you are Rachel Notley&#39;s sparring partner in this one you&#39;re probably looking at the 2012 debate where danielle smith was on the stage with allison redford raj sherman and uh brian mason you&#39;re probably looking at the debates from the ucp leadership debate you&#39;re you&#39;re looking at how she&#39;s had more contentious conversations with all sorts of people over the past time but you&#39;re also looking at her more recent stump speeches the phrases she&#39;s continuing to use the charges she&#39;s continually dropping on people and you&#39;re making sure that that is consistently um considered</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">considered in your debate performance as well in your uh your uh your mock debate performance i suppose i mean so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">so how many hours are we talking like is this a sort of build</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">build it into the schedule for an hour a day weeks before and then it ramps up or like what like i i&#39;m just curious given you know how much training you know people do for a five minute media appearance this is like a lengthy a lengthy debate what what are we talking so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so really depends on the leader some are just better at it than others some need more more prep than others. And that&#39;s just a simple reality. And Stephen said in our last show, and it&#39;s totally true, you can over-prepare somebody. So you don&#39;t want to be doing like one a day in the lead-up if you&#39;re already there and you&#39;re just going to get distracted or bored and you&#39;re going to stop using the lines that you&#39;re practicing on. You got to kind of hit that sweet spot. But there are leaders who need more experience, more exercise, don&#39;t have the reps and you need them to get into that particular comfort zone. But generally speaking, you&#39;re probably looking at a couple of really you know</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">intensive days of debate prep like like not maybe necessarily literal full days but four hours blocked off where you&#39;re going through the binder you&#39;re doing a version of the debate that is like a well let me stop let me try this answer and you talk with the room about what if i had said this right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then you&#39;re doing a version that&#39;s almost a dress rehearsal no pauses no stopping and sort of testing these things you just go and And you go for the 90 minutes, the two hours. This debate is actually two hours, but there&#39;s commercials in it. So, you know, probably 90 minutes is what you would actually practice for. And you just see how you hold up over that withering scrutiny and that time. So you&#39;re practicing two things, right? You&#39;re practicing, well, three, your policy, your delivery, and your endurance. Like you want to make sure you&#39;re able to go to the distance in this particular thing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I&#39;m going to stage it more like an actual theater production as well, right? So the first thing you do in a theater production is you do your book read. read right so everybody&#39;s going to do your book their book read they&#39;re going to go through the lines they&#39;re going to say this line doesn&#39;t work i don&#39;t like this line the pollster is going to be there they&#39;re going to say you know we tested these lines these are the ones that work the best this is how uh people are responding to it this is working really well with women this is working really well with men if we can try and balance this in and get this in the first half of the debate this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this needs to be in the second half of the debate and so you&#39;re going through a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">a book read you&#39;re literally sitting there with your binder you&#39;re going through it in no particular order maybe just, you know, alphabetical order, the order in which the binder was prepared.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re going through that and then you&#39;re saying, okay, well, then</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">then the next thing is let&#39;s get this thing on its feet, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? So we are going to say, what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">what are you the most comfortable with? What are you the least comfortable with? What do we need to work through? What do you want to work on?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And the leader may say, I&#39;ve got the answers, but I&#39;m not really comfortable with the talkovers, right? The talkovers are particularly problematic to me. So a talkover, of course, is is this podcast we all talk over each other and we&#39;re actually intelligible uh the debate tends not to be as intelligible um but this you know so okay we&#39;re going to work through that and then so you then you get to a full dress and the full dress is people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">people coming in they are prepared and they are ready to go and i would do all three of those things not necessarily on the same day maybe the first two on one day the full dress on another day because you have to internalize all all this information. No one&#39;s picking up this book and memorizing it. She&#39;s got to have the book like a week and a half in advance, whether it&#39;s Danielle or Rachel, and they got to go through their lines and memorize their lines and go through it with their staff and rewrite the line and make it more their own.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And then they come back to, okay,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">okay, we&#39;re ready. We&#39;re ready for the read through.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. You know, the thing I would say though, and the reason I like to do a full dress early, maybe even literal months before the main event is the staff do need to do an honest assessment of what&#39;s working, see the blind spots of the leader, the ways the leader is excelling or perhaps failing to allow them to build that plan. And that&#39;s part of why you do it early and then determine how many debate preps you need. And it&#39;s hard to really understand that without doing the full dress. And yeah, maybe it&#39;s not as polished on the policy at that point. Maybe it&#39;s not as polished on the delivery, but you get a little bit of an understanding as to what you&#39;re working with, if anything. And that&#39;s really important because there is huge variability in the leaders here the other thing that steven i think alluded to but i just want to say like explicit during that shakedown period perhaps even between what he described as the table read and the dress is is really having a conversation about like the questions you&#39;re worried about right like so what&#39;s the one that you think would kill you like let&#39;s really dwell a little bit on this what&#39;s the question you dread from get or dread getting and we often call those in the business murder questions right like what are the murder questions here the ones that you just don&#39;t think we have a very solid answer for yet. And you work your way through that, you work through the anxieties that the leader might be bringing on those ones. And you practice a few things, and you see how they sort of resonate with other people.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then the final point I want to make before kind of throwing it back, because we&#39;ve dropped a lot on the table here is, as you&#39;re going through, and you&#39;re practicing, you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re picking kind of the best lines, because the last thing you want to be is this overprogrammed person whose every answer has a scripted line. as we say in this space internalize don&#39;t memorize right you are not reading a script you are making sure you know your data firm and you&#39;re able to throw it out but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t have a couple of canned lines ready to go that are just absolute fucking daggers that&#39;s</span>

Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine and you</span>

I think he&#39;d used it in a rally a little bit earlier, probably to wild applause. And that made him say, oh, that really plays. So let&#39;s try to jam that into the debate. and so as much as it might look like they&#39;re bringing out new material you know like they&#39;re a comic for the first time at the comedy cellar they&#39;re generally not right like this is part of their stadium set this is stuff that they&#39;ve used this is their greatest hits and they want it packaged for television as part of a moment okay</span>

            <span class="text">right uh and and if you are kind master of that particular craft, you can really use it to your advantage. And Stephen, you yourself know this.

            <span class="text">Well, and Nenshi was great at this because he was coming in and he was doing debates with 30 people, 20 people, 15 people. It kind of got winnowed down as he got closer to the actual election. But he would be in a position where he would make people focus And he would annihilate the other candidates. Barb Higgins, I think, is still pissed with with Nancy because she she was ripped apart by him.</span>

            <span class="text">different because Smith has this radio talk. Like Smith&#39;s problem in my mind is that she lowers her voice all the time, right? I&#39;d be saying to her, keep your voice as neutral as possible and do not swallow and do not push it into the nasal. So I&#39;d be working with her. There&#39;s an exercise that we do where you try to imagine that the word is formed just outside of your lips. and when you try and imagine that it pushes it&#39;s a technique that singers use where they create the note outside of their mouths and that allows them to project the clearer cleaner note and that&#39;s what i&#39;d be working on with her so she doesn&#39;t swallow her words she doesn&#39;t appear to be pulling back it&#39;s the same type of thing we&#39;re working with allison on but very specifically danielle is used to having a microphone right where we have ours and she&#39;s that&#39;s not what she&#39;s doing in this she&#39;s projecting it out beyond and yes i see all of my hand gestures i understand yeah</span>

The minute Prentice turned to Rachel Notley and marked her as the opponent, I&#39;m sure they thought they were being really clever and trying to take down the Wild Rose. But they handed the race to Rachel Notley because she had a much higher ceiling. There were way more people willing to consider Rachel Notley. And rather than dealing with the Wild Rose who were already at their vote ceiling, no other votes were going there. They totally upended their own game on them. Bit of an own goal by Jim Prentice, but nonetheless, a super important debate. Other debates that I can think of that were really important, 2015 as well, saw the Quebec language debate, which absolutely threw the election to the Liberals. It was a three-way race.

            <span class="text">maybe that&#39;s not even the tenor of it but there was something kind of you know truthy about it like it&#39;s it sort of encapsulated the entire debate the the arrogance of jim prentice the resilience and the shrewdness of rachel notley you know how smart she was how how tough she was. And it became the moment everybody talked about. And, um, it is really the, it&#39;s the spin after the fact and who wins the spin that as much as anything usually determines who won the debate.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. The other thing about about debates is they&#39;re about expectations. And so I think I&#39;ve talked to a lot of people in the last couple of days, and they have said some version of, Danielle Smith&#39;s really got to watch out. Rachel</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Notley is going to murder her. Or people saying, oh, this is the opportunity. Rachel Notley is going to murder Danielle Smith in this debate. And I think the expectations as a result are much lower for Danielle Smith than Rachel Notley going in. And so it might be score to draw draw if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Danielle Smith does not like collapse and sweat on the stage at this particular moment. So a lot of the expectation game stuff also needs to be considered here. It&#39;s not just what comes out of it, it&#39;s where you came into it. And frankly, Rachel Notley has a higher bar as a result of that. So unless she lands like a total knockout blow, even if she wins the debate on points, I think a lot of people are going to say Danielle Smith didn&#39;t lose the debate. And that could be quite impactful.</span>

I was trying to imagine where there was a moment where somebody did something unexpected and this endorsement occurred, and then you&#39;re like, oh my God, wow, that&#39;s really crazy. And I couldn&#39;t think of any. And I thought of some that were kind of close, like in</span>

            <span class="text">in leadership contests, people with organizations thrown to other people. David Orchard endorsed Stéphane Dion for the 2006 Liberal Leadership, brought his Saskatchewan organization. Okay, maybe arguably that was impactful, but it&#39;s so small and niche, and it tended to be more organizational. So I did a bit of Googling. I couldn&#39;t actually find any endorsements that weren&#39;t just a member of a party endorsing somebody at a different level, as though that was supposed to be amazing. And then I asked ChatGPT. I said, hey, tell me about endorsements in Canadian politics. And it gave me just a list of politicians endorsing other politicians of the same ilk and a bunch of answers that were outright lies like just not accurate i think it it was it was it said like uh uh patrick brown endorsed jagmeet singh to run in brampton east and i</span>

And there was a news story about this. And so I looked up more, and it was inaccurate. David Suzuki specifically was asked, did you endorse Elizabeth May? And he&#39;s like, no, I met her for the first time on that stage. I was just speaking at an event. I wasn&#39;t endorsing her. But the Greens had put out a piece of literature that said he had. So that&#39;s where that one had come from.

            <span class="text">Well, and I think actually where I have seen endorsements be a a little bit higher value is when it is a less partisan situation or a lower information situation and i think a nomination race is a perfect example of that you may or may not especially if it&#39;s like a big riding like thousands of members you may or may not know the people you may or may not know the quality you&#39;re dealing with the endorsement of the mp who you do know the outgoing candidate mla as the case may be and you&#39;re saying okay that might be the case i also think municipally for For the council races, they can be a little bit more useful because the most impactful, the most consequential endorsement I can remember seeing is Brian Pincott, his first election.

I can understand why they simplified their math along those lines. But I am a bit surprised that they, well, because they don&#39;t want to say a tax hike could actually reduce economic activity.

One is in Calgary, one is in Toronto, and one is in Abu Dhabi. And maybe Toronto has higher income tax rates, but for other reasons, it has a higher return on investment. investment maybe the one in Abu Dhabi is looking pretty good and maybe the one in Calgary would on the margins have been the one selected at eight percent corporate tax rate because that&#39;s going to get you x number of million additional dollars on a big project but at 11 it&#39;s not and it goes to Toronto or Abu Dhabi that&#39;s that&#39;s a possibility and that&#39;s a reality in a global world that you have to contend with and that&#39;s one of the challenges with corporate tax rates and why provinces sort of race each other to the bottom on these particular metrics right that&#39;s just the the reality of life, and we can&#39;t pretend otherwise.</span>

People generally think, if it doesn&#39;t hit me, it&#39;s a good tax. If it does hit me, it&#39;s a bad tax. That&#39;s as simple as people are about this. And I just, in isolation, there&#39;s no way that corporate income tax increases are a loser. They&#39;re just not. And so the UCP&#39;s job now is to tie it to something that&#39;s a winner, which is why you&#39;re seeing them immediately spring to kills jobs. And these are job creators that you&#39;re now putting consequences on. But I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work because it&#39;s never worked before. for yeah</span>

Uh, there was a poll by David Coletto last week that showed the, like on the weekend that showed the NDP up 10 and everyone said, Holy shit, this is a big thing. This is consequential. And that started a flurry of texts of people saying, do you think this is real? Do you buy it? Uh, as it was already reported in the braid column, this roughly matched the ndp&#39;s internal numbers um i have certainly heard rumors that the ucp internals from the weekend were not so different from that particular outcome too but then on monday this must have seemed like manna from heaven for the ucp campaign that came in with a counter narrative here and it was presented and if it was any other pollster people would have discounted it because there was other stuff like you know council put out some quote-unquote polling as well and it also showed the ndp up by about 10 but it&#39;s janet brown she is the doyenne of pollsters in this province she does it well she is the gold standard there&#39;s a reason why everybody loves janet brown she&#39;s just so bloody accurate on these things because she does it the way you&#39;re supposed to do it you</span>
