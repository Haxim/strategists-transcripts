      <h1>Episode 1848E: A tight 102 minutes on the Liberal leadership brands</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">January 27, 2025</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>The gang do a classic deep dive on the identities and brands of the six Liberal leadership campaigns that made it to the starting line, answering questions like: "What is brand?" and getting Carter's unbiased answers to questions about his candidate's brand. Corey Hogan's suit jacket guest stars.</p><blockquote><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about recent developments in liberal leadership politics before diving deep into the brands of the six candidates. Who's got the best handle on their brand? What even makes a good political brand? And did you take the under on last week's over/under question? We hope so. Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p></blockquote></div>

We&#39;re going to get into the brand of each of the liberal candidates now that the field has gelled, now that the field is solidified, Corey. But before that, can we spend, let&#39;s say, 10? I&#39;m going to give it 10. It might end up being 15. It might end up being the whole show. We may never get to the branding episode. There are three strategy questions on the table that I think are worthwhile to consider before we get into the branding episode, which we are going to do, Stephen Carter. And I want you guys to give me your take. I&#39;m not going to do the strategy scale. I&#39;m not going to do the fine, fabulous, or fucked. You guys just give me your take.

If not conflict, well, maybe you&#39;re not, because you&#39;re willing to, you know, speak truth about your campaign&#39;s lack of innovation. So who knows where you&#39;ll go here. But Carter, we just want to disclose your relationship with the Carney campaign as thin as it might be. Your words, not ours. But Corey, what do you think of this strategy by Christopher Freeland? And I mentioned this earlier because there was talk of her team putting this out there to seed the ground prior to lunch, but now we&#39;ve heard it from her that Carney&#39;s the insider, he&#39;s the PMO-driven candidate, like this is the guy you want if you want more of the same. Strategy-wise, and then how is it landing for you? Give me your take and the card will come to you on the same.</div>

She was at the center of the Trudeau government forever until she was fired, apparently for a lack of competency. So like, I just don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know that this argument is going to work very much. I think it&#39;s likely to antagonize a lot of the liberals. And I do, I do worry a little bit on behalf of the liberals for, for the amount of, I guess, tape she&#39;s creating for the conservatives to create an attack ads, right? Like, so the liberals best shot is they can break from this time. Freeland might win, Carney might win. It does sort of feel like the consensus is Carney is in the pole position at this particular moment, right? But if Carney does win, Freeland is starting to poison the, you know, the Carney brand before going forward. And she might make the calculation, this is how I win, this is how I do it. But it does seem like a pretty high risk strategy, because if you end up running for this man, and you&#39;ve convinced Canadians along the way of losing that he is continuity i</div>

Like, I&#39;m not sure that anybody who who wasn&#39;t already a diehard partisan, is going to leave it feeling great about either party. Because on one hand, we&#39;re so used to the sociopathic nature of politics that it doesn&#39;t faze us when somebody walks into somebody&#39;s neighborhood and starts basically calling them borderline a murderer and a degenerate, right? And then somebody comes up and says, hey, I&#39;m not, come here, we&#39;ll talk about it, I&#39;ll buy you a drink, right? And so on one level, the actions of Lansman are like, they&#39;re just so weird. Like when you think think about it and his reaction in some ways was like almost like a shot of normalcy but i also think if you look at it through the lens of hey she&#39;s just doing her job she&#39;s being a critic and this guy comes up and starts getting in her business and being kind of handsy it&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah. Well, first of all, we are saying brand, but I just want to be clear, brand is ultimately the end result. It&#39;s what people think of you. It&#39;s how you come off. What you&#39;ve listed there is largely identity. Those are components of a visual identity, written identity, the words you use. And that&#39;s the kind of stuff a campaign has control over, but ultimately you judge its success or not based on what your brand is. So the brand is the outcome. The brand is not the action. Love it. And I think that&#39;s important to keep in mind, especially as we go into some of these candidates, and maybe I&#39;ll keep my powder dry on that. But like a lot of these folks have a brand coming in, like we already think things about them, which means the identity that they&#39;re presenting, visual words, all of that, it</div>

We created almost a, well, not almost, we created a fake creative brief for the Carney brand, like the Carney visual identity when it went down. And we went through all of the topics and even just writing it out. One of the things that occurred to me is you&#39;re creating a brand for a leadership campaign, but it&#39;s also got to be the start of your brand for the general election campaign.

Does a small event make sense? Does streaming make sense? Does not make sense? And a lot of the time, you&#39;ll argue the pros and cons, merits of those things. But anyone who&#39;s worked with me knows I&#39;ve got a bit of a shorthand for this, which is brand answers all questions. if you work backwards from how you want to present yourself those things resolve relatively quickly and relatively easily so i&#39;d be curious to hear steven the conversation that might have occurred in the carny campaign so much as you can provide it but that to me and you don&#39;t always get it right like right sometimes you fuck it up but like that to me is like well who are we trying to be well then of course this is how we have to launch right and uh when i see the carny launch video video and how it started with the graphics of you know i was born here and then i lived in edmonton and then a lot of his canadian origin story is in</div>

          <div class="said">Okay, let&#39;s let&#39;s jump into this. I think that that&#39;s that&#39;s enough on the table in terms of what we need to assess our brand. And we&#39;ll start with the websites, because they do, while they are not inclusive of everything that is a visual identity, an identity, or an outcome of a brand, I think they house a lot of the items, including, you know, photos, the language, the overall sort of taglines Carter talked, and Corey, you&#39;ve both talked about the Carney one. Let&#39;s start with Krista Freeland. She&#39;s at kristafreeland.ca is where her campaign&#39;s at. She&#39;s leaning heavily on the last name. People can look this up. That&#39;s better than me explaining any of it. So I won&#39;t. I won&#39;t explain any of it other than turning it over to you guys if you want to talk about it. Let&#39;s start with this. What did you like? What did you not like? And where did this overall kind of land with you? So plus minus delta, right? Plus minuses delta. Corey, can I start with you on Krista Freeland? Give me your plus minus delta on her.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, the plus is the word. She obviously is most comfortable when she&#39;s dealing with the written word and she&#39;s telling a story. And I think that makes perfect sense. That&#39;s her background. That&#39;s who she is. And I really do believe she has a good sense of what she wants to do. However, I&#39;m going to give you a couple of minuses here. And unfortunately, they do somewhat stack together. One minus is the polish of her visual identity here. And I think it is such a fascinating example to me about graphic design and how there is such a fine line between stellar graphic design and bad graphic design. And I think, unfortunately for her, she&#39;s on the bad side of the graphic design. you&#39;re not saying</div>

Carter talks here about, hold me to the standard of next Prime Minister of Canada. Freeland is wrapping wrapping herself in the flag, making sure she&#39;s centered as liberal, and then talking about the party. So they&#39;ve, you know, deliberately or not chosen distinct swim lanes, even in their lack thereof, and or chosen policy prescriptions that they&#39;ve put out there.

And there are a lot of channels that can carry that. But there&#39;s a a very practical reason not to rely on people going to your website to find your video i think actually i will say the carney campaign i tried to find it on youtube and i really struggled and i think that&#39;s a big miss right because sometimes you just go to where you think videos are and you want to find it but the reason you want to drive people to those other channels the social channels whether it be twitter or facebook or</div>

Jamie did this this back in 2025 why there&#39;s a path here i can do this and i think that&#39;s great um i think if anything he&#39;s selling himself a little too short uh even if you&#39;re not in it to win it act</div>
