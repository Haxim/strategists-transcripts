If not conflict, well, maybe you&#39;re not, because you&#39;re willing to, you know, speak truth about your campaign&#39;s lack of innovation. So who knows where you&#39;ll go here. But Carter, we just want to disclose your relationship with the Carney campaign as thin as it might be. Your words, not ours. But Corey, what do you think of this strategy by Christopher Freeland? And I mentioned this earlier because there was talk of her team putting this out there to seed the ground prior to lunch, but now we&#39;ve heard it from her that Carney&#39;s the insider, he&#39;s the PMO-driven candidate, like this is the guy you want if you want more of the same. Strategy-wise, and then how is it landing for you? Give me your take and the card will come to you on the same.</span>

She was at the center of the Trudeau government forever until she was fired, apparently for a lack of competency. So like, I just don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know that this argument is going to work very much. I think it&#39;s likely to antagonize a lot of the liberals. And I do, I do worry a little bit on behalf of the liberals for, for the amount of, I guess, tape she&#39;s creating for the conservatives to create an attack ads, right? Like, so the liberals best shot is they can break from this time. Freeland might win, Carney might win. It does sort of feel like the consensus is Carney is in the pole position at this particular moment, right? But if Carney does win, Freeland is starting to poison the, you know, the Carney brand before going forward. And she might make the calculation, this is how I win, this is how I do it. But it does seem like a pretty high risk strategy, because if you end up running for this man, and you&#39;ve convinced Canadians along the way of losing that he is continuity i</span>

Did they do a great job or did they do a shit job? Well, I don&#39;t know. I kind of feel like the whole thing was awkward to watch. That was my basic feeling. Like, I&#39;m not sure that anybody who who wasn&#39;t already a diehard partisan, is going to leave it feeling great about either party. Because on one hand, we&#39;re so used to the sociopathic nature of politics that it doesn&#39;t faze us when somebody walks into somebody&#39;s neighborhood and starts basically calling them borderline a murderer and a degenerate, right? And then somebody comes up and says, hey, I&#39;m not, come here, we&#39;ll talk about it, I&#39;ll buy you a drink, right? And so on one level, the actions of Lansman are like, they&#39;re just so weird. Like when you think think about it and his reaction in some ways was like almost like a shot of normalcy but i also think if you look at it through the lens of hey she&#39;s just doing her job she&#39;s being a critic and this guy comes up and starts getting in her business and being kind of handsy it&#39;s</span>

I&#39;m kind of putting it out in the broadest sense with a few examples.

It&#39;s how you come off. What you&#39;ve listed there is largely identity. Those are components of a visual identity, written identity, the words you use. And that&#39;s the kind of stuff a campaign has control over, but ultimately you judge its success or not based on what your brand is. So the brand is the outcome. The brand is not the action. Love it. And I think that&#39;s important to keep in mind, especially as we go into some of these candidates, and maybe I&#39;ll keep my powder dry on that. But like a lot of these folks have a brand coming in, like we already think things about them, which means the identity that they&#39;re presenting, visual words, all of that, it</span>

Let&#39;s say Freeland is elected, her brand extremely distinct, right? With the red everywhere, and we could talk about it, right? And what implications will that have on the overall liberal brand? So it&#39;s an interesting point. We&#39;ve talked about the politics, like all three of us in various forums, including this one, have talked about the politics of being able to run a race literally within seconds of winning this one. but then that&#39;s also got</span>

It&#39;s not something you can assess on the front end. This is what I&#39;m talking about. And rightfully so, to Corey&#39;s point, is more visual identity or broader identity, including the words, etc. So what the pieces we should be assessing today, we can continue to have that discussion. If you&#39;ve got any thoughts on those in terms of which pieces you find most important, like even like tactically, like I like that, for example, like the hero image means a lot to me, like I&#39;d love to hear that sort of thing.

Does a small event make sense? Does streaming make sense? Does not make sense? And a lot of the time, you&#39;ll argue the pros and cons, merits of those things. But anyone who&#39;s worked with me knows I&#39;ve got a bit of a shorthand for this, which is brand answers all questions. if you work backwards from how you want to present yourself those things resolve relatively quickly and relatively easily so i&#39;d be curious to hear steven the conversation that might have occurred in the carny campaign so much as you can provide it but that to me and you don&#39;t always get it right like right sometimes you fuck it up but like that to me is like well who are we trying to be well then of course this is how we have to launch right and uh when i see the carny launch video video and how it started with the graphics of you know i was born here and then i lived in edmonton and then a lot of his canadian origin story is in</span>

Let&#39;s start with Krista Freeland. She&#39;s at kristafreeland.ca is where her campaign&#39;s at. She&#39;s leaning heavily on the last name. People can look this up. That&#39;s better than me explaining any of it. So I won&#39;t. I won&#39;t explain any of it other than turning it over to you guys if you want to talk about it. Let&#39;s start with this.

And I think that makes perfect sense. That&#39;s her background. That&#39;s who she is. And I really do believe she has a good sense of what she wants to do. However, I&#39;m going to give you a couple of minuses here. And unfortunately, they do somewhat stack together. One minus is the polish of her visual identity here. And I think it is such a fascinating example to me about graphic design and how there is such a fine line between stellar graphic design and bad graphic design.

And you can say to her credit, she didn&#39;t take it safe, but I&#39;d say to her detriment, she didn&#39;t deliver on it. It&#39;s also by far the sloppiest of the pages on some technical components. It was driving me up the fucking wall today when I was looking at it, and she&#39;s got all of these buttons at the top.

So if you go to Party Renewal Plan, or other than that one, I guess, Donate, Volunteer, you see that image kind of underneath of Krista. Thoughts on, like, the portrait-style image, singular of Krista Freeland versus what you see with other candidates, people around them. um more sort of surrounded by by everyday folks from a launch etc i&#39;m kind of curious on your on your take with freeland right at the heart and the center of it not necessarily surrounded by by by people almost like a like a intense portrait shot there any</span>

Corey, I&#39;ll get to your constructive delta, but Carter makes an interesting point. Minimal policy, if any, on the Carney page, I&#39;m just looking at that right now, versus Freeland, minimal policy, but does have a party</span>

            <span class="text">party renewal plan, a six-step party renewal strategy, which I think is interesting from the perspective of audience as well, right? Carter talks here about, hold me to the standard of next Prime Minister of Canada. Freeland is wrapping wrapping herself in the flag, making sure she&#39;s centered as liberal, and then talking about the party. So they&#39;ve, you know, deliberately or not chosen distinct swim lanes, even in their lack thereof, and or chosen policy prescriptions that they&#39;ve put out there.

            <span class="text">So I&#39;m not fussed with his video not being on the website. First of all, we live in a more of like an ecosystem environment now. And there are a lot of channels that can carry that. But there&#39;s a a very practical reason not to rely on people going to your website to find your video i think actually i will say the carney campaign i tried to find it on youtube and i really struggled and i think that&#39;s a big miss right because sometimes you just go to where you think videos are and you want to find it but the reason you want to drive people to those other channels the social channels whether it be twitter or facebook or</span>

But Carter also makes a compelling argument, which is if you go to the website, the video is the greatest sales pitch in order to get you to sign up, and it&#39;s missing. so i could see both sides of like the constructive tactical argument i&#39;m</span>

And in some ways, it is the one that is the closest and most direct line from the existing liberal brand. And so this is kind of the paradox of Karina Gould&#39;s campaign to me. Like in some ways, she&#39;s youth and change because of who she is. But a lot of what she&#39;s saying is probably the most consistent with the Trudeau liberals and how the liberals have presented themselves over the past bit. And she&#39;s a very good communicator. But my negative is, I think this has not actually changed. I think that if you put this to Canadians, unless they are so wowed by the fact that you are younger, and like, you know, it also just wrecks my brain that she&#39;s a fair bit younger than me even, right?

There must always be people willing to try and there must always be people willing to take the first steps, even if their journey is one meant to pave the way for future generations. He&#39;s basically saying, he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s in it to win it. He&#39;s in it to be a trailblazer so that the next, you know, up and coming, maybe even himself in a future contest, but the next up and coming Indigenous leader says, fuck yeah, I won&#39;t, you know, there are people who&#39;ve done this before. Jamie did this this back in 2025 why there&#39;s a path here i can do this and i think that&#39;s great um i think if anything he&#39;s selling himself a little too short uh even if you&#39;re not in it to win it act</span>

You can answer this however you please, but I find this to be interesting as like three practitioners talking about this. Which of these brands would you want to take and find your most talented designer in your network and say, give me 10 hours with this? i want to do something with it so it could be it could be you know any of these that we&#39;ve seen even the the final three that we rapid fired and said i&#39;ve got i&#39;m going to take my favorite best most interesting designer and 10 hours uh and i want this project which project would you choose uh between the six that we have uh discussed today freeland</span>

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think, and I said this, but I really want to underline, you could make that brand amazing. You couldn&#39;t just hand it to one of the other candidates and make it work, right? Your brand is really tied to who you are as an individual, how you&#39;re perceived as an individual and what your goals are. And so, well,</span>
