        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the last week in politics. Would Mulcair have been able to stay on as leader if the NDP convention was in Toronto? Is it time for Bernie Sanders to call it quits? And did Ric McIver lose his mind or only his dignity? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">Corey, I want to go to you about this Mulcair question. Carter raises a good point, and I want to talk to you about the same one. The concept of location bias and the location of a convention, you&#39;ve gone through a few of these yourself. Explain to me from your angle if that bias exists, which I think we&#39;re leaning towards, yes, but how do you counteract it or how do you play towards it or against it is it how do you kind of strategize</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">it yeah there&#39;s only been a few conventions i&#39;ve ever been to that did not have a location bias and those were in the good old days when leadership was done by delegates because they everybody tried to send full slates in very contested nominations correct yes</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">uh so regardless of whether you&#39;re coming from montreal or alberta you were sending your i think it was 14 delegates because otherwise you were people were organizing to make that happen that was going to happen but But in off years, and now every convention is an off-year convention because you don&#39;t actually pick the leader there. Interesting, and I think we should talk about it someday, and maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be today, that we elect our leaders one way and we turf them a different way. And if you haven&#39;t set up like an interesting complication there.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">yeah, any other time, assuming you&#39;re not going to get full slates, you have this bias towards the proximity of the convention. And in fact, it&#39;s gotten worse because most of the parties, NDP including, have set up this system where you can be elected as a delegate. And even if you&#39;ve hit your threshold in Alberta or in your riding of Calgary Confederation, they&#39;ll just slot you into a different riding. You&#39;ll be a delegate for them because they&#39;d like to have the numbers. They want the optics. They want to have a number of, it&#39;s not even slates at that point. It&#39;s like, let&#39;s get as many people as possible to this convention. Let&#39;s have it as full as possible.</div>
