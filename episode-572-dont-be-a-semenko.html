            <span class="text">This is The Strategist, episode 572. My name is Zain Velji. With me, as always, Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan. Guys, how are you?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, it&#39;s going to be one of those days. One of those days. Listen, you should be more excited because we have done it, Stephen. We have done it. Alberta now, the only province with an NDP government. How exciting. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I got to tell you, if I had bet on this 10 years ago, I would have made a ton of money. The odds against this were so unbelievably minimal. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I would have made him... Almost as good as the odds that the Wizards would not make the playoffs. I think that&#39;s what I equate this to. Why are you hurting like that? I don&#39;t like that. That&#39;s just mean. We should probably do an entire episode on Manitoba. Should we not, Carter?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, this has to be the same focus that we gave to Saskatchewan. Great.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Great. So we&#39;re done. Yeah. Well, look, that was an interesting election. It was an interesting election, but frankly... We&#39;re probably getting into</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">into the game a little too late to talk about that one. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, we missed the boat. I blame Steven for that. I really do. But I guess there&#39;s other stuff to talk about, and I want to get into that. Corey, is there anything on top of your mind right now that you would want to talk about? I&#39;m effectively writing the show as we go. Okay, well, yesterday, of course, the U.S.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">primary in New York. Okay, we&#39;ll do some of that. Gave some life to some narratives there. We have in</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">in Alberta, the leader of the PCs lost their mind a bit, and the fallout from the budget in general. That&#39;s interesting. And, of course, Tom</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Tom Mulcair being on a Quebec television show, I think. Maybe it was radio. I think it was television. Oh, it was TV. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Essentially suggesting that if the NDP convention had been in Toronto, he might still be leader. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I like this. That sounds real fun. I&#39;m just crowdsourcing the show now, Carter. That&#39;s where I&#39;ve gotten to. I&#39;ve effectively just asked you guys what you want to talk about. Well, let&#39;s start there. Let&#39;s start with that segment. The beard has no chill for Alberta.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so it&#39;s effectively Tom Mulcair on a French television show, glass of wine, talking talking casually about the fact that if his leadership vote were not held in Alberta, he may be or may have stood a chance to get through it. Stephen Carter, what do you say?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Thomas Mulcair apparently knows nothing about politics.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Thomas Mulcair can&#39;t do math. Thomas Mulcair. Okay, so every delegated convention has a similar location</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">location bias. Let&#39;s start with the premise. Is there a location bias? absolutely there&#39;s a great broad question</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">question let&#39;s start there i like that the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the location bias exists it will always exist and basically the location bias is it&#39;s easier to get there when you live in the same province or you live in the same city right so if you have a convention in downtown toronto with its 36 or whatever ridings immediately there right and then it grows bigger in the 905 and now all those people right there it&#39;s easy for them to get to the to the convention</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">absolutely but that&#39;s not why you choose to hold a convention in a certain place why do you choose</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">choose a certain place or another i want to actually get into this broad conversation because it&#39;s interesting to me well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well you remember at the preamble when you said that there&#39;s only one ndp government left yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">okay that&#39;s why you hold it okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is this is the you know the beginning of a new ndp movement right right that will be based again in a broad strokes you know how can can we rebuild the party putting it in alberta made sense made sense right there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there were reasons to put it in alberta now were there reasons to put it in toronto were there reasons to put it in montreal of course there are yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s always a reason and it works out like in alberta all of our conventions wind up in red deer right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right and there&#39;s two reasons for that the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">sure there&#39;s one where you don&#39;t want to put it in edmonton don&#39;t want to put in calgary we put it in the compromise but the hotel rooms are cheaper yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right so so there&#39;s there&#39;s all All kinds of practicalities</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">How much does it cost us to get a room? Can we book our convention there? Do they have space for us at this particular time? Right. All these logistics things matter too. Right. So bottom line, is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not guessing at all because the Alberta NDP people, the people, you know, Corey&#39;s people, the people of Corey have basically said the people</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They didn&#39;t have the numbers to unelect Thomas Mulcair. Corey,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I want to go to you about this Mulcair question. Carter raises a good point, and I want to talk to you about the same one. The concept of location bias and the location of a convention, you&#39;ve gone through a few of these yourself. Explain to me from your angle if that bias exists, which I think we&#39;re leaning towards, yes, but how do you counteract it or how do you play towards it or against it is it how do you kind of strategize</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it yeah there&#39;s only been a few conventions i&#39;ve ever been to that did not have a location bias and those were in the good old days when leadership was done by delegates because they everybody tried to send full slates in very contested nominations correct yes</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh so regardless of whether you&#39;re coming from montreal or alberta you were sending your i think it was 14 delegates because otherwise you were people were organizing to make that happen that was going to happen but But in off years, and now every convention is an off-year convention because you don&#39;t actually pick the leader there. Interesting, and I think we should talk about it someday, and maybe it doesn&#39;t have to be today, that we elect our leaders one way and we turf them a different way. And if you haven&#39;t set up like an interesting complication there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah, any other time, assuming you&#39;re not going to get full slates, you have this bias towards the proximity of the convention. And in fact, it&#39;s gotten worse because most of the parties, NDP including, have set up this system where you can be elected as a delegate. And even if you&#39;ve hit your threshold in Alberta or in your riding of Calgary Confederation, they&#39;ll just slot you into a different riding. You&#39;ll be a delegate for them because they&#39;d like to have the numbers. They want the optics. They want to have a number of, it&#39;s not even slates at that point. It&#39;s like, let&#39;s get as many people as possible to this convention. Let&#39;s have it as full as possible.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s go. go uh and unfortunately for tom mulcair he&#39;s an idiot right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

We&#39;ve talked about Mulcair and Alberta. Let&#39;s just continue on with Alberta very quickly. Stephen Carter, the leader of the PC party, Rick McIver, was thrown out effectively. You know what? I&#39;ll let you tee this up because, frankly, the facts don&#39;t speak as well as they do when Stephen Carter explains them to us. So story time with Stephen. Here we go. Story</span>

A copy of the speaker&#39;s decision was distributed with the amendment to a private member&#39;s bill. It&#39;s important that it&#39;s a private member&#39;s bill because, generally speaking, a government member does not try</span>
