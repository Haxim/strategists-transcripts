People are doing weird shit, like bringing goats on screen. It&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s excellent. It&#39;s really, really good. I think, I think we have to replicate this. We have to.

            <span class="text">So, guys, we have Julie Payette, the Governor General of Canada, embroiled in this scandal. It came out a few weeks ago that her staff, 17 people on Deep Background with the CBC, had talked about some of her behaviors with her staff. Now it&#39;s coming out that she spent a quarter of a million dollars for some renovations to Redo Hall, partially for security. Another part for, I guess, a cat elevator or a cat staircase of some kind. Anyways, all that being said, she has not moved into Rideau Hall. How big of a problem is this for the government now? Because initially it was interesting. It was fascinating. It was like, oh, look at this PR problem that might exist for Rideau Hall. But now the connection to government seems to be happening. And, Corey, I want to start with you. Is this a problem for the Trudeau government?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Sure. Sure. I mean, they picked a multilingual astronaut because they thought it was cool and it matched this vision of Justin Trudeau&#39;s Canada. But ultimately, here&#39;s the thing about the governor general. It&#39;s one of those positions that just</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just bleeds into the background most of the time. And when you see it, it&#39;s usually not a good thing. Usually it means either we&#39;ve got a bit of a constitutional crisis going on or a lot of gaffes. And we&#39;ve had a couple of governors general, I suppose, lately who have found themselves in the public eye, Adrian Clarkson, Michelle Jeanne, you know, and never really for great</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">great reasons. You know, either it&#39;s dealing with a constitutional crisis or dealing with them doing something that people think the representative has no business doing. Now, here&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s actually a really important job on paper, even if in practice it&#39;s not. You open up the Constitution, do your old Command F, you&#39;re going to find Governor General mentioned, I don&#39;t know, about 70 times to the Prime Minister&#39;s five, and none of those five were before the Constitution Act of 1982. All of the power in this country rests with this position. And so you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you ultimately have to start getting a little bit nervous when things start going off the rails so foundationally because Canadians start saying things like, why in the world do we even have a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a representative like this? I&#39;m one of them, frankly. I just think it&#39;s impossible for us to get rid of the position with our constitution amending formula the way it is. But it makes things awkward for you as a government. It calls into question your judgment as a prime minister. I don&#39;t necessarily think this is the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the biggest scandal facing the Trudeau government right now, but it&#39;s obviously something that they&#39;re going to have to watch, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re a little embarrassed about.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, map this out for us. How big of a deal is this for the PMO?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s a problem they don&#39;t need. I mean, I guess on some levels it&#39;s served as a channel changer from their own problems with the WE Charity. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So this has now changed it to something different, which on some levels they&#39;re not necessarily directly responsible for. I mean, certainly they nominated Julie Payette to be the governor general. It doesn&#39;t just happen. It&#39;s not a lottery, although wouldn&#39;t that be cool? It should be. I mean, take a look at those Oilers 50-50s. Hey, we all throw in $100 and the winner gets to be governor general. I&#39;m in. in um but you know one of the things that that cory listed off is he listed off three uh governors general who have been uh embroiled in conflict and scandal and up uptick and uproar and problems and all three of them just happen to be the three women uh the three most recent you know the the three women who&#39;ve served as the governor general uh we don&#39;t hear very much about david johnson um in part i don&#39;t know that we didn&#39;t because we didn&#39;t go looking for it now he did spend spend $76,000 in taxpayer money, you know, on</span>

I do think that we are far more willing and prepared to be outraged about our female governors general than we are about our male governors general, as it is in politics in general. You know, serving as a female premier or as a female member of Parliament or as a female member of the Legislative Assembly is a different experience than serving as a male.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Piat, Julie Piat, and that&#39;s that they&#39;re all appointed by liberal governments. And I think there is a difference in how the liberals and the conservatives tend to have treated this office in the past that we should acknowledge here. The liberals tend to try to find a showy set piece for Governor General that represents the country as they see it and as how we feel, you know, know, diverse, big, bold. You know, and when you have a male prime minister, having a female governor general does seem like a nice counterweight if you&#39;re the Liberal Party in particular. So there is that element too. And there&#39;s a challenge with that, because when you get big personalities to be governor general, they are going to find themselves in the spotlight more than the David Johnstons of the world. University administrators don&#39;t tend to seek the spotlight. That&#39;s just not necessarily something that goes with the job. I mean, I mean, there&#39;s obviously very charismatic university presidents, but they tend to comport</span>

That being said, right now, Corey, I&#39;m going to you again, because Carter kind of gave me his answer, and I&#39;ll go back to him to get the more fulsome level of it. If you are in the PMO right now, right, if you&#39;re tasked with issues managing this, if you&#39;re tasked with saying, is this something we lean into? Is this something we shy away from? What are you doing from a messaging and calm strategy right now in the PMO?</span>

You&#39;re gathering all of the facts that you can. You are giving yourself a bit of distance from the Governor General. You&#39;re reminding people of the nature of the role being separate from the government wherever possible. And certainly, I think we saw that with comments from Chrystia Freeland, I believe it was. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">that is not a headache that they need either.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it is a pretty decent channel changer. It takes the heat from you and puts it on someone else. It works on a few different fronts. I mean, she&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">she&#39;s put herself in this position. Why not take advantage of it if you&#39;re in the prime minister&#39;s office? It keeps you away from the wee charity problem. That&#39;s not a bad thing. People do love to focus their attention on, you know, people in power. So I guess it could be something that you would do. I think that the problem is that then what, right? Right. So let&#39;s say that you&#39;re successful in getting Julie Payette to stand down. She resigns. Now you&#39;ve got to just nail the next selection. And Corey makes an excellent point about the Liberals wanting to select a standard bearer for all of Canada. It&#39;s just it&#39;s a really hard thing to do. It&#39;s hard to find a single person who reflects the entirety of Canada. I mean, Julie Payette on paper is perfect. uh it&#39;s just it&#39;s just the the perfection that we&#39;ve come to expect uh isn&#39;t</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i can&#39;t in in support of stevens why not talk about this strategy i can&#39;t imagine losing a single vote because you appointed a bad gg like people just don&#39;t think it&#39;s an important job so you know it doesn&#39;t really look like you&#39;re imperiling the health system or anything like that it&#39;s it&#39;s chatter but it&#39;s not damaging chatter for the most part now to cut against that though they also don&#39;t think it&#39;s an important job and if you are a government that can&#39;t solve this problem that&#39;s not a very good look so if it looks like you are sitting there as the prime minister theoretically the person who runs this country unable to rein in a governor general who who is spending from the public purse far too much, is abusing staff. When you do have all of those levers where you could solve this problem, that becomes a bit of a challenge for them. So for that reason, I don&#39;t think I would lean into the problem because I don&#39;t think they have good solutions. It would be one thing if you roped it out a bit and then you had a brilliant selection, and maybe they do, but if you had a brilliant selection for Governor General to come in behind. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.</span>

I mean, she is a brilliant person. She&#39;s exactly what we want. You know, a STEM-focused female who&#39;s achieved everything, who reflects the entire nation of Canada. This is exactly who we want. She turns out has some failings, like we all do. Like, God.</span>

And especially when it&#39;s perhaps their final chapter, and they&#39;ve been chosen for the symbol and everything they&#39;ve represented as the layers of their identities that they&#39;ve constructed in their previous chapters of their life. Carter, I want to go to you on this, because we talked about, okay, what the government should do. Interesting tension between you and Corey as to what that looks like. What should our friends in the opposition do? If you&#39;re the conservatives or the NDP, is there any juice in this story? Is it the angle that Corey mentioned around a prime minister that can&#39;t reign a governor general in? Is it about the liberal HR and vetting process, just throwing a couple of things out there? Is there any hay to be made? I mean, listen, let&#39;s be clear, and we&#39;ll talk about this shortly. our friends in the Conservative Party have been very good at expanding the scope on things, everything, throwing everything against the wall. But with that being said, is there anything special or unique about this story that you may want to lean in and get the government to start talking about?</span>

How has it been? Or sorry, not the mattresses just disappearing, turtling here. Because, Because, you know, if it was going to work, it was going to work.

She should get out, tell her story, get herself cleaned up from this and then resume. I&#39;m assuming a job that she wants being the governor general. It&#39;s not a bad gig.

Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. This is, of course, the story of Katie Telford and her husband, Rob Silver. So recently it was revealed that the commercial rent program that was being offered by the government as part of the pandemic relief was outsourced to a company that current liberal chief of staff or PMO chief of staff, Katie Telford&#39;s husband, Rob Silver, works at. the media or at least a couple of outlets, specifically the National Post and the Globe and Mail, had a little bit of a hullabaloo about this. Stephen, explain to us what&#39;s going on here. What do you think is happening? Because it seems to be that outside of a few outlets, and you can correct me if I&#39;m wrong or if you disagree, that most people are saying there&#39;s nothing wrong here. She put out the disclosures that she needed to as the Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister voluntarily. They had a Chinese wall between any decisions made regarding this this company. It seemed like she took all the necessary precautions, but give us your assessment of this current situation.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">of the We Scandal so that they can jump all over it because it got them such high ratings and so many click-throughs and so many eyeballs on their stories. And let&#39;s be clear, the media chase eyeballs. They&#39;re not just out there to put out the news. They&#39;re there to to gather an audience, just like we&#39;re here to gather a massive audience through my subsidizing of the virtual audience.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is our reality in a commercial news environment. They&#39;re out to find the next We Scandal. So they go and they find this thing and they think, oh, this is salacious. This is going to be a thing. They do their homework. They don&#39;t care what is actually in place. What&#39;s actually in place is an ethics commissioner advance ruling ruling, you know, a full disclosure in advance prior to anything happening. When Rob Silver took the job, Katie Telford walked her ass down to the ethics commissioner and said, this is what&#39;s happening. What do I need to do? The ethics commissioner gave her a perfect outline of what should be done. And she did it. And you know how I know this is good? Because people from the pundits, people who&#39;ve worked in government from the left and the right and the center are all watching and saying this is exactly what should have been done. She walked out. She declared the potential conflict. She got the advice from the ethics commissioner. She followed that advice. The fact that this company, a recognized expert in the field, happened to win a contract when Katie Telford wasn&#39;t involved shouldn&#39;t be a story. But the media is chasing their eyeballs, their click-throughs, and they want to misrepresent the news just so that they can get another scoop. And I think it&#39;s pathetic. And it just frustrates the hell out of me. Did I do a good enough job? I want to be happy.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I, because the media has lost the plot as badly as everybody else in the world. Steven&#39;s entirely right. You know what? Actually, I will be more charitable. This became a story because they thought they had a story. They chased it down for several days. They realized at the end they didn&#39;t, but they&#39;d spent a lot of time on it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And somebody else said, wow, that&#39;s really awesome. And they followed it too. It&#39;s not a story. I mean, this is, you could have written this entire story. It wouldn&#39;t be very interesting news, but it would have been much more honest if it just said, you know, they did everything right. They didn&#39;t just do everything right. They took a step beyond what the ethics commissioner said, I seem to recall. I believe the ethics commissioner said, well, given the nature of it, it&#39;s not likely you&#39;re going to come across it all the time. You don&#39;t need a screen for this. And they set one up anyhow. And by the way, Zane, we do not use the term Chinese wall anymore because it&#39;s fucking 2020. uh but they set up the screen and um and</span>

Because I want to talk to you about the politics of this and the strategy, because this kind of seems like if everyone&#39;s on side with you saying this is not a story, is there anything for the PMO and the liberals right now to make out of this to try to pivot away from we is there anything that they can do to kind of showcase that? Look, another proof point as to how they&#39;re trying to expand the scope on we is there Anything you can maneuver or tightrope walk on, I hope that term&#39;s appropriate, to be able to take this story and perhaps convert it into a bit of a political win.</span>

It doesn&#39;t matter if you do everything right. right. They are going to come after you because you are associated with the prime minister or you are the prime minister or what be. And we should all look at these things with quite a jaundiced eye because it doesn&#39;t matter how pure we are. Look how honestly and well we did here meeting with the ethics commissioner up front. They&#39;re going to have a problem with it. We can do no right as evidenced by this, as evidenced with We Scandal. But the reality is we followed all of the rules.

We&#39;ve talked about what message they need to go out, how they can use this as, as perhaps a tool to illustrate that, that the media and the opposition are off base as it relates to the WE scandal. But what exact messenger are you using? What strategy or tactic are you implementing this fact right now? If you&#39;re in the PMO, or if this happened to you, what sort of mechanisms are you trying to use to get this message out that, look, this is an example of how they&#39;re just after us baselessly?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I would use actually all the NDP and conservatives that have stepped out of the woodwork to defend me. You know, the Twitterverse is lit up with with people jumping to Katie Telford&#39;s defense. This is not their normal position. You didn&#39;t see them leap to the prime minister&#39;s defense during the Wee scandal. They are doing so because they know the consequence of not being able to get staff in the future. And that&#39;s what this is all about. This is about trying to find staff that will fulfill these roles. Like Rob Silver, when Katie became the chief of staff initially, He stepped down from his partner&#39;s role at Crestview Strategies. That should not be required. That should not be the thing, the norm for how a political staffer&#39;s spouse needs to behave in order to avoid conflict of interest. Rob gets offered what appears to be a pretty darn good gig. He takes the good gig because he&#39;s very</span>

You have to divest yourself of certain investments and all of – disinvest, I suppose. But for your family, for those in your immediate orbit, it makes things difficult for them. It makes things difficult for your old business associates who now are probably not going to get contracts with the government as readily because people will say, oh, Lord, is that going to start looking like a conflict in different senses? It&#39;s tough. It&#39;s really tough. And it&#39;s not a selling point of the gig. That&#39;s for damn sure. And so I really applaud her for going to the ethics commissioner. commissioner by the way i i shouldn&#39;t applaud her for doing what&#39;s right but to go to the ethics commissioner have the ethics commissioner&#39;s advice and then say you know i actually want to go a bit further than that i applaud her for that and um and honestly to have an article still written like this and to have people still coming after you like this i mean talk about no good deed goes unpunished just</span>

            <span class="text">with our public health officials across the country, what we&#39;re starting to see, and I think we can start pointing with a conversation here in Alberta with Dr. Dina Hinshaw, you know, is someone who was celebrated during the pandemic in the months of March, April, leading into May, as being the sage advice, the leader of ensuring Alberta&#39;s case count was low, that our hospitalization numbers were, you know, kept at bay, you know, almost having the Premier step aside and ensure that she was the singular voice. And we saw that obviously in BC as well with Dr. Bonnie Hendry. What I think we&#39;re seeing now in the summer months is a bit of public opinion turning as As the government has, in both of those provinces, started to make their decisions on things like school reopenings and what time to trigger what phases of the overall reopenings in each province, we&#39;re starting to see perhaps a little bit more mixed response to their leadership. So, Corey, I wanted to start with you. Is this any surprise to you? What do you kind of make of this from heralded as public opinion, you know, at the top of their game to now perhaps slipping a bit? it uh a does this surprise you and b what do you kind of credit it to so to speak yeah</span>

They just don&#39;t, or a New Democrat. Most people in the world don&#39;t, but the deeply politically engaged do, And they can&#39;t help but see everything through that lens.

            <span class="text">Corey, I want to pick up on what Carter just said around the politicians, right? Because while these public health officials from across the country and in our various provinces might not themselves be looking at every decision through a political lens, our politicians are certainly using some of them as political chess pieces, so to speak, right, to ensure that they&#39;re cover for certain policies that they want to implement, that they are, you know, on side. How do you kind of see that dynamic playing out? And is there any sort of risk or downside risk for whether that&#39;s Jason Kenney here in Alberta or Premier Horgan in BC, you know, or even at the federal level, Dr. Theresa Tam, where politicians are injecting their ideology and ensuring, you know, this jives, right? And it almost starts forcing public health officials to go in a certain way, but kinda?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, as it ever was, right? Politicians use experts for political cover all of the time right whether it is academics whether it is interest groups who come forward and say you know this is something we&#39;d like to do and and it&#39;s the same story it&#39;s just playing out on a much bigger stage something that&#39;s much more dramatic right now and um unfortunately um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that that really sort of changes people&#39;s views of it just because the the stakes are so much higher. And look, if you are a politician, you&#39;ve got to be very careful because as I mentioned, sometimes academics get used regularly. Sometimes interest groups get used regularly. What you find is if they&#39;re used too regularly and they too consistently back up the party, they are seen to continue the conversation we had in the last round here as</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as just associated with that party, associated with that tribe, and they lose any kind of of persuasive power they have to the other side. And so if you overuse your health official in that fashion, the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the other side, the quote unquote other side, the opposition is going to start tuning them out. And that&#39;s a challenge. So if you&#39;re a public health official, you&#39;re kind of caught in the middle. As the premier, you want to be able to point to the public health official and say, we&#39;re doing it for these reasons. If you are the public health official, you want to make sure the public is listening to you. And if you are the public, you want to make sure you&#39;re getting the straight goods from a health official who&#39;s not being kind of corrupted by politics. And that&#39;s a deeply uncomfortable place for all of the parties to be in because everybody&#39;s got to reassess everybody on a very consistent basis. And I think</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">And so I hope that if there&#39;s a takeaway people can have here, it&#39;s the same sort of looking at the validator, in this case the health official, and thinking about where</span>

But this was a story that was about this mug that was produced, according to the individual who made it, you know, local artisan, she said, you know, it&#39;s supposed to be tongue in cheek. And City TV covered it as a story regarding the eroding political discourse had a political science Prof talk about how this, this story is a symbol of it. Twitter and the political zeitgeist kind of took, you know, took some issue with this simply because this is not the first time our political discourse has gone here, especially in Alberta, where we&#39;ve seen, you know, the same attacks, if not more vulgar against Justin Trudeau against Rachel Notley in years past.

I think they&#39;re going to be disappointed. But, you know, nonetheless, here we are. The world is a crazy place.

What does Trudeau get out of this? You know, he appeals to a large subset of the population that wants stronger environmental protections, not weaker environmental protections. He doesn&#39;t win any votes in Alberta by doing this. There are no votes to be had for him in Alberta. So what the hell is he doing? Strengthen those environmental protections. Do not weaken them. I don&#39;t give a shit if COVID&#39;s, you know, making it difficult. It&#39;s time to do the right thing.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I agree. The thing that the federal government perhaps is concerned about is exactly what Jason Kenney is concerned about. Oil and gas is a huge part of the Canadian economy, and they might be worried about how they can sweeten the pot in that sense and what can they throw to Alberta. But if you&#39;re going to do that, reducing environmental protections doesn&#39;t – like that doesn&#39;t create jobs. That maybe increases your dividend or the amount of net income that&#39;s available to you if you&#39;re profitable as a company. But maybe a smarter path here would have been in all of this COVID spending to say, yeah, we will provide money</span>

I mean, that to me seems like it would have been a better play. And so I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t get it. I think it was short-sighted, and it&#39;s just going to lose him support with people who he needs to support. And also, with so many big fights on oil and gas coming up,</span>

If you recall, Alberta, when they rolled out their provincial app, had a ton of problems, ton of issues. But are you in or out for what you&#39;ve seen thus far for how the feds have rolled out the COVID app? As someone who&#39;s kind of led comms for a government, kind of wanted to get your assessment first. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, no, I&#39;m in. I think whenever you roll out anything technical like this, you risk the Obamacare disaster, right? And the media is conditioned to look for stories of this doesn&#39;t work on old platforms. Oh, somebody found like they were sent a code by mistake, anything like that. There&#39;s always going to be something. And so aiming for like a perfect, no noise launch is not possible. And when you consider that, I think they did a really great job. And obviously, I think it was good enough that I myself downloaded it, but in a province that it doesn&#39;t even work yet. Yeah.</span>

Right. After a bit of why don&#39;t you help me first has gone to the federal app just really says the federal app is the place to be. And and if your critics in Alberta can get on board with it, I think that tells you you&#39;ve got a pretty clean launch. launch</span>

They gave us, of course, five stars, and that is what renders me to then ask said question. Here&#39;s part of the review. Okay. Hey, guys. I&#39;m caught up on your episodes and glad to see that you&#39;re back. Though you&#39;re fabulous enough, you do not need to diss Canada Land or the Boys in Short Pants, so giving us some unsolicited advice, which we will not be taking. Also, I see nothing about City TV, which we started a war with today. Now for the question. Corey, I want to go to you first for obvious reasons, because you will get this in a second.

My son-in-law, a former Alberta resident, thinks that the Alberta NDP should try to merge with the Alberta Liberals, and I personally feel that this is something that Rachel should not waste her efforts on.
