Well, now that conservative convention in Quebec City has happened. It&#39;s over. It&#39;s done with guest speakers, endorsements. There was musical entertainment. And of course, there was an hour plus long speech by the leader, Pierre Polyev himself in the round. Corey, I want to actually talk about a few things from this convention, a few things not from this convention, which is why I call the segment Pierre Potpourri. There&#39;s a few things to talk about about Pierre Polyev, interlinked kind of through the one connective tissue known as Pyropolyev. But let&#39;s start with your initial thoughts on his speech. Give me your thoughts on what he said this weekend in Quebec City. Was there anything interesting, anything politically resonant, anything strategically fascinating for you? Put some things on the table. We&#39;ll talk about this, and then I&#39;ve got a couple of questions for you guys.</div>

He wants to free people to build all of these new green energy and electricity production things that will solve our problems. By the way, talks a lot about the various electricity alternatives out there, doesn&#39;t mention solar, doesn&#39;t mention wind, talks about nuclear, talks about hydro, and essentially is creating a conservative version of how you can approach climate change, which is to get rid of the regulations and taxes that the government has provided.

I recall that the lead up to that one-year anniversary question, even the day he won in a major way, let&#39;s not forget how much of a thumping his victory was, was that even with the analysis, it was about a party divided. Where&#39;s the soul of the conservative movement? What&#39;s going to happen? Are they going to be able to stitch these two halves that don&#39;t belong together together in a meaningful way? Carter, that conversation seems to have died out, if not been completely wiped off the table. The first thing I want to talk is a strategy around unification. Your thoughts around it for Pierre one year later, are you impressed? Are you not impressed? Do you feel like there&#39;s still risks?

He&#39;s just going to pivot. My problem is is that he hasn&#39;t really pivoted, right? He remains kind of the relatively far right guy out there.

We certainly have seen tons of instances in the last bit where the government has looked like a dead government walking two years out from their mandate. And that&#39;s just how it&#39;s going to be. I would rather be here than 10 points behind. All of the pressure is on Justin Trudeau right now. I almost said Pierre Trudeau. I think he&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t think people are putting the pressure on him as it stands. But there is a question as to whether Pierre Poiliev might be going out on certain policy limbs. I don&#39;t think the consequences are going to be high. But for example, to talk about how he&#39;s going to tackle inflation, it&#39;s quite possible in 18 months, inflation will have tackled itself. I mean, not itself. A lot of hard work by a lot of people, not trying to, you know, denigrate the good work of the Bank of Canada here.

The goals that they had are being met. The question I have, and in that same vein of strategist wisdom, which is, if it&#39;s working, do you add more stuff to the mix? I don&#39;t think the three of us would agree that furthering the ad campaign is a bad idea, unless you do. Chump in on that. But adding new creative when the creative that you have is already working, give me your thoughts on that. What&#39;s your line to kind of make that decision? I know it could be an entire episode on its own, but it&#39;s come up this weekend and I wanted to just get your take on it. It seems to be working. They have more. What should they do?

So when you talk about advertising, there&#39;s two things that are, I think, relevant to this particular conversation because we&#39;re talking about ad creative and we&#39;re talking about more ads there are diseconomies of scale and economies of scale in advertising the economies of scale come from obviously</div>

As folks who, you know, between the three of us who&#39;ve placed, created, scripted, done all of that sort of stuff, bought media in certain cases to place advertising. I guess the question I have, if I can spend a few more minutes on this, Carter, is, you You know, have you seen a play where because new creative for advertising was on the menu of what we do next, it was the next thing we&#39;re supposed to do, that it&#39;s actually undercut what&#39;s been working. Change doesn&#39;t necessarily equal progress. Talk to me about that. That&#39;s kind of at the heart of the issue, what I wanted to get to. And I know we can&#39;t discern from like one source that that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here, but that&#39;s kind of the conversation I wanted to have. Like, give me your experience where simply the change, because it&#39;s the next thing we&#39;re supposed to do undercuts the progress that you seem to be already making with your existing. And it could be advertising, it could be strategy, it could be messaging, but that&#39;s kind of the heart of the issue here.</div>

Any experiences you may have had where you&#39;ve either seen the desire to do something just because it&#39;s on the plan undercut the progress you&#39;re making with your existing creative, existing message, existing plan, existing sort of tactic that you&#39;re employing?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Oh, I mean, for sure. You can flip out creative too frequently and undercut yourself in the process. One of the things that we often see with politicians in speeches is they get bored and they want to change it up. And those of us who work in communication say, no, just Just read the same fucking speech, because by the time you are sick of saying it is maybe when people are starting to pay attention to it. And repetition is just such an important thing in order to deliver any message, certainly in politics as well. And so if you&#39;re flipping creative out too frequently, you&#39;re maybe not giving it time to land any advertising strategy. You&#39;re going to be talking about breadth and depth, right? And frequency, how many times you are going to be hitting the same people. so you know you you might have uh you know a reach of 50 000 and you&#39;re going to hit each of those people three times that might be part of your strategy you might need to hit them 15 times with a political ad in order for them to start feeling it and hearing it that&#39;s just the realities we deal with in politics that&#39;s what we deal with with advocacy and trying to change people&#39;s opinions here it&#39;s not quite the same as this</div>

That was around 80%. While you guys give me a response on this, I&#39;ll pull up exactly what it was.

            <div class="said">I&#39;m not. I think they knew exactly what they were doing. The reality is, if you poll on these issues with certain phrasings, you are going to find 70% support amongst Canadians, right? And so the Conservatives have picked the kind of the social grounds, the social justice grounds that the Liberals are on the least firm ground on when it comes to overall national public opinion, and allowed those to go forward. I think in some ways, it was a pretty fascinating strategy i believe it was entirely intentional i&#39;ll call it a lightning rod strategy where they knew that this issue would generate a lot of media feedback and blowback they knew this would generate a lot of commentary at feedback and blowback but they knew that when it gets down to it and you pull canadians on it they&#39;re probably not really that out of step with where the majority of canadians are that&#39;s just a simple reality you know we&#39;re not talking about something that is about the acceptance of transgender people more generally we&#39;re talking talking about surgeries with children, not fully reversible in some cases.

They think they should get credit for all of the things they did, you know, laudable things in the past few years from the perspective of themselves and the majority of voters, but maybe not germane to the moment that we&#39;re in right now. So the liberals really do need to knuckle down and say, what is the story? What is our coalition? Where are we going to win? Because they&#39;ve been retrenching to major cities, and they&#39;ve been retrenching to fear of the conservatives for for just too long. And, you know, that&#39;s not a strategy that works time and time again. People get bored of that strategy. So you got to tell them a little bit more.</div>

They&#39;ve actually put out an ad campaign for young voters, a series of advertisers, one of which says, some choices mean more than your fit check. Go out and vote. I&#39;m just curious, are you in or out on our nation&#39;s sort of electoral institutions with their vote mobilization campaigns, especially, and now more so, they&#39;ve largely been targeted at young people? Give me your take on this. Are you in or out when these bodies try to make appeals? They almost are the rock the vote of themselves in some ways. Are you in or out when they try to do this? And Manitoba is just another example. Alberta had their own version of this. Like everyone&#39;s doing their, they&#39;re trying to go viral with some fun hip, put hip in air quotes campaign. In or out, Corey? uh</div>

            <div class="said">i mean if we want to if we want to incentivize some sort of uh voter turnout model then incentivize it come up with an incentive uh this isn&#39;t an incentive this This is like an awareness campaign, which is going to generate an outcome of delivering some people to the polls, but not all people to the polls. So therefore, it&#39;s inadvertently going to help someone. Elections Manitoba doesn&#39;t know who they&#39;re helping. Elections Alberta didn&#39;t know who they were helping. City of Calgary doesn&#39;t know who they&#39;re helping. And I&#39;m told, I&#39;m not an expert in this, but I&#39;m told that the outcome isn&#39;t necessarily determined by the voter turnout. out so why don&#39;t we just focus on getting people out that want to vote and fuck the rest of them they can bitch and complain afterwards i</div>
