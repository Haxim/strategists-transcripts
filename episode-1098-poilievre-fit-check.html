But instead, the Canadians, you know, they rallied in the overtime and really made it spectacular. So very good to Canada. uh as you know we are basketball superpower now and uh i gotta tell you i&#39;ve never been more into basketball into the b and the ball as we say in nowhere land one</span>

            <span class="text">I guess, using the conservative convention, which happened this weekend for those that weren&#39;t tuning into politics to talk about conventions. broadly. Well, now that conservative convention in Quebec City has happened. It&#39;s over. It&#39;s done with guest speakers, endorsements. There was musical entertainment. And of course, there was an hour plus long speech by the leader, Pierre Polyev himself in the round. Corey, I want to actually talk about a few things from this convention, a few things not from this convention, which is why I call the segment Pierre Potpourri. There&#39;s a few things to talk about about Pierre Polyev, interlinked kind of through the one connective tissue known as Pyropolyev. But let&#39;s start with your initial thoughts on his speech. Give me your thoughts on what he said this weekend in Quebec City. Was there anything interesting, anything politically resonant, anything strategically fascinating for you? Put some things on the table. We&#39;ll talk about this, and then I&#39;ve got a couple of questions for you guys.</span>

I have to take exception with some of the things that he said, but let&#39;s put all of that aside right now. That speech should scare the shit out of the liberals because it effectively makes a fairly compelling case that things are a lot worse now than they were when Justin Trudeau took office. Ignores a lot of good, ignores things like the Canada child tax benefit, right? But talks about crime being up, talks about the cost of living being up, gives He gives a lot of personal stories about people being affected. I mean, we criticized in the Alberta election the lack of personal stories. This was the exact opposite. This was more personal stories than not, it felt like. You know, he</span>

Whenever he was speaking in English, he was talking about Singh and the NDP. Whenever he was talking in French, he talked about Blanchett and the bloc. And literally never the twain shall meet. Like if you go through the speech, there&#39;s not a lot of mentions of the NDP in French. There&#39;s no mentions of the bloc in English.

We talked about we were begging for personal stories from Rachel Notley, begging for them during the podcast. You know, and Pierre Polyev has them. Pierre Polyev not only has the personal stories. He has them and he tells them in an engaging way, you know, but like like a lot of storytellers, his commitment to truth isn&#39;t necessarily there. Right. His commitment to honesty isn&#39;t necessarily there. But the problem with that isn&#39;t that he&#39;s lying.

            <span class="text">yeah, you know, again, your mileage will vary, but one of the things that made me roll my eyes about the speech was the number of small ball things that the liberals had done, quips that Trudeau had made that had been repurposed into attacks and whatnot. And again, it&#39;s a good reminder, eight years in, you&#39;re going to have a bunch of them. But I wasn&#39;t, for example, thinking that we&#39;d be hearing about ArriveCat in</span>

But, you know, you can almost go through it and check off the various things that the prime minister has said that then became the hook with which Pierre Poliev could talk about an issue. And the biggest one, of course, and to your point about if you&#39;re the liberals and you&#39;re watching this, is it&#39;s very clear they know where the liberals are going.

But for me, it was actually the remarkable commitment to consistency that really was scary, right? Like he called on the CBC to be defunded. He said that the media works for Trudeau, you know, like these are these are things that he has said before and they are you know he&#39;s bringing them up and he&#39;s bringing them up and he&#39;s bringing them up and it&#39;s consistent and one</span>

Corey may have more nuance. Corey remembers more than I do. But for me, it wasn&#39;t that it was new. It was that it was disciplined. It wasn&#39;t that, you know, all of a sudden he&#39;s throwing out the cost of housing. He&#39;s been talking about the cost of housing forever. He brings up things that happened in the past. He&#39;s a dog with a bone. He doesn&#39;t let anything slide. he grabs it he holds it and he will not let it go because he knows that that&#39;s how canadians that&#39;s how everybody frankly um learns to learns and brings in messaging</span>

He wants to free people to build all of these new green energy and electricity production things that will solve our problems. By the way, talks a lot about the various electricity alternatives out there, doesn&#39;t mention solar, doesn&#39;t mention wind, talks about nuclear, talks about hydro, and essentially is creating a conservative version of how you can approach climate change, which is to get rid of the regulations and taxes that the government has provided. Now, a lot of steps missing in between there, a lot of gaps. The suggestion, though, that we would be more green if government got out of the way, fucking</span>

            <span class="text">Pierre Polyev became leader on September 10th, 2022. Today&#39;s the one-year anniversary. I recall that the lead up to that one-year anniversary question, even the day he won in a major way, let&#39;s not forget how much of a thumping his victory was, was that even with the analysis, it was about a party divided. Where&#39;s the soul of the conservative movement? What&#39;s going to happen? Are they going to be able to stitch these two halves that don&#39;t belong together together in a meaningful way? Carter, that conversation seems to have died out, if not been completely wiped off the table. The first thing I want to talk is a strategy around unification. Your thoughts around it for Pierre one year later, are you impressed? Are you not impressed? Do you feel like there&#39;s still risks? Give me a couple thoughts on this as a first sort of topic in Pierre. You</span>

He&#39;s just going to pivot. My problem is is that he hasn&#39;t really pivoted, right? He remains kind of the relatively far right guy out there. And people like Peter McKay are absolutely willing to sell their soul to him just to be a part of the team, just to say.</span>

Like the the 2500 people that would have been at the convention if it was Jean Charest as the leader versus the 2500 people that would be at the convention with Pierre Polyev, it&#39;s irrelevant. What&#39;s relevant now is that Pierre Polyev has been successful in rallying the people. And the people are in the midst of speaking. And it&#39;ll be interesting to see whether or not, well, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s going to get a bump even out of this convention, regardless of how high he was before.</span>

That they&#39;re not going to be as prosperous as their parents? They fucking are, and it&#39;s true. Like, this is one of those things where it&#39;s not just spin.

We&#39;ve talked about this in a more global way on this podcast before, but now we&#39;ve got a specific. Pierre Polyev, no election expected until 2025. Is he peaking too early? As a strategist, would you be concerned he&#39;s peaking too early if you&#39;re helping him out? Give me your thoughts on this. Carter, same question to you in a second.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, not really. We certainly have seen tons of instances in the last bit where the government has looked like a dead government walking two years out from their mandate. And that&#39;s just how it&#39;s going to be. I would rather be here than 10 points behind. All of the pressure is on Justin Trudeau right now. I almost said Pierre Trudeau. I think he&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t think people are putting the pressure on him as it stands. But there is a question as to whether Pierre Poiliev might be going out on certain policy limbs. I don&#39;t think the consequences are going to be high. But for example, to talk about how he&#39;s going to tackle inflation, it&#39;s quite possible in 18 months, inflation will have tackled itself. I mean, not itself. A lot of hard work by a lot of people, not trying to, you know, denigrate the good work of the Bank of Canada here. But But we might be back at 2%, you know, by the time the next election comes,</span>

He wanted us to cut off the tap on the programs you care about. We stayed the course, we made sensible, prudent decisions, inflation got back in line, and you have childcare, and you have those other supports that we&#39;ve created along the way. and so you know that&#39;s a possibility i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big one and i also think people can overthink some of those things this is something he&#39;s got now there&#39;s a moment it&#39;s hurting justin trudeau that hurt will pay dividends in its own right we were just talking about how sometimes you can get in virtuous cycles where people who were your critics internally become your best pals you know once you start to show a little bit of daylight in the polls between you and your opponent.

I&#39;m like, you know, this is going to maybe create more attention on him. I don&#39;t know if I actually fundamentally believed it. Like put on your strategist hat.

The goals that they had are being met. The question I have, and in that same vein of strategist wisdom, which is, if it&#39;s working, do you add more stuff to the mix? I don&#39;t think the three of us would agree that furthering the ad campaign is a bad idea, unless you do. Chump in on that. But adding new creative when the creative that you have is already working, give me your thoughts on that. What&#39;s your line to kind of make that decision? I know it could be an entire episode on its own, but it&#39;s come up this weekend and I wanted to just get your take on it. It seems to be working. They have more. What should they do? Give me the strategy.</span>

This is well-tested advertising that is performing as expected in the market. You know, that&#39;s our bread and butter. That&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to be doing in our campaigns. But, you know, Pierre Pauliev has got... And keep in mind, this is one of the unintended consequences of, you know, spending limits during the writ.

            <span class="text">cory give me your thoughts on this right like Like the conditions as we know them, they have an ad campaign. It seems to be working. They&#39;ve got more ads. They want to do another buy. The real question is, give me your wisdom or how you&#39;d make a decision around swapping the creative or adding new creative if what you already have seems to be doing the job.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It depends on what they&#39;re trying to do. And they are going to have much better information than us whether it is still doing the job. So when you talk about advertising, there&#39;s two things that are, I think, relevant to this particular conversation because we&#39;re talking about ad creative and we&#39;re talking about more ads there are diseconomies of scale and economies of scale in advertising the economies of scale come from obviously</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">obviously your creative costs per placement are a lot lower when you run that ad a ton of times and you use the same creative right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but you run into diseconomies of scale at a certain point the ad stops working and you can throw more money at it but you&#39;re no longer getting the efficacy you&#39;re used to and so you see a bit of a tapering off in its ability to change minds as it goes along here so they have a better sense of whether they&#39;ve hit any kind of ceilings in terms of well that creative is not necessarily working anymore saturation</span>

            <span class="text">if they&#39;re spending that kind of money i&#39;m sure they&#39;re doing market research and i&#39;m sure they&#39;re understanding that a little bit better and you have to assume from the outside and i certainly do that they&#39;re not idiots and they&#39;ve sort of figured out that they uh you know know can push this further by switching up the creative but there&#39;s a couple of things i want to say there one</span>

            <span class="text">and when right and and that&#39;s an interesting question for me because do you want everybody to feel this way about pierre poliev to like the highest degree in november of 2023 well why what what&#39;s that going to do for you is it because you expect a liberal counter-offensive to come and you want to make sure you&#39;re in market at the same time so you don&#39;t want to risk flighting your advertisements and for those who don&#39;t know flighting is a theory of advertising where you go in heavy you taper out a little bit and you come back heavy a bit later just to get back to top of mind at the point where it really matters and it&#39;s very</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">common in political advertising the idea being you set the issue you keep it at a boil you remind people of the relevance at the time that it matters and maybe they&#39;ve decided that won&#39;t work because there&#39;s another player on the field here the other particular component is maybe they were always potentially going to run advertising through here and maybe their creative costs aren&#39;t marginally consequential maybe this is all being done in-house maybe they&#39;re paying the video team anyways and</span>

            <span class="text">I love that analysis. This is why I wanted to kind of jump into it, right? As folks who, you know, between the three of us who&#39;ve placed, created, scripted, done all of that sort of stuff, bought media in certain cases to place advertising. I guess the question I have, if I can spend a few more minutes on this, Carter, is, you You know, have you seen a play where because new creative for advertising was on the menu of what we do next, it was the next thing we&#39;re supposed to do, that it&#39;s actually undercut what&#39;s been working. Change doesn&#39;t necessarily equal progress. Talk to me about that. That&#39;s kind of at the heart of the issue, what I wanted to get to. And I know we can&#39;t discern from like one source that that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here, but that&#39;s kind of the conversation I wanted to have. Like, give me your experience where simply the change, because it&#39;s the next thing we&#39;re supposed to do undercuts the progress that you seem to be already making with your existing. And it could be advertising, it could be strategy, it could be messaging, but that&#39;s kind of the heart of the issue here.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, the last question on this one to you too, same one, right? Any experiences you may have had where you&#39;ve either seen the desire to do something just because it&#39;s on the plan undercut the progress you&#39;re making with your existing creative, existing message, existing plan, existing sort of tactic that you&#39;re employing?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I mean, for sure. You can flip out creative too frequently and undercut yourself in the process. One of the things that we often see with politicians in speeches is they get bored and they want to change it up. And those of us who work in communication say, no, just Just read the same fucking speech, because by the time you are sick of saying it is maybe when people are starting to pay attention to it. And repetition is just such an important thing in order to deliver any message, certainly in politics as well. And so if you&#39;re flipping creative out too frequently, you&#39;re maybe not giving it time to land any advertising strategy. You&#39;re going to be talking about breadth and depth, right? And frequency, how many times you are going to be hitting the same people. so you know you you might have uh you know a reach of 50 000 and you&#39;re going to hit each of those people three times that might be part of your strategy you might need to hit them 15 times with a political ad in order for them to start feeling it and hearing it that&#39;s just the realities we deal with in politics that&#39;s what we deal with with advocacy and trying to change people&#39;s opinions here it&#39;s not quite the same as this</span>

That was around 80%. While you guys give me a response on this, I&#39;ll pull up exactly what it was.

            <span class="text">I&#39;m not. I think they knew exactly what they were doing. The reality is, if you poll on these issues with certain phrasings, you are going to find 70% support amongst Canadians, right? And so the Conservatives have picked the kind of the social grounds, the social justice grounds that the Liberals are on the least firm ground on when it comes to overall national public opinion, and allowed those to go forward. I think in some ways, it was a pretty fascinating strategy i believe it was entirely intentional i&#39;ll call it a lightning rod strategy where they knew that this issue would generate a lot of media feedback and blowback they knew this would generate a lot of commentary at feedback and blowback but they knew that when it gets down to it and you pull canadians on it they&#39;re probably not really that out of step with where the majority of canadians are that&#39;s just a simple reality you know we&#39;re not talking about something that is about the acceptance of transgender people more generally we&#39;re talking talking about surgeries with children, not fully reversible in some cases. And that makes a lot of people very, very nervous. And I think that the conservatives calculated,</span>

But I also don&#39;t think that it hurts me that much if people are saying, can you believe the Conservatives passed this policy?

You had a lot of new Canadian majority communities, immigrant majority communities that were voting for them. And I think that was like a very natural consequence of some of the decisions the Conservatives made during the particular campaign. pain um but but otherwise it seemed to be socioeconomic as much as anything it was like the middle class brought them there the</span>

They think they should get credit for all of the things they did, you know, laudable things in the past few years from the perspective of themselves and the majority of voters, but maybe not germane to the moment that we&#39;re in right now. So the liberals really do need to knuckle down and say, what is the story? What is our coalition? Where are we going to win? Because they&#39;ve been retrenching to major cities, and they&#39;ve been retrenching to fear of the conservatives for for just too long.

How much credit would you give to the the Liberals, on a letter grade basis, they have a new head, or they, as in they have been able to, but while consulting the other parties, find someone else to lead the allegations of foreign interference in Canada&#39;s affairs over the next 16 months.

They get an F, not because this was a particularly bad decision, but because it was particularly bad that the decision happened so long after it should have happened.</span>

We&#39;ll save that for next time. Let me instead talk about Elections Manitoba. They&#39;ve actually put out an ad campaign for young voters, a series of advertisers, one of which says, some choices mean more than your fit check. Go out and vote. I&#39;m just curious, are you in or out on our nation&#39;s sort of electoral institutions with their vote mobilization campaigns, especially, and now more so, they&#39;ve largely been targeted at young people? Give me your take on this. Are you in or out when these bodies try to make appeals? They almost are the rock the vote of themselves in some ways. Are you in or out when they try to do this? And Manitoba is just another example. Alberta had their own version of this. Like everyone&#39;s doing their, they&#39;re trying to go viral with some fun hip, put hip in air quotes campaign. In or out, Corey? uh</span>

            <span class="text">uh yeah i mean i mean in on concept out on execution but the line between clever and cringe has never been blurrier than it is in 2023 and i i don&#39;t know i mean i hope that they tested these i hope that they did well in that sense but i suspect that they didn&#39;t i suspect that it was a well-intentioned but under-equipped electoral body determining that this would be what the the youths want to hear and that kind of sucks like if you&#39;re going to do it you got to do it right you got to hire the right ad firms and you you got to figure it out you got to know your audience carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i mean if we want to if we want to incentivize some sort of uh voter turnout model then incentivize it come up with an incentive uh this isn&#39;t an incentive this This is like an awareness campaign, which is going to generate an outcome of delivering some people to the polls, but not all people to the polls. So therefore, it&#39;s inadvertently going to help someone. Elections Manitoba doesn&#39;t know who they&#39;re helping. Elections Alberta didn&#39;t know who they were helping. City of Calgary doesn&#39;t know who they&#39;re helping. And I&#39;m told, I&#39;m not an expert in this, but I&#39;m told that the outcome isn&#39;t necessarily determined by the voter turnout. out so why don&#39;t we just focus on getting people out that want to vote and fuck the rest of them they can bitch and complain afterwards i</span>
