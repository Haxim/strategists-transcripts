And there was the possibility he could have won, but he would have won – we&#39;re talking about Sauvé there. Not to be confused with Sauvé who won, but the Sauvé who lost. The Sauvé who lost, yeah.

            <span class="text">and don&#39;t get me wrong in the next election he could end up with more seats than the liberals not really because of any great showing by the ndp but because of kind of a poor showing by by the liberals. But if he believes that and he gets cocky and he starts saying, well, maybe I&#39;ll go to an election this fall, and it makes that more likely in confidence votes to come,</span>

But the second is, you know, you got to spin something that&#39;s believable to the Canadian public. As soon as they reject your spin on one thing, they&#39;re going to start rejecting your spin across the board. That&#39;s where Pierre Polyev has actually been very successful. He&#39;s been able to keep his spin into the realm of possibility and probability. ability. The spin coming out of Singh, I mean, he&#39;s still polling in third place. He doesn&#39;t have a national army that can really win seats across the nation. I mean, how many seats can he win in Alberta? Well, probably the same number as the liberals. But nonetheless, it&#39;s not a real army that&#39;s going to launch him into being the official opposition. When we&#39;ve seen the NDP being the the official opposition is because of a complete collapse of liberals, not because of strength from the NDP.</span>

Generally speaking, this is a pure vibe test, but just people I&#39;ve talked to in the past 24 hours, people who are varying degrees of politically attuned, they&#39;re generally saying, yeah, it sounds okay. And in fact, I was having one conversation with somebody where he was like, oh yeah, that&#39;s a lot of money for schools. That&#39;s really good.

It should be for the public system, maybe not even the charter system. But there are a lot of people saying, well, the ratio seems sensible. So it feels like it&#39;s at least a short-term win.

I think the bigger, and so you have the public and the charter schools out in the new build areas. I think the bigger challenge though is it&#39;s not clear how those prioritizations are going to occur. There&#39;s going to be a lot of people fighting at the table for their various pieces of funding and prioritization, but then there&#39;s not teachers. And that&#39;s the bigger problem. Like when you look at the operational dollars that are in education right now, lots of ways to look at them, but the simplest, plainest way to look at them is that we spend the least per student in this area of any province. and you can only claim look how good we are look at this alberta efficiency for so long before it just starts to look fucking unreasonable and and nonsensical and why is my child&#39;s class 28 kids why is my other child&#39;s class 29 kids these are kids in the fifth grade in the third grade in this case you know this these are big class sizes and it&#39;s</span>

You know, it can&#39;t be too little too late, uh, cause it is a massive investment. Um, but it is too late and it happened on her watch and, uh, and it&#39;s going to be watered down by having fewer, uh, public schools and more, more private schools.

I think there are ways that you can avoid the frame that the premier has created and also deliver the exact same message. Schools are great. We need schools. We need people to work in those schools too. And the balance is entirely wrong here. So let&#39;s not spend that money on private education. We&#39;ve never had to in the past and it&#39;s still going to be there. Let&#39;s not put the money into charters. Let&#39;s put the money into teachers and let&#39;s be realistic.

But keep in mind that there&#39;s also a lot of problems that are coming around with healthcare, transportation, and other issues. This feels like she&#39;s taken the whole nest egg and spent it in one place. um personally i would have i would have come up with uh like if i&#39;m going to do a giant uh tv you know tv show uh to announce something i&#39;m going to announce a significant capital capital infrastructure program across the board just not with schools uh or i&#39;m going you know so i&#39;m going to announce um you know the rail plan or something along those lines does she get to do that again again when she uh finally settles on something vaguely resembling a rail plan um next year is that going to be something that makes sense i mean she&#39;s she&#39;s put an awful lot of her eggs in this particular one basket cory</span>

Do you take a pause? Do you regroup? Do you keep going? How do you retool when something is in such limbo? Is this white space opportunity? Is this you go dark if it goes dark?
