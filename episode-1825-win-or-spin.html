        <div class="desc"><p>The gang assemble after Monday's by-elections, Tuesday's address by Premier Danielle Smith and Wednesday's group chat about the Bloomberg Businessweek business school rankings to discuss the issues of the day.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are subjected to "WIN OR SPIN" - a grab bag of topics ranging from the by-election results to big spending on schools in Alberta to municipal politics and everything in between. Will Danielle Smith's $8.6 billion school spending program prove popular? Has Jagmeet Singh "spun himself"? And when Alberta was calling, was it just a pocket dial? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

But the second is, you know, you got to spin something that&#39;s believable to the Canadian public. As soon as they reject your spin on one thing, they&#39;re going to start rejecting your spin across the board. That&#39;s where Pierre Polyev has actually been very successful. He&#39;s been able to keep his spin into the realm of possibility and probability. ability. The spin coming out of Singh, I mean, he&#39;s still polling in third place. He doesn&#39;t have a national army that can really win seats across the nation. I mean, how many seats can he win in Alberta? Well, probably the same number as the liberals. But nonetheless, it&#39;s not a real army that&#39;s going to launch him into being the official opposition. When we&#39;ve seen the NDP being the the official opposition is because of a complete collapse of liberals, not because of strength from the NDP.</div>

Her plan includes public, charter and non-profit private schools. Critics, including the NDP, argue the plan reacts too late to this easily foreseeable crisis and that the inclusion of private schools has drawn further controversy.

Generally speaking, this is a pure vibe test, but just people I&#39;ve talked to in the past 24 hours, people who are varying degrees of politically attuned, they&#39;re generally saying, yeah, it sounds okay. And in fact, I was having one conversation with somebody where he was like, oh yeah, that&#39;s a lot of money for schools. That&#39;s really good. And I said, yeah, well, that&#39;s a lot of money for nonprofit schools. We never used to do that.</div>

It should be for the public system, maybe not even the charter system. But there are a lot of people saying, well, the ratio seems sensible. So it feels like it&#39;s at least a short-term win.

You know, they&#39;re going to be magnets for larger areas because they&#39;re often built around a concept or a religion or a culture, right? And so they tend to have larger catchments. I think the bigger, and so you have the public and the charter schools out in the new build areas. I think the bigger challenge though is it&#39;s not clear how those prioritizations are going to occur. There&#39;s going to be a lot of people fighting at the table for their various pieces of funding and prioritization, but then there&#39;s not teachers. And that&#39;s the bigger problem. Like when you look at the operational dollars that are in education right now, lots of ways to look at them, but the simplest, plainest way to look at them is that we spend the least per student in this area of any province. and you can only claim look how good we are look at this alberta efficiency for so long before it just starts to look fucking unreasonable and and nonsensical and why is my child&#39;s class 28 kids why is my other child&#39;s class 29 kids these are kids in the fifth grade in the third grade in this case you know this these are big class sizes and it&#39;s</div>

You know, it can&#39;t be too little too late, uh, cause it is a massive investment.

We need people to work in those schools too. And the balance is entirely wrong here. So let&#39;s not spend that money on private education. We&#39;ve never had to in the past and it&#39;s still going to be there. Let&#39;s not put the money into charters. Let&#39;s put the money into teachers and let&#39;s be realistic. We&#39;re not going to build a billion of schools. That would be inflationary. We&#39;d be bidding against ourselves over the next few years.
