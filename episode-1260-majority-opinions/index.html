        <p>The gang discuss the death of major parts of the "No More Pipelines Act" and an NDP convention that has Singh underperforming with 81% of the vote on his leadership review. Pharmacare and the Supply and Confidence agreement guest star.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss 5/7ths of the Supreme Court ruling against the Impact Assessment Act, 81% of the NDP endorsing Singh in his leadership review and the NDP convention's unanimous support to create a red line on the Supply and Confidence agreement. Has the Trudeau government been delivered a black eye by the Supreme Court? Should Singh be worried that even with no organized opposition one in five delegates voted against him? And with Carter properly posting an episode, are Corey's days numbered? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

This is being framed as a big win for the provinces and a loss for the federal government&#39;s environmental goals. I want to kind of dive into it. I think Friday was an interesting day.

I know that the Alberta Court of Appeal had said this should happen and they use some very strong language. But frankly, they do that a lot on things that the Supreme Court then turns around and says, yeah, I don&#39;t think so. I mean, fundamentally, Fundamentally, as you go through the decision, it is rooted in a view of Canadian federalism that exists. It just seems to have been going out of style as it pertains to the environment, right? It&#39;s this idea that you&#39;ve got these watertight</div>

And in areas of overlap, a certain amount of cooperation is required and you can&#39;t just unilaterally make these sorts of decisions. So, you know, maybe we shouldn&#39;t have been surprised by it. I think that there were a lot of people saying they suspected that the federal government would be successful in court on net. They obviously were not. And I think we&#39;ll wait and we&#39;ll see how all the lawyers write this up and assess it and look at the various pieces and say, oh, this makes sense. Or, you know, I wouldn&#39;t have necessarily called that, but that work is still to be done. You know, we&#39;ve</div>

But the bottom line, and the most important part here is it is a very big win for provinces who are standing up against it. And it is a black eye for the federal government who, you know, largely treated the province, at least in a political sense, as though these arguments were ridiculous.

There are others, there&#39;s legal experts and federal officials, obviously, that are saying premiers are exaggerating the impact of the ruling.
