        <p>Parliament has resumed and the Liberal reset is in full swing. The gang asks: what have we learned about their strategy? Will it work? What else do the Liberals need to give it a fighting chance? Plus: a lot of talk about a Globe and Mail profile on the Trudeau-Telford partnership.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter tackle a Liberal "potpourri", giving their takes on the caucus retreat, grocery CEO meeting - and what a profile on Katie Telford by Shannon Proudfoot reveals about the present and future of the Liberal Party. Are we seeing a strategic return of "Liberal kleptomania"? Can any strategist hope to break into the dynamic that Trudeau and Telford have created among themselves? And we know the B and D stand for bedroom and decorating, but can anyone tell us what the E stands for? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Guys, this is a segment, of course, we introduced in episode 1109. I want to bring it back. This is an ongoing segment I like to keep into the mix. And I want to stress test political tactics. Why do we still do this?</div>

          <div class="said">Or Carter, more specifically, why the fuck do we still do this? And today, I want to take you to London, Ontario. You guys remember Justin Trudeau had his caucus retreat. He was a day late. He was late from India. We&#39;ll We&#39;ll talk about India in a second. He shows up to the caucus retreat. There&#39;s probably a lot of questions for him. We don&#39;t know necessarily what happened. There&#39;s some leaked sources. But after the caucus retreat, Carter, you have Justin Trudeau standing behind the human wall of caucus members, ministers, backbenchers, the entire liberal caucus. They do the human wall. And naturally, the media, knowing that this is a tense moment for the liberals, they&#39;re down in the polls, are looking for folks within that human wall that may not necessarily be so happy, might be gazing away, might be rolling their eyes. The focus, the attention is drawn away from Trudeau. Carter, the question I ask you today in this segment of why the fuck do we still do this, why the fuck do we still do the human wall of politicians? I always understand the human wall of people that look like you, so you see yourself in them. But the human wall of politicians, Politicians, should we be ending this practice? Give me the justification. Should we keep it? Listen,</div>

I, you know, I&#39;ve stopped using the human wall. I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;ve ever used it. And I&#39;m sure someone will dig up a package of me. To</div>

When she became leader, it was more like the mob of people playing paintball and hanging out and nodding thoughtfully as she said things in clips released of those caucus meetings when she first got the job of UCP leader. I mean, the reason they do it is simple. It&#39;s a way to visually say, I do not stand alone. We are united. There&#39;s talk about the unity of the Liberal Party having cracks in it. And so as a result, they try to give this counter visual, they counter program it with everybody there. there now i i generally don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea first of all it</div>

Was it successful? Was it not? Give me your sense of this particular play. And let me add a bit of context. This is on the heels of Justin Trudeau not being such a big fan of Jagmeet Singh&#39;s approach to go after grocery store CEOs just mere months ago. And now they&#39;re called with the power of government to have some conversations to quote unquote, stabilize grocery prices. What do you think of this liberal strategy?

Both of you suggested, but mainly Corey, both of you, but mainly Corey suggested that this should be something that the liberals pursue is their ongoing history of kleptomania should continue not just to the left which they&#39;ve been a big fan of stealing ideas from the ndp but steal pierre&#39;s ideas and there have been a few of those over the last week but cory on this particular one i&#39;ll let you continue yeah</div>

So maybe we&#39;re going to go do that as well, too. So, you know, I don&#39;t read it as part of like a brilliant liberal strategy for the path forward. I see this as closing doors that they&#39;re worried angry dogs are going to run through. So by taking on some of these strategies of some of their opponents, they&#39;re limiting the vectors of attack. And that&#39;s how I read this. And frankly, I don&#39;t expect an awful lot out of it except to be able to say, yeah, we did that. We tried to be tough with these CEOs. We brought them to Ottawa. Have you ever been to Ottawa?

But I wanted to say that there&#39;s this notion of like an idea having value. And then there&#39;s the notion that the action has the value.

Carter, Carter, talk to me about this. This is interesting to me. And I&#39;ll get back to Justin Trudeau stealing some Jagmeet Singh ideas, which is what the heart of this question was. is your thought on the conservative ability for theft in terms of idea. And Corey, I don&#39;t mean to drive by your idea versus action. I think that&#39;s a really interesting framework. What gets the political credit? What gets the voter credit? Carter, your response to that or any reaction to that, but also the same question to you around conservatives and their abilities. I</div>

And over the course of time, they switched positions. So there&#39;s this kind of natural ideological switch that happens, too, where an idea may have existed previously in time. Or in the kind of the attitudes of the time where, you know, gay marriage may have been a problem for conservatives at one point. And then they shift rather dramatically and say, you know what, this is an anchor around our necks. We&#39;re no longer going to hold this position. We&#39;re going to push it away. So there&#39;s different types of ideas stealing. The blatant idea of stealing, I always think kind of like of Mulroney and the Canada Health Act, right? right, like to put into very distinct terms to step on the provincial rights of delivering health care. You know, like there&#39;d been pieces of it before, but Mulroney really jumped in and codified it. And, you</div>

People don&#39;t know what they want, right? They would have never asked for the iPhone with a touchscreen like we invented. What the fuck do they know in terms of what they want? He was, in this reductive sense, in the pure leadership category. Who cares about reflecting their needs? If they reflected their needs, They just want more keyboards or a better keyboard on their phone to extend that example. So your thoughts on this, and I will get back to this point on groceries in a second.</div>

          <div class="said">here&#39;s the thing. I generally think in politics, politicians have their own frameworks. Political insiders have their own frameworks. But if you want to understand how the public reacts to a lot of what goes on in politics, I like to lay it over a workplace environment. And you&#39;ll sort of see behavior that people reward or punish a little more clearly there. And in a workplace, pushing off other people&#39;s ideas, that&#39;s a defensive thing. People don&#39;t really like that. You don&#39;t like that idea just because it&#39;s from another person. Accepting other people&#39;s ideas, even people who disagree with you, even people who might be people who oppose you, well, that&#39;s magnanimous and strong. And that&#39;s the kind of behavior we like to see in leaders. So I think the other thing that we haven&#39;t talked about, but I want to put on the table is that a lot of people see a lot of strength and confidence in saying, yeah, you know what? I was wrong. That&#39;s actually a pretty good idea. We&#39;re going to do that now, right? And it suggests a certain kind of openness and confidence that is</div>

You can absolutely see what the Ottawa discourse is as you&#39;re going through it there. there. And for me, what really struck me about it was just the way it expanded upon and gave some texture to this notion that Justin Trudeau and Katie Telfer need each other. They trust each other. They were the ones with their backs against the wall, everybody doubting them as far back as like 2014, 2015. They got through it. They managed to prove everybody wrong, but they might have some some of the same weaknesses and they might have the same gaps and they&#39;re both introverts and governments over time tend to get bunker mentality anyhow and because they have perhaps some of the things that would lend them to be bunker mentality even in better times maybe there&#39;s some trouble and maybe because they see things so much the same way and they have the same expectations for the world they have some blindness on some of this stuff that you look at and you&#39;re like Like, how</div>

But I think the list actually missed a lot of very obvious political ones, too. And not that those are not political ones, but those are more like, there was an event, how did we react to it? But I&#39;m talking more like thrust of policy and strategy. Like, let&#39;s just use this foreign inquiry as an example. It was obvious to everybody six months ago. As much as I would like to say it was only obvious to us, it was not. Literally every commentator was saying, we&#39;re just going to end up here anyways, right? What is this government doing? Why is it doing this in the most painful way possible? And sure enough, six months later, we ended up exactly there. And I have a hard time believing that would happen if there</div>

Like we&#39;ve talked about the story, whether we want to say it as the me, we, now, Gans, like what are you here for story, or just the simple lack of ads that they have on the air about the story against their principal opponent, let alone the story about themselves and what they&#39;re here for, other than to tout their past accomplishments that many criticize them for.

          <div class="said">Yeah, let me just jump right off that. So, Pierre Poliev being not defined by the liberals, just defining himself, I think that there needs to be somebody there saying, what&#39;s the fucking story? And if he&#39;s the villain in our fucking story, what are we doing to set it up so everybody goes, oh, that guy&#39;s bad in chapter two, right? Like, what do we need to put on the table there? What are the pieces that overall lead to the climax and the denouement that we want here? And that is clearly, in my opinion, something the liberals have been missing for at least two elections at this point. And so that&#39;s something that I think the liberals should be candid with themselves about and say, okay, we got to find that. And you know, interestingly enough, I think based on that reporting and other reporting, it&#39;s going to have to be somebody that Justin Trudeau trusts a</div>

They actually literally do win on a grind down of vote efficiency. Right. Between Azam and Katie, like talented operatives who like literally push this thing over the top while still losing the popular vote and retaining government in some miraculous fashion.

They&#39;re always trying to find new people to bring in because, you know, two people decide to leave and go and retire or someone goes to a competitor and suddenly the, you know, the C-suite is looking awfully weak.

On a scale of 1 to 10, the political risk for Pierre Polyev of falling too much in love with himself and his own words and his own rhetoric and his own way of being, he clearly is on a high after Quebec City. He seems to really dig what he&#39;s up to. But the risk of politicians of falling Falling in love with themselves and their words. Where do you, currently, for Pierre Poliev, where does that risk lie on a 1 to 10 scale, Carter? It&#39;s</div>

But when you talk about hydrogen, you&#39;re talking about creating stations with a fairly volatile gas, and they don&#39;t exist in a lot of places, and they&#39;re not sold in a lot of places. And in many ways, the lift is much, much bigger, I think.</div>
