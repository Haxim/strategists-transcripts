            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah this is we&#39;re off to a great start better the most in the first five minutes let&#39;s move it on to our first segment our first segment why the fuck do they still do this? Guys, this is a segment, of course, we introduced in episode 1109. I want to bring it back. This is an ongoing segment I like to keep into the mix. And I want to stress test political tactics. Why do we still do this?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Or Carter, more specifically, why the fuck do we still do this? And today, I want to take you to London, Ontario. You guys remember Justin Trudeau had his caucus retreat. He was a day late. He was late from India. We&#39;ll We&#39;ll talk about India in a second. He shows up to the caucus retreat. There&#39;s probably a lot of questions for him. We don&#39;t know necessarily what happened. There&#39;s some leaked sources. But after the caucus retreat, Carter, you have Justin Trudeau standing behind the human wall of caucus members, ministers, backbenchers, the entire liberal caucus. They do the human wall. And naturally, the media, knowing that this is a tense moment for the liberals, they&#39;re down in the polls, are looking for folks within that human wall that may not necessarily be so happy, might be gazing away, might be rolling their eyes. The focus, the attention is drawn away from Trudeau. Carter, the question I ask you today in this segment of why the fuck do we still do this, why the fuck do we still do the human wall of politicians? I always understand the human wall of people that look like you, so you see yourself in them. But the human wall of politicians, Politicians, should we be ending this practice? Give me the justification. Should we keep it? Listen,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Listen, I mean, you&#39;ve pointed out the justification for it. The justification is that, you know, you see the people that are there. It&#39;s an easy visual. It&#39;s an easy thing to kind of show the normalcy or the, you know, how wonderful everybody is. Why do we still do it? I don&#39;t know. I do not like it. I, you know, I&#39;ve stopped using the human wall. I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;ve ever used it. And I&#39;m sure someone will dig up a package of me. To</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">To be clear, I&#39;m talking about the human wall of politicians behind the politician. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t you know, I don&#39;t understand why we&#39;re doing that. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me. It is a dated idea that that creates more tension than it does that it dissipates. Right. Because now people are put into prop mode. and i&#39;m not sure about you guys but i don&#39;t find a lot of people like being used as a prop so it creates some some bias some upset because people are angry that they&#39;re being used literally to shield people in some cases so i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">mean i understand why we do it it&#39;s a simple photo it&#39;s simple it&#39;s simple storytelling but i think we&#39;ve moved beyond simple storytelling and this is is, it&#39;s outliving its usefulness. I&#39;ll throw it over to Corey to tell me why</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">wrong. Carter, before you throw it over to Corey, which is my job, are you advocating that we kill the human wall of fellow politicians? Absolutely. Is that your pick? Absolutely.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">are we killing the human wall of politicians with the politician right at the front, at the apex of it? And Justin Trudeau is not the only person committing this crime. We&#39;ve seen this through and through. This is why I want to bring it up. He&#39;s just the most recent example. Sure.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Sure. We&#39;ve seen versions of it here in Alberta with Danielle Smith. When she became leader, it was more like the mob of people playing paintball and hanging out and nodding thoughtfully as she said things in clips released of those caucus meetings when she first got the job of UCP leader. I mean, the reason they do it is simple. It&#39;s a way to visually say, I do not stand alone. We are united. There&#39;s talk about the unity of the Liberal Party having cracks in it. And so as a result, they try to give this counter visual, they counter program it with everybody there. there now i i generally don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea first of all it</span>

But I also think in some ways, it underlines that you can&#39;t trust these people with visuals like this, which, of course, given that journalism school is four years, you can assume most journalists are over four years old, and they know you can&#39;t trust people. people but um nonetheless uh it&#39;s something that just sort of rubs their nose in it like yeah this is all theater you&#39;re all just doing your thing it&#39;s all bullshit and so i just i don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a great thing for prime ministers to do it if only for that reason you mentioned the other which is somebody might crack somebody might yawn uh and all of a sudden you&#39;ve got a visual that was unnecessary you know you&#39;re you&#39;ve got a lot of error points when you&#39;ve got over 100 people behind you and</span>

We had this at the retreat, and then that&#39;s the thing that goes up in the caucus rooms and whatnot, and they get updated regularly. So I think that you have to do it, right?

Walk me through in your mind what the strategy was. Was it successful? Was it not? Give me your sense of this particular play. And let me add a bit of context. This is on the heels of Justin Trudeau not being such a big fan of Jagmeet Singh&#39;s approach to go after grocery store CEOs just mere months ago. And now they&#39;re called with the power of government to have some conversations to quote unquote, stabilize grocery prices. What do you think of this liberal strategy?

            <span class="text">Well, it would appear at least from the outside, like this is part of a broader strategy of clearing the decks and doing that through some strategic surrenders, right?

Both of you suggested, but mainly Corey, both of you, but mainly Corey suggested that this should be something that the liberals pursue is their ongoing history of kleptomania should continue not just to the left which they&#39;ve been a big fan of stealing ideas from the ndp but steal pierre&#39;s ideas and there have been a few of those over the last week but cory on this particular one i&#39;ll let you continue yeah</span>

And I think they&#39;ve said, we</span>

            <span class="text">we are not doing particularly well on affordability. And what the NDP are proposing on affordability in terms of this seems very popular as well. So maybe we&#39;re going to go do that as well, too. So, you know, I don&#39;t read it as part of like a brilliant liberal strategy for the path forward. I see this as closing doors that they&#39;re worried angry dogs are going to run through. So by taking on some of these strategies of some of their opponents, they&#39;re limiting the vectors of attack. And that&#39;s how I read this. And frankly, I don&#39;t expect an awful lot out of it except to be able to say, yeah, we did that. We tried to be tough with these CEOs. We brought them to Ottawa. Have you ever been to Ottawa?

Or do the conservatives have the same opportunity for theft as much as the liberals have? Because you&#39;ve talked about the historical, a little bit of left, a little bit of right, a little bit of left, a little bit of right. Is this unique to them? Or do you like this sort of ability without fault? Or do you think that the conservatives have the same ability to maybe steal from the new Democrats as they try to to win over some union or labor-like voters?</span>

            <span class="text">I would argue the conservatives are at their most successful when they are the most inclined to steal, right? When they show the least ideological purity and they&#39;re willing to do things like, you know, boutique tax credits that are very popular with people, but don&#39;t naturally match kind of this conservative ideology, right? Yeah, sure. And that&#39;s almost been like the deal with the devil that parties on the right or parties on the left have to do. You know, you try to get elected, that means getting more people. And that means speaking</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, I think the liberals are probably a little better positioned to do that just because of where they are on the spectrum, right? Just the situation that they find themselves in is they can steal from the left or the right, and it&#39;s not too far in either case. But I wanted to say that there&#39;s this notion of like an idea having value. And then there&#39;s the notion that the action has the value. And I think in politics, I think in public discourse, I&#39;m talking about electoral politics here, I&#39;m talking about voter discourse.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think the action gets more credit, right? It&#39;s this extension of this Steve Jobs idea. Steve Jobs famously said, real artists ship. and the argument was everyone has ideas yeah everyone has ideas there&#39;s no art and ideas the idea is not thinking of the mac the the art is in building the mac right and um putting those things into action and executing on them getting it out the door and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and people generally credit you for getting it out the door and so when your government you have this massive mover advantage where no matter who came up with it you get to have credit for it because you were the one who did it at the the end of the day. And that&#39;s a power I think more governments should use. And I think that is one of the fundamental tensions that any government has with its true believers.</span>

            <span class="text">I also said by Steve Jobs, you are not my daughter. Carter, I am actually literally looking at the Walter Isingson biography. I&#39;m not going to get into it. Carter, Carter, talk to me about this. This is interesting to me. And I&#39;ll get back to Justin Trudeau stealing some Jagmeet Singh ideas, which is what the heart of this question was. is your thought on the conservative ability for theft in terms of idea. And Corey, I don&#39;t mean to drive by your idea versus action. I think that&#39;s a really interesting framework. What gets the political credit? What gets the voter credit? Carter, your response to that or any reaction to that, but also the same question to you around conservatives and their abilities. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that, you know, so we, we, Corey&#39;s mentioned before on the podcast that at one At one point, the liberals were the party supporting free trade and the conservatives were the party opposing free trade. And over the course of time, they switched positions. So there&#39;s this kind of natural ideological switch that happens, too, where an idea may have existed previously in time. Or in the kind of the attitudes of the time where, you know, gay marriage may have been a problem for conservatives at one point. And then they shift rather dramatically and say, you know what, this is an anchor around our necks. We&#39;re no longer going to hold this position. We&#39;re going to push it away. So there&#39;s different types of ideas stealing. The blatant idea of stealing, I always think kind of like of Mulroney and the Canada Health Act, right? right, like to put into very distinct terms to step on the provincial rights of delivering health care. You know, like there&#39;d been pieces of it before, but Mulroney really jumped in and codified it. And, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that was just good politics. That was taking a giant win for himself, right? So all of this comes back to why do we do politics the way we do politics? And the best politics is done with a degree of leadership right and and a degree of reflection and</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m going to almost go back to a Jobsian quote, right, where he talks about people, boring from a Henry Ford quote, right? People don&#39;t know what they want, right? They would have never asked for the iPhone with a touchscreen like we invented. What the fuck do they know in terms of what they want? He was, in this reductive sense, in the pure leadership category. Who cares about reflecting their needs? If they reflected their needs, They just want more keyboards or a better keyboard on their phone to extend that example. So your thoughts on this, and I will get back to this point on groceries in a second.</span>

            <span class="text">here&#39;s the thing. I generally think in politics, politicians have their own frameworks. Political insiders have their own frameworks. But if you want to understand how the public reacts to a lot of what goes on in politics, I like to lay it over a workplace environment. And you&#39;ll sort of see behavior that people reward or punish a little more clearly there. And in a workplace, pushing off other people&#39;s ideas, that&#39;s a defensive thing. People don&#39;t really like that. You don&#39;t like that idea just because it&#39;s from another person. Accepting other people&#39;s ideas, even people who disagree with you, even people who might be people who oppose you, well, that&#39;s magnanimous and strong. And that&#39;s the kind of behavior we like to see in leaders. So I think the other thing that we haven&#39;t talked about, but I want to put on the table is that a lot of people see a lot of strength and confidence in saying, yeah, you know what? I was wrong. That&#39;s actually a pretty good idea. We&#39;re going to do that now, right? And it suggests a certain kind of openness and confidence that is</span>

But the reality is the NDP are not doing particularly well on the polls either. Normally, when the liberals go down in the polls, the NDP go up. That hasn&#39;t happened. And we&#39;re kind of looking at a conservative government. So I don&#39;t think this confidence and supply agreement has ever been more secure than it is right now, because they&#39;re</span>

She did not try to override the story with her interview. But in some cases, extremely flattering, glowing words about her. In other cases, saying that her linkage to Justin Trudeau is one of the reasons that there&#39;s been so much error ball that the liberals have essentially played. Carter, your initial takeaway, and less so that there was a profile and the strategy behind it, because that was for a different episode, the takeaway from what you got. And you could start with why there was a profile about Katie Telford, what you think that signals, and then what you extracted from it. Because I want to tease out some of the strategy that you see.

I am in awe of how long she&#39;s lasted in the office um and i think that she does for the most part a very good job i also think that she&#39;s got weaknesses and those weaknesses are the ones that we&#39;ve talked about on this podcast about a thousand times especially about and and it was ironic because the list of mistakes that we&#39;ve been talking about on this podcast is like they listened to the podcast and wrote them down into the into the uh into the global mail article um no one&#39;s perfect And this felt to me like a preemptive article that sets</span>

You can absolutely see what the Ottawa discourse is as you&#39;re going through it there. there. And for me, what really struck me about it was just the way it expanded upon and gave some texture to this notion that Justin Trudeau and Katie Telfer need each other. They trust each other. They were the ones with their backs against the wall, everybody doubting them as far back as like 2014, 2015. They got through it. They managed to prove everybody wrong, but they might have some some of the same weaknesses and they might have the same gaps and they&#39;re both introverts and governments over time tend to get bunker mentality anyhow and because they have perhaps some of the things that would lend them to be bunker mentality even in better times maybe there&#39;s some trouble and maybe because they see things so much the same way and they have the same expectations for the world they have some blindness on some of this stuff that you look at and you&#39;re like Like, how</span>

But I think the list actually missed a lot of very obvious political ones, too. And not that those are not political ones, but those are more like, there was an event, how did we react to it? But I&#39;m talking more like thrust of policy and strategy. Like, let&#39;s just use this foreign inquiry as an example. It was obvious to everybody six months ago. As much as I would like to say it was only obvious to us, it was not. Literally every commentator was saying, we&#39;re just going to end up here anyways, right? What is this government doing? Why is it doing this in the most painful way possible? And sure enough, six months later, we ended up exactly there. And I have a hard time believing that would happen if there</span>

I don&#39;t I think that that would be disastrous for the liberals at this point. It would be so disruptive. She&#39;s so clearly part of the fabric, so deeply embedded.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s an interesting point. And so you&#39;re saying that what&#39;s missing here potentially is the air war aspect, is the message. And I mean, the evidence is there that it is missing, right? Like we&#39;ve talked about the story, whether we want to say it as the me, we, now, Gans, like what are you here for story, or just the simple lack of ads that they have on the air about the story against their principal opponent, let alone the story about themselves and what they&#39;re here for, other than to tout their past accomplishments that many criticize them for. But Corey, yes, please.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, let me just jump right off that. So, Pierre Poliev being not defined by the liberals, just defining himself, I think that there needs to be somebody there saying, what&#39;s the fucking story? And if he&#39;s the villain in our fucking story, what are we doing to set it up so everybody goes, oh, that guy&#39;s bad in chapter two, right? Like, what do we need to put on the table there? What are the pieces that overall lead to the climax and the denouement that we want here? And that is clearly, in my opinion, something the liberals have been missing for at least two elections at this point. And so that&#39;s something that I think the liberals should be candid with themselves about and say, okay, we got to find that. And you know, interestingly enough, I think based on that reporting and other reporting, it&#39;s going to have to be somebody that Justin Trudeau trusts a</span>

And Corey, Corey&#39;s analysis, I think, is very astute, Carter, because when you look at the last two elections, they lose the popular vote. They actually literally do win on a grind down of vote efficiency. Right. Between Azam and Katie, like talented operatives who like literally push this thing over the top while still losing the popular vote and retaining government in some miraculous fashion. And Corey&#39;s right. We&#39;ve talked about this in the past. This is what&#39;s missing. But Carter, let me go to your point directly. If it is, how do you get... And</span>

Eventually, that means that the organization has an end date. Corporations work against this all the time. They&#39;re always trying to find new people to bring in because, you know, two people decide to leave and go and retire or someone goes to a competitor and suddenly the, you know, the C-suite is looking awfully weak. So corporations would do this. In politics, we tend to, you know, everything is so personal. Everything is so, you know, like,</span>

They may or may not have worked on the campaign, but they saw the outcome and they said, holy shit, there&#39;s something happening here.

So, if you start getting a little high on your own supply, there is a very good chance you will be knocked down by the electorate in very short order, especially when you&#39;re in the middle of the systemic change that Pierre Polyev is in. Like, he&#39;s in a really risky place. People are saying, oh, I like this new guy. But if he turns back into the old guy, they&#39;re not going to like that.</span>

What is the political risk to him right now? One being very low, 10 being pretty high, and should be quite cautious.</span>

Do you know what the predominant place you charge an EV is? Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">Your house, using an outlet that you already have, right? Like the infrastructure is in some ways resolved for short trips. But when you talk about hydrogen, you&#39;re talking about creating stations with a fairly volatile gas, and they don&#39;t exist in a lot of places, and they&#39;re not sold in a lot of places. And in many ways, the lift is much, much bigger, I think.</span>
