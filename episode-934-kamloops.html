            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We must shine a light on these events and keep them, and the shame, horror, and grief that comes with them, in our mind as we redouble our commitment to reconciliation. The Kamloops Residential School was a place that destroyed lives as a matter of formal government policy.</span>

            <span class="text">This is the strategist, of course, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Everything&#39;s the same. Let&#39;s just jump right into it. Carter, I rarely give you this opportunity, which is the one to start where you want, because there&#39;s so much to unpack with this story, both from what we learned Friday and this weekend, but also historically. So I ask you the question, where do you want to start? Where should we start as we talk about this?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, is it possible that something can be both shocking and not surprising at the same time. Can we both be shocked by the numbers and the specificity of this particular situation and not surprised at all given the residential school history of Canada that this is where we find ourselves, that this is where Canada has this history and has this this thing that we did, that we have papered over. I mean, I was in school when residential schools were still a thing. I was still, you know, it was still a part of our history. I didn&#39;t know anything coming through my schooling. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">from people on the Internet, right? We all weren&#39;t told. We weren&#39;t given any information. Well, of course we weren&#39;t. We didn&#39;t think we were doing anything wrong. wrong and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i think that that&#39;s the absolute horror of this is that uh we ask sometimes how good people can do such awful things well this is one of those moments where people who thought themselves good uh were doing something horrible and now how do you reconcile that how do you fix that and that&#39;s kind of where i am now is is you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know the shock and the and and the not surprise that that I have about this particular situation gives way to, what now? What now? Because it&#39;s not like this is a new horror. I mean, to the point of not being surprised, this is not a new horror. This is something that has existed for a long time in our collective consciousness.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But arguably, there just hasn&#39;t been much done. And if we broaden the issue,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">if we don&#39;t just make it about the residential schools or the missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiries, or if we broaden it and just talk about Canada&#39;s abhorrent history</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">connects to our present, right? This idea that the history is in some fashion in the past is frustrating because, of course, it&#39;s not. It drags itself forward to today. It drags itself forward to today&#39;s politicians where I see too</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">tough issues. They&#39;re hard issues. They&#39;re not easily solved issues. And the things that we do do, flying the flags at half-mast, which I would argue is the very minimum, do nothing to solve and instead just kind of continue, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a charade, but some sort of lack of progress that we&#39;re making as a society. So that&#39;s where I am today, Zane. That&#39;s my moment of self-reflection that you&#39;ve given to me. So thank you for that.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Corey, I want to give you the same opportunity because Carter&#39;s put a lot out there in terms of can we be shocked and not shocked at the same time that this is not necessarily, you know, ancient history. You know, I bring up the year 1996. That&#39;s the last residential school closure in this country. That&#39;s not ancient history at all. That&#39;s recent history. We all know the year 1996. We can tether that to something in in our lives, you know, whether that be culturally or otherwise, giving you the same opportunity, where do you want to start? Where do you want to go? And then we&#39;ll kind of take</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Carter is as old as Methuselah. So, you know, he talks about being around when residential schools were around, going to school when residential schools were around. We all went to school when residential schools were around. and um the</span>

            <span class="text">the the stories the the whispers the people in the community who talked about people who went missing and you know hope that the friend just ran away and went somewhere else but the fear that the friend was dead uh in in indigenous children i mean that was very real and i guess to build on carter&#39;s point some have gotten here this weekend some have been here for a very long time and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and what i think is interesting about a moment like this is that so often in our life we We hear about, you know, TRC, MMIW, these things seem like an abstraction. You know, we can conceptualize, yes, we need to be better as a society, but do we think about what we mean by that? Do we think about what we are being better than? And, you know, honestly, it&#39;s terrible to say, but the grievances of Indigenous communities often to many seem like a nuisance or worse, just unwelcome, or why are we bothering with spending time and effort on here? But then, dead</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">nothing justifies dead children. And I think one of the things that perhaps can come out of the news that came out of Kamloops on Friday is, we got to get serious about this, because there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

We can, we can worry about what this means about us as a country. We can worry about what this means as us as a society. You know, what does it mean that humans would do this to other humans?</span>

You know, I think I agree with what you guys have said here around, you know, one of the things that has been interesting in Canada is we&#39;ve often used this cloak of pluralism and multiculturalism as a, as cloud cover for the fact that we live in in this harmonious society. We kind of purge a lot of the history before a certain date to kind of point to these policies of, you know, the cultural mosaic versus the melting pot and all those simple comparators to say that, oh, it&#39;s good here. It&#39;s a proven policy. It&#39;s a proven system, unique place in the world. And that self-adulation, I think, often gets in the way of this sort of introspection, which kind of leads me from what Corey was talking about between comparing the us, you, me, the three of us, as in regular folks, versus those that represent us, i.e. our governments, plural, you know, all of them leading to this one. Carter, talk to me a bit more about, you know, the, if I can use this term, the burden of responsibility between us as Canadians and folks that are, you know, engaged</span>

But the truth of the matter is that if you look at generations of immigration, it follows very similar patterns. You know, You know, when Eastern Europeans came over to Canada, they were treated differently because they were different. And when, you know, South Asians are coming over to Canada, they were treated different. So first generation, there&#39;s a very common first generation story of, you know, immigration into Canada.

We just want to try to do perhaps a bit of analysis if we can. Why has this, to Corey&#39;s point, generational solutions, is that the heart of it? Is that the fact that governments have been built for moments in time responding to issues, the micro, the cadence of what electors want and what mandates they can win and which are most feasible? Or is that an oversimplification in explaining why governments have been so massively unsuccessful on action, perhaps generating heat and light success, action less so?</span>

So there&#39;s an action that occurs every day on First Nation issues because there&#39;s resource development. There&#39;s there&#39;s treaty issues. You know, the the various ministers have dealt with First Nations have been busy. They&#39;ve been busy doing lots of busy work and doing lots of busy issues because there&#39;s no shortage of problems. I mean, it can be, you know, it can be, you know, a good example could be, you know, the lack of potable water on a on reserves. Right. So we&#39;re working on that issue. We&#39;re working on that issue. OK, that&#39;s a great thing to be working on. We can work on that. We can work. We can do the missing and murdered indigenous women issue. We can do that.

But I think that one also is possible, but probably not probable. And these are my best scenarios at this point. I can&#39;t think of anything else that fits these boxes here.

Corey, out of nowhere, the expiry dates have been extended. Turns out they weren&#39;t real in the first place. On AstraZeneca, that&#39;s right. Health Canada has extended the shelf life of the AstraZeneca doses set to expire by Monday, i.e. tomorrow. They&#39;ve extended them by a month, so that means that it has extended the expiry date of roughly 45,000 AstraZeneca doses, with the vaccine had an original and expiry dose of May 31st. They now expire July 1st. Corey, is this a big deal? Is this just an extension of shelf life? Does this make you question expiry dates on everything and anything? Have you already been doing that prior to? And does a three-second rule apply? Okay, all those questions for you. Well,</span>

Well, then I think we&#39;ve probably got no real worries here. Where you&#39;d, you know, the limited group you&#39;d be worried about are the people who would dead end on one dose of AstraZeneca.

Overrated or underrated, this new lab leak theory that the U.S. is now investigating, this, of course, now, you know, started as a, I can say this right wing conspiracy theory at the beginning of the pandemic that, you know, if you haven&#39;t heard of it, that COVID was leaked through a Wuhan virology lab that is now not saying is gaining mainstream acceptance, But the predominant theory proposed by the WHO that this was cross-contamination from animals to humans has not necessarily been proven in the meantime. And the U.S. is now asking for open up an investigation that Mark Garneau and Justin Trudeau have agreed to in sense of moving forward. Is this overrated or underrated for like the politics of COVID going forward?</span>

Maybe it has some scientific value, and I hope that that comes out. But I think you&#39;re really missing the point here, and that is the the u.s intelligence community is very focused on uh giving us the ufo report on june 1st and that&#39;s what i&#39;m really focused on the the chinese virus or the the i don&#39;t trust them at all on any of that but the ufo stuff is going to be really fun cory</span>

They&#39;re, okay, we&#39;re all getting, well, not we&#39;re all, but this is the G7, keep in mind. And most of the G7 nations can say we are getting vaccinated and we are ready to start reopening in various fashions on various timelines, sure. But, you know, it&#39;s happening at this point. And we are going to need those signals from our leaders of the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you the final question, start with you here. The Bloc failed to muster unanimous support for a Commons motion backing Quebec&#39;s constitutional changes. In order to pass without debate, the motion needs to face no vocal opposition from MPs. But it did. It faced one from former Liberal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, now an independent LNP who yelled out nay. How big of a deal is this that the unanimous support for the backing of Quebec&#39;s constitutional changes did not go through unanimously? Is that overrated or underrated that it did not go through?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think this is part of a slow burn, where people had hoped this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. Well, let&#39;s just say leaders in Parliament, we hope this would not be an issue at all, and they could keep their heads down, and they could all move on with it. But we are seeing polling now, where a supermajority of Canadians outside of Quebec are opposed to this, and a super majority within Quebec are in favor of this. And that&#39;s a level of contention that&#39;s going to be difficult to manage.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">manage. And their best hope of managing it was this quick strike. I don&#39;t think Canadians are going to let them get away with that. I think we&#39;re going to have to have a conversation about this particular matter, this notion of Quebec amending the Constitution. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I find it fascinating that you have premiers like Jason Kenney speaking out in favor of this. I didn&#39;t see any provincial breakdowns in the Leger polls that showed 65% of Canadians outside of Quebec opposed, but I have to – you know, we&#39;re all Albertans. We live in Alberta. Does anybody on this podcast think that Alberta was somehow going to be more supportive of the notion of the nation just being entered into the Constitution?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, it&#39;s really troubling. It&#39;s really difficult to see. I mean, Jody Wilson-Raybould, I mean, this is a good move for her politically. I mean, she gets to oppose the prime minister again. She gets to take a popular position, and it gives her an opportunity heading into an election where, as we know, independents do very poorly. So smart move politically, I think, for her drags</span>

            <span class="text">drags this out. I mean, I think that every political leader has indicated essentially federally they just don&#39;t want to deal with this in an election period. For the reasons that Corey&#39;s just describing, the numbers suck. You don&#39;t want to have an issue where you have to take one position to win Quebec, and you have to take the other position to not win, you know, to win outside of Quebec. Doesn&#39;t it seem</span>
