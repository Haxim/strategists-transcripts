        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the exhumation of the bodies of 215 Indigenous children in Kamloops, BC. Why was this news - so expected in some circles - so shocking? How do governments respond? And whereto from here? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Carter, I rarely give you this opportunity, which is the one to start where you want, because there&#39;s so much to unpack with this story, both from what we learned Friday and this weekend, but also historically. So I ask you the question, where do you want to start? Where should we start as we talk about this?</div>

Can we both be shocked by the numbers and the specificity of this particular situation and not surprised at all given the residential school history of Canada that this is where we find ourselves, that this is where Canada has this history and has this this thing that we did, that we have papered over. I mean, I was in school when residential schools were still a thing. I was still, you know, it was still a part of our history. I didn&#39;t know anything coming through my schooling. And</div>

You know, I think I agree with what you guys have said here around, you know, one of the things that has been interesting in Canada is we&#39;ve often used this cloak of pluralism and multiculturalism as a, as cloud cover for the fact that we live in in this harmonious society. We kind of purge a lot of the history before a certain date to kind of point to these policies of, you know, the cultural mosaic versus the melting pot and all those simple comparators to say that, oh, it&#39;s good here. It&#39;s a proven policy. It&#39;s a proven system, unique place in the world. And that self-adulation, I think, often gets in the way of this sort of introspection, which kind of leads me from what Corey was talking about between comparing the us, you, me, the three of us, as in regular folks, versus those that represent us, i.e. our governments, plural, you know, all of them leading to this one. Carter, talk to me a bit more about, you know, the, if I can use this term, the burden of responsibility between us as Canadians and folks that are, you know, engaged</div>

But the truth of the matter is that if you look at generations of immigration, it follows very similar patterns. You know, You know, when Eastern Europeans came over to Canada, they were treated differently because they were different. And when, you know, South Asians are coming over to Canada, they were treated different. So first generation, there&#39;s a very common first generation story of, you know, immigration into Canada.

And if he falls back on the tools that served him well in his past jobs, he will not get his future job. You&#39;ve got to be much pithier with the soundbite. You&#39;ve got to be able to see when you&#39;re being led down a garden path. I think the example of the economy, oh, thanks for explaining the economy to me, is a good example.

Corey, out of nowhere, the expiry dates have been extended. Turns out they weren&#39;t real in the first place. On AstraZeneca, that&#39;s right. Health Canada has extended the shelf life of the AstraZeneca doses set to expire by Monday, i.e. tomorrow. They&#39;ve extended them by a month, so that means that it has extended the expiry date of roughly 45,000 AstraZeneca doses, with the vaccine had an original and expiry dose of May 31st. They now expire July 1st. Corey, is this a big deal? Is this just an extension of shelf life? Does this make you question expiry dates on everything and anything? Have you already been doing that prior to? And does a three-second rule apply? Okay, all those questions for you. Well,</div>

Overrated or underrated, this new lab leak theory that the U.S. is now investigating, this, of course, now, you know, started as a, I can say this right wing conspiracy theory at the beginning of the pandemic that, you know, if you haven&#39;t heard of it, that COVID was leaked through a Wuhan virology lab that is now not saying is gaining mainstream acceptance, But the predominant theory proposed by the WHO that this was cross-contamination from animals to humans has not necessarily been proven in the meantime. And the U.S. is now asking for open up an investigation that Mark Garneau and Justin Trudeau have agreed to in sense of moving forward. Is this overrated or underrated for like the politics of COVID going forward?</div>

Maybe it has some scientific value, and I hope that that comes out.

The Bloc failed to muster unanimous support for a Commons motion backing Quebec&#39;s constitutional changes. In order to pass without debate, the motion needs to face no vocal opposition from MPs. But it did. It faced one from former Liberal Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, now an independent LNP who yelled out nay. How big of a deal is this that the unanimous support for the backing of Quebec&#39;s constitutional changes did not go through unanimously? Is that overrated or underrated that it did not go through?</div>

          <div class="said">I think this is part of a slow burn, where people had hoped this wouldn&#39;t be an issue. Well, let&#39;s just say leaders in Parliament, we hope this would not be an issue at all, and they could keep their heads down, and they could all move on with it. But we are seeing polling now, where a supermajority of Canadians outside of Quebec are opposed to this, and a super majority within Quebec are in favor of this. And that&#39;s a level of contention that&#39;s going to be difficult to manage.</div>
