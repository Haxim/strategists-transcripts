        <p>Zain's away but Stephen and Corey couldn't (wouldn't) wait to record after a news-filled day coming out of the Alberta Legislature and the new UCP premier. </p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Alberta's new UCP Premier is sworn in and she just can't stop making news. Two thirds of the gang are on deck. They have so many things to say and not say. Things they say include: Kenney ghosting Smith, CMOH Deena Hinshaw being fired, health care overhaul due in 90 days, Calgary strategy, the evolving Sovereignty Act and, of course, the idea that the unvaccinated are "the most discriminated against group that [Smith has] ever witnessed".</em></p></blockquote>

Now, you may want to change the legislation to do that, but we have had mandatory vaccinations in the province of Alberta. Ironically, the person who took them out, Jason Kenney. We used to require mandatory vaccinations at AHS for the flu. You know why? Because we didn&#39;t want people in the hospitals giving the flu to people in, like the staff shouldn&#39;t give the flu to people in the hospital. That was a pretty common thing. Hepatitis B, very easily vaccinated against, super easy to do every health care professional every first responder gets vaccinated against vaccine hepatitis b and you talk about travel danny danny do you want to travel somewhere in africa because you&#39;re going to need a shit ton of vaccinations to make sure you can do so safely now you can go if you want without getting those vaccinations but don&#39;t come back with malaria and expect that the canadian health care system is going to take care of your sorry ass and you don&#39;t falsely equivocate the number of people who&#39;ve been ill</div>

Every civilized society, meaning the people who aren&#39;t taking their cues from the United States, thinks that vaccination is a good thing. And the fact that vaccination has gone from being a good thing to a bad thing is the reasons why we have measles outbreaks in southern alberta this is a bad thing danny we don&#39;t want this shit to happen i don&#39;t understand how you can say that and to suggest that they&#39;re the most discriminated people in in canada the people who you haven&#39;t i mean fuck you daniel danielle black people lgbtq people first nations people um i&#39;m out here working in surrey with with you know the south asian population.

Alberta really got a good look at her. There was the lake of fire comments one of her candidates made. There was when Danielle Smith said the science wasn&#39;t settled on climate change in a late debate that was in the last week at CBC. And her support just evaporated. And you and I have talked about this. I was running the liberal campaign at the time. You were the head strategist for the PCs at the time. And we both saw the same thing, which is overnight, Danielle Smith&#39;s support collapsed, right?</div>
