But I&#39;m saying most people in our city have no fucking clue what&#39;s going on. So you got Gondek, who&#39;s the current mayor, right? You got Farkas, who came in second last time as the conservative choice. This is the former counselor who&#39;s now running as a, let&#39;s put a pin on this, but a progressive white.</span>

You mentioned Brian Thiessen. This is the Calgary party. This is Carter&#39;s party. Brian, a well-respected labor lawyer or employment lawyer, I should say, in the Calgary space, former police commission chair. chair and then jeff davison this is running as an independent ward former ward six counselor ran for mayor last time as you alluded to um and of course is also leading a little bit more conservative in that in that regard you&#39;ve got other folks running but that&#39;s the that&#39;s the batch is it not yeah yeah</span>

Like, not only did they run against each other four years ago, they all started on council at the same time. So, the 2017 election, which I know well, you know well, right? You were running Nenshi&#39;s. I was covering City Hall at the time.</span>

And what&#39;s fascinating to me is that I think more people today on raw numbers are engaged in politics as a cultural observational sport. Fewer people are engaged in politics as a raw, let me put my vote somewhere sport. And I think they&#39;re engaged in culture because politics is culture based on what&#39;s happening down south, what&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">you think it is. This is not insightful. This is not insightful other than to say, it kind of goes to my first question, which is other than to say, okay, Sharp looks more viable than ever before. Who can stop bad things from happening? I don&#39;t think the question is who is the best mayor.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">but here she is jyoti gondek who&#39;s running as like oh yeah by the way i was mayor and i still continue to be mayor as almost a brand new thing and she&#39;s first or second in the polls like if if jyoti gondek wins monday night people won&#39;t celebrate that as a Jyoti Gondek win as much as they&#39;ll be like yeah low voter turnout all those things but holy shit did she escape strategically or otherwise from a referendum the woman literally had a fucking recall against her and she could be mayor again which goes back to your other wise point around are people actually mad or are they disengaged and will the engaged people finally learn the lesson like the engaged people on the center right let&#39;s just say the center all the way to the left kind of say maybe we got to coalesce around Gondek I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what everyone&#39;s doing I don&#39;t want to count out these and I don&#39;t count on anybody at this case because 50% undecided, you know, in that sense, the smart money is that most of those people stay home. But there could be some true undecideds in that mix, as you mentioned, with even the hyper engaged. But I think the question that is framing up is a negative partisan question, which is who can stop evil from happening or who could stop bad stuff from happening? Not evil might be too deep of a word or too charged of a word. Whatever that might mean for you. And for the left or for the center in the left, as sharp has become more viable, I think that question snaps into focus. And then for the right, as Gondek and a new progressive-like version of Farkas flirt with one and two in the polls, the coalescing around sharp might occur. So this is – I</span>

So let&#39;s get to that in a second. But before that, let&#39;s talk about process, because you&#39;ve jumped into process, and I think it&#39;s very important, because there&#39;s been an absence of a few things this election.

But in terms of the art, the creativity, the placement, the timing, the virality, or even the try to punch through, the attack ads, the stunts, all that sort of stuff that comes with it, I think we&#39;re taking a step back. Where I think we might have taken a step forward is if you were on the email list of these folks, on the owned side of things, the email list, I think campaigns are doing quite a good job talking to their supporters. Now, I have no sense. This is what Henderson yesterday said about the Edmonton campaign. I&#39;ll say about the Calgary campaign. i have no sense how big these dashboards are i have no</span>

I do think people at the debates, but it&#39;s insiders watching the debates. So usually the debates afterwards, I chat with a lot of people, hear what they&#39;re thinking, what they&#39;re saying. The chamber one, people were like, Thiessen won that 100%. He also, that was the first time he went really hot on tying Sharp to Smith. And again, the teacher strike timing. Last night, I feel like people felt like Davison, and Davison was entertaining, right? Like people thought that Davison, in terms of like a winner, I think he&#39;s then, the conversations in my circles are like, we really like him. He would be great. But does he have a chance?

And I think the initial polling showed Albertans didn&#39;t want parties. I think it&#39;s changed slightly. But then we&#39;re also in a time frame where like with the teacher strike, Daniel Smith is not like doing super well in Calgary right now.

You know, I think for for Thiessen, the fact is, I think the best mayor question would have been very helpful to them. But as soon as people turn into pundits, and what I mean by that is they turn into people like you and I who talk about things like viability. As soon as voters turn into pundits, that&#39;s trouble when you&#39;re not one of the people that&#39;s showing viability through metrics like polling or momentum or other sort of congealed sort of metrics like that.

And I don&#39;t have a clear answer in the sense. I have a clear answer.

To to those around us around what to do how it&#39;s shaping up what&#39;s going on and I think one core ingredient missing in both cities in this election is that, and less so in Edmonton, because I think folks are starting to understand the task. It&#39;s a two-horse race for the most part, and that we&#39;ve got to stop Cartmel if you&#39;re anywhere between, let&#39;s just say on the left and some folks on the center. That task is less clear here. That path is less clear here. I think Farkas, to your earlier description of who he&#39;s become and who he wants to be, makes that task a bit harder in terms of what folks are doing i think gondek with her history and and and perhaps a little bit of disappointment for some people makes that task harder and then thesen with all his promise right</span>

In this case, this is a scenario that in the simplest of terms, if you believe what Farkas stands for, it&#39;s two left wing candidates versus a right one at the top. And</span>

            <span class="text">this. Let&#39;s close out here, which is I don&#39;t want to go through every council race, but I replayed the story for Henderson the other day in 2017. I was so focused on the mayor&#39;s race. And of course, this was like every other race. We hit all of council, whatever. And as I look up on the screen on that night in 2017, I&#39;m like, oh, thank God. And then she won. We get to celebrate. Oh, what happened to any of the councils? Every single incumbent that ran won. on</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">do you think do you think that story plays out here again in calgary uh just based on the simple sleepiness uh of this election or do you feel like any of the incumbents are at real threat um and what what are you kind of as</span>

            <span class="text">as you&#39;ve also mentioned earlier in this episode this independence streak seems to be one of those driving questions or at least seems to be a not a deciding or driving question maybe that&#39;s too much but seems to be a factor of some kind in some of these races so just your broader thoughts on council council incumbents and where we might land with a few of these things or any notable things you find fascinating on your end?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">recently like not not not that long ago, but, and I think, okay, let&#39;s say five of the six incumbents or six of the six. I actually don&#39;t think that matters that much because you have, you need to count to eight, right? Like you need, you need the eight. So, so where, where, who, who are the other, who are the new faces around the table? Right. Who are the new seven people and what are they like and, and what do they believe in and are they part of a party? Are they not part of a party?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. It&#39;s, it&#39;s going to be fascinating to see. who has the best governance or easiest governance pathway, who has the worst governance pathway, what some of these new faces look like, what those previews of the future look like. Is there a case where the Calgary party produces one or two folks without a mayor&#39;s chair? Is there any... I mean, here&#39;s the thing. The future of the parties, I mean, we can spend hours discussing, but let&#39;s be clear. They have to disband. And if they want to start up again, that&#39;s going to be a new thing. But the question is, they may not even be part of the next election. So this could be like literally a one and done where that Calgary party name, brand, website, logo, the flag that they&#39;ve wrapped themselves around is so temporary that it may never see the light of day again. And same for the Edmonton sort of version of these brands. And same for Communities First. This</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is not a thing that we&#39;re going to associate. I mean, people are not associating candidates with brands as aggressively other than just to be like, you&#39;re part of a party and I don&#39;t like that. But they&#39;re not associating themselves with these brands while voting for them. I think the likelihood of them doing so is significantly less even when those parties leave and be like, I remember that was our community&#39;s first candidate that&#39;s doing that. And that&#39;s the reason why they&#39;re doing X, Y, and Z. I</span>

            <span class="text">I want to wrap up here with any final thoughts you may have. We&#39;ve talked almost exclusively about the mayor&#39;s race. We talked a bit about council. We talked about the ballot box question, the polling, the process,</span>

            <span class="text">some scenarios we might see on Monday night. I&#39;m not going to ask you for a prediction because it does genuinely seem close. But if you want to give one, you can. But any final thoughts, Annalise, as we wrap up? yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">um yeah that&#39;s i will state that prediction i think turnout will be low but maybe not maybe people will like coalesce this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">this weekend and the the undecideds will decide and they&#39;ll share it with their networks and and but yeah no i think 40 so the 2017 was the highest in 40 years that was 58 but that was that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">that and as you know like people came out and supported nancy because there was some polls that made it look really really close the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">right and so it was like there was something kind of like exciting and motivating if there&#39;s nothing i mean short of like a new poll coming out today that shows sharp 10 points ahead i don&#39;t</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t know how you motivate all of these undecideds to come out so if we&#39;re dealing with 46 last time in like the covet election i think it&#39;s going to be in the 30s which is like like abysmal, like that&#39;s, that&#39;s bad. That&#39;s not good. And then I think whoever, to your point at the beginning about like how big their mandate is going to be, whoever&#39;s in the mayor&#39;s chair is not going to have a huge mandate. They&#39;re going to have like, there&#39;s a lot of big things that need to happen in the next four years. And they&#39;re going to have a team that may or may not, you know, be, be with them.
