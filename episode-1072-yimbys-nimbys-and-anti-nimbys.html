        <div class="desc"><p>Calgary City Council has had a wild couple of days. The gang unpacks some of the lessons - local, national and just about good strategy - that spill out of them. Plus - a lightning round discussion around the crystallizing narrative that the NDP lost because of the corporate tax hike proposal and the debate.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use a weird 24 hours at Calgary City Council to discuss the politics of affordable housing and the strategies of expert panels and rapid reversals. Are conservatives poised to take total ownership of the housing question? Has Calgary Council's sudden reversal increased the risk of demands for future reversals? And who won Stephen and Corey's impassioned-speech-off? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

So these were like bold, bold actions and recommendations that are different things that Calgary could do to increase the diversity, increase and diversify the supply of housing in Calgary during a critical time during a housing crisis, which is something many cities across this country are dealing with. So there was recommendations to do with zoning, parking minimums, etc. We don&#39;t need to get into all of them.

          <div class="said">it&#39;s not just the federal MPs who jumped in on this. Phone lines were lit up. Emails were lit up. Calgarians of all stripes were furious. And so I think the other really important element that we need to put on the table here, and God knows I don&#39;t want to go too deep into Calgary land here, is the arena deal a month and change ago was passed by council 15 to 0 with no public consultation. And so this is not about the arena, but I think people were like a dry powder keg ready to explode at council. You know, people&#39;s tolerance with council already very low. We&#39;ve talked a bit on this pod about the polling for the arena actually not being very positive. And then when you have conservative councillors oppose the affordability and housing elements that the federal conservatives are even pushing. And one of the reasons they&#39;re saying they&#39;re doing it is a lack of public consultation. People had had fucking enough. Yeah,</div>

Um, it&#39;s because as soon as you start wavering on one of your ideas and you start wavering on one of the things you&#39;re committed to, there are other things that people will start to push you on. What is, Oh, if you&#39;re not really committed to this one, well then how committed are you to the next one or the next one or the next one? And so that&#39;s one of the, that&#39;s one of many really good reasons. Um, generally speaking, not to back away, uh, just because the public is outraged. You know, the public being outraged is just not, in and of itself, enough reason to back away from an issue. You&#39;re supposed to be a leader. You&#39;re supposed to be able to weather these intermittent storms of hostility because you are doing what&#39;s in the best interest of your community. And they may come to see that. This was just so egregious, the way that this And I think that Corey has really nailed it in pointing out that in part of the reason why this was so bad is it was conservatives taking advantage of the opportunity to show, I think, the progressives that they could stop this regardless of whether or not it was good policy.

          <div class="said">Yeah. And, you know, one of the things about these bodies, whether it be a council or a cabinet or a legislature, is their decisions intentionally curate an era of finality. Like, I&#39;ve done this, ergo it is done. And one of the small little details of this is one of the reasons why it was relatively easy to reconsider this particular motion is it was technically in the same council day, even though the calendar had flipped over because the meeting had recessed. The rules for reconsideration were lower, although they certainly had the votes even with the, you know, the heightened like two thirds majority required to do it. So that was like interesting, but not necessary. But there, you know, that sense of like the gavel down and we&#39;ve made a decision and that&#39;s it and we&#39;re moving on.</div>

That&#39;s done for the reason Stephen said, because if you train people to think that those decisions are actually just momentary things that can be reversed the next time, you change politics in ways that are not particularly helpful to you as an elected official, right? Because there&#39;s supposed to be a certain move-on finality to decision-making in politics, and we go on to the next thing. And I actually think there&#39;s a broader challenge in politics where more things are open, more things are up for discussion, even once they&#39;re concluded. And we see this in a big sense when, for example, the UCP government comes in in Alberta and undoes all of the NDP things. Used</div>

The solutions that Pierre Polyev is talking about and has kind of branded himself around as his right wing solutions are very similar to the quote unquote left wing solutions. I&#39;ll give you an example. example um this is one of the examples we used to talk about quite a bit in uh nenshi&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">if you have a secondary suite you might you know the person who has that secondary suite might accidentally park their car in front of my house um well that&#39;s not a very good reason not to have a secondary suite um and the way that liberals liberals have traditionally, you know, messaged that is that social housing is a compelling end in and of itself. We need to have affordable housing. Affordable housing means that we should be able to have secondary suites. Not everybody needs to live in a, you know, 2,400 square foot house with a bonus room.</div>

          <div class="said">That&#39;s true, but there&#39;s a better way to message it. And that is the right wing way, which is to say, why is the state even involved in these decisions? These should be be market forces that are making these determinations. The state doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to say about it, except whether or not the facility is safe, whether or not the house is safe. And if it&#39;s safe, then we should be able to see market solutions to these problems. So if you&#39;re the liberals, then what you need to do is figure out what language you&#39;re going to do to put around your solutions and actually start solving them. Because that&#39;s what people are demanding. The reason that Pierre Polyev has been able to jump on this has been because number one, he&#39;s willing to, and number two, he sees that the cost of living issue is driven by housing. If you want to get ahead of the cost of living issue, you have to start solving the housing problems. So just start solving them. The solutions are known and available to everybody. Corey,</div>

And yeah, the United Kingdom doesn&#39;t exactly have cheap housing all of the time. But you know what? But at least there&#39;s a solution out there that somebody can propose that is actually about the supply of housing instead of whatever the fuck this is that the NDP and the liberals are talking about. I mean, my God, the liberals are literally saying, we&#39;re going to find ways where you can borrow more money and have more money available to purchase a house.

I&#39;m not building a duplex on my lot. My lot&#39;s not big enough for this. But if I want to put up some postmodern monstrosity, who the fuck&#39;s decision is that but mine? This is my property, and I should be allowed to do what I want with it. And the idea The idea that the very same people who would really bristle at the government being involved in any other component of their life want to come in and stop them and their neighbors from being able to do what they want to do with their property really baffles me. Like, I don&#39;t understand that. But I think maybe this is also an opportunity to find common ground on this particular issue. This is something that progressives can support. This is something conservatives can support. Maybe it&#39;s got to be framed in entirely different ways.

So there&#39;s these properties that have been sold with covenants. don&#39;t get me started and and the truth of the matter is the people who who want to stand behind these covenants need to understand where they came from right they are racist there is just no other way around it they are racist they well</div>

          <div class="said">covenants were put in place many covenants were put in place to keep the neighborhoods uh you know free of of undesirables and the undesirables that they are trying to keep free just happened to be black, Jewish, have different types of last names, different religions, different ethnicities. All of these things were a significant part about why covenants came to be at all. And anybody who&#39;s using a covenant to defend why their property should be kept the way it is needs to be confronted with the fact that they are behaving as a racist. And that&#39;s okay. okay, if you want to be a racist, I&#39;m fine with that. Just say you&#39;re being a racist.</div>

And the last thing I wanted to say is something I wanted to say earlier, and I forgot to, but I&#39;m going to do it right now. I am so fucking tired of city councils and elected representatives rejecting expert advice, especially expert advice that they request. You know, this council, like this housing advisory committee didn&#39;t just show up. They wasn&#39;t like, you know, 12 people sitting around in a fucking city just trying to figure out what they should do with their weekends. These are people that were appointed by city council to come forward with the best possible recommendations. And eight fuckers decided that their time, their expertise and their efforts weren&#39;t worth shit. shit so fuck you terry wong yes i&#39;m talking to you sorry cory i brought up a specific name but it&#39;s terry fucking wong that&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">processing facility and you know, no, no one likes that. No one wants the chicken processing facility outside of their backyard, but that&#39;s how we used to build things because it was convenient. We walked everywhere. We, we had industry located next to houses and we decided, you know what, that&#39;s probably not a great idea, especially given the fact that a lot of our industry was polluting the neighborhood and killing our children. Not great. We don&#39;t want to do that. So we&#39;re going to create zoning so that we have certain uses away from other uses. And then we went too far. We thought, you know, what would be great is if we could actually zone everything so that we have residences in one place and commercial in another place. And what we found out is that mixed use and density actually is the best way to possibly zone things because it makes it better for business owners. It makes it better for residents. It makes it better for all kinds of people. And if you think that a 15-minute community is in some fashion going to impede your ability to to travel you&#39;re a nutcase you&#39;re a crazy person so you know i i just think that you know we we have the opportunity to to say that we were wrong and and one thing that politicians don&#39;t do enough of is say they were wrong and they did the wrong thing for a long time and now they have to fix it just say you were wrong okay</div>

That&#39;s getting into your business in a way that the city just shouldn&#39;t get into your business. And we&#39;re not going to tell you you must own a car and you must therefore have a garage. We&#39;re not going to get into your business in that way. And if you don&#39;t want that, that&#39;s fine. And we fully accept that that&#39;s your right as a citizen of Calgary, right? The thing about Calgary, the thing about Alberta is you get choices. You get to live the life that you want to live and the government stays out of your your way in these particular fashions.

And you can organize like crazy around individual questions and you can just flood the zone on it. And you can make misery for the individual counselors on individual issues. shoes and the counselors don&#39;t even get to hide between like i hear you on that one but the overall bundle is really good and the bundle is the important thing and it&#39;s not one it&#39;s a suite of things and there&#39;s a reason we need to keep it together instead they&#39;ve unbundled their own fucking bill allowing them to get beaten to death on every single individual recommendation by every single interest group that&#39;s out there and they&#39;re just going to be bloodied at the finish line like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a possibility that there are different votes different combinations of yes yes and no on every single thing. And every single thing passes. And everybody is mad at every counselor because of this unbundling that they&#39;ve done and the conversation they&#39;ve invited over several months. Sucks for the counselors. Great if you&#39;re actually looking to try to get your individual thing in there. So just organize narrowly and go hard over the next bit.</div>

If your terms of reference were so wide that it did things that were not on the table, that&#39;s on you. That&#39;s not on them. You ask them for solutions. You could have put them in more of a box. The second reason you hire a task force is to avoid political blame. You know what needs to be done and you need outside expertise to validate the thing that you want to do. And of course, Jason Kenney did this with the McKinnon panel when he was elected in 2019. He knew what he wanted to do in terms of funding for all of these various things. He needed outside, marked by a former NDP finance minister, yes, this is what needs to be done. This is the analysis against all of the other provinces. He knew that. He</div>

There generally isn&#39;t strategy across the country. I mean, I watched Surrey as they decided that they were going to get rid of the RCMP and move to their own police force. It&#39;s a financial disaster. It&#39;s not strategic by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, it&#39;s just one politician&#39;s dream to try and create something that&#39;s going to be a legacy.

But if you&#39;re just doing it to keep mouths to be fed, it&#39;s also very expensive. And it can make government work at cross purposes if the overlap is too tight, right? If two people are working in the same space. So I&#39;ll be curious to see if she says, now we&#39;re going to do small government or smaller government, we&#39;re going to get back to normal, or if she declares this to be the new normal.

When I think about the one moment that probably set this campaign, I have a different one moment. I&#39;d be curious if I had to pick one. For me, it was the wildfires. It just broke the flow. It was like a first week of the NDP just murdering the UCP. We talked about how horrible that first week was. And it was a total reset of the campaign as soon as we got the wildfires. And it had a couple of effects. One, it allowed Daniel Smith to look like a premier.</div>

And upon reflection, I think part of the reason that&#39;s the case is that four weeks became three weeks, effectively. And a lot of things got piled on top of that wildfire narrative that was moving at the exact same time. So that had a big effect. And we know that&#39;s when polling started to move.</div>
