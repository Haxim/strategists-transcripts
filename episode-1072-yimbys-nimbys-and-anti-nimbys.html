So these were like bold, bold actions and recommendations that are different things that Calgary could do to increase the diversity, increase and diversify the supply of housing in Calgary during a critical time during a housing crisis, which is something many cities across this country are dealing with. So there was recommendations to do with zoning, parking minimums, etc. We don&#39;t need to get into all of them. Anyways, task force does the work, they come up with these goes to council yesterday it&#39;s defeated in an eight to seven vote so eight members of council uh basically said like no we don&#39;t want to make any progress on on housing is how that was interpreted i would</span>

How much, Carter, let&#39;s start with you. How much do you think the fact that this hit the federal stage, how much do you think that shaped this, like, very sudden reversal?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think that, you know, the idea that Conservatives are for low-income housing has been something that Pierre Polyev has really pushed. And he&#39;s talked about reducing red tape. He&#39;s talked about, you know, getting municipalities into a place where they&#39;re making better decisions. All of those things are part of his his talking points. Now, the conservatives want to own affordability as a as a primary issue. And when city</span>

            <span class="text">city council like this makes a decision that goes against that, it really is reinforcing the stereotype that the that the conservatives have been railing against. It&#39;s bureaucratic. It&#39;s got gatekeeping. It&#39;s got all the words that Pierre Polyev is excited about, and it&#39;s now happening here in Calgary. The fact that it is the</span>

If they&#39;re doing this and they&#39;re jumping in in Vancouver, it&#39;s just the standard, you know, blue on red violence. This is blue on blue violence. And I think that it got more attention, number one. And number two, it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think it&#39;s important to note that the supporters were all from what we would kind of consider the progressive wing of the Calgary Council. And the opponents were conservatives plus a few people who were a bit surprising in the sense that you would normally expect them to be relatively reliable progressive votes. And so for those outside the city keeping count, yes, there are more progressive councillors in Calgary than conservative councillors, if you&#39;re going to do kind of like a rough, easy math on that. And to Stephen&#39;s point, one of the things that I think that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what are you doing? What in the absolute fuck are you doing on this particular matter? And I think that surprised a lot of the conservative councillors. And I do think Stephen put his finger on the button here. One of the reasons why it was such</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">such a rapid reversal is I feel like a lot of the reason the conservatives on council voted against this is because it had the support of progressives on council. It had that sports team thing. And by all accounts, from the people I&#39;m talking to, it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s not just the federal MPs who jumped in on this. Phone lines were lit up. Emails were lit up. Calgarians of all stripes were furious. And so I think the other really important element that we need to put on the table here, and God knows I don&#39;t want to go too deep into Calgary land here, is the arena deal a month and change ago was passed by council 15 to 0 with no public consultation. And so this is not about the arena, but I think people were like a dry powder keg ready to explode at council. You know, people&#39;s tolerance with council already very low. We&#39;ve talked a bit on this pod about the polling for the arena actually not being very positive. And then when you have conservative councillors oppose the affordability and housing elements that the federal conservatives are even pushing. And one of the reasons they&#39;re saying they&#39;re doing it is a lack of public consultation. People had had fucking enough. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just absolute enough. And it caused it caused the kind of shitstorm you sometimes see in politics. And I think almost to the credit of those conservative counselors, they very quickly read the room and said, we screwed up. And they they extracted themselves from a situation of</span>

            <span class="text">you know, what else are we going to have to back away from? And the arena deal stands at the top of that list.

But, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">when you back, I mean, this is one of the reasons that the double down principle exists and the double down principle isn&#39;t just to be, you know, just to get what you want to get or just to be obstinate. it. Um, it&#39;s because as soon as you start wavering on one of your ideas and you start wavering on one of the things you&#39;re committed to, there are other things that people will start to push you on. What is, Oh, if you&#39;re not really committed to this one, well then how committed are you to the next one or the next one or the next one? And so that&#39;s one of the, that&#39;s one of many really good reasons. Um, generally speaking, not to back away, uh, just because the public is outraged. You know, the public being outraged is just not, in and of itself, enough reason to back away from an issue. You&#39;re supposed to be a leader. You&#39;re supposed to be able to weather these intermittent storms of hostility because you are doing what&#39;s in the best interest of your community. And they may come to see that. This was just so egregious, the way that this And I think that Corey has really nailed it in pointing out that in part of the reason why this was so bad is it was conservatives taking advantage of the opportunity to show, I think, the progressives that they could stop this regardless of whether or not it was good policy. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And, you know, one of the things about these bodies, whether it be a council or a cabinet or a legislature, is their decisions intentionally curate an era of finality. Like, I&#39;ve done this, ergo it is done. And one of the small little details of this is one of the reasons why it was relatively easy to reconsider this particular motion is it was technically in the same council day, even though the calendar had flipped over because the meeting had recessed. The rules for reconsideration were lower, although they certainly had the votes even with the, you know, the heightened like two thirds majority required to do it. So that was like interesting, but not necessary. But there, you know, that sense of like the gavel down and we&#39;ve made a decision and that&#39;s it and we&#39;re moving on.</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s not an accident. incident. That&#39;s done for the reason Stephen said, because if you train people to think that those decisions are actually just momentary things that can be reversed the next time, you change politics in ways that are not particularly helpful to you as an elected official, right? Because there&#39;s supposed to be a certain move-on finality to decision-making in politics, and we go on to the next thing. And I actually think there&#39;s a broader challenge in politics where more things are open, more things are up for discussion, even once they&#39;re concluded. And we see this in a big sense when, for example, the UCP government comes in in Alberta and undoes all of the NDP things. Used</span>

Just how what should the liberals and NDP federally be doing right now when CPC is like in their turf, essentially?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think what they should be doing is actually solving the problem. Almost all the solutions are the same, right? The solutions that Pierre Polyev is talking about and has kind of branded himself around as his right wing solutions are very similar to the quote unquote left wing solutions. I&#39;ll give you an example. example um this is one of the examples we used to talk about quite a bit in uh nenshi&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">if you have a secondary suite you might you know the person who has that secondary suite might accidentally park their car in front of my house um well that&#39;s not a very good reason not to have a secondary suite um and the way that liberals liberals have traditionally, you know, messaged that is that social housing is a compelling end in and of itself. We need to have affordable housing. Affordable housing means that we should be able to have secondary suites. Not everybody needs to live in a, you know, 2,400 square foot house with a bonus room.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s true, but there&#39;s a better way to message it. And that is the right wing way, which is to say, why is the state even involved in these decisions? These should be be market forces that are making these determinations. The state doesn&#39;t necessarily have anything to say about it, except whether or not the facility is safe, whether or not the house is safe. And if it&#39;s safe, then we should be able to see market solutions to these problems. So if you&#39;re the liberals, then what you need to do is figure out what language you&#39;re going to do to put around your solutions and actually start solving them. Because that&#39;s what people are demanding. The reason that Pierre Polyev has been able to jump on this has been because number one, he&#39;s willing to, and number two, he sees that the cost of living issue is driven by housing. If you want to get ahead of the cost of living issue, you have to start solving the housing problems. So just start solving them. The solutions are known and available to everybody. Corey,</span>

People have talked about Vienna, probably not an appropriate model for Canada because it&#39;s got kind of an aging, declining population. I don&#39;t know. You could look at the UK. You could look at council housing, how they build a house and then they allow somebody even to buy that house if they&#39;ve lived there long enough. And then they build another house. And yeah, the United Kingdom doesn&#39;t exactly have cheap housing all of the time. But you know what? But at least there&#39;s a solution out there that somebody can propose that is actually about the supply of housing instead of whatever the fuck this is that the NDP and the liberals are talking about. I mean, my God, the liberals are literally saying, we&#39;re going to find ways where you can borrow more money and have more money available to purchase a house. Never mind that it is so many times multiples of income right now that you would be drowning the rest of your life if you purchased one of these houses in Toronto.

I&#39;m actually not even really joking. There&#39;s this sense of the community must look in this way, and it has to have these heritage elements. It must be built in this particular fashion. I&#39;m not building a duplex on my lot. My lot&#39;s not big enough for this. But if I want to put up some postmodern monstrosity, who the fuck&#39;s decision is that but mine? This is my property, and I should be allowed to do what I want with it. And the idea The idea that the very same people who would really bristle at the government being involved in any other component of their life want to come in and stop them and their neighbors from being able to do what they want to do with their property really baffles me. Like, I don&#39;t understand that. But I think maybe this is also an opportunity to find common ground on this particular issue. This is something that progressives can support. This is something conservatives can support. Maybe it&#39;s got to be framed in entirely different ways.

All of these things were a significant part about why covenants came to be at all. And anybody who&#39;s using a covenant to defend why their property should be kept the way it is needs to be confronted with the fact that they are behaving as a racist. And that&#39;s okay. okay, if you want to be a racist, I&#39;m fine with that. Just say you&#39;re being a racist.</span>

And the last thing I wanted to say is something I wanted to say earlier, and I forgot to, but I&#39;m going to do it right now. I am so fucking tired of city councils and elected representatives rejecting expert advice, especially expert advice that they request. You know, this council, like this housing advisory committee didn&#39;t just show up. They wasn&#39;t like, you know, 12 people sitting around in a fucking city just trying to figure out what they should do with their weekends. These are people that were appointed by city council to come forward with the best possible recommendations.

No one wants the chicken processing facility outside of their backyard, but that&#39;s how we used to build things because it was convenient. We walked everywhere. We, we had industry located next to houses and we decided, you know what, that&#39;s probably not a great idea, especially given the fact that a lot of our industry was polluting the neighborhood and killing our children. Not great. We don&#39;t want to do that. So we&#39;re going to create zoning so that we have certain uses away from other uses. And then we went too far. We thought, you know, what would be great is if we could actually zone everything so that we have residences in one place and commercial in another place. And what we found out is that mixed use and density actually is the best way to possibly zone things because it makes it better for business owners. It makes it better for residents. It makes it better for all kinds of people. And if you think that a 15-minute community is in some fashion going to impede your ability to to travel you&#39;re a nutcase you&#39;re a crazy person so you know i i just think that you know we we have the opportunity to to say that we were wrong and and one thing that politicians don&#39;t do enough of is say they were wrong and they did the wrong thing for a long time and now they have to fix it just say you were wrong okay</span>

            <span class="text">yeah well not to at the risk of repeating what i was saying earlier i think it&#39;s about choice it&#39;s yes we uh we are still going to zone industry in certain areas but we&#39;re not going to tell you what kind of house you&#39;re going to build on your property, that&#39;s going too far. That&#39;s getting into your business in a way that the city just shouldn&#39;t get into your business. And we&#39;re not going to tell you you must own a car and you must therefore have a garage. We&#39;re not going to get into your business in that way. And if you don&#39;t want that, that&#39;s fine. And we fully accept that that&#39;s your right as a citizen of Calgary, right? The thing about Calgary, the thing about Alberta is you get choices. You get to live the life that you want to live and the government stays out of your your way in these particular fashions. And I think that that&#39;s really, you know, that&#39;s fruitful ground, both for the conservatives, but also,</span>

Those things organically occurred in cities all throughout the world because they made sense, because that&#39;s how people wanted to live their lives. And if people ultimately decide that&#39;s how they want to live their lives again, and you allow them to do that through the zoning and whatnot, then God love it, right? That&#39;s just fantastic.

You know, this idea of like master planning is how you&#39;re going to get what you want is just probably not true. There are so many failed examples of that.

            <span class="text">do believe that if you are on the outside looking at this, council has handed you a golden opportunity. They&#39;ve told you that they&#39;re going to unbundle these things. They&#39;ve told you that they are going to vote on this in September. And you can organize like crazy around individual questions and you can just flood the zone on it. And you can make misery for the individual counselors on individual issues. shoes and the counselors don&#39;t even get to hide between like i hear you on that one but the overall bundle is really good and the bundle is the important thing and it&#39;s not one it&#39;s a suite of things and there&#39;s a reason we need to keep it together instead they&#39;ve unbundled their own fucking bill allowing them to get beaten to death on every single individual recommendation by every single interest group that&#39;s out there and they&#39;re just going to be bloodied at the finish line like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a possibility that there are different votes different combinations of yes yes and no on every single thing. And every single thing passes. And everybody is mad at every counselor because of this unbundling that they&#39;ve done and the conversation they&#39;ve invited over several months. Sucks for the counselors. Great if you&#39;re actually looking to try to get your individual thing in there. So just organize narrowly and go hard over the next bit.</span>

            <span class="text">You do exactly what Stephen said. Listen to your task force. You ask for the expertise. You probably gave them parameters. If your terms of reference were so wide that it did things that were not on the table, that&#39;s on you. That&#39;s not on them. You ask them for solutions. You could have put them in more of a box. The second reason you hire a task force is to avoid political blame. You know what needs to be done and you need outside expertise to validate the thing that you want to do. And of course, Jason Kenney did this with the McKinnon panel when he was elected in 2019. He knew what he wanted to do in terms of funding for all of these various things. He needed outside, marked by a former NDP finance minister, yes, this is what needs to be done. This is the analysis against all of the other provinces. He knew that. He</span>

It&#39;s a financial disaster. It&#39;s not strategic by any stretch of the imagination. Instead, it&#39;s just one politician&#39;s dream to try and create something that&#39;s going to be a legacy.

I know that some people will disagree with that and they&#39;ll say that the party system is broken in some fashion it&#39;s not it brings in professional leadership it brings in professional staffing and it enables a better outcome because the people who are working for you the people who are leading you are more skilled and more attentive at politics this is not uh this isn&#39;t you know an after-school project kids this is real and there are real life consequences and even though this you know this particular council is full-time they&#39;re supposed to be behaving like adults um the truth of the matter is sometimes they just don&#39;t it&#39;s</span>

And that can be a strength, right? You can say, okay, we&#39;re going to really focus in and have a dedicated staff on these particular areas. But if you&#39;re just doing it to keep mouths to be fed, it&#39;s also very expensive. And it can make government work at cross purposes if the overlap is too tight, right? If two people are working in the same space. So I&#39;ll be curious to see if she says, now we&#39;re going to do small government or smaller government, we&#39;re going to get back to normal, or if she declares this to be the new normal.

May 16th was the day the NDP released the financial calculation behind its platform and the business tax increase. And so they&#39;re saying like, this was like Christmas. And like, these were like the single days where we knew, okay, we&#39;ve got this, we&#39;ve won this campaign. I just want your take.

It was like a first week of the NDP just murdering the UCP. We talked about how horrible that first week was. And it was a total reset of the campaign as soon as we got the wildfires. And it had a couple of effects. One, it allowed Daniel Smith to look like a premier.</span>

            <span class="text">Two, it truncated the rest of the campaign. So I have been critical about how many things came, how fast and how furious. And upon reflection, I think part of the reason that&#39;s the case is that four weeks became three weeks, effectively. And a lot of things got piled on top of that wildfire narrative that was moving at the exact same time. So that had a big effect. And we know that&#39;s when polling started to move.</span>

            <span class="text">Polling didn&#39;t move on the 16th and the 18th, as far as I can tell from all of the available sources here, right? right? There is the Abacus poll that went from like 10 points up to not.</span>

            <span class="text">But in hindsight, that was clearly an outlier, right? Because the other polls were telling different stories. And Janet Brown&#39;s polling, which everybody&#39;s holding up as this gold standard, it</span>

Um, this, you know, I still think the lack of storytelling from, from the NDP making it relevant to me and to you and to our families, um, really hurt them.

And that vote coalesced around, you know, the top three, maybe a top four with, you know, some strong showing by Fury inexplicably. My God, could you imagine if he becomes mayor of Toronto?
