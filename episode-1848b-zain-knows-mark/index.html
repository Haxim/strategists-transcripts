        <p>The gang convene to discuss the Mark Carney launch, the Chrystia Freeland launch, and the strategy of launch and assessing political candidates. Stephen Carter performs his contractually allowed once-every-twelve-episode coup, seizing the host chair over the objections of the other participants and common decency.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Liberal leadership campaign launches, with a focus on a busy week for Mark Carney. What was the best way to enter the Liberal leadership race? What does Carney's launch reveal about the campaign's strategy and tactics? And do you think Corey was worried about the economic wellbeing of those poor people in Laurier Heights? Stephen Carter, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Like, dude was like, he clearly was like, you know, ease enough to be like, I&#39;ve got confidence, the point I&#39;m making and my personality to be able to say, yeah, I can also make an analogy that&#39;s quasi comedic. I can also do this. And then when you make a joke, I know which one to drive past and complete a point because there&#39;s a thought process here sort of thing. I thought that was a much higher wire hack than people thought it was, because just because Jon Stewart likes you doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s easy. In fact, I&#39;d say that was extremely high difficulty, and he nailed it. And so that was why I was like, oh my god, this was very impressive.</div>

He seemed comfortable being there, but quirky awkward while he was there at certain times in that he was the button-down banker, super nice guy, very funny, but obviously in this environment that is just surreal and strange, and that&#39;s that Jon Stewart 45 jokes a second thing. And I really wanted to spend more time with that guy. Like, I thought he was charming. And so that&#39;s what we all thought as we were leading into this all here. And then you watched it, Zane.

          <div class="said">And I think what I got was extremely scripted. obviously extremely scripted because there was scripts like both on paper and teleprompter and of course obviously it would be scripted because it&#39;s like arguably the the most important up until that up until the next one uh maybe a speech that he&#39;s given his first speech in politics but you know unlike cory the other thing i was maybe expecting is that is mark carney as i saw in the daily show ready out you know ready product today his ceiling could be high he doesn&#39;t have fuck</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">fuck i was gonna say an arbitrary six months he doesn&#39;t have six months he has to be ready today And so I think what it to me highlighted was the political challenge of Mark Carney, especially given Freeland, which is the fact that he is coming in as an outsider that wants to take over caucus and be prime minister without a seat. And that highlighted to me in some ways that the Freeland team may fundamentally have a point, which is that this guy&#39;s not ready today. This guy&#39;s just not ready today. He&#39;s not ready just like that. it&#39;s not like there has been a political rock star sitting on the sidelines. What there has been sitting on the sidelines is an extremely impressive, very great one-to-one, you know, very highly credentialed man who&#39;s ready to take the mantle. But that does not mean that there has been a political rock star sitting on the sidelines, so to speak. And I think maybe The Daily Show was such a great performance. It&#39;s not like he should have held back. Strategically, I think he needed to nail that, and he did. It&#39;s not like you would have asked him, be like, we know you&#39;re are great on fireside chats, just like dial this down to an eight because your launch is the one that needs to be a 10. Anyone saying that bullshit today, which by the way, there are some people don&#39;t understand. If you&#39;re going to hit that, hit it out of the park, and he did. But I think today it may have shown to me that there is argument in the fact that this guy may not be necessarily ready to take this on day one, especially with the performance he gave. So I was looking for someone looser. I was looking for someone more, not even animated, but someone who who could tell an anecdote, carry that hockey analogy, like, through, but tell a story that actually means something to me. And I think, to me, it also highlighted one other piece. And I know Mark, so it highlighted this other piece, which is extremely obvious, is that this guy really has faced minimal resistance in his life. Like, he&#39;s been great. I played hockey here across the street, and I was great at hockey. And I got a hockey scholarship, and I killed that. And then I went here, and then things were great. And I made a shit ton of money. And then I served my my country and now i sit on like even in the q a where he&#39;s like yes i&#39;ve resigned from the board of stripe and all these other four probably like fuck you you fuck like and i know you and i like you a lot but fuck you that&#39;s an insane amount of things and i get that&#39;s a massive sacrifice mark carney&#39;s making for us but also fuck you right like that&#39;s an insane amount of things that you&#39;re uh and so i and almost highlighted to me that there&#39;s like there was no sort of like</div>

          <div class="said">Well, first, I just want to respond to what what Zane said, because I agree when I don&#39;t, right? He Yeah, there&#39;s no political chip that you just put in Mark Carney&#39;s brain that&#39;s going to replace having all of the years of experience in politics and the, the comfort it creates with all sorts of settings that you don&#39;t you don&#39;t get in real life. Like it&#39;s it&#39;s a weird world politics. And it takes a certain amount of experience in that weird world for you to be able to do things at the highest level. But I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think he needs six months. I think he might might be really good in six weeks and i agree with zane entirely that he should be looser but this is what the reason why i the reason why i think he did so well is there were those moments right and they were stitched together by awkward components in between but when he went off script you know his little quips on the side they they were fucking charming and they were good and you know and when he was off script clearly when he was being looser he was very good his answer when when City News called on him and he&#39;s like, oh, wait a minute, were you the City News reporter that did the Streeter? I had the sound off, but I wanted to know, like you were going around showing people my picture, what was that about? And he&#39;s like, well, I was asking their names. He&#39;s like, and nobody knew my name, huh? And he&#39;s like, nope, not one person. Closest I got was Mike and everybody sort of laughs. And he laughed, like the comfort. He says, oh, I can roll with that or something to that effect. Like, that&#39;s okay.</div>

I learned these values right next door going around this city. I&#39;m so glad that I&#39;ve got this community that&#39;s supporting me. I am deeply connected here, there, everywhere.

We got to look up every day and say, are we doing enough in that space? And I generally thought it hit the beats that you would expect a speech from Mark Carney to hit, including the need to defend Canada. He had a bit of contrast with Pierre Poliev. I didn&#39;t have major concerns with it. I do agree with Zane that there wasn&#39;t like the big stopping power, big idea.

          <div class="said">I&#39;m getting to it. I think the analogy start was strong with I grew up here. I like the hockey through line, because I think that&#39;s the most relatable thing about Mark Carney, is his fandom for hockey. And I think it&#39;s genuine, right? When you see him put on a McDavid jersey, I actually believe that. I&#39;ve always believed that. And when you realize, and this is one thing I&#39;m surprised we didn&#39;t get to know, is that Mark Carney was an excellent goalie, right? Like, I know that about him. Like, why you guys didn&#39;t extend that metaphor? Why one wouldn&#39;t extend that metaphor to, like, I&#39;m cool with taking shots, I&#39;m good with whatever, like, take all the shots you want. Like, I&#39;m Teflon, like, I&#39;ll stand in the way, I&#39;ll defend you. There&#39;s something there that I would have. But I like the I think this hockey through line, this analogy of sport, the metaphor of being across the hall or across the street, I couldn&#39;t tell exactly which or don&#39;t remember exactly which was was really good.</div>

          <div class="said">And then I do like how he he he talked about Trump. I do like how he tried to reframe the ballot box question. I wish he would have brought in the carbon tax conversation into the speech rather than leave that to the Q&amp;A. I think you could have got a much stronger headline in that regard. You could have talked about his climate positioning. But ultimately, one thing I will refute in terms of what Corey said in terms of a big idea is something you and I, Carter, have talked about all the time, which is launches may not necessarily matter, but the public was looking at Mark Carney in a novel way because it&#39;s the first time he gave this sort of speech. And I would have liked for him to do something against type. And everything I saw there was on type, the way he delivered, the way he looked, the way he presented. And I would have expected that if all of those things were going to be the Mark Carney I expected, then maybe Mark Carney was going to say something that I wouldn&#39;t expect Mark Carney to say. And I didn&#39;t get that either. And that&#39;s what I was hoping for. And I wasn&#39;t expecting some big policy announcement that was like left-wing populist being like, whoa, but</div>

          <div class="said">That&#39;s fine. And it seems very clear to me that Mark Carney was willing to do the carbon carbon tax stuff, but didn&#39;t want that to be the story. And so he made the conscious decision to background rather than foreground, knowing that that was inevitably going to be there. And that makes perfect sense to me. We talk about this all the time.

And he very actively did not draw attention to it. So that was fine to me. I also think that the Q&amp;A coming forward with such obvious questions because it wasn&#39;t in the content allowed him to have some sort of sense. Let&#39;s put it this way. If he answered all the obvious questions, you&#39;re going to get the non-obvious questions in</div>

So there is a benefit to having a few things held back that you know, like any competent reporters can say, well, I wanted to ask this, but I got to ask this because somebody else is going to do it. And in fact, I thought that his weakest answer answer on the Q&amp;A was his last, where he seemed to get a little bit snippy about conflicts of interest and how he was going to be managing them. I think a better answer would have been like, you know, I&#39;ve taken these steps. I&#39;m open to other steps. Because obviously, I know as Prime Minister, I will have all of these things put on me here, instead of saying like, well, I answered that question, which was basically how he got to end his Q&amp;A.

          <div class="said">I think the human Wall is pretty played out at this point. I understand why people went to it. It creates a dynamic background. It allows you to showcase the diversity of your campaign, whether it be old, young, white, brown, whatever it may be. I get that. But I also think we&#39;ve seen it so long that it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s like it&#39;s the same as having nothing behind you at this point, if I&#39;m going to be frank. And so I do agree with Zane that the Canadian flag would have been a stronger visual. But I also think it would have been more consistent with what I at least believe is is Mark Carney&#39;s best plan, not just for the liberal leadership, but then going into a general election? And, and I ultimately, you guys both know me, I&#39;m a person who says brand answers all questions, all questions, the setup of a room, how you present yourself on literature, the words you use. And if you&#39;re not clear on your brand, then you&#39;re going to make mistakes like the human wall, because it&#39;s just like, well, I guess, I don&#39;t know, isn&#39;t that what we do? Right? And you say, no our brand is canada our brand is always canada we don&#39;t put things in front of the canadian flag we don&#39;t block out the maple leaf we&#39;re fucking team canada and i i think that that that was the real style miss in terms of the flag when when it comes to the human wall yeah</div>

          <div class="said">Considered? Yeah, like, I would have considered it. I mean, especially if you saw that reaction and the view count and everything going well, I would have taken that and maybe adopted to the Corey or version of the Corey strategy, strategy, which is also the me strategy, which is also the Bernie strategy, which is find a mic somewhere and officially declare it on home soil, and then get going with the first event, fireside chat somewhere, fundraiser elsewhere, maybe a PNP hit with David Cochran and Vashie Capellos on Powerplay the same day sort of thing, declaring that you&#39;re in and just get going, right? Try to find different mediums. Like, it&#39;s not like Canada was refusing to run the Jon Stewart clip. And it&#39;s not like Canadians weren&#39;t going to see the Jon Stewart clip. And John Stewart clip. So in some ways, you already had that launch, so to speak. I do get the desire to choose Edmonton. And I don&#39;t know if it was a sword or a shield move, Edmonton, whether it was to allow Freeland to not do the same thing, because she&#39;s also got Western roots, or if it was like, we&#39;re going to do this on her own, or if Mark&#39;s got plans to run there, which, by the way, I think would be crazy from a seat perspective. But maybe Edmonton was too attractive, too romanticized a story. And you guys were trying to figure out what to do with it, when to go with it. But I think there would have been time for that. And in fact, I would have actually argued to show the hockey boards or do it in the actual, and logistically, I&#39;m just making shit up, what do I know, what was possible. But I almost lost sight of the analogy and its connection five seconds into the speech. And many people who see the clips might just see, okay, a mid-sized room that Mark Carney launched in somewhere in Edmonton and not necessarily get the through line, unless it was more visually represented that way so just a few thoughts cory</div>

          <div class="said">It doesn&#39;t add up to an A, because he doesn&#39;t have time to prove potential. That&#39;s just my very simple point here. Potential is great, Corey, but this guy doesn&#39;t have time. He He launched the general election campaign yesterday with a C speech. And that&#39;s okay, because it&#39;s Mark Carney, and he went a great amount of curve in his first ever political speech. But it&#39;s also the most important, like, he&#39;s going for something unprecedented here. I&#39;m saying that without hyperbole. He wants to be prime minister of this country, having never run for elected office before, not being a sitting MP. So he&#39;s going for something unprecedented, as much as I&#39;d want to give him potential points, and Corey could sell me on it. He very well may have. Um,</div>

They&#39;ve got a couple of points, one of which is that that she&#39;s the only one with the courage to have stabbed Justin Trudeau and told him to leave. She&#39;s the only one that she saved Canadians billions of dollars of potential payments with those worker benefits sort of thing. She knew it was bad policy, she got rid of them, right? I&#39;m the one, this would be her saying this, I&#39;m the one who was able to do that, in addition to the fact she&#39;s got the respective caucus, etc. So she&#39;s had a decent week in some ways, because she&#39;s building up to a message. You can see what she&#39;s going to get to. This is obviously like inside baseball, but you can actually see her saying, I&#39;m the reason Justin Trudeau is no longer there. I&#39;m the change candidate. If you want more of the same, that&#39;s Mark Carney. It&#39;s the same team behind Mark Carney. I&#39;m the change. You can see a lane for her.

Justin Trudeau is able to take the moral high ground, hit Daniel Smith on the head for two, three days in a row. Looked like he has a pretty decent week.</div>

And then Pierre Polyev, his inability to pivot this week, his inability to give clear, simple answers to what seem to be clear, simple questions. Did that open up more questions about what Pierre Polyev&#39;s relationship is with Canada and the Canadian flag, Pierre Polyev&#39;s not had a great week. And in addition to that, he&#39;s potentially not going to have a great couple of weeks, and him and Jenny Byrne can&#39;t pivot as the Liberals ax the tax on themselves and understand what the future of this election looks like with a ballot box question that he may not get to control. He&#39;s been historically amazing at controlling and being consistent. The fact is, the question may not be in his favor, as we talked about actually just yesterday. You guys have told me, And I agree with you that the question on the U.S., Trump, tariffs, et cetera, not amazing questions for Pierre Palliev if that&#39;s what a general election ends up being.</div>
