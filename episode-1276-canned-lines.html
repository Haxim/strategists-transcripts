            <span class="text">i just started the segment i was already like done the title so thank you carter for chiming in cory hogan i want to talk about i want to talk about responses to attack ads first of all we&#39;ve talked about polling uh and for those new to the segment i introduce an item that we see happen often in our political universe it could be a line of messaging It could be a political tactic, it could be a strategy. And I question the premise, why the fuck do we still do this? Corey, there&#39;s two parts to this. Number one, as politicians, we&#39;ve talked about this from the polling perspective, politicians will often refuse to say that they look at polling, that they&#39;ve seen the recent polling, that they&#39;ve heard about the polling, that there is a poll out there. They seem to have a similar manner about attack ads or ads about them out there, so to speak, which seems even more inexcusable because attack ads don&#39;t take a lot of absorption. They&#39;re usually 15 to 30 seconds of shit about you. You probably want to know what people are saying about you. Corey, politicians usually refuse to say that they&#39;ve watched them. And then they always have opinions about them. Their opinions usually range from, I haven&#39;t seen them, but comma, you know, I want to run a positive campaign. I, you know, we need more and more civility. We need, you know, I&#39;m not here to get into the mud. I&#39;m here to kind of take the moral high ground. Corey, the question is, why the fuck do we still do this, knowing the new rules of politics? And let me show you our most recent example of both of those things, Corey. Bonnie Crombie. The Ontario PCs are running attack ads against her. We know that they are. They&#39;ve put money behind these attack ads. These spots seem relatively generic in terms of, you know, this is someone who&#39;s an insider, wants to cash in her paycheck. The content of them is kind of almost irrelevant to a certain degree, because we&#39;re not going into an ad analysis. That&#39;s not what I want to do here. But a response, Corey, highlights exactly the two things I&#39;m talking about. Number one, I haven&#39;t seen them. But number two, man, do I have opinions about them? And she goes down the path of civility and trying to be above the fray, etc. Corey, this is a tried and tested script. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an effective one. Why the fuck do we? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, let&#39;s just start with the basic vibe around attack ads, because that is where this starts. And that&#39;s that you&#39;re supposed to not like them. politicians always tut tut the other other person&#39;s attack ads they&#39;ll always describe their own attack ads as not attack ads no i&#39;m just raising important contrasts important questions whatever the situation might be and so uh you know and that is somewhat rooted on this very shallow if you polled somebody i guess what i&#39;m trying to say is if you polled the electorate they would say they don&#39;t like attack ads doesn&#39;t</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not effective we&#39;ve talked about this this a hundred times. And we&#39;ll talk about it a hundred more. So in some ways, the easiest answer to your question, Zane, is they say they don&#39;t like attack ads because they know voters don&#39;t like attack ads. And it&#39;s the easiest way that they can kind of align themselves with it and tut-tut and get like an easy point on them.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But to kind of expand on it a little bit and talk about what you were saying in terms of, you know, this notion, like they&#39;re supposed to have not seen this 15 second clip about themselves like yeah look if if that&#39;s your approach to life if if you live a life of active information avoidance to the point where you won&#39;t watch a 15 second hit on you about your job i mean you&#39;re not very good at your job and i don&#39;t really trust you to do anything you&#39;re probably the kind of person who doesn&#39;t open bank statements to come to your house too right so oh like i sort of agree like it&#39;s kind of a dumb thing for a politician to say but nobody&#39;s going to take them to task on it because who&#39;s going to stand up and you know only the person who put out the attack ad is going to stand up and say the attack ad&#39;s good and they&#39;re going to say it&#39;s good because it&#39;s not even an attack ad it&#39;s raising important questions it&#39;s bringing contrast for it&#39;s just her record it&#39;s not an attack ad right carter</span>

And I feel like we see that quite often, right? Where there&#39;s like a charge on the table, there&#39;s these attack ads, I haven&#39;t watched it. I&#39;m rejecting the premise of the fact that we can discuss the content of this attack ad, right? I&#39;m putting that aside. Rather, this is about civility. Versus actually saying that, you know, that concept of rejecting the premise should be used sparingly, and that there is political value about going at something directly, using Using that and saying, you know what, they said this about this attack. Fuck these. This is not true. Here&#39;s what could happen. I&#39;m kind of curious if that also plays into it, because, you know, the safe opportunity now seems to be one person said X.

Here&#39;s the new bullet points that you start responding with when someone says, have you seen this new attack ad about you? What would your two or three bullet points be, Carter, for politicians going forward?

What are your couple bullet points? Carter&#39;s saying, yes, I&#39;ve seen it, and then you kind of have a couple. He has a tree that he&#39;s created. Are you scrapping this?

Let&#39;s just start there. right your goal when this comes out is what is it to to get points on the other person is it to rebut the charge is it to frame out who you are and you know i think that that&#39;s maybe different situation to situation but i wonder if the rules aren&#39;t different can we pause</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

This is not official Corey Hogan advice on this podcast. But if this is what you want to do, if the whole idea is judo, don&#39;t you just want to swing for the ever-loving fucking fences then? Like, wouldn&#39;t the strategy be just to go totally hard as a motherfucker against them? Like, if every accusation is a confession, why didn&#39;t she, if you want to do this, why didn&#39;t she just say, like, he couldn&#39;t have been projecting more unless he called me the less talented brother in a family of drug dealers, right?

            <span class="text">but okay but like so this is the this is the hypothetical i&#39;m like i&#39;m just trying to take that logic to its conclusion like Like if the whole idea is like a judo hit where you come back at them with three times the heat that they came at you, then give them three times the heat, right? But like I&#39;m not actually sure that&#39;s what your goal is in this situation, right? The goal is to kind of minimalize and move on. But why is the goal always to minimalize and move on or to neutralize? Why is that the goal? Because it&#39;s not your message box. Because you don&#39;t repeat the charge, right? Yeah, you never do. Carter&#39;s right. right it&#39;s not your message box and you&#39;re sitting there and all of a sudden you know it&#39;s like the classic like make them deny they&#39;re a pig fucker right would she have been better served by 30 minutes of her explaining how she wasn&#39;t in it for the money</span>

That&#39;s the lane you&#39;ve chosen for strategic reasons. I don&#39;t even care what the strategic reasons are. You&#39;ve decided, you know what? Yes. How do you best prep someone to do that?

            <span class="text">so you know it&#39;s if you can deliver the can line in a way that looks uncanned that would be kind of the next best option the option above that is like it&#39;s uncanned and and you are reacting directly to something that was said in the room you&#39;ve picked up a piece like you know generally you want to go in this space but you&#39;re You&#39;re not too worried about the specific words, right? That, in my opinion, is the best way to do something like that because it affords you the most defensive options going forward, and it&#39;s also going to just be more appealing to people.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, how do you know – and this is related to what Cordy is talking about – how do you know if you have or are working with a politician that you can provide that runway to, that grace to? And we often kind of say, let X be X, right? Right. Like let, you know, West Wing, let Bartlett be Bartlett or let like, you know, let this person be who they are. How do you know who if you have that person that they can hit, so to speak? Like this is kind of like a question that that I think often there&#39;s a lot of regret in politics that I&#39;ve heard from politicians or political staffers being like, fuck, we control them too much. We didn&#39;t let them be who they are. We hear that regret all the time, like all the time. um how do you know if you&#39;ve got someone that you that you should allow to just do what they need to do even if it&#39;s one out of every where whatever is a miss well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well you speak with them and if they come across like a fucking idiot when you&#39;re speaking to them don&#39;t let them speak to other people so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so so i mean quite literally i mean some politicians you need to script a lot of stuff for because their on the fly game is just so bad uh and often like will result in terrible outcomes but you compare that to a nahed nenshi who&#39;s on the fly game was world class like you don&#39;t have to script nahed nenshi no one scripted nahed nenshi nahed nenshi did and said everything that needed to be done and said uh in the moment because he knew what needed to be said in the moment better than anybody else so you don&#39;t script him because he&#39;s already killing it um other politicians you have to be a lot more prescriptive and uh you just hope that they don&#39;t get caught on something you didn&#39;t prep um because that&#39;s that&#39;s where you are so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so yes carter i agree with your answer and cory but like my my sort of question is really like on the cusp yes you&#39;re gonna have a class of politician that you&#39;re like this person i&#39;m not gonna limit public exposure and script every line and you&#39;re gonna have a class of politician that&#39;s like improv genius world debate star of course i&#39;m gonna let them do whatever the fuck they want the nenshi example then it&#39;s the politicians that might have that muscle corey that might have that potential that if you gave them the runway they could deliver that&#39;s what i&#39;m effectively talking about that the regret comes from a lot of folks being like they may have had that next year we just never let them go for it yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah well but here&#39;s the here&#39;s the thing actually carter&#39;s point is a great one because you tend to get um extreme personalities in politics right and uh you there is the successful politician model who is not super</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">super improv genius right there are politicians who can just stick to the script and frankly sticking to the script is often the better strategy right oh it&#39;s so great if you can find somebody who can stick to the script and deliver the sense like compassion however if they need to yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah like Like, again, if we&#39;re going to tier things, like, sure, I&#39;ll take an improv genius over stick to the script, but I&#39;ll take stick to the script over anything else. Really? Right? Like, pretty good usually sticks to the script. Oh, yeah. Because, Zane, the thing about sticking to the script, the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the thing about sticking to the script is you are going to benefit from the knowledge and the skills of everybody around you. But even</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s over. I get it, Carter. But what about this X factor of authenticity and personality that the person who almost always sticks to the script but trades that off for a bit of persona or personality, whichever one you want to say, or a bit of authenticity and personal brand, so to speak, stick to the script to me, yeah, competent, can deliver, probably has a bit of depth because they&#39;ve been briefed well. all they take the job seriously but the other elements they don&#39;t have cory</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well let&#39;s use nahid nenshi as an example here right because the thing about on the fly game is it changes over time and people&#39;s response to it changes over time</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">celebrity arc to politics right and that is often tied to that speaks from the heart off the cuff just says it like it is but a that feels different in opposition than government what comes off as a god why can&#39;t this government understand common sense comes off as fuck you little people i&#39;m the guy in charge now once you&#39;re in government uh if you talk about this notion of uh you know you just learn too much in government so you get you become so so detail laden uh if you&#39;re a mayor or if you&#39;re a premier and then all of a sudden you can&#39;t help yourself you just know way too much and that on the fly game really suffers as a result and you know ultimately also this thing is about confidence too and if you go out there and you make a comment and it doesn&#39;t work so much and then your game kind of stab you know it can</span>

            <span class="text">the problem in politics, I think more often than not as people deviated from the script because they start to believe the script, they start to believe like, Oh, it says here, I&#39;m the super fucking genius on page three. And I enter stage, right. And I say the uplifting speech that Bartlett would give, right? Yeah. But we wrote you that speech. Yeah. Bartlett was a fictional character, numb nuts.

So, you know, politicians with their improv moments tend to improv in front of safe crowds. And if it kills, then yeah, they&#39;ll take it to the show, they&#39;ll take it to the matinee.

            <span class="text">Well, we&#39;ve talked a lot about the idea of communicating around vaccinations, and I can almost see why you&#39;d remove specific things that might push you know create a backfire effect but politicians shouldn&#39;t be directing communications at a public health level if that was decided by a public health professional who&#39;d done research uh like you know we did at h and k or in many other different places then i&#39;d be fine with it but i think that it in terms of politics it&#39;s going to generate um you know more anger from people who are already angry with danielle smith but no nobody who likes her is going to be impacted at all so</span>

And so in some ways, this story is so tied to the ill will so many have towards the UCP on this particular matter. There is no trust that the UCP and Daniel Smith even believe in vaccines, let alone are willing to promote vaccines in kind of a regular, consistent, public health friendly way.
