        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the federal budget and Doug Ford's tear-soaked apology to Ontarians. Was this an "election" budget? Has Doug Ford stopped the bleeding of support? And what does a Peanut Buster Parfait taste like?

But worry not, because I know Corey Hogan wants to take one on our federal budget. But let&#39;s set some context, of course. This past week, it seems like eons ago, the federal budget was tabled. The biggest budget since the Second World War. The centerpiece of it, national child care, of course. We&#39;ll talk about that in some detail. We also have this greening of the economy, the green transition, as it&#39;s been called by the Trudeau government in the past. We also have $100 billion of new spending, no real pathway to balance, and a deficit that sits at a grand total of just north of $350 billion. That is correct. You heard that right, $350 billion. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you first, like I always do on these big meaty topics, which is where do you want to take us? Where do you want to go? And what was your top line feeling? I want to say thoughts, but feeling when you heard this come out on, I don&#39;t even know, was it Monday? Last Monday.</div>

          <div class="said">So I think that there were two competing narratives that were trying to come out of the budget deliberations. One competing narrative was this is the end of the country. We are outspending ourselves into oblivion, and it is all over. And that narrative was, of course, championed by O&#39;Toole, and that was supposed to be his narrative coming out of it. And the other was kind of a narrative of what do I get? And what do I get was probably headlined by the</div>

You only get the chance to do these, you know, remaking Canadian society initiatives, remaking Alberta society, remaking British Columbia, Ontario, doesn&#39;t matter. You only get to take those chances when you are in the midst of something horrible. So when, for example, when you&#39;re in the midst of an economic downturn in Alberta, based on the elimination of oil and gas, this is the time when you get to do something. So you have to do something. If you wanted to remake something, you do it now. Now, you already have an enormous deficit. There&#39;s nothing you&#39;re going to be able to do about it. What&#39;s spending an extra, I can&#39;t remember the specific amount, was it $400 billion over $300 billion over how many years? $30 billion?

But when you&#39;re able to provide a deficit that is reduced from your your fall projections by so much, even that kind of made this is a big deficit. But Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s accusations that this is running up the red ink and is jeopardizing, you know, Canadian future really rang a little bit hollow because we had all kind of had our expectations set by that fall update. So Carter says it&#39;s a master class in political opportunism. I also think it&#39;s a master class in political framing, because in what other world do you get to spend so much money, go so much into debt and have people say, oh, pretty good, pretty good job, guys. Great work. I mean, this is an interesting budget. It&#39;s like Christmas in more ways than one. Not only do they get to give out an awful lot of things, but it&#39;s a green and red budget.

I want to talk about the response by O&#39;Toole. You guys both mentioned it in abstractions, but I want to talk about his framing on a response. sponsor, at least the headline that it&#39;s been circulating on the O&#39;Toole framing. But I want to talk to you guys about the centerpiece first. And let&#39;s talk about child care. So the number that was floating around was at $2 billion prior to being like, they&#39;re going to invest $2 billion in child care. And a lot of us were head scratching, like, how the heck does that work? Turns out it&#39;s $30. So we&#39;re off all of our speculators and leaks are off by a factor of, I don&#39;t know, fucking 10, plus maybe 11, maybe 12. Who knows, Corey? Who knows math? is it 15 i think it&#39;s 15 uh we were off by a factor of 15 um but at the same time cory is that the right centerpiece here because there&#39;s also this recovery element which surprisingly and weirdly kind of gets lost like that we&#39;re extending the sues we&#39;re extending you know these supports that were all</div>

It&#39;s also a reminder of the economic malaise that we&#39;re in. And I&#39;m sure the government would much more like to talk about what&#39;s coming and it&#39;s positive rather than here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to help mop up still the economic turmoil that has been wrought by COVID-19, which, by the way, is still going on, lest anybody forget.</div>

But the politics almost province by province become fascinating. And it creates all sorts of different dynamics and i think not just on net but but very much in almost all cases if not all cases they favor the liberal government they put the conservatives into awkward positions so let&#39;s just use this as an example uh you have jason kenney now here in alberta saying well just give me the check i don&#39;t want your child care program i want the money and i want alberta to be able to run its own child care program from a point of view rooted in constitutionalism, not a crazy notion.

So as much as I said there wasn&#39;t any real wedge in the budget, I guess I should say there was no unexpected wedge, and certainly not one where the Conservatives could stand up on Budget Day and say, yes, I&#39;m damn opposed to child care.

And old news, it doesn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t release the same thing indefinitely. Now, I will note that Trudeau and every government ever announces things multiple times, but But you don&#39;t get the same impact. The impact that he got from bringing in a new program that was, as Corey has articulated, it has wins across the country in different ways and in different fashions, both political as well as the pragmatic benefit for the people who are actually impacted. This is a good news story that he gets to own and control. It was brought in by the first female finance minister to bring in the budget. Um, these, these were meaningful words at a meaningful time with symbolism all worked in. Uh, so from my point of view, that, that was a, that was a slam dunk and it was also the right emphasis. You, you, you have to put the emphasis on what people want to hear. Um, and this was a good piece that people wanted to hear. It&#39;s a very easy story because I, you know, we, we talked a lot about this in the last episode. What is the story and can I see myself in that story? story.

Well, he can&#39;t do it without the premiers. And so it becomes a lot harder to suggest that this is some sort of wild, outrageous policy if all of a sudden you&#39;ve got all of the provinces lining up to say, yeah, that sounds pretty good to me. It makes it seem an awful lot more in the mainstream. stream it&#39;s not as though there&#39;s an awful lot of liberal governments across this country right now in the provinces so so it really does kind of create this um this kind of band of brothers and uh unfortunately it&#39;s all brothers right now i don&#39;t think we have any female premiers right now but uh it uh it makes it less likely to be something that you can point to and say is just totally outrageous out there policy because it&#39;s rooted in requiring consensus to move forward So it also seems to – I don&#39;t think the intention was directly to rebut this charge by Aaron O&#39;Toole, but we talked about this a few weeks ago. It&#39;s pretty clear what Aaron O&#39;Toole is trying to frame this election out as. And the way Justin Trudeau brought in child care here or proposes to bring in child care makes that charge harder to stick, right? And that&#39;s not worth nothing either.</div>

Risks overall, the deficit number, the spending, you know, what could go wrong for them as they introduce this with that six-month lag that if you&#39;re on Team Trudeau right now, you&#39;re trying to either de-risk or or try to ensure, frankly, doesn&#39;t happen to begin with? If you&#39;re in that room, helping the Prime Minister and Katie Telford and that team to say, here&#39;s the priorities of things, great job this week.

          <div class="said">is that people become very, very quickly accustomed to that which they didn&#39;t have before. I think the second risk is actually the more dangerous risk, and that is that we are creating an opportunity for a structural deficit to appear at the federal level, where the expenditures, the planned expenditures for the federal government just simply far and away outstrip the federal revenues. We&#39;ve been in a structural deficit in Alberta basically since 2007, because that&#39;s when we lost natural gas royalties. And once Once you&#39;re in a structural deficit, it is incredibly hard to get out of it without imagining some sort of a revenue change or significant expenditure change. And governments generally don&#39;t do very well with either of those things. Increasing expenses, super easy. Decreasing revenue, also super easy. But balancing the two just</div>

Now, we could have an intellectual discussion about whether or not that matters or not. And that&#39;s always an interesting conversation. But I think that let&#39;s play the game as though it will matter to the Canadian population at some point. And I think that if that is the case, then this could very easily lead to a much more significant structural deficit than one that we&#39;ve seen at the federal level for a long time.</div>

These provinces, these demographics, women more than men in this case, men more than women in this case. And as a result of all of these sheets that kind of gave us that summary of who it benefits, you could basically learn a lot. Like there&#39;s not a lot of mysteries still to come in the budget as a result. I&#39;m sure there are some. I&#39;m sure there will be – there is money that&#39;s been identified as just like almost like not – Like plush fundy almost. Well, yeah. I mean that&#39;s kind of the negative way to look at it.

And if they&#39;re like, whatever, that&#39;s cool. That&#39;s a useful program. Could that give you the justification to perhaps spend more? Another $100 heading into, I&#39;m just making that number up, but another big program that maybe you&#39;ve held back and now you you feel like, damn it, the political will might be there to announce that on the run-up to the election. So, Carter, from strategist perspective, what would you perhaps advise the Trudeau government? And let&#39;s just assume a fall election. We don&#39;t know more than that.

It&#39;s going to be $20 million for Calgary, and you actually can point to the fields that they&#39;re going to change, or you&#39;re going to point to the arenas that they&#39;re going to build. That stuff matters to people. $100 billion is meaningless. It&#39;s just a big, big number that people can&#39;t understand. Pointing to projects that can be done for less, that kind of small money, small ball in my community is actually very, very valuable.

          <div class="said">Well, Carter&#39;s suggestion of the local recovery program is interesting to me. I&#39;m not as big a fan of small investments as Stephen, but I do like small investments that tell a bigger story and start to roll up. And it&#39;s not so much that you spent money in my neighborhood, but you spent it on child care, because you&#39;re investing in social infrastructure. Oh, yeah, this is the government that invests in social infrastructure. I think that has more value than just kind of, you know, putting putting a new parking lot in the curling rink, because I think the expectation over time has become, well, the next government&#39;s going to do stuff like that, too, who gives a shit, right? So it&#39;s investments that you think the other guys wouldn&#39;t necessarily make, is my belief is probably money that&#39;s better spent. in the purely crassly political context, not in the context of what&#39;s</div>

He apologized on Thursday morning in a press conference days after his government faced intense backlash for introducing a number of additional COVID-19 restrictions that were not recommended by health experts. And then, of course, nixed that same weekend. Ford was isolating, another factor around this, around paid sick leave. So Ford himself was isolating at his late mother&#39;s house in Etobicoke after a staff member tested positive, said that he was very sorry. Simply put, we got it wrong. We made a mistake.

Doug Ford instead had confusion and chaos, and people were responding exceptionally negatively. I like the apology. I think that apologies work in general. I came up during the Ralph Klein—he didn&#39;t cry. Ralph Klein never cried when he apologized.

And when you look at the United States, you can see it sort of seesaws back and forth, who&#39;s the money leader. But the conventional wisdom for a long time has been that right-wing political parties have a natural fundraising edge, You know, their economic message appeals to wealthier Albertans or the types of people who get riled up by these situations are more likely to be in the conservative camp. And so the idea that the NDP could not just out-fundraise the conservatives, the UCP, but double them, but lap them, I mean, that&#39;s really significant. And it&#39;s really significant for a number of different reasons. First of all, obviously money helps you win elections. Let&#39;s just call the obvious one right there. Second, and that&#39;s part of why we&#39;re talking about it right now, the optics of it are – they&#39;re dramatic. It doesn&#39;t look like, yeah, they&#39;re</div>

          <div class="said">they&#39;re kind of close. Let&#39;s put it this way. The UCP is closer to raising as much money as the Alberta party, a third party with no seats in our legislature, than they are to raising the amount of money that the NDP had, right? I mean, that&#39;s really pretty damning when you&#39;re the governing party. And the other thing, and let&#39;s call this 2A, the last time this happened last year, the UCP sort of brushed it off as, well, we&#39;re the government. We weren&#39;t fundraising during COVID. We were focused on different things. So no big deal, the NDP.</div>

          <div class="said">Our leader is working day in, day out in the legislature, in the halls of government to keep Albertans safe. And it&#39;s not surprising that in an environment like that, where the opposition leader can go around to fundraisers, can work phone calls, can try to work Albertans up and scare them, you know, a threat to public health, but to the benefit of their coffers. It&#39;s not surprising in that environment that the NDP would be successful in fundraising. But at the end of the day, Albertans know the UCP have their back, which is why we expect these fundraising numbers will turn around once we&#39;re out of this moment. And we can have an honest conversation about these things. And our leader can be out there talking to Albertans in a way that we know resonates with them.</div>

Perhaps you go so far as even to say somewhat unscrupulous money. And we&#39;ve got to be three times as good as them to be in the game with them. And you&#39;ve got to create that sense of, you know, sweat on the back of people&#39;s necks. Like, that&#39;s great. We&#39;re at 1.2 million. It&#39;s great that only 600,000 came came in, you know, relatively, we&#39;re doing fine in that sense. But this isn&#39;t just about Albertans. This is about all of the levers they feel totally comfortable pulling that they shouldn&#39;t pull. Corey, would you characterize that as embracing an underdog status?</div>

Yes, we have this money, but it&#39;s not enough. So you are trying to give two messages at the same time. One is kind of the, there&#39;s really only one game in town message, but the other one is, but it&#39;s still not enough. We need more.
