It was 22 pitches. Let me tell you something. The previous record was 21. I was on the edge of my seat watching that at-bat. Plus, all the fans in the stands were losing their minds. the 26 of them that were so many foul balls to</span>

I feel like this episode needs to be a holiday special because this is, of course, the Persian New Year coming up on March 21st. Navroz, which is a big deal to my parents, but my people. I was going to say my parents and my people. So I don&#39;t know. No, you guys just rejected my claim for a holiday special, and here we are. But you&#39;re not Persian.</span>

            <span class="text">Nah, but we&#39;re Muslim. Listen, okay? This is where the light adoption and the crossover on the Venn diagram of culture and religion comes in. Maybe you&#39;ll sit down once, and I&#39;ll kind of give you a lecture. Carter will join me.</span>

So I don&#39;t think that the hunger was the problem. I think that just being a racist was, in fact, the problem, exacerbated perhaps by hunger, but I suspect it was just deep-seated racism that has come to the forefront.</span>

            <span class="text">Excellent diagnosis by Dr. Carter there. We&#39;ll appreciate that, Stephen. Our next headline comes to us from CNN. China concerned about human rights abuses in Australia. Australia&#39;s detention Detention sentient. Sorry, I can&#39;t even say it. Corey, your laughter is getting in the way of me finishing the headline. You&#39;re really jumping on it. Okay, here we go. China concerned about human rights. I could have stopped there.

They&#39;re starting the trials for the two Michaels here in a couple of weeks. Canadian officials are not being invited to those trials. The same battle that exists between Canada and China exists but times 10 with Australia. And you&#39;re just seeing that ramp up. And the Chinese government has no problem throwing completely hypocritical statements against the wall just to see if they stick. And they stuck enough to wind up in your head. So it&#39;s extremely frustrating that China gets to play by</span>

I want to get your perspective on this. I mean, from a communication standpoint, do you feel like the good— I&#39;m using good and bad, and I don&#39;t know if those are the right terms. They aren&#39;t. But the good of these vaccine selfies, the fact that people are taking them, and the movement building that can happen around them outweigh the downsides or the negatives? I</span>

            <span class="text">now there are two issues at hand here one of them is whether this is actually effective or if people just say gross I don&#39;t like the selfie and they&#39;re not particularly interested but there are people who actually have aversions to needles and generally speaking how you deal with an aversion is you kind of introduce it to them slowly so in a way I sort of think that these selfies would make people feel a little bit better about that, but I&#39;m not sure if that is just wishful thinking by me or whether that particular therapy would be useful in this case. But I guess the point I want to underline here is that this is actually going to take a marriage of communications expertise and medical expertise. This is what we would call kind of like an interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary problem that needs to be resolved. So Carter should get off his high horse too. Everybody should stand on common ground and we should try to figure this fucking thing out using the best evidence available.</span>

It also says that vaccine scarcity and vaccine jealousy will reduce the vaccine hesitancy that is a big problem in our society. Doctors should do their own, should listen to their own advice and look at the actual research that exists from communicators. It doesn&#39;t have to, we don&#39;t have to ask doctors to do a study.

And Bigfoot, a cartoon character, goes to Alaska and gets into a fight with some oil men who are like these cartoon villains who want to use bombs to blow up land to get just the oil to pool, I guess, or something like that. Anyhow, this flop of a movie that was never seen by that many people all of a sudden raised the ire of the Canadian Energy Center, the war room that Alberta set up. And they decided to go to the ramparts and take on a mythical character for failing to be an accurate portrayal of things. As if that&#39;s not absurd enough, then</span>

It&#39;s a French-Belgian company that has produced this film, sold its rights to Netflix. Jason Kenney still calls it a Hollywood production that depicts oil companies as, quote unquote, wanting to murder children to oppose environmental progress. progress. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start with that very simple question. I mean, I usually don&#39;t write much down, and I haven&#39;t in this case either. I have why, what, why.</span>

Your war room put something out. Even up until last week, I was talking to you guys about, okay, what is Tom Olson, the head of this war room, doing to justify the existence of this petition to the premier? And how hard is this risk getting slapped? Well, it turns out not very hard because the premier is doubling down on it. So tell us why, Carter. What&#39;s going on from a strategy perspective for this premier?</span>

Never mind that we&#39;re building the pipeline in Canada. Canada. So the money that was spent in, you know, in the United States seems to have been better spent. But whatever, these things are, they don&#39;t rely on truth. What they do is they rely on the audience desire to actually have the thing be true.

But if there is a thesis of this show, it&#39;s that we can peel back and explain what some of the strategies that drive these conversations are. And I hope people realize that the conversation about Bigfoot is absolutely tied to the fact that it is easier to talk about culture war bullshit than it is about real problems and real challenging facing the good people of Alberta.

But let&#39;s talk about the dead cat strategy. Let&#39;s go back to the 2015 election for a second. There&#39;s nowhere intended to go, but let&#39;s do it. In that election, that strategy by Crosby and Harper and Jenny Byrne was played in the 11th hour, right? This was very much like the, and if you guys recall, this was the barbaric cultural practices hotline. This was the niqab stuff. This was let&#39;s wedge here, wedge there.

I think it was a very useful thing to talk about the next I also think it&#39;s useful when you&#39;re under attack like that for you to turn it against your attackers and basically say, hey, yeah, I mean, they would love if we had Bigfoot movies out there. To the ramparts we go. And it was pretty clear to me that the UCP MLAs were sort of enjoying the culture war fight this week. I suspect it&#39;s something that&#39;s uniting them during very disharmonious times to be able to stick it in the eye of their opponents and their perceived opponents who might like this. The thing that I want to stress to you is this doesn&#39;t even need to be a winning issue for it to be a winning issue.

Now, we&#39;ve talked about kind of the failing of war metaphor before in politics, but I think this actually works because you still need the strategic general back saying, OK, how are we going to win this war in two years? Because it&#39;s the election date and we&#39;re two years away from being in the middle of an election. in Alberta. It&#39;s the election that matters, not Bigfoot</span>

All of those things are hurting real Albertans right now, and I&#39;m not sure they&#39;re going to be prepared to blame someone else other than the government that&#39;s making them happen today.</span>

This is where companies are going to headquarter. There are some obvious questions that flow from this, especially if you are framing this as a merger like Jason Kenney is attempting to do here. Well, if it&#39;s a merger, why wouldn&#39;t you move your headquarters to this wonderful low-tax jurisdiction you&#39;ve been talking about? Why is it staying in Toronto? Well,</span>

There&#39;s been a lot of consolidation in the oil industry, and Synovus has been one of the people who&#39;s been hoovering up the other companies around here. When companies do that, they tend to find efficiencies. They say, okay, well, I don&#39;t probably need two investor</span>

So what we have is we have a representative democracy. There&#39;s all kinds of reasons for doing representative democracy, but recall is essentially a form of direct democracy where the people themselves have a say in the issues of the day. And both of them are important parts of democracy. They just don&#39;t go well together.

If you were to start making it even shorter through recall, I think you&#39;d get worse government overall. So it&#39;s popular. It&#39;s not.

Like, you wouldn&#39;t want somebody to be recalled perpetually for all of the reasons you&#39;ve articulated so nicely.
