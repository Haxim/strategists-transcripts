The Canadian government has spent irresponsibly in its attempt to fend off economic disruption caused by COVID-19, according to Stephen Harper. Quote, it&#39;s not a good reaction. It&#39;s been overkill, Harper said on the podcast American Optimist, which was released earlier this week. Quote, this is bad macroeconomic policy on an enormous scale. The podcast launched about a month ago and bills itself as an alternative to fear, cynicism and zero thumb thinking in mainstream media, according to the CBC. You see, Carter,</span>

It would have kind of been in this vein of we were we would have spent less. We would have not spent on you. We would have spent on macroeconomic policy, all things that Stephen Harper indicated. How bad was this appearance for Harper and maybe not even for Harper himself because he&#39;s done with it, but for the conservatives? Well,</span>

So he, you know, he doesn&#39;t make it easier on O&#39;Toole by standing up and saying something like this, because there are a lot of Canadians that agree with this. And O&#39;Toole has basically said we wouldn&#39;t have done it this badly, but I don&#39;t think that he has said that they wouldn&#39;t have done it quite so much. This is Stephen Harper continuing to exert a shadow over O&#39;Toole that makes it hard for O&#39;Toole to be the leader that&#39;s going to be elected the next prime minister.

But I don&#39;t think that Stephen Harper would have been much different than Justin Trudeau, but we&#39;ll never know. And him wanting to portray himself as different than Justin is all part of his desire to rebuild himself as an image. He&#39;s writing his legacy. But keep in mind, this is the guy who spent us out of the 2008 fiscal downturn.</span>

Without fiscal course correction, Ottawa could be posting deficits until 2070, says the PBO. And a new permanent federal if new permanent federal spending programs are drastically weakened, fiscal positions in the province has substantially extended the timeline for return to balance, says the report from the parliamentary budget officer. Corey, we&#39;ve talked about this before in two prongs. Number one, where debt and deficit rank in the mind of Canadians. They&#39;ve been at historic lows, is the summary. We&#39;ve also seen the volatility in issue-based polling heading into this election, where pandemic was first, it is now ninth or fifth, depending on which pollster you&#39;re reading and following. But secondly, we&#39;ve also talked about the parliamentary budget officer just jumping in, throwing these hot grenades into the mix and being like, hey, and they indicate in this in this report, this</span>

But, you know, this position was created under the Harper government to try to bring some sort of independent authority to the budgeting process.

And generally speaking, in those moments, in my experience, leaders in the House from various parties will sort of say, OK, we get it and we will try to help each other out there. And we are not going to make hay of the fact that there&#39;s security services being spent because this is all too serious. And that&#39;s when it gets real for a lot of politicians, right, that the words have actually resulted in something a little bit crazier than that.

We&#39;re talking about Alberta. Let&#39;s do it. The province of Alberta announced Wednesday, we&#39;re recording on Thursday, so yesterday, that Alberta will soon have no mandatory COVID-19 protocols, no more mandatory masking, contact tracing, or isolating as part of a move to treat the coronavirus like other respiratory respiratory viruses, or as our health minister said, in the endemic phase. Starting Thursday, as in today, anyone with COVID-19 symptoms, I should say, or a positive test result must isolate but quarantine for their close contacts will be recommended as not mandatory. I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just reading this from a news release. I&#39;ll just add one more piece of reaction, which was we got a piece of reaction from Calgary Mayor Nye Nenshi said that lifting the remaining health orders in Alberta was, quote, the height of insanity.

What are the triggers that would otherwise bring us back to normal society? Are we going to continue these tests forever? Are we going to continue it? You know, all of the arguments because the government made them, but there&#39;s a gaping hole in them. And the gaping hole is there actually is a pretty important trigger to come at this point. And that&#39;s the fact that anybody under 12 cannot get vaccinated still. We&#39;re in a situation now where we don&#39;t even know what the COVID levels are going to be in our community as we&#39;re sending our kids back to school. And hey, that</span>

A lot of people will tell you the risk to kids is much lower for hospitalization, for more severe certainly for death, but even things like long COVID that are getting a lot of press, that there&#39;s an awful lot lower risk for children. The argument is effectively my children&#39;s risk unvaccinated is not really materially different from mine vaccinated because of the age difference and the effects here but like</span>

But you&#39;ll never even know if you&#39;re the person next to it, because there&#39;s no documentation, there&#39;s no reporting. And that is my major foundational problem with this.

Vaccinations are bad. There is a group of people in Alberta for whom that is the story that they&#39;re hearing. You know, mask mandates destroyed business. No, not having COVID destroyed business, not feeling safe, destroyed business. And we&#39;ll see how things unfold when we don&#39;t feel safe putting our kids in school and we don&#39;t feel safe going into businesses.

            <span class="text">places like the UK, their fourth wave deaths and hospitalizations didn&#39;t follow at the same level, and certainly it seemed to be much more with unvaccinated groups, Which is not to say their lives don&#39;t matter. I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s fewer of those as time goes on, right? But here&#39;s what I guess what I would say.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fact that cases are climbing, that&#39;s true. And I didn&#39;t see the numbers today. So maybe this is no longer true as of this moment. But until yesterday, we were still seeing hospitalizations and ICU decline. And I do think that there&#39;s an intent by the government here and by the chief medical officer of health to get us to stop thinking about these things in terms of case counts and start thinking about these things in terms of severe outcomes. Because there are people like all three of us who are dual vaccinated, double vaccinated. We may still end up with COVID, but if we get it, odds are good it will be either asymptomatic or with fairly mild symptoms. And to be fair, that&#39;s probably not something that we need to be deeply concerned about. Right now, obviously, if we then spread it to a bunch of people, different ball of wax. But one of us getting a cold for a few days or something equivalent to cold symptoms, I should say, is not something that people should be particularly worried about. And cases is maybe not a great approximator for COVID anymore, as vaccines have absolutely changed the game.</span>

            <span class="text">Steven, at this moment, you know, where certain cases, to Corey&#39;s point, I don&#39;t have today&#39;s numbers as well, matching the peak of that third wave, so to speak. Carter, explain to me, though, on Corey&#39;s point, because I feel like even if, you know, ideology or raw politics is driving this decision, there is a chance that, you know, they could be right. that that there is very little sort of backlash or ramifications on the public health side or even from the public like we&#39;re seeing a very loud uh group including calgary&#39;s mayor saying it&#39;s the height of insanity many docs coming out there saying this is crazy i can&#39;t believe this is happening um but at some point could that just quell if things continue on as normal like almost like the opening where they made that gamble to use cory&#39;s highway analogy or to use cory&#39;s winding road analogy, I should say, right? Driving fast on a windy road. It seemed to have kind of paid off for them. Where they did it, they were generally going to be fine for the most part on the balance of probabilities. Is this similar in that regard, where even on the opposition, they might be perhaps risking the politics of overreaction by, for example, what Rachel Notley said today, I&#39;m calling on the reversal of this decision to end mandatory isolation, et cetera. Or do you feel like her politics are still pretty sound from the lane she&#39;s trying to hunt and pick?</span>

They should have been spending the last three weeks saying it&#39;s only about hospitalizations and ICUs. Who cares? What do you mean cases? Cases don&#39;t matter at this point.

And while we&#39;ve got our eye on that, That&#39;s when they tell us that they&#39;re going to go down in their level of restriction. I mean, that was a fundamental problem that they had yesterday. And so the prep work wasn&#39;t done. And maybe they were trying to do it. Maybe it wasn&#39;t registering. But if it wasn&#39;t registering, it didn&#39;t get done. There needed to be an awful lot more done on that front.</span>

What tactics would you have used to try to change the narrative to hospitalization? Would it have been press conferences by the premier and the chief medical officer of health? Would it have been digital advertising? Would it have been surrogates? Give me a mixture of what it would have taken to shift the metric that we viewed COVID through. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yes, that has allowed us to really change the game with COVID. And now even when we get COVID, it doesn&#39;t mean the same thing. So from this point forward, the government of Alberta will be focusing primarily on hospitalization and ICU rates. rates here&#39;s our new like i some of it is similar to changing the dashboards like on they should be like this is the icu number this is the hospitalization number click these four different links to get yourself to the case numbers because they don&#39;t matter anymore and i would have actually continued those daily briefings that they postponed and use that as an opportunity to constantly reinforce it&#39;s not about cases anymore because the time to do that is when cases are going down not when cases are going up as soon as cases are going up it looks like you&#39;re You&#39;re just shifting the goalposts on people. But as they&#39;re going down, you say, you know, you don&#39;t even say they&#39;re going down. You say ICUs are going down. Hospitalizations are going down. Somebody asked about the cases. Cases don&#39;t matter at all, Jim. But if you care, you can click the four links and you can figure them out. As the premier has</span>

The section right after, hey, we&#39;ve entered stage three is cases in Alberta, and then a bunch of information about cases. This should be hospitalizations and ICUs in Alberta. Government of Alberta should change it tomorrow. When you click view all outbreak data, if right now it says cases and outbreak data, it should take you to a page that says hospitalizations and ICUs in Alberta from COVID-19, where it says cases by zone. The case column is number one right now. It&#39;s the prominent one. You&#39;ve got to change that. You should have changed this four weeks ago if this was your plan. The problem is you have never stopped talking about cases being the core metric until the minute where it served you at this particular moment. And</span>

Okay, let&#39;s say that the Premier agrees, says, okay, three weeks ago, he said, yep, we&#39;re going to do the table setting. What else, even in the short term, would you have added to the mix to make this strategy and this rollout optimized better? Corey, jump in, and then Carter, I&#39;ll go back to you on this.

And here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing to protect children who are at risk. And so you can&#39;t just look at it as a whole, although you need to provide that contextualizing information to people. But you also need to say, here&#39;s how we&#39;re accommodating children who are at risk. Here&#39;s how we&#39;re doing it in the fall. Here&#39;s how we&#39;re doing it through the winter. Do you know what? It&#39;s not even a COVID thing anymore. This has made us so much more aware of chronic diseases and in general, the risks that people have in these situations.

I&#39;m talking about ongoing ability to have these online courses for when there&#39;s flare-ups for these individual children.

Because we you talked about this is something he likes to do. If you were advising him as a political staffer, would you have told him, Premier, I agree, you need a big swing?

            <span class="text">let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s end this segment here, which is talk to me about what the strategy today forward needs to look like for the official opposition, for the NDP. You know, Premier or former Premier Rachel Nolley, opposition leader, has suggested that she&#39;s asking for a reversal regarding the isolation requirements. Carter, you know, with hedging the fact that her base, as you said, in your words, is a little bit larger. She&#39;s not going for the right flank that Kenny&#39;s going for. She&#39;s maybe going for her base plus. How does she develop a strategy here, both in terms of messaging and tactics, that appeals to that mushy middle of people that might look at this and not feel right about it, but aren&#39;t outspoken about it, that aren&#39;t kind of like tweeting about it, that are like, I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s up here. And I feel like that&#39;s the majority, to be honest, right? They&#39;re like, oh, what? Like, like, how does she rightfully politically hedge her bets to win over that crowd? But if it goes in Kenny&#39;s favor, which the opening like it doesn&#39;t have any impact or whatever, she doesn&#39;t lose outright lose them for going too aggressive, so to speak. So I think that&#39;s the balancing act. You can even disagree with my premise. That is the balancing act, so to speak. But as I see it, that&#39;s the act. How do you construct or what are you doing if you&#39;re if you&#39;re the opposition? position i</span>
