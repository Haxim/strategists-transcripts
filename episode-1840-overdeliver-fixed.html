I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I&#39;m waiting for a couple of important pieces of mail that are important to me. And I couldn&#39;t believe, I still cannot believe that this strike has gone on for a month. You would think you&#39;d start to see some sort of bend from either the union or from Canada Post. I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s going to happen. And so I think it&#39;s entirely appropriate that the minister step in and return normal service for a period of time. I&#39;m not sure if May is the right timeline. I think that getting us through the Christmas season is really essential. This is the only time I think the Canada Post may be an essential service. So getting us through the Christmas season is certainly important.</span>

I don&#39;t think Pierre Paulieff has much reason to get that involved in it right now, but that definitely feels like a, oh, hey, while you&#39;re at it, can you fucking fix Canada Post?

And actually, can I say, I think one of the challenges, it&#39;s just one person maybe you feel very differently i think a lot of canadians would struggle to say what this strike is all about right like they you know or or like the nature of it beyond just sort of dollars and and there&#39;s this general feeling out there that that has been pervasive for decades that if you work for canada post you do okay you make pretty good money you&#39;re not going to work very hard don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true i&#39;m just saying that&#39;s the stereotype and they need to do a they need to do a service to themselves and find in a way that they can frame this thing a little bit different than it&#39;s currently framed and it does start with with telling their story and once they&#39;ve gotten through the pr angles once it&#39;s no longer news that you&#39;ve got these you know thousand word pieces as to what it means to be a canada post worker you have to follow up with paid because you&#39;re going to lack media especially if this thing is, well, as it is happening, as they&#39;re ordered back to work, right?

The Globe and Mail is citing 10 sources reporting earlier this week that tensions between Christopher Freeland and the Prime Minister&#39;s office, maybe even the Prime Minister himself, have increased as spending on political strategies such as the GST holiday, which by the way starts tomorrow, on toys, alcohol, and food, and a promised $250 rebate for working people earning $150k or less. These are $7 billion initiatives. The tension conversation conversation between the PM and Freeland has been at an escalating drumbeat. Carter, is this real? Is this smart? And what the fuck? Look at this. It is the clock must have struck midnight again because Mark Carney&#39;s back in the news. The shit or get off the pot experience that is the Mark Carney candidacy is once again just so conveniently back as this story gets told. Carter, break it down for me.

It is a culmination. It is something that&#39;s easy to point to in many ways. Carter, there&#39;s two angles here. First angle is how to get rid of a minister. How do you do it eloquently? What does Trudeau do in that sense? Number two, though, and maybe I&#39;ll go to door number two first before I go to door number one, is can he?</span>

You&#39;re ignoring signals. You&#39;re ignoring all the signposts. So what the fuck difference does it make if you do another thing that&#39;s fatal, right? Right.

If I shake up that cabinet, I mean, really shake it because I haven&#39;t really shaken it yet. When I shake up that cabinet, the Canadian people, they&#39;re going to respond.

And frankly, if the Alberta premier was taking the same approach, I think we&#39;d be in a lot stronger position here. If the prime minister could go in and Trudeau could say to Trump, look, I&#39;m a reasonable guy. I&#39;m willing to meet you on some of these border things. I want to talk to you about what you can do also to secure the border on both sides. Let&#39;s figure this all out. to. But I got to tell you, these guys are nuts. You know, Doug Ford, he&#39;s going to cut off your electricity. Danielle Smith, she&#39;s going to just stop the oil in its tracks. They don&#39;t give a fuck. You know, like they will not be disrespected in this way. That would be a much stronger negotiating hand for Canadians. And I appreciate that Doug Ford is doing something that maybe is in his interest. Maybe he didn&#39;t get there because he wanted to be on Team Canada. But maybe he did. And it is exactly what Team Canada needs. They need the bad cop to the good cop. And Trudeau being the good cop right now but we have lacked the bad cop instead we&#39;ve had good cop and supplicant cop who is willing to just let you get whatever the fuck you want which is what&#39;s you know let&#39;s talk let&#39;s talk</span>
