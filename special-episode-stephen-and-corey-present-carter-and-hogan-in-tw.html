        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen and Corey get together to talk about everything from the BC NDP leadership to the box Putin has put himself in. All without Zain's supervision.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. It's Saturday morning! Grab your coffee, pull up a chair and join us as Stephen Carter talks about getting a massage. Other topics include: Canada supporting Ukraine's NATO membership, bad polling for Danielle Smith and the UCP, how leadership contest construction determines the results and much, much more. But, because Zain isn't here, also less.</em></p></blockquote></div>
