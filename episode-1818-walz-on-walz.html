Then the social media darling passed clips, legislative and governor of Minnesota, his success on passing things, on getting shit done, took a life of its own, so did his dad humor. And here we are, Corey, after a successful interview with Kamala Harris this weekend, interpersonally, where he had a stark difference, both in terms of how he not just presented himself, but how he presented himself for the job with Josh Shapiro, him, you know, and reported by CNN saying, what can I do? How can I help versus Shapiro trying to negotiate the role with Kamala Harris, fighting more of an interpersonal match? And here he is.

Or he hasn&#39;t made the statements out there. Or it&#39;s just the biography you&#39;re reading. And let&#39;s be clear, though. Voters will not usually get past the first couple of pages of the book either. And those first couple of pages are pretty effing compelling, especially if you&#39;re a Democrat looking to balance off your ticket. And, you know, the comments about what might be in his past, what do we know? What have we maybe not fully digested, such as the DWI? I think it was the 90s, actually, Stephen. Oh,</div>

And I&#39;m not going to argue and say that that Minnesota is a deep red state. It is a it is a blue state that, you know, in Biden&#39;s lagging polls was entering into swing territory. But, you know, it is a blue state. But he did big things. He did big things there. And there&#39;s something to be said about the way he looked, the way he presented, the way he spoke, and frankly, who he was as a messenger that allowed him to do these small P and big P progressive things. And when you talk about that on the national stage, what lesson does that kind of teach you? Because there&#39;s a conjoining element around vibes that I want to talk about. But before that, what kind of lesson does messenger versus message kind of teach you right now?

Carter, you know, what&#39;s what&#39;s fascinating about that is that we actually don&#39;t know most of the stuff Trump has said over the last little bit, other than his disaster of a performance at the Black Journalist event where he says even more crazy and crazy things to try to get attention. And frankly, in the normal Trump way, which is still graded on a curve as being quite insane, we haven&#39;t heard from him. We haven&#39;t necessarily heard from him because it has all been about Kamala Harris and now Tim Walz and Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg and the whole constellation. What do you think about attention in this sense? Like, is attention grabbing a strategy?

Or do you like the more open-ended, what can I do to be part of a team player, helper, happy warrior, as Tim Walz is being called? And is it to each their own? Or is there a preferred lane in politics? I&#39;m not trying to codify a rule, but I&#39;m going to try to codify a bit of a rule. Like, I&#39;m curious to get your strategist leadership assessment, because there was two different tacks taken here. And if you believe the reporting, which looks first rate to me, you almost conclude that it had a lot to do with who came out on the end of this process.

And so if you&#39;re in that and you&#39;ve misread it, and it&#39;s not a question about having a sincere conversation, and maybe the tone is a little off, maybe it seems a little bit too transactional because of those negotiating components, well, maybe she says, you know what? I&#39;m not getting a good feeling here. I&#39;m going to go with the guy who says he&#39;ll do anything, right? Who doesn&#39;t want the guy who says he&#39;ll do anything? thing now maybe she&#39;ll regret that down the road maybe Shapiro would have been the smarter choice down the road we don&#39;t know today although certainly early early scores are good for her choice right but it&#39;s a very interesting move that he did to negotiate knowing that there was another person on the short list right there like that kind of negotiation that kind of hardball often happens once they&#39;ve already extended the offer and now you&#39;re talking terms now</div>

You&#39;ve got people that can activate these people, you know, for Democratic mayor, Democratic congressperson, Democratic governor, Democratic senator. I mean, there&#39;s so many different ways to activate these folks. It doesn&#39;t all have to happen in the seven swing states. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity to add these people in.

And people, like not necessarily even colleagues, just walking around. Like I work at a university. I could hear just random conversations about, did you hear Nahed Nenshi&#39;s in? Did you know you can just buy a membership by going to Alberta NDP? Like this was just fucking happening. Like I&#39;ve never, I never see that. People don&#39;t talk about the mechanics of buying a party membership randomly out when you&#39;re at the grocery store. And you were hearing that when Naya Nenshi was in. And I&#39;m sure it was a little bit unnerving for you because they didn&#39;t all go through your portal and you didn&#39;t know where they were. But that was fucking happening. And you&#39;re going to have similar things without that membership at the end occurring across the United States. You&#39;re going to have family dinners where the daughter is really excited about walls. And, you know, the sun was just door knocking for the Harris campaign out in Pennsylvania.

And, and so I do also like the ones that are more targeted about what you&#39;re trying to do for people, but I get it as long as it&#39;s carefully targeted there.</div>
