Once again, multiple Pulitzer prize winner has come out with the article, the follow up to her Pulitzer Prize winning article on Trump&#39;s tax returns, where she got a sliver of them before. Well, now we are seeing the entire breadth of them. Is that right, Corey? We&#39;re seeing the last decade, I believe, last 10 to 12 years of</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that he doesn&#39;t – or at least in his taxes. Can we start there? Donald Trump is not as wealthy as he&#39;s often purported to be. Now, there&#39;s a big caveat on that, and the New York Times does address it a number of times throughout their very long and comprehensive article. But the reality is taxes are what you tell the government you made, and they are not necessarily reality. And a fellow like Donald Trump, who I suspect many of us would say perhaps lacks the moral fiber that many others out there do, may not be inclined to make it look like he&#39;s gotten a ton of money if that means he&#39;s going to be paying a ton of taxes. So let&#39;s just sort of start there as a bit of a foundational point. But if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you look at all of the machinations, if you look at the losses from his individual business units, and he&#39;s got a ton of businesses, and it seems like he&#39;s just essentially running them parallel and he owns all of them, he&#39;s lost a lot of money over the last bit. And that is not really in depreciation, despite what he often claims. It is just he&#39;s lost a lot of money in the last bit. So Donald Trump perhaps was not in great financial straits before he became U.S. president. I mean, let&#39;s be clear, not in great financial straits is he&#39;s not the billionaire he pretends to be, not that he actually has any real problems in the world. He&#39;s still got an awful lot of money and an awful number of assets. But yeah, the emperor&#39;s clothes, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe they&#39;re not invisible, but maybe they&#39;re seers. Maybe they&#39;re not Saks Fifth Avenue, as he always claimed.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">The emperor&#39;s clothes are seers. That&#39;s not bad. That&#39;s a pretty decent save. I&#39;m like, oh, Corey really let the gas out of that one going nowhere. Carter, what&#39;s going on? What do you make of this? Corey&#39;s right, an unbelievably comprehensive piece put out by the New York Times on Trump&#39;s tax filings, tax returns.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s start with the number that jumps out, and that&#39;s the $750. And the problem with $750 is that everybody can relate to $750. This is where we ran into problems with the no-meat committee in Alberta. And for those who don&#39;t know, the no-meat committee in Alberta was essentially, back in the day, Alberta&#39;s MLA got paid a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">a little bit more.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, okay, something like that. But they got paid a little bit extra for attending the – that&#39;s good, Zane. Very funny. I laughed inside. But they got</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">got paid extra every month for attending – for being a part of a committee. Well, this committee didn&#39;t meet for two years and people still got paid $1,000 a month. The problem with that is everybody knows what $1,000 a month would mean. Everybody understands what $1,000 a month would mean to their lives. Well, I&#39;ll tell you something. Every American that paid more than $750 in tax last year knows what a big advantage it would be to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to only have to pay $750 worth of taxes. This is now real for people in a different way than Donald Trump&#39;s billions of dollars in assets, billions of dollars or millions of dollars in earned income. That doesn&#39;t mean much. $750 in taxes, that means a lot because I understand it. I can relate to it. And I know Corey, for example, pays $750 a day in taxes. That&#39;s the kind of money he pulls down. So when you&#39;re paying that kind of taxes, you can be a little bit bitter about the billionaire next door who paid sweet fuck all.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">I should do this professionally. I really say so. Carter, you&#39;re absolutely right. Right. You know, that 750 number is the one that is jumping out. You know, there&#39;s there&#39;s been already calculations on on on federal income tax for truck drivers, 10K, ER nurse, 8K, teacher, 6K, right? Grocery store cashier, fifteen hundred bucks. Right. So paying more tax federal income taxes than a grocery store cashier in the United States on average. Corey, do you agree with Carter? Is that the focal point of this exhaustive document? Is that what you&#39;re plucking out, for example, if you&#39;re the Democrats?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it might be the punchline. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the biggest takeaway for me personally, but certainly it&#39;s the one that most lends itself to being in an advertisement, in being a line in the debates coming up this week. $750, Stephen&#39;s exactly right. That&#39;s the kind of money you can wrap your head around fairly easily. And by the way, we sort of blew past it, but Trump paid $750 in taxes in 2016 and 2017. Those were, you know, years he was running and year he was president, respectively.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The thing about that number, too, is it could have been zero. So if you read through the reporting, he effectively just paid taxes so that he could say, I paid taxes. I think that&#39;s one of the more interesting things here. He&#39;s obviously aware of what it looks like, and he was trying to make sure that under oath, I guess, for lack of better. he could say, I pay taxes, I pay taxes as president. And, you know, I made a huge amount of money, both things true, maybe missing the fact that he also spent a huge amount of money. And he paid very little tax. But yeah, I mean, it&#39;s easily the one that you can wrap your head around. And it&#39;s going to be in an ad near you instantly.</span>

I&#39;m cool with, you know, the lunacy that pops out of his mouth every single day. I&#39;m fine with him, you know, being modestly racist. I&#39;m fine with all those other things. But this, not paying taxes, I&#39;m out of here. They&#39;ll find a way to justify it. They&#39;ll find a way to make him the hero that only paid $750 worth of taxes.

Basically, everything else he touches, with a few exceptions, has turned to shit. but uh you know there&#39;s enough huge numbers out there of his income or at least revenue i should say even with this tax return that people will legitimately say boy this guy&#39;s super rich and he paid almost no tax but you want to know the interesting thing he in large part did that for the last 10 years because of a tax change that was brought in under obama so trump can continue a narrative that he began in the 2016 campaign which is yeah you&#39;re right i</span>

Everybody else can carry the water on this thing. We&#39;ve said it on You the People a whole bunch of times, our other podcast, you know, the talk specifically about American politics. It comes out every Thursday. Make sure you listen. But the Democrats need to constantly phrase the impact of this election on the individual voter. We can&#39;t be talking about Trump and Trump&#39;s failures all the time. How does that impact me as a voter? How does that impact me as a citizen? The voters have a selfish intent, and that selfish intent is about trying to make sure that they get the best possible government for their individual circumstance how does trump&#39;s tax returns make things better for me i understand that he&#39;s able to game the system i understand that he&#39;s able to fuck me over but that doesn&#39;t make things better so i would focus on on kids</span>

Carter, you know, it is interesting in my mind. How do you reconcile? You said, if you wanted to do a wealth tax, now&#39;s the time to do it. Taxes are on the front burner.

It didn&#39;t really, you know, the irony was lost on them that he was one of these fuckers, but he said the right words. He had a different type of populism in 2016 than he has now.

Well, I&#39;ll tell you when I&#39;m done being audited by the IRS. That is ongoing right now. And then I would have said, yeah, the tax code is full of loopholes. Look at Barack Obama. He He created an enormous one, as the Times talked about in there. Let&#39;s talk about how you&#39;ve been screwed by insiders like Joe Biden, who&#39;s been in the beltway for 40 years. That is probably more along the lines of what I would have done than what he did. What he did was kind of coming out and deny everything.

He doesn&#39;t solve an issue before he moves into the next issue. He uses the next issue to move out of the previously unsolvable issue. So at some point in the next 24 to 48 hours, there&#39;s going to be another issue that pushes this thing out of the news and everybody will run after it. Now, this happens to be coming just before the debates, two days before the debates. yeah so so maybe this has a little bit longer life cycle but i doubt it i doubt that that this is the thing that everybody&#39;s focused on at the at the debates uh just because the history has shown history</span>

They&#39;re expecting some big cost overrides or overruns next year, potentially. There is the fact that the pandemic bump will not last forever. We&#39;ve talked about these pandemic bumps being rather, you don&#39;t get used to them, right? They&#39;re a sugar high.</span>

It is just as likely, in my mind, that the first wave, we thought they managed it well, the second wave, less so. And now you&#39;re in the middle of an election and there&#39;s no way out except to go to the voters and get them to render their judgment.</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;re strong and they&#39;re weak, right, which is usually what happens when a minority government folds. And they looked at Wilkinson and they looked at how he managed his behavior through the pandemic, which I think for the most part, the BC Liberals were supportive of the BC government going through the pandemic response. response because, you know, Andrew Wilkinson&#39;s a doctor and wanted to have a strong health-related response.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So that made him look weak. I&#39;m not sure that he is as weak as he looks. And that&#39;s where I would have probably been more cautious. I think I&#39;ve said on this podcast that I didn&#39;t think that the prime minister should call an election. The prime minister has now kind of come to that same conclusion and isn&#39;t calling an election. And at least they put it off for six months in some some unidentified person has seemingly pushed it off by six months um i i just think that the volatility is too high volatility in canadian elections is much different than the american elections we don&#39;t have people who are baked in and when you look at the poll that just came out uh from insights west uh you&#39;re seeing that the the largest group of people in the province uh aren&#39;t voting for the ndp what they&#39;re saying is uh we wish there wasn&#39;t an election election so</span>

Insights West had them up 47.29 in June, late June. I guess my point is, why didn&#39;t they go over the summer before all of the kids were going back in school? Why didn&#39;t they take a similar time into New Brunswick and run this election basically hitting the polls now or slightly before now before these numbers start getting away in a big way? Because that&#39;s the real risk. And I guess that&#39;s the real probability is more to the point. It&#39;s always the risk. It was the risk if you were to call it in June, July</span>

            <span class="text">Now, all of that said, I think that the real strategy for him has to be, yes, the unnecessariness of this election for sure. Absolutely, we are only in this because of Horgan&#39;s vanity and his desire to get to a majority. But there are a number of other areas where the government is potentially exposed. And maybe you have to say, well, John, if you want to have an election about what&#39;s to come, let&#39;s have an election about what&#39;s to come. and start putting a bit more of the economic twist on it because there is a reality here, which is that there is going to be a lot of hurt. Even though we sit in Alberta, and in Alberta job losses have been higher,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">job losses are pretty significant anywhere in the country, and maybe it&#39;s time to talk about the economy or at least try to get outside of the NDP message box. I think as long as they&#39;re talking about health care,</span>

I mean, I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s what John Horgan would be running against if he tried to make this all about COVID-19. So that would be the big risk with that strategy.</span>

But, you know, I just think that this is a rerun of 2017 in Horgan&#39;s mind, and he can win that way. But he&#39;s not up against Christy Clark. He&#39;s up against Andrew Wilkinson.

            <span class="text">Yeah, the why are we here critique is strong. And John Horgan has not had a particularly compelling week from my perch, at least, admittedly one province over, of explaining why in the world there is an election right now. And I want to broaden this point and just say this has not been a good first week for the BC NDP. Their launch was kind of a little awkward looking. Many of the tactics, you know, Horgan calling, you know, the one a day he&#39;s going to call some random supporter is already starting to run a little thin. And I guess this is the other layer that we&#39;re almost sort of just taking for granted. But let&#39;s talk about it at least briefly and maybe talk about it longer another day.</span>

I want to do a special in the coming weeks where we deep dive on BC thoroughly, talk to some of the folks that perhaps are on some of the sides of this campaign or are affiliated, and do what you just said, which is analyze the tactics and the strategies in our COVID environment, what they look like, what we see from our perch that&#39;s working, that isn&#39;t working. I think there&#39;s a lot to discuss there as we discuss what campaigning not just looks like in 2020, what campaign looks like in our version of 2020, which is this COVID environment.</span>

Guys, there was so much that we got from the speech from the throne. And so just to distill it, I&#39;m going to do another classic game that we haven&#39;t done for a while. We&#39;re going to do up, down, delta. Now, you may not remember this, but here&#39;s what it simply is. I will give you a figure or a party, in this case, Trudeau. What did you see from the speech? And what you will do is you give me a thumbs up, a thumbs down and a delta as in what you would have changed. So, you need to give me an up or down and what you would have changed. So, either way, it&#39;s up or down and what you would change. So, Corey, let&#39;s start with you. We had a ton of speculation into this speech. Was Trudeau going to take the practical bucket? Was he going to take the ambitious bucket? At the end of the day, from what you heard, the speech alone, because I know there&#39;s another element I want to discuss about Trudeau, but from the speech alone, up or down, and then what you would have changed.

Who cares? He called it a kooky academic theory on a scale of one to 10. Carter, how damaging is this to Jason Kenney politically?</span>

And by the way, after Jason Kenney said this, his issues manager, Matt Wolf, tweeted out a video of Ben Shapiro, a very nicely done Ben Shapiro video, talking about intersectionality being how many victim groups you associate with. Fun fact, I guess you wanted to know that. But Corey, what</span>

So I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s going to be a lot of swing voters sitting there caping for the concept, right? Twitter hit peak Twitter, I think, in the immediate aftermath of the Premier&#39;s comments when there were people saying intersectionality is not a theory, it&#39;s a framework, you know, and that may be true. But I think that tells you how deep we are in the rabbit hole right now. Now, I think where there is damage, it is that people are going to be – the damage is probably more perceived than real where people will say, God, that was a little embarrassing. I don&#39;t know why we needed to detour on this. And it calls into question in</span>

I suspect that his strength over the past three or four weeks is one of the reasons that we&#39;re not heading towards a snap election, uh, in this country. Uh, so I, I think you have to go over it. He&#39;s definitely, uh, now I think some of his answers are weak. I think that some of his answers should be much stronger if he&#39;s ever going to bring over swing voters.
