        <p>Shannon Philips and Stephen Carter talk about the results of the highly anticipated First Ministers' Meeting. Is the lack of a project list a problem or an asset for Carney?

Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

I&#39;m glad there isn&#39;t a specific list, because I&#39;m looking for some due diligence here. Not to get too far down the rabbit hole of the policy aspects of this. But I mean, I don&#39;t want people, you know, signing off on a bunch of white elephants and spending a bunch of money where they shouldn&#39;t on projects that may or may not have, you know, social or political support, as well as, you know, support from the financial side.

Because it&#39;s going to have to be more than one weekend or one week, right? It&#39;s going to have to be a sustained push from this government and really sustained communication structures for the better part of a year before people are really going to start to grab onto it.

And it&#39;s shovel ready. It is also not. But that&#39;s fine. That happens all the time. Right. Which is why that level of due diligence is really important.

Maybe it&#39;s not a nation building project in Brampton, maybe it&#39;s more housing there, but I&#39;d also be doing some polling on what people are looking for in those areas. And you also have to hold together a Quebec coalition. If you&#39;re going to go stomping through the environment, you&#39;re going to find PDQ that the BQ is going to start eating your lunch, right? Right. So you have to think about those regional dynamics.
