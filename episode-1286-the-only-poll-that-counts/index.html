        <p>The Liberal Party of Canada and PMO's former pollster, Dan Arnold, joins the gang to go over the results of an exclusive poll on the state of the Alberta NDP leadership race. But seriously.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter and Pollara Chief Strategy Officer Dan Arnold go over a 1500-person poll of Albertans on the Alberta NDP leadership race, trying to answer the question on everybody's mind: what it means for the Zain Velji for Leader campaign. How well known are the candidates with the general public? What does their membership sales universe look like? And can Zain's DGAF attitude catch fire in the race? Zain Velji (not to be confused with Zain Velji for Leader), as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Sometimes you pick up fragments because you don&#39;t have the budget, you don&#39;t have the expertise available on hand. You pick up fragments from an omnibus, for example, on familiarity, and you have to go with it. If you two were going simply on familiarity, and Dan, I&#39;ll get you to chime in on this on the back end. I&#39;ll ask Corey and Stephen first. First, if all you saw was what Dan lays out here in the familiarity numbers, how would you be starting to think of making a case here? Because you both say it&#39;s important, but not everything.

So, like, the Nenshi strategy is an entirely different episode. It has its own interesting sort of elements to it. But talk to me, Carter, about what I need to do to get out of last place. And should that be my goal? Let&#39;s go back to 2010, Nenshi. You had the idea of third place before Thanksgiving. Talk to me about the Zane Velji headline goal here, right? I&#39;m currently in last place. Let&#39;s say I can put up the money. Let&#39;s say I want to still do this. What should my goal be? And from like, that&#39;s as simple of like a bumper sticker.

So there&#39;s ways you can kind of craft a bit of a buzz. And all of a sudden, if you&#39;ve laid the groundwork, you&#39;ve gotten into the conversation by taking these 30-70 stances to begin with, those are going to be amplified, people are going to hear more about those stances.
