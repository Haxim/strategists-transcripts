And we have to start here. year this one comes to us from vice but it could have come to us from fucking anywhere else this morning it sure looks like ted cruz went to cancun while texas freezes and starves i mean jesus christ uh i&#39;ll let you just react to the citizen journalism on the plane by it seemed like half the plane taking pictures of ted cruz yeah emming every reporter in texas and in dc about the fact that this guy was going all the way to and i&#39;ve got another headline here in a second but we can burn it right now. Republicans who say Ted Cruz is a hero for flying to Cancun as Texas freezes to death. Friends of the GOP like Dinesh D&#39;Souza, who says, quote, I&#39;ll let you speak, but I need to get this out of the way. What could Ted Cruz do if he were here in Texas? I&#39;m hard pressed to say if he&#39;s in Cancun, that means he&#39;s not using up valuable resources of energy, food and water that can now be used by someone else. This is probably the best thing he could do for the state right right now this</div>

There are a lot of big, weird places in the world. You know, the real unfortunate thing – I mean, and the governor of Texas and Rick Perry and Ted Cruz, they&#39;re not exactly painting a great picture here. But he is going to become an emblem of this Texas libertarian republicanism, and I think that&#39;s part of the reason why this was such a story. It just ties into that stereotype of like this Texas live free or die attitude. And as a result, I think it will live on for a while. It&#39;s one of these things that will probably grow in notoriety 40 years from now. Now, it&#39;ll be remembered as the mayor of Dallas said this or something stupid like that.

We&#39;re just going to keep doing that check every single week. I just wanted to insert that one there. Let&#39;s move it on to our next headline. This comes to us from CBS. CBS, DoorDash spent $5.5 million to advertise their $1 million charity donation during the Super Bowl.</div>

            <div class="said">usually leave off with an article that I want to do a little bit of discussion on, and I don&#39;t know if this is the one, but sure, let&#39;s do it. DoorDash, like many companies during the past Super Bowl, decided that they were going to donate to causes and community organizations. This was something that Planters and Pepsi and Budweiser and other organizations and companies also decided to do during their Super Bowl ad spree. Rather than placing ads, they purchased maybe smaller slots or they gave that money to charity. But DoorDash seems to be on the outside in the sense that they are now spending money thereafter to advertise the $5.5 million – sorry, to advertise the million-dollar charity donation that they have made. Stephen Carter, from an advertising perspective, from a strategy perspective, from a PR perspective, what do you make of this?</div>

I don&#39;t. I believe in PR. And I think if you want all companies to act a certain way, you make it a law because corporations aren&#39;t good. There&#39;s no such thing as a good corporation. And I&#39;m not saying that means corporations are bad. I&#39;m saying they&#39;re a vehicle for creating profit. And as profit-driven organizations, depending on the market segment they serve or the interests of the employees they want to retain, they may feel it&#39;s in their interest to make such donations, but they&#39;re not doing it because they are good. And I just think that people who look at corporations say, oh, they&#39;re such good citizens or have these kind of warm fuzzies about these corporations.</div>

Our first segment, there is no I in team. Guys, I want to talk about campaign teams. I want to talk about campaign team structures. I want to talk about campaign team design, what&#39;s changed over the course of the last half decade. You know, we get so many questions, whether it be on Twitter or personally, around what a campaign looks like, what the inside of a campaign looks like, how you structure a team, how you kind of find your team, how do you source talent, where does the talent go, perhaps how is the talent compensated? These are questions that I think, you know, are largely left in a black box for those that don&#39;t have the experience just yet to jump into it. So I want to try to, you know, perhaps pull the curtain on some of these to try to expose a bit and maybe educate a bit on how these are done. But Stephen Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. And I&#39;ll start with the most basic question, which is, how does one go about putting together a campaign team? Let&#39;s say and put you in a scenario today. day. You&#39;re asked by someone to run their campaign. You&#39;re asked by them to put together a campaign. Let&#39;s get beyond the point of you saying, yep, I&#39;m in, I&#39;m interested.</div>

Say, for example, you were running, there was a time you could run a campaign in the Maritimes and depending on your riding, you might actually never door knock because there&#39;s such an ingrained understanding of, well, that&#39;s Bill and Bill&#39;s a liberal and that&#39;s Charlie and Charlie&#39;s a conservative.

You know, I take what could probably be called like an effectuation approach where I look around and say, Who do I know? What do I have? And I use that to help determine what my strategy will be. Now, in some cases, especially if you&#39;ve been in this game longer, you&#39;re not really limited by skill sets, you&#39;re probably more limited by dollars and resources of that nature. but for me the first thing on any campaign is starting with a group of people who are going to get you to the finish line uh you i</div>

It&#39;s that you&#39;re smart enough to figure out how to do something for the first time. And so you get that group of people together, you see what you have at hand, you see what the candidate has, does the candidate have friends? Is the candidate shameless about fundraising? Is the candidate actually just, like, brutally good with a quip, and you want to get that out through the media as much as possible. And you try to build around that. And you say,</div>

            <div class="said">you start putting money around and you prioritize your spending as such. Again, really depends on the campaign because the more national the campaign gets, province-wide campaigns, bigger campaigns, you&#39;re probably actually just going to have experience. And at that level, experience matters a great deal more because you can&#39;t just walk into a provincial war room and know what the fuck&#39;s going on. You&#39;re not even going to know where the bathroom is for the first couple of weeks. And there is nothing like having done it before, seeing the traps that have occurred before, seeing how things have played out in other jurisdictions is very useful. That is a different game.

I mean, it&#39;s a little different than what I do, but I think that there is a common thread through this, and that is also looking at the people that you trust. Generally speaking, it is easier to hire and bring on board people that you know that they do a good job. You&#39;ve worked with them in the past. One of the things about campaigns is we work at a different frequency. Decisions get made faster. You don&#39;t have as much information. You just move through campaigns. Even at the beginning of a campaign, when it appears you have lots of time, you don&#39;t have as much time. So you want to see experience in campaigning, not just an experience of, you know, I&#39;ve hired agencies to do advertising for a campaign. And it&#39;s excruciating because they go through 36 different iterations to land upon something that they think is good.</div>

            <div class="said">Well, you&#39;re completely right, Carter. Campaigns are designed to last for 28 days, 35 days, a couple of months, maybe in the most extreme cases, six months or more. They are not designed to last forever. And because of that, that there&#39;s a certain slapdashness to it, which is also one of the challenges with bringing in professionals who are not campaign professionals but just professional professionals. You bring in a professional ad person, they are going to lose their mind in a campaign setting where it&#39;s, yeah, we came up with an ad idea this morning. We need to do a version of it by this afternoon, right? That is not the way they like to work because that cuts so many corners, and that&#39;s just not the way you&#39;re supposed to do it for 100 different reasons. We talk about campaigns. We&#39;ve mentioned before, I think last week, that that&#39;s military terminology. People use military terminology in campaigns a lot because there are so many commonalities. And one of the commonalities that I want to throw on the table here is this notion of battlefield promotions. So sometimes you have somebody just drop off a campaign or you have a vacancy and you just point to somebody and you say, okay, you&#39;re in charge of this now. And</div>

And the chair of our campaign, who had been around for a while, he said, well, this isn&#39;t my first rodeo. And he literally looked at the dozen people in front of him and he just pointed to us.

            <div class="said">you are the logistics director. You are the operations director. And just happened to point to me. And I was the communications chair from that point forward and actually started a career in communications that way. Campaigns have a weird way of – and I&#39;d love to say that&#39;s because he saw something in me. I just think I happen to be the third person, and communications was the third thing he thought of. But that&#39;s how these things tend to work. And then if you can show yourself in those roles, you can turn those battlefield promotions into something permanent.</div>

But now, if you&#39;re running it in 2021, how are you sourcing your talent? Is it partially your own team? Is it a combination of your own team and folks you know in the past and folks that you&#39;re willing to roll the dice on? What does that ratio look like? I&#39;m kind of curious how you think about these things from an operational standpoint.</div>

            <div class="said">start by saying if you&#39;re standing alone in a field, that doesn&#39;t make you a farmer. And one of the things about building a campaign team is it should be done by people who have worked on campaigns and know people who work campaigns. They can work their Rolodexes. They can get those individuals forward who have some of that capacity, have some of that skill, even if it was at a lower level. Maybe you&#39;re just incrementing them up a notch. Maybe you&#39;ve had some great conversations about ideas they&#39;ve had if they just had that next level up. But you start by reaching out to your network and seeing who might be interested in getting along with the ride. This is the extension of the comment that I made earlier.

Now, if we&#39;re being kind of rational about this, we always look at the marginal benefit and say, what is the marginal benefit of this paid professional over this volunteer I can get off the street who&#39;s pretty good, but not as good as them. But people tend to lean on people and say, come on, man, if I pay you, that means we could lose this campaign because I can&#39;t spend money on my third lit drop. So it</div>

            <div class="said">it becomes a question of strategy in a way that&#39;s beyond how much money do I have, I guess is the point that I want to make. And as a result, It really kind of pushes the professionalization to the margins. It pushes it to that time outside of the campaign periods. It pushes it to those third-party advertisers that Stephen was talking about earlier. It pushes it to organizations that are campaign adjacent and have access to Grind. And so that&#39;s an unintended consequence, but that&#39;s a real one in this country. And so you&#39;re finding that the professionals are almost fighting proxy wars with campaigns now, And they&#39;re getting their paychecks and they&#39;re getting their points outside of the campaigns proper, at least outside of the local campaigns. The provincial, national, regional bodies, those are usually paid professionals.</div>

            <div class="said">That is excellent insight. And maybe I&#39;ll close this segment off with a story of mine. Corey, you talk about Battleground promotions. And one that I feel like was really fun during the Nenshi campaign, the last one, was less so a promotion, but more so because I didn&#39;t run a tight ship. We had a person that Carter and I, and I think, Corey, you know pretty well, and I won&#39;t name them on the podcast, who stepped into the campaign office, which was located in downtown at around 5 p.m. or so. And this person was incredibly well-dressed, well put together. And the assumption made by myself and the office manager slash volunteer coordinator in the office was that this person was here for the 5 o&#39;clock policy meeting. turns out that they were definitely not there for that but were more so inquiring about the campaign uh turns out that we thought they were here for the policy meeting no one wanted to admit to anyone else that who invited this person they sit down at the policy meeting and they just start contributing to policy this is the third meeting of the policy committee and the first one where the candidate is attending and the candidate is just like i don&#39;t give a shit who this person is This person has some really good ideas. Long story short, they come up with the acronym that defines their policy for the campaign.</div>

But Stephen Carter, I&#39;ll start with you because I think I know Corey&#39;s answer on this. It&#39;s the dichotomy he presented. If you had to choose one or the other, if you had to choose one or the other on a political campaign between smart and experienced, which would you take?</div>

I don&#39;t think you need to have big pyramids where everything flows, but you do need to know who&#39;s on what base and who&#39;s responsible for what. And I think campaigns often hand wave around that stuff. And often the biggest mistake they make is give two people roughly the same responsibilities, which creates tensions in that community you&#39;re trying to create. you do need to know what you are accountable for and you need to make sure other people know what you&#39;re accountable for that sharing of what everybody&#39;s job is is more than just titles it is you know let&#39;s say zane&#39;s the policy director that means he&#39;s ultimately responsible for the final draft of the policy document but he&#39;s going to take the input of the policy committee or it&#39;s zane holds the pen he writes the entire policy but you&#39;ve got to be clear on that because if you&#39;re zane and you think you hold the pen and it turns out you&#39;re the copy editor you&#39;re going to get frustrated.
