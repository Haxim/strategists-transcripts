I don&#39;t really know why a collared shirt denotes business time and a t-shirt says not business time, but that&#39;s the way the world works, Zane. It&#39;s just one of the many mysteries that we&#39;ll have to unpack on our other podcast, The Sartorialists, which</span>

And we have to start here. year this one comes to us from vice but it could have come to us from fucking anywhere else this morning it sure looks like ted cruz went to cancun while texas freezes and starves i mean jesus christ uh i&#39;ll let you just react to the citizen journalism on the plane by it seemed like half the plane taking pictures of ted cruz yeah emming every reporter in texas and in dc about the fact that this guy was going all the way to and i&#39;ve got another headline here in a second but we can burn it right now. Republicans who say Ted Cruz is a hero for flying to Cancun as Texas freezes to death. Friends of the GOP like Dinesh D&#39;Souza, who says, quote, I&#39;ll let you speak, but I need to get this out of the way. What could Ted Cruz do if he were here in Texas? I&#39;m hard pressed to say if he&#39;s in Cancun, that means he&#39;s not using up valuable resources of energy, food and water that can now be used by someone else. This is probably the best thing he could do for the state right right now this</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s in general, no Americans ever cared about anything that&#39;s gone on in Alberta, or really any Canadian province. It&#39;s tough enough to get them to know that our prime minister&#39;s name is not jean putin so that&#39;s just the reality that we deal with as canadians a certain asymmetry and information about the two nations but yeah</span>

Texas mayor resigns after telling residents desperate for power and heat, only the strong will survive. I have not read a more Texas headline or a more character of a Texas headline. But this mayor, of course, going out on Facebook, saying that only the strong will survive, that this is a crisis that we are in together but kind of are not in together because only those of the few that are not meek will live through it. Carter, you&#39;ve advised mayoral candidates and mayors. Is this part of the key messaging handbook when an emergency strikes upon a city?</span>

No, I think that, you know, this is probably one of the worst statements I&#39;ve ever seen by a mayor. I honestly didn&#39;t think he&#39;d have to resign in Texas. Looking what Ted Cruz isn&#39;t going to necessarily have to resign. But the outrage was real. And you got to think, I read the article, I read a lot of the quotes the guy said.

There are a lot of big, weird places in the world. You know, the real unfortunate thing – I mean, and the governor of Texas and Rick Perry and Ted Cruz, they&#39;re not exactly painting a great picture here. But he is going to become an emblem of this Texas libertarian republicanism, and I think that&#39;s part of the reason why this was such a story. It just ties into that stereotype of like this Texas live free or die attitude. And as a result, I think it will live on for a while. It&#39;s one of these things that will probably grow in notoriety 40 years from now. Now, it&#39;ll be remembered as the mayor of Dallas said this or something stupid like that. But the whole post was just an absolute legend. This guy is a total unit. He&#39;s saying, sink or swim, it&#39;s your choice. The city and county or any service owes you nothing.</span>

DoorDash, like many companies during the past Super Bowl, decided that they were going to donate to causes and community organizations. This was something that Planters and Pepsi and Budweiser and other organizations and companies also decided to do during their Super Bowl ad spree. Rather than placing ads, they purchased maybe smaller slots or they gave that money to charity. But DoorDash seems to be on the outside in the sense that they are now spending money thereafter to advertise the $5.5 million – sorry, to advertise the million-dollar charity donation that they have made.

Do you agree with Carter that this is something that&#39;s a common practice and the bad part is that it just got out? Or do you feel like this is kind of perhaps like strategically offside in some sense?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, listen, I could go on a long rant about this. I could take the rest of the episode on this particular topic. I don&#39;t believe in corporate citizenship. I don&#39;t. I believe in PR. And I think if you want all companies to act a certain way, you make it a law because corporations aren&#39;t good. There&#39;s no such thing as a good corporation. And I&#39;m not saying that means corporations are bad. I&#39;m saying they&#39;re a vehicle for creating profit. And as profit-driven organizations, depending on the market segment they serve or the interests of the employees they want to retain, they may feel it&#39;s in their interest to make such donations, but they&#39;re not doing it because they are good. And I just think that people who look at corporations say, oh, they&#39;re such good citizens or have these kind of warm fuzzies about these corporations.</span>

Our first segment, there is no I in team. Guys, I want to talk about campaign teams. I want to talk about campaign team structures. I want to talk about campaign team design, what&#39;s changed over the course of the last half decade. You know, we get so many questions, whether it be on Twitter or personally, around what a campaign looks like, what the inside of a campaign looks like, how you structure a team, how you kind of find your team, how do you source talent, where does the talent go, perhaps how is the talent compensated? These are questions that I think, you know, are largely left in a black box for those that don&#39;t have the experience just yet to jump into it. So I want to try to, you know, perhaps pull the curtain on some of these to try to expose a bit and maybe educate a bit on how these are done. But Stephen Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. And I&#39;ll start with the most basic question, which is, how does one go about putting together a campaign team? Let&#39;s say and put you in a scenario today. day. You&#39;re asked by someone to run their campaign. You&#39;re asked by them to put together a campaign. Let&#39;s get beyond the point of you saying, yep, I&#39;m in, I&#39;m interested.</span>

But let&#39;s before we do that, I think Carter, you&#39;ve probably laid out a good sort of structure. Corey, do you agree with that more broadly? Or is there another model? Or is there some tweaks to the model you&#39;d like to you&#39;d like to or models plural, I should say? Well, look, I see, I</span>

            <span class="text">I see things a little bit different. I think that the there are no, no limit to variance on campaigns, certain campaigns will have some elements and not other elements. There will be money for advertising or not. There will be the choice to take on certain tactics or not. And that will really color the type of talent that you need to have on board. Say, for example, you were running, there was a time you could run a campaign in the Maritimes and depending on your riding, you might actually never door knock because there&#39;s such an ingrained understanding of, well, that&#39;s Bill and Bill&#39;s a liberal and that&#39;s Charlie and Charlie&#39;s a conservative.

You know, I take what could probably be called like an effectuation approach where I look around and say, Who do I know? What do I have? And I use that to help determine what my strategy will be. Now, in some cases, especially if you&#39;ve been in this game longer, you&#39;re not really limited by skill sets, you&#39;re probably more limited by dollars and resources of that nature. but for me the first thing on any campaign is starting with a group of people who are going to get you to the finish line uh you i</span>

            <span class="text">i think it&#39;s better to have smart dedicated people who understand how to figure out how to do things than it is necessarily to have experienced people now it&#39;s best to have both if you have the option of doing so but the reality is campaigns change so much over time that it what gets you over the finish line more often than not is not that you&#39;ve you&#39;ve done it before. It&#39;s that you&#39;re smart enough to figure out how to do something for the first time. And so you get that group of people together, you see what you have at hand, you see what the candidate has, does the candidate have friends? Is the candidate shameless about fundraising? Is the candidate actually just, like, brutally good with a quip, and you want to get that out through the media as much as possible. And you try to build around that. And you say,</span>

            <span class="text">how do these parts fill into a campaign? What are the gaps I have? What gaps do I believe I can fill? And from there, you say, what do I need? What is absolutely essential to run at a high level? What&#39;s okay to run at just an average level? And what you absolutely must have at a high level, that&#39;s who you start paying for.

            <span class="text">you start putting money around and you prioritize your spending as such. Again, really depends on the campaign because the more national the campaign gets, province-wide campaigns, bigger campaigns, you&#39;re probably actually just going to have experience. And at that level, experience matters a great deal more because you can&#39;t just walk into a provincial war room and know what the fuck&#39;s going on. You&#39;re not even going to know where the bathroom is for the first couple of weeks. And there is nothing like having done it before, seeing the traps that have occurred before, seeing how things have played out in other jurisdictions is very useful. That is a different game. But when you talk about campaigns more at a local level,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I want to add one thing to what Corey&#39;s saying. I mean, it&#39;s a little different than what I do, but I think that there is a common thread through this, and that is also looking at the people that you trust. Generally speaking, it is easier to hire and bring on board people that you know that they do a good job. You&#39;ve worked with them in the past. One of the things about campaigns is we work at a different frequency. Decisions get made faster. You don&#39;t have as much information. You just move through campaigns. Even at the beginning of a campaign, when it appears you have lots of time, you don&#39;t have as much time. So you want to see experience in campaigning, not just an experience of, you know, I&#39;ve hired agencies to do advertising for a campaign. And it&#39;s excruciating because they go through 36 different iterations to land upon something that they think is good.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, you&#39;re completely right, Carter. Campaigns are designed to last for 28 days, 35 days, a couple of months, maybe in the most extreme cases, six months or more. They are not designed to last forever. And because of that, that there&#39;s a certain slapdashness to it, which is also one of the challenges with bringing in professionals who are not campaign professionals but just professional professionals. You bring in a professional ad person, they are going to lose their mind in a campaign setting where it&#39;s, yeah, we came up with an ad idea this morning. We need to do a version of it by this afternoon, right? That is not the way they like to work because that cuts so many corners, and that&#39;s just not the way you&#39;re supposed to do it for 100 different reasons. We talk about campaigns. We&#39;ve mentioned before, I think last week, that that&#39;s military terminology. People use military terminology in campaigns a lot because there are so many commonalities. And one of the commonalities that I want to throw on the table here is this notion of battlefield promotions. So sometimes you have somebody just drop off a campaign or you have a vacancy and you just point to somebody and you say, okay, you&#39;re in charge of this now. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">can tell you from my own personal experience, the first time I think I got a serious job in politics is I was sitting around a table and another campaign, it was a The leadership campaign had released a list of all of these, you know, eminent people who were doing these eminent roles. And the chair of our campaign, who had been around for a while, he said, well, this isn&#39;t my first rodeo. And he literally looked at the dozen people in front of him and he just pointed to us. And he&#39;s like, you</span>

            <span class="text">you are the logistics director. You are the operations director. And just happened to point to me. And I was the communications chair from that point forward and actually started a career in communications that way. Campaigns have a weird way of – and I&#39;d love to say that&#39;s because he saw something in me. I just think I happen to be the third person, and communications was the third thing he thought of. But that&#39;s how these things tend to work. And then if you can show yourself in those roles, you can turn those battlefield promotions into something permanent.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, how are you sourcing talent for a campaign? I love that you guys shared your stories of being plucked and promoted in your first sort of iteration of this. But now, if you&#39;re running it in 2021, how are you sourcing your talent? Is it partially your own team? Is it a combination of your own team and folks you know in the past and folks that you&#39;re willing to roll the dice on? What does that ratio look like? I&#39;m kind of curious how you think about these things from an operational standpoint.</span>

            <span class="text">start by saying if you&#39;re standing alone in a field, that doesn&#39;t make you a farmer. And one of the things about building a campaign team is it should be done by people who have worked on campaigns and know people who work campaigns. They can work their Rolodexes. They can get those individuals forward who have some of that capacity, have some of that skill, even if it was at a lower level. Maybe you&#39;re just incrementing them up a notch. Maybe you&#39;ve had some great conversations about ideas they&#39;ve had if they just had that next level up. But you start by reaching out to your network and seeing who might be interested in getting along with the ride. This is the extension of the comment that I made earlier. But then in any campaign, many</span>

And I can&#39;t tell – I mean I can&#39;t tell you how many friendships I&#39;ve gotten from those random connections over the years. And really I go back to a lot of what you&#39;re looking for in those situations is just sort of a can-do-it-ness.

Ruth Ruth Huber is her name, and she would work the phones, and she would browbeat you, and she would say, like, okay, so I&#39;m going to – she wouldn&#39;t even give you the options. She&#39;d say, hey, I saw you. You volunteered here, so I&#39;m going to put you down for door knocking on Wednesday. Oh, Wednesday&#39;s no good for you? Okay, I put you down for Thursday.

And when you come back, say, do you need help entering this data? Hey, do you need help sorting these lists, making this thing look a bit better? Hey, I&#39;m here anyways. You want me to help start sorting all of these things for a lit drop that are going on? Volunteer, make yourself active, actually deliver on the small things that you promised that you would do. And people are going to find you valuable. And when you&#39;re valuable, you get invited to more meetings. And then all of a sudden you are a strategist. All of a sudden you are a communications consultants who are telling like, I don&#39;t know about this piece. And hey, did you know this piece of literature when I was dropping it off? It doesn&#39;t fit in door, you know, the doorknobs very well, this door hanger doesn&#39;t fit quite right. And you become a valuable contributor to the campaign.

You know, okay, so we&#39;ve been talking primarily about the core campaign team, how one kind of finds themselves at the core. So there&#39;s two things I want to talk about. Number one, one more question on the core, regarding perhaps the stickiest issue in Canadian politics, which is compensation. And then secondly, I want to talk about the expanded campaign team. You guys talked about the pyramid scheme of volunteers, etc. I want to talk about that for a second. But as we stick with the core team,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. The conventional wisdom is in this country that people on campaigns, it&#39;s a commitment of passion. It&#39;s a commitment of giving back to your community. It&#39;s a commitment of wanting to see civic change. You don&#39;t get into this business to get rich. You don&#39;t get in this business to even get paid. That&#39;s been the conventional wisdom, and there&#39;s many reasons why, especially as we compare it to our friends down south, and we&#39;re campaigning in politics as an outright business in many ways, not just for practitioners, but for vendors and technologists, etc. How have you kind of, you know, from a high level, reconciled this approach of campaigns and how they, you know, compensate people?</span>

            <span class="text">central campaign, it&#39;s probably a paid gig. I&#39;ve not actually worked on any central campaign where the real jobs there are not paid gigs. And there&#39;s a lot of reasons for that, not least of which is you don&#39;t get the option of them not showing up one day as a volunteer. You need their time. It&#39;s got to be their full time. um there</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there are a lot of considerations on local campaigns as to why somebody gets paid or not and you there&#39;s i mean it&#39;s so fascinating how when you define these rules you just change all of these realities here because one of the big ones is spending caps during a campaign period in this country you can only spend so much money in most jurisdictions right and so you find out that you often find campaign managers almost have their compensation front loaded right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right outside of that campaign period? Is that within the spirit or even the letter of the law, depending on your jurisdiction? Great question. Not really well policed, but people</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people don&#39;t really want to spend money on staff during campaign periods because that&#39;s money they can&#39;t spend on lit drops and advertising online and other things that you can&#39;t get volunteers for, but you can get a volunteer for a staff position. Now, if we&#39;re being kind of rational about this, we always look at the marginal benefit and say, what is the marginal benefit of this paid professional over this volunteer I can get off the street who&#39;s pretty good, but not as good as them. But people tend to lean on people and say, come on, man, if I pay you, that means we could lose this campaign because I can&#39;t spend money on my third lit drop. So it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it becomes a question of strategy in a way that&#39;s beyond how much money do I have, I guess is the point that I want to make. And as a result, It really kind of pushes the professionalization to the margins. It pushes it to that time outside of the campaign periods. It pushes it to those third-party advertisers that Stephen was talking about earlier. It pushes it to organizations that are campaign adjacent and have access to Grind. And so that&#39;s an unintended consequence, but that&#39;s a real one in this country. And so you&#39;re finding that the professionals are almost fighting proxy wars with campaigns now, And they&#39;re getting their paychecks and they&#39;re getting their points outside of the campaigns proper, at least outside of the local campaigns. The provincial, national, regional bodies, those are usually paid professionals.</span>

Let&#39;s say it&#39;s a hybrid model, to use your earlier sort of classification. How many people do you think are getting paid on a campaign? How are you kind of structuring that from your standpoint?

And one that I feel like was really fun during the Nenshi campaign, the last one, was less so a promotion, but more so because I didn&#39;t run a tight ship. We had a person that Carter and I, and I think, Corey, you know pretty well, and I won&#39;t name them on the podcast, who stepped into the campaign office, which was located in downtown at around 5 p.m. or so. And this person was incredibly well-dressed, well put together. And the assumption made by myself and the office manager slash volunteer coordinator in the office was that this person was here for the 5 o&#39;clock policy meeting. turns out that they were definitely not there for that but were more so inquiring about the campaign uh turns out that we thought they were here for the policy meeting no one wanted to admit to anyone else that who invited this person they sit down at the policy meeting and they just start contributing to policy this is the third meeting of the policy committee and the first one where the candidate is attending and the candidate is just like i don&#39;t give a shit who this person is This person has some really good ideas. Long story short, they come up with the acronym that defines their policy for the campaign.</span>

            <span class="text">Guys, are you ready? Ready to close this marathon off. This has been fun. I like these deep dive episodes. We get to go into some of the nostalgia territory, talk about some of the things we&#39;re passionate about as process. But Stephen Carter, I&#39;ll start with you because I think I know Corey&#39;s answer on this. It&#39;s the dichotomy he presented. If you had to choose one or the other, if you had to choose one or the other on a political campaign between smart and experienced, which would you take?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Smart every time. The experience, it turns out that most of the time we&#39;re not doing rocket science here. we&#39;re running a campaign and trying to talk to people. So taking someone who&#39;s smart is almost always the best choice.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, give it to me again, smarter experience. We are taking smart, I think.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, these things change so much. Smart is worth its weight in gold. Unless when we&#39;re saying experiences, they literally every month do a different campaign. It&#39;s smart.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you for our next one. Overrated or underrated hierarchy on a political campaign? Overrated or underrated in your mind? Oh, hierarchy</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is overrated. Structure is underrated. I don&#39;t think you need to have big pyramids where everything flows, but you do need to know who&#39;s on what base and who&#39;s responsible for what. And I think campaigns often hand wave around that stuff. And often the biggest mistake they make is give two people roughly the same responsibilities, which creates tensions in that community you&#39;re trying to create. you do need to know what you are accountable for and you need to make sure other people know what you&#39;re accountable for that sharing of what everybody&#39;s job is is more than just titles it is you know let&#39;s say zane&#39;s the policy director that means he&#39;s ultimately responsible for the final draft of the policy document but he&#39;s going to take the input of the policy committee or it&#39;s zane holds the pen he writes the entire policy but you&#39;ve got to be clear on that because if you&#39;re zane and you think you hold the pen and it turns out you&#39;re the copy editor you&#39;re going to get frustrated. Everyone&#39;s going to get frustrated. You&#39;re going to have a bad time.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Overrated. No one wants to join a campaign at the very bottom rung of the ladder. They all want to feel valued and they all want to feel like they&#39;re making a contribution and they are. So even that, you know, Corey talked about the door knockers. I mean, voter</span>
