            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">This is the strategist emergency episode 906 and a half. My name is Zain Velji with me as always Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter guys. Happy emergency episode day.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It feels like we were just chatting like feels</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">like just yesterday. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, here&#39;s the thing, right? Often, we do episodes and often if Stephen Carter&#39;s involved, they&#39;re outdated very quickly.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and so this is one of those situations where i would say that if you uh have not listened to our episode from last night i&#39;d still say it&#39;s a worthy listen uh but i&#39;d say that a lot of the context and perhaps a lot of the developments that we have seen over the past 12 to 24 hours um are going to add a different tone and perhaps different tenor to uh to this episode and so let&#39;s Let&#39;s jump right into it. I have no segment titles. I have nothing. We&#39;re going to talk about the ongoing aloha gate in Alberta and then the ramifications and the ripple effects across the country. Because, Corey, I said yesterday Alberta was the heartbeat. You corrected me and said Alberta is probably the worst manifestation. Now I&#39;m not even sure of that because we&#39;re starting to see every order of government, Senate, senators, ethics chairs, our neighbors in Saskatchewan. This is a – it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s – and I hate to make light of this, but it&#39;s almost a viral sort of impact in terms of how quickly it&#39;s growing across the country. And maybe let&#39;s start there. Maybe let&#39;s start broad before we get into Alberta, and I&#39;ll throw it over to you, Corey, because we&#39;re making eye contact.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I struggle to think of a parallel here. I can&#39;t think of a situation where there was an event that was affecting every province, and so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so many of them had to deal with the fallout at the same time. This is pretty damning for the political class writ large, I would say. And I wonder what kind of like the broader – I don&#39;t want to get over – everybody gets all over the top on this and there&#39;s this recency bias. But, you know, we&#39;ve been living in such partisan times for so long. There&#39;s been this well-documented polarization. But what&#39;s really united Canadians in this moment is a giant fuck you attitude towards politicians who set a bunch of rules and then ignore them. And it&#39;s amazing to see how quickly this fallout is spreading across the country. It&#39;s amazing to see, you know, you see this whenever you&#39;ve got provinces kind of dealing with situations in parallel. You see this whenever organizations are dealing with situations in parallel. But there&#39;s this one-upmanship that&#39;s now happening, these stronger and stronger statements, the Nova Scotia conservative leader saying things like, oh, they&#39;d be out of my caucus in a heartbeat. I mean, that&#39;s even further than what the furthest was before that date.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;re in a weird one here, right? Right. I mean, ministers are dropping left, right and center. The ethics chair you mentioned, parliamentary secretaries basically are it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s unbelievable. And it&#39;s and it does not actually seem to have concluded at this point, although you have to imagine the worst is over just based on the amount of sleuthing that must be going on. You</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You know, Carter, we&#39;re we have some individuals, you know, conservative Senator Don Platt just came back to Canada. His punishment, so to speak, has not been decided. Conservative MP David Sweet resigned as the committee chair, the ethics committee chair. Saskatchewan cabinet minister, who was the minister of highways, I believe, had an excuse that he was out finalizing a home sale. They called BS on that. And now he&#39;s gone all across the board. It&#39;s seeming to afflict every sort of political stripe. And then, of course, the bloodbath here in Alberta that we saw, which is partially and I&#39;d say largely the reason we&#39;re recording tonight&#39;s episode, which was the chief of staff gone, Tracy Allard, the minister of municipal affairs gone, and demotions for a lot of parliamentary secretaries. So to pick up on Corey&#39;s comments, Carter, have you seen anything like this before, a riptide like this in Canadian politics?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t think I have. I mean, I&#39;m used to seeing something like this in a single province at a single time. You know, like you may see things repeat. And one of the things that&#39;s really upsetting for me on this is that obviously Canadian politicians weren&#39;t listening to our American podcast, You the People, where we talked about, you know, Gavin Newsom running into this same type of thing when, you know, he was ignoring COVID rules that he&#39;d set forward. forward. There&#39;s been mayors that have ignored their own COVID protocols that have been in deep trouble. This isn&#39;t exactly new. What is new is you add in the flavoring of the Christmas season and you add in the egregiousness of the travel. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And that is really what&#39;s creating the total upswell across the country. So this is predictable. This was avoidable. People who followed politics should have been able to predict that this was going to happen. And I would posit, that would add to Corey&#39;s earlier point, this is going to have long-term impact beyond just the parties that were involved. This is going to have long-term impact on the overall trustworthiness of politicians. Are we willing to trust politicians? Are we willing to give a select group of people the ability to govern us when we simply have been proven time and time again that they can&#39;t be trusted? it. I&#39;m tired of having politics undermined by the actions of the politicians. It is time that we started having stronger and stronger consequence for those actions.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I do like that line, politics being undermined by the politicians. I think in a roundabout way, you&#39;re asking for a dictatorship of</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">some sort. But not a dictatorship</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is the conclusion of most Most of Stephen Carter&#39;s rants.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, no, this is good. Like I said, often dated very quickly when we record with Stephen. Corey, let&#39;s remind our listeners of what happened in Alberta today in a series of, not a series, sorry, in a social media post, if I&#39;m not mistaken, I believe a release, if you guys can confirm that for me. I don&#39;t know if there was an official release. No, it was a Facebook</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Facebook post and then on Twitter. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And on Twitter. Okay, so I&#39;m reading the tweet right here, a statement by the premier saying that, you You know, millions of Albertans have made real sacrifices over the past 10 months to help keep each other safe. Last Friday, I took responsibility for not being clear enough. Over the weekend, I learned that Albertans were sending a clear message that they want to see real consequences, and thereby the following. Municipal Affairs Minister Tracy Allard, I&#39;ve accepted her resignation. I have asked my chief of staff to step down. And I want to talk about the difference from resigning and asking. So remind</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">remind me about that. Oh, Stephen&#39;s probably got something. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I have a few. I have a few thoughts.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Remind me about that. And perhaps it starts with the letter S that ends with Everance. We also have MLA Jeremy Nixon, parliamentary secretary, his resignation from his post. MLA Jason Steffen, no longer on Treasury Board. And then MLA&#39;s Tanya Furr, Pat Wren, and Tanya Yao, who is yet to be located, I believe, still in Mexico somewhere, so we believe, have lost their legislature committee responsibilities. responsibilities. And then he lists the replacements for for some of those interim posts, chief of staff and municipal affairs minister in particular. Corey, did this surprise you? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I guess it did. Because it was I mean, Jesus Christ, what a bloodbath was was the reason it was only a social media post and not a news conference, because Kenny was at his nephew&#39;s baptism. Like, holy fuck, talk about settling scores all over the place. The you know, No, I think we do need to talk about the style and the substance separately here. I agree. Let&#39;s talk about the substance for a minute.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It is a big deal to lose your chief of staff anytime. The chief of staff is an incredibly important role. There is a ramp up to these things.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And if you don&#39;t believe that, just look at kind of the gap and the hiccup they had in communications when Katie Merrifield left and Brock Harrison came in. And I think part of the reason there was such a bad press conference on January 1st, no slight to Brock here, is it&#39;s really tough to tell the new boss you&#39;re out of your goddamn mind. So if the new boss wants to do something and you&#39;re in the job for all of three weeks, maybe you can&#39;t really feel like you&#39;ve got the ability to talk about it. So there&#39;s a bit of a ramp up whenever you&#39;ve got a senior staff person like that who is jumping into a new role.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And as mentioned, Katie Merrifield, Executive Director of Communications and Planning, recently left. Howard Anglin, recently left. Jamie Huckabee recently left. That&#39;s three very serious hitters in the Premier&#39;s office that have been replaced in the past couple of weeks here, or have left, I guess is a better way to put it. You know, Jamie didn&#39;t really get the choice, but that&#39;s going to really affect operations for quite some time. So I think people are saying not enough.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Fair enough. And you can have that argument. And this is a pretty serious thing. So I get it. But it&#39;s a big deal. You know, this is an important role that you&#39;ve just let go. Allard, actually, I think is a lot more digestible. You&#39;ve got to keep in mind, she hasn&#39;t been in the role very long, Minister of Municipal Affairs. Ministers get shuffled. The system actually digests that a little bit better. Because there&#39;s very formal department onboardings that happen with ministers. There&#39;s continuity of government plans that are much more established for ministers of the crown. Now, when you get into the parliamentary secretaries and the committee placements, it doesn&#39;t actually mean very much at all. But it&#39;s a pretty clear signal that, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know, you&#39;re not going to make it to cabinet. Like, you&#39;ve got to be clear here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">desire of anybody who&#39;s not in cabinet is to be in cabinet. And the desire of anyone in cabinet is to stay in cabinet and maybe someday become the premier. Maybe. Not everybody wants that particular burden. but um the uh the notion that you are moving backwards and unlikely to find your way back to the table or to the table in the first place is going to be that&#39;s going to hurt for a lot of those mlas there&#39;s no doubt about that carter</span>

And everybody that&#39;s in that office speaks with the single voice of the premier. year. And in today&#39;s parliamentary democracies, those offices are extremely powerful. So when you lose or you fire a chief of staff, frankly, you tend to lose the next election. If you&#39;re firing a chief of staff, I mean, if you think back of Nigel Wright, when he was fired by Stephen Harper, they lost the next election. Rob Ford fired his chief of staff and died. And Alison Redford fired me and didn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t able to continue on part of that is the premier&#39;s office is the election hub it is the governance hub it is everything and if you start throwing your chief of staff away especially in light of losing your principal communicator and your primary the the the secretary what&#39;s i can&#39;t remember the role that howard had yeah</span>

I mean, any of us idiots can say, have you lost your fucking mind? he&#39;s never going to hear it but when gerald butts says it or when katie telford says it katie telford says to the prime minister you&#39;ve lost your fucking mind he hears it and he stops his actions because that&#39;s the relationship that a chief of staff needs to have this next person just saw the guy in front of him get fired he&#39;s</span>

And if that can be proven that he knew these things before, perhaps that&#39;s the one. But there&#39;s no one else. There&#39;s no one but him now. Okay,</span>

            <span class="text">the medium as well in terms of, you know, the media in a second. But Corey, you bring up a really interesting point here, which is Kenny&#39;s future. And I wanted to discuss this a little bit later, but you mentioned it right now. Does the fact that the blast zone of this particular crisis expand across the country perhaps shelter him from the fact that this is not an Alberta-specific isolated incident? He&#39;s not the only, quote unquote, leader facing it. Does that perhaps shelter him in a certain way? Or does that perhaps catalyze his demise and his exposure as you see it right now for his leadership? So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s a really interesting question, Zanon. I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but the reality is if everybody&#39;s in the same boat, that does offer a certain amount of protection. Part of why I think Jason Kenney was in such a challenging position yesterday is he had staked out a much more moderate position towards dealing – well, moderate. He didn&#39;t do anything. And that was what Albertans were reacting to here. So, so perhaps, perhaps this is one of those things where it&#39;s just going to be a pox on all of their houses and nobody&#39;s going to want to drop a leader over it. And I don&#39;t want to sound histrionic.</span>

I think the risk of there being some sort of memo, some sort of caucus member who is a bit cynical and perhaps didn&#39;t – perhaps even had a conversation with someone in the premier&#39;s orbit or the whip or something like that who says, no, we were basically told if you do it, be quiet or something like that.

They&#39;ve done their research. They had the phone around. They made sure the whip&#39;s office, I&#39;m sure, was super busy over the weekend. They knew where everybody was and the shoes that could drop or, you know, memos and those types of things. The paperwork. I mean, we saw a letter today from Tracy Allard to the chief of staff telling, you know, saying that Rick McIver was going to cover off the ministry for her. He&#39;d very kindly offered. I mean, it didn&#39;t say where she was going to go.</span>

And you got to know that people love to see a defector, love to see a defector. And because of the nature of social media and the way that content that comes, you know, that you want to share gets shared, and then it goes to more people and spreads and spreads and spreads, you can convince yourself that there&#39;s a bigger thing going on on the other side than one person jumping over the wall. And this could just be a couple of people jumping over the wall.</span>

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s let&#39;s expand out back to the federal scene or back to a more federal conversation about this. We talked about the blast radius of this particular scandal reaching every part of the country. We are now seeing, and I don&#39;t even know where I&#39;m going with this question other than to say, what</span>

            <span class="text">what is the ceiling on fatigue, Carter? Because this kind of reminds me in a slightly odd parallel as to some of my time with the Notley campaign last election, where the war room was just such an unbelievably potent part of the campaign that they came out with Bozer eruption on day one, Kenny had to take action. Bozer eruption on day two, he had to take action. Day three, take action. Day 19, he&#39;s like, fuck it, I don&#39;t give a shit. People were fatigued out. And I know that&#39;s a weird parallel to draw, but is there a fatigue ceiling here to something like this when the ninth, you know, parliamentary secretary in Manitoba comes out as something, you know, that they went overseas? Is it going to matter as much as what happened yesterday or the day before or the day before that? every</span>

            <span class="text">single time we talk about an issue uh on this podcast or on you the people the truth is we&#39;re going to be driving past that issue and moving into something else um by the next podcast most people you know i was reminded of the we charity debacle uh today on on 770 and it was it&#39;s kind of ridiculous i mean where&#39;s the we um charity debacle does anybody even remember does anybody care is it going to guide people when they vote uh in you know the fall of 2021 uh for the next federal government? Probably not. Is this going to stick? No, this doesn&#39;t stick. This one specific detail doesn&#39;t stick and it doesn&#39;t carry forward. What changes is, does this change the brand perception? Does this change the relationship with my brand? So if you think of this as simply a consumer transaction, a bunch of people had really bad pizza.</span>

            <span class="text">Will they still buy pizza? Probably, right? They may change brands. They may change where they&#39;re getting their pizza, but they still eat pizza. And they&#39;re still going to vote. You know, Albertans are still going to vote conservative unless the brand becomes so toxic that they can&#39;t anymore. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And the story that I&#39;m starting to see is that people are moving away from the brand for good. They&#39;re no longer eating pizza. And that and that is a that&#39;s the the challenge that all of these things have together is that when it happens once, it&#39;s OK. Maybe twice You can rationalize it away. But when it really starts to redefine the brand, people move away and stay away. And I think that that&#39;s what Kenny has to start worrying about now.</span>

But is there perhaps something to say to someone who has to let go of a minister or a parliamentary secretary around perhaps trying to be the one that bucks the trend again, similar to what Kenny did to try to set a new template as to what&#39;s acceptable? Do you kind of see that territory emerging in this particular discourse, Carter? I</span>

I want to give both of you just a chance to round it out before I move to one final question. Anything you&#39;re looking at from the national level, from our provincial level, like the next thing you have yourself keenly focused on, what are you looking at? I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think this is just all really good news for Trudeau. I mean, yes, he lost a couple of parliamentary secretaries, but this seems to be being born the same as the COVID problem, primarily by conservative premiers. And that just makes him happy every single day. I also wanted to say that, you know, the metrics of this, it still has to, we have to keep in mind that all of this is existing in a COVID world. So tying it together with COVID to me is important. And, you know, we had over 100 deaths again, or 96 deaths in four days, or the four or five days of Aloha Gate, as it were. were another few thousand people diagnosed with COVID and watching what&#39;s happening with this new strain in the UK. I&#39;ll tell you something, if we get the UK strain, it will not matter whether or not Jamie Huckabee came down with the disease. There&#39;s your poster boy for the UK strain coming to Alberta and that will have lasting impact.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, these are not one-offs at this point. There&#39;s too many of them for you to call this one-off, right? It&#39;s systemic. And that means the system needs to be changed. And the challenge for governments always is when</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when you have a situation like this where the public broadly says there is something foundationally wrong, how are we going to stop these fucks from acting this way, is you change it or people are going to change it for you. You&#39;re already seeing this with opposition statements in places like Nova Scotia, raising the stakes, saying this is what the consequences of such an action should be. So oppositions are going to call for system-wide changes. Some of them could be very strident. Some of them could be perhaps even regrettable with hindsight because there won&#39;t be an awful lot of gray in them. They&#39;ll be all black and white. What are you going to do as a government to shut these holes, to make sure that there&#39;s not comparable problems going forward? Solving that problem is one of self-preservation. It&#39;s not just, you know, batting away the opposition in the current moment. It&#39;s if this happens again or a variant of it happens again, it doesn&#39;t need to be the same thing. It doesn&#39;t even need to be COVID.</span>
