            <div class="said">and so this is one of those situations where i would say that if you uh have not listened to our episode from last night i&#39;d still say it&#39;s a worthy listen uh but i&#39;d say that a lot of the context and perhaps a lot of the developments that we have seen over the past 12 to 24 hours um are going to add a different tone and perhaps different tenor to uh to this episode and so let&#39;s Let&#39;s jump right into it. I have no segment titles. I have nothing. We&#39;re going to talk about the ongoing aloha gate in Alberta and then the ramifications and the ripple effects across the country. Because, Corey, I said yesterday Alberta was the heartbeat. You corrected me and said Alberta is probably the worst manifestation. Now I&#39;m not even sure of that because we&#39;re starting to see every order of government, Senate, senators, ethics chairs, our neighbors in Saskatchewan. This is a – it&#39;s almost like it&#39;s – and I hate to make light of this, but it&#39;s almost a viral sort of impact in terms of how quickly it&#39;s growing across the country. And maybe let&#39;s start there. Maybe let&#39;s start broad before we get into Alberta, and I&#39;ll throw it over to you, Corey, because we&#39;re making eye contact.</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">Yeah, I struggle to think of a parallel here. I can&#39;t think of a situation where there was an event that was affecting every province, and so</div>
          </div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">so many of them had to deal with the fallout at the same time. This is pretty damning for the political class writ large, I would say. And I wonder what kind of like the broader – I don&#39;t want to get over – everybody gets all over the top on this and there&#39;s this recency bias. But, you know, we&#39;ve been living in such partisan times for so long. There&#39;s been this well-documented polarization. But what&#39;s really united Canadians in this moment is a giant fuck you attitude towards politicians who set a bunch of rules and then ignore them. And it&#39;s amazing to see how quickly this fallout is spreading across the country. It&#39;s amazing to see, you know, you see this whenever you&#39;ve got provinces kind of dealing with situations in parallel. You see this whenever organizations are dealing with situations in parallel. But there&#39;s this one-upmanship that&#39;s now happening, these stronger and stronger statements, the Nova Scotia conservative leader saying things like, oh, they&#39;d be out of my caucus in a heartbeat. I mean, that&#39;s even further than what the furthest was before that date.</div>

            <div class="said">You know, Carter, we&#39;re we have some individuals, you know, conservative Senator Don Platt just came back to Canada. His punishment, so to speak, has not been decided. Conservative MP David Sweet resigned as the committee chair, the ethics committee chair. Saskatchewan cabinet minister, who was the minister of highways, I believe, had an excuse that he was out finalizing a home sale. They called BS on that. And now he&#39;s gone all across the board. It&#39;s seeming to afflict every sort of political stripe. And then, of course, the bloodbath here in Alberta that we saw, which is partially and I&#39;d say largely the reason we&#39;re recording tonight&#39;s episode, which was the chief of staff gone, Tracy Allard, the minister of municipal affairs gone, and demotions for a lot of parliamentary secretaries. So to pick up on Corey&#39;s comments, Carter, have you seen anything like this before, a riptide like this in Canadian politics?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">don&#39;t think I have. I mean, I&#39;m used to seeing something like this in a single province at a single time. You know, like you may see things repeat. And one of the things that&#39;s really upsetting for me on this is that obviously Canadian politicians weren&#39;t listening to our American podcast, You the People, where we talked about, you know, Gavin Newsom running into this same type of thing when, you know, he was ignoring COVID rules that he&#39;d set forward. forward. There&#39;s been mayors that have ignored their own COVID protocols that have been in deep trouble. This isn&#39;t exactly new. What is new is you add in the flavoring of the Christmas season and you add in the egregiousness of the travel. And</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">And that is really what&#39;s creating the total upswell across the country. So this is predictable. This was avoidable. People who followed politics should have been able to predict that this was going to happen. And I would posit, that would add to Corey&#39;s earlier point, this is going to have long-term impact beyond just the parties that were involved. This is going to have long-term impact on the overall trustworthiness of politicians. Are we willing to trust politicians? Are we willing to give a select group of people the ability to govern us when we simply have been proven time and time again that they can&#39;t be trusted? it. I&#39;m tired of having politics undermined by the actions of the politicians. It is time that we started having stronger and stronger consequence for those actions.</div>

And then he lists the replacements for for some of those interim posts, chief of staff and municipal affairs minister in particular. Corey, did this surprise you? Yeah,</div>

And I think part of the reason there was such a bad press conference on January 1st, no slight to Brock here, is it&#39;s really tough to tell the new boss you&#39;re out of your goddamn mind. So if the new boss wants to do something and you&#39;re in the job for all of three weeks, maybe you can&#39;t really feel like you&#39;ve got the ability to talk about it.

You&#39;ve got to keep in mind, she hasn&#39;t been in the role very long, Minister of Municipal Affairs. Ministers get shuffled. The system actually digests that a little bit better. Because there&#39;s very formal department onboardings that happen with ministers. There&#39;s continuity of government plans that are much more established for ministers of the crown.

And I wanted to discuss this a little bit later, but you mentioned it right now. Does the fact that the blast zone of this particular crisis expand across the country perhaps shelter him from the fact that this is not an Alberta-specific isolated incident? He&#39;s not the only, quote unquote, leader facing it. Does that perhaps shelter him in a certain way?

I hadn&#39;t thought about it, but the reality is if everybody&#39;s in the same boat, that does offer a certain amount of protection. Part of why I think Jason Kenney was in such a challenging position yesterday is he had staked out a much more moderate position towards dealing – well, moderate. He didn&#39;t do anything. And that was what Albertans were reacting to here. So, so perhaps, perhaps this is one of those things where it&#39;s just going to be a pox on all of their houses and nobody&#39;s going to want to drop a leader over it.

I think the risk of there being some sort of memo, some sort of caucus member who is a bit cynical and perhaps didn&#39;t – perhaps even had a conversation with someone in the premier&#39;s orbit or the whip or something like that who says, no, we were basically told if you do it, be quiet or something like that. The risk of some conversation like that happening is, in my opinion, quite high because, in my opinion, it&#39;s impossible that the premier did not know that these people were leaving, right?</div>

They knew where everybody was and the shoes that could drop or, you know, memos and those types of things. The paperwork. I mean, we saw a letter today from Tracy Allard to the chief of staff telling, you know, saying that Rick McIver was going to cover off the ministry for her. He&#39;d very kindly offered.

Bozer eruption on day two, he had to take action. Day three, take action. Day 19, he&#39;s like, fuck it, I don&#39;t give a shit. People were fatigued out. And I know that&#39;s a weird parallel to draw, but is there a fatigue ceiling here to something like this when the ninth, you know, parliamentary secretary in Manitoba comes out as something, you know, that they went overseas?

And that just makes him happy every single day. I also wanted to say that, you know, the metrics of this, it still has to, we have to keep in mind that all of this is existing in a COVID world. So tying it together with COVID to me is important. And, you know, we had over 100 deaths again, or 96 deaths in four days, or the four or five days of Aloha Gate, as it were. were another few thousand people diagnosed with COVID and watching what&#39;s happening with this new strain in the UK.

So oppositions are going to call for system-wide changes. Some of them could be very strident. Some of them could be perhaps even regrettable with hindsight because there won&#39;t be an awful lot of gray in them. They&#39;ll be all black and white. What are you going to do as a government to shut these holes, to make sure that there&#39;s not comparable problems going forward? Solving that problem is one of self-preservation. It&#39;s not just, you know, batting away the opposition in the current moment. It&#39;s if this happens again or a variant of it happens again, it doesn&#39;t need to be the same thing.
