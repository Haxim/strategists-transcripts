            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to the headlines, guys. So many headlines to cover, so many stories to cover. Let&#39;s start here with the CBC. Justice Minister accidentally tweets that one of his campaign donors will become a judge. That&#39;s right. Officially, Justice Minister David Lamedi appointed five new judges across the country this week. On Twitter, however, Lamedi announced three additional appointments, including that of a Montreal lawyer to the Quebec Superior Court. The tweets were subsequently deleted and the minister&#39;s office say they were posted by mistake by the civil servants managing the account. Stephen Carter, is this Daniel Urba, if I&#39;m pronouncing it correctly, it&#39;s probably French, I&#39;m assuming. Is he ever going to make it on the Quebec Superior Court now that this article has come out?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I would be very surprised. uh this is the type of uh thing that just kills kills careers um and i don&#39;t you know most of the time these donors aren&#39;t giving that much money it just kills me that people think that you know a politician can be bought for 1300 or 1500 bucks i mean give</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">give me an absolute break no one is buying their way onto a onto the bench uh most often by the way a significant pay cut um so that they can can, you know, just,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">just, you know, oh, let me give you $1,500 every year for five years and you&#39;ll put me on the bench. Like, give me a break. There&#39;s just no such corruption in Canada. And the fact that journalists continue to imply that politicians can be bought for $1,500 leads me to the conclusion that journalists can be bought for $1,500.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, well, that was all very wrong. I mean, he&#39;s right about many things, but he&#39;s somewhat wrong about this So it is very possible to be acting in a corrupt fashion when you appoint your friends or your supporters. And let&#39;s face it, money often comes also with volunteerism and other things like that. Or perhaps it&#39;s somebody who&#39;s a bag man who is going out and accumulating $1,500 contributions from 10 people, 100 people. These things are all possible. So let&#39;s not dismiss the possibility out of hand. And it is a bit outrageous to suggest that corruption does not exist in this country. If this was a call-in show, I would ask Canadians coast to coast to say, hey, tell me your most corrupt story. And you would have Quebec say, no, we&#39;re the most corrupt. You should see the corruption we&#39;ve had in the past. The mob&#39;s been involved. And you&#39;d have Saskatchewan say, fuck you, Quebec. Most of our government went to jail once in the 90s. Yeah, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you have to go back 40 years to find that now. 40 years ago. You</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You really don&#39;t. This is – we saw it. We had it. We moved on. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, sure. It&#39;s solved. We&#39;ve solved corruption. That&#39;s great. But here&#39;s the thing I will say that I somewhat agree with you on is it&#39;s not totally outrageous that somebody would be both a donor and a legitimate candidate for these offices. And it&#39;s certainly true that going from lawyer to judge is often a step down in pay. It depends on the type of law. It&#39;s not always, but it quite often is. And the thing</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">thing is, if you were thinking about these things, let&#39;s just say, let&#39;s just live in a world of total naivety for a minute, almost as a thought exercise. If you just wanted to appoint judges who were like you, wouldn&#39;t you appoint people who were like you? And isn&#39;t being a donor somewhat an example of somebody seeing the world in a similar fashion to you? I mean, it&#39;s not necessarily a corrupt act, but there&#39;s a reason we have these protections in place. What I think is most interesting, though, is that there was a tweet formulated that said, there is this appointment, and</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s good. Or was this a situation where they were on the list and they were pulled off the list? Because that happens too. Like there might be a situation where you&#39;re going to name these people and during the final vetting, you&#39;re like, no, they can&#39;t be on. And the irony here is one of the reasons they may have decided the individual could not be on is because they</span>

If you don&#39;t get that reference, it&#39;s from Mr. Show, and you should definitely Google Mr. Show pre-taped call-in. Let&#39;s move into our next article and our next headline. Stephen Carter, this is for you because I have promised you I&#39;ve made a vow of sorts that I would keep you updated on all the vaccine incentive programs across the world. And this is going to West Virginia because West Virginia to give away guns as vaccine incentive. That is right, Stephen Carter. West Virginia will be giving away guns as an incentive to get residents of the state inoculated against COVID-19. The drawings will run from Father&#39;s Day, June 20th to August 4th, and will include a variety of prizes from cash to firearms and yes, even trucks. During the Father&#39;s Day drawing, the state will give away five custom hunting rifles and five custom hunting shotguns. Stephen Carter, is this something that we should be considering here in our great province of Alberta, the giveaway of</span>

            <span class="text">now. Yeah, let&#39;s not talk about Carter misreading situations. Let&#39;s move on to our next headline. This one comes to us from the Canadian press. Majority of conservative MPs vote in favor of defeated sex-selective abortion bill. I want to spend a bit of time on this one, guys. A majority of conservative leader Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s caucus voted in favor of a bill that sought to restrict certain abortions, even as he voted it down, saying he respects a woman&#39;s right to choose. What do we have here? Saskatchewan MP Kathy, I believe, Wagenthal brought forward Bill C-233, which sought to ban doctors from performing an abortion based on the sex of a fetus, which was defeated in a 248 to 82 vote this past week. All but one of the votes cast in its favor came from the conservatives who have 119 members, with the other coming from former party MP and leadership contender Derek Sloan. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you first on this. What do you think of this as it relates to Aaron O&#39;Toole voting it down, but still having a majority of MPs voting in favor of it?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, this represents what we&#39;ve talked about before. There are multiple factions within the Conservative Party. For many Conservatives, the abortion question has not been settled in Canada. I think for most Canadians, the abortion issue has been settled in Canada. It is not an issue that you will get elected running on most of the time, unless you&#39;re coming from a very Conservative area. It is certainly not an issue that will get you an elected national government. But you can win a nomination race on it. You can win a nomination race on it very, very easily. And so oftentimes the people who are selected to represent us don&#39;t necessarily represent the majority&#39;s viewpoint. They represent a very small portion of it. And I think that the Conservative Party has had challenges in the past managing this particular issue, and they continue to have challenges now. And I would bet they&#39;re going to have challenges in the future.</span>

            <span class="text">I think that I certainly don&#39;t assume that Canadians are opposed to banning sex-selective abortion. The only polling I&#39;ve ever seen on it, and it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen it, is like 60%, two-thirds opposed to</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sex-selective abortion. And, you know, there are camps, obviously, who are absolutists on both sides. Yes, an abortion should always be legal, and no, an abortion should never be legal. But the reality, although the activists on both sides, neither side likes to acknowledge it, is that most Canadians live in a certain amount of grey on this matter.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And if you push the people who are more by default, you should never allow an abortion. They&#39;re like, well, what about in cases of rape or incest? You&#39;ll see it very quickly go, oh, yes, okay, well, that seems a reasonable reason to have an abortion. abortion uh but the flip side version of that on the other side is you should always be allowed to have an abortion but do you think you should be able to just abort a child just because they&#39;re or a fetus just because they&#39;re it&#39;s a female fetus right and you</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I want to get your reaction to what Cordy said there in terms of his calculus, in terms of sex-selective abortion perhaps being one of the fringe cases, so to speak, on the abortion question.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It is a fringe case. It is a manufactured thing that people imagine that there&#39;s a stream of women going and making this choice based on that type of criteria. but it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a manufactured issue and when you kind of break down to it if you if you have intellectual conversations with people and you show statistics and you&#39;d have a discussion about it you quickly find that it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a red herring it&#39;s not an actual thing um that people are doing uh in canada i mean i suspect that you know when when china had its one child rule maybe there was a different type of situation but in canada this is uh this isn&#39;t necessarily the the the driving reason for why women are choosing to have an abortion. So I think that Corey&#39;s right. People generally don&#39;t want sex-selective abortions in Canada, but I think that in general it&#39;s used as a red herring, a whataboutism for the right wing to try and sneak one past the pro-choice lobby.</span>

You know, his leadership has always been a little bit rocky post-convention when he kind of gave that speech, the membership voted against it, you know, really trying to pick a lane with his caucus and with his membership. Does this just extend the narrative on the leadership woes, or do you feel like that could be overblown in your mind?</span>

            <span class="text">Aaron O&#39;Toole knew that this was something that could otherwise be used to paint his party as, you know, extremist, because that is that&#39;s even now how the conversation is playing out. But he also knew that this was not something particularly in conservative leaning ridings that would go over well if the entire CPC. I&#39;m not even sure he could have delivered the entire CPC because I&#39;m quite sure he couldn&#39;t, in fact. But this may have been an attempt to cleverly deal with the issue. Does it work? I would say no. But I also think that it&#39;s going to make it a little bit more difficult for the liberals to throw it at him during a general election.</span>

Guys, I want to talk about two stories, both, you know, almost reeking of elitism, both to do with the air, both to do with the sky. Let me tease them out to you, and then we&#39;ll talk about one and then the other. The first one, of course, here in Alberta, where we sit, where Jason Kenney is pictured alongside his fellow cabinet ministers sitting on the patio of the federal building, also known as the Sky Palace. We&#39;ll get into the long history of that in a second. And the story thereafter? Well, Air Canada, after inking a deal with the federal government, which they indicated they would cap their executive compensation to a million dollars until the loan, the nearly $6 billion loan that the government has provided them, is fully repaid, sneakily greenlit $10 million of bonuses for their executives. it is. I want to talk about the ramifications of that for Air Canada, as well as for the government that seems to have gotten played a bit on this deal. Maybe you disagree. But let&#39;s start in Alberta with the story in the sky known as the Sky Palace. As I said earlier, Premier Jason Kenney&#39;s office is defending photos that showed the Premier and his senior cabinet ministers sitting on a patio at the Sky Palace in the federal building saying they&#39;re not in violation of COVID-19 gathering rules. Seems like they might be, but we&#39;ll talk about that. But photos obtained by multiple media outlets indicate Joe Kenney, Health Minister Shandro, Environment and Parks Minister Nixon, Finance Minister Taves, and at least two others sitting on the patio of the offices commonly known as the Sky Palace. They also have two other folks who appear to be servers that are also pictured not wearing masks. Stephen Carter, I want to start with you first.</span>

What did happen, though, was the premier and her staff went directly to the team building, the federal building, and requested that the top floor be turned into a penthouse of some sort, a premier&#39;s residence. residents we&#39;re one of the few promise and provinces that don&#39;t have a premier&#39;s residence was sold during the Klein era and so getting a premier&#39;s residence back was deemed to be a priority by the premier</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So the Sky Palace itself was a major screw up that kind of took down a premier. Corey, do you want to add anything to the contextual history of Sky Palace before I talk to you about what political sins Premier Kennedy&#39;s cabinet have committed with this photo evidence? Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the thing that Stephen didn&#39;t mention, but is really important to underline is that as a result of everything he just described, the space has basically been deemed cursed, just absolutely</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fucking cursed. So they made a last minute pivot to change the nature of the space from an apartment to quote unquote offices and hosting space. I worked in the federal building for four years and it was like a rite of passage. People would come in and ask with morbid curiosity, can I see the Sky Palace? Can you take me up to see this penthouse apartment? And I would, you know, I would take them up and I would show them. And inevitably, people would be in uproarious laughter because the idea that it was supposed to be an office because this was sort of the back justification that was made, there was an attempt to sort of pretend for a while, at least that it was not actually going to be an apartment. Like the quote unquote offices were these small, weirdly shaped rooms with closets in them. It</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was not an office space. It was clearly an apartment. Even with kind of the adjustments made, it was so obviously meant to be a place somebody lived and so obviously not meant to be a place somebody worked. But the NDP government really avoided the space as a result. And in most of my time in government, and in the early days of the UCP, they seem to as well.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">In most of my time in government, the people who use that space were bureaucrats. Like, if there was a farewell party, if somebody was retiring, we would go up there and we would do our speeches. If there was a Christmas party, we would go up there and, you know, there&#39;d be the spread of food or whatnot. But the politicians sort of all</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">all shied away from it, all got pretty scared of it. And nobody really wanted to be associated with the quote unquote Sky Palace. And so, good or bad, and you can argue bad, because all of a sudden, there&#39;s this government space that&#39;s just not being used, but it&#39;s still being maintained. People stayed the hell away from it. The 11th floor of the federal building, which is the floor this is, has had for almost all of my time there, nothing in it, no activity, certainly nobody was ever situated there. And it was used very intermittently, like I said, almost entirely by bureaucrats. So the place has taken on kind of this cursed feel.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is a bit of a tempest in a teapot here. And the main reason I believe that to be the case is that we are now coming out of these restrictions, right? And people are generally confused as to what&#39;s allowed and what&#39;s not allowed. And the situation is, you know, obviously not, not following the rules. Like I actually, I will say, I think where the government has gone truly awry is on pretending that this was all above board and that there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s violating the COVID restrictions in this sense. But I just don&#39;t think people carry that much that, that it was broken. And in December, when</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when we had Aloha Gate, the situation was foundationally different. People were making big sacrifices of things that they wanted to do and that they weren&#39;t being allowed to do, and they were staying home for the Christmas break. And yet we had MLAs, we had cabinet ministers, we had them flying off and going everywhere and having a grand old time. And that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that brought kind of a visceral reaction back. Here, it&#39;s more like your crime is jumping the gun. We know in two weeks, this is going to be the basic state of play anyhow. And so I just don&#39;t believe that the outrage is nearly as high on this one as it was during Aloha Gate. I think part of the reason the coverage and the commentary is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">hitting a pitch that&#39;s similar to Aloha Gate is everybody knows how big of a deal that was, but they&#39;re fighting the last war. I think if you were to canvas 100 people, they would say, yeah, it&#39;s fucking bullshit. I hate those assholes. But that&#39;s because that&#39;s sort of the foundational feeling people have about the government right now. The government&#39;s unpopular right now. I don&#39;t think that this has dramatically changed the popularity of the government to the negative. Carter&#39;s right. Was it a social visit? Was it work? I don&#39;t think people are entirely outraged by the notion that working late into the night, the premier might have had a drink. Certainly, we&#39;ve all worked in politics. I think we know how common just casual drinking is in those environments, whether you want to endorse it or not. That is sort of, let&#39;s just say, a multi-party fascination.</span>

And ultimately, it does pile on to an overall feeling about the government. But I just, you know, I don&#39;t know that it does anything more than reinforce. I don&#39;t think it changes minds. I still don&#39;t. And it&#39;ll be interesting to see how people react to this. It certainly knocks them off agenda. And I bet you it really irritates caucus.</span>

This is, in many ways, it&#39;s not like a thing that was done. It&#39;s kind of a visual that, you know, you have to see it, the white linen cloth, as you mentioned, the sparkling water, etc. Carter, you know, putting in your campaign game face on, how would you leverage a photo like this if we were heading into campaign mode? If you were a TPA or if you were the NDP, would this act as a proof point to you? So Corey says, you know, people may not necessarily be concerned because they might be jumping the gun. Corey might be right about that. But if we look two years in the future, do you feel like this image could mean something to the broader political conversation to remind Albertans about, you know, an element of Jason Kenney? And if so, which element would that be for you?</span>

He campaigns in the blue pickup truck because he&#39;s the everyman, right? He&#39;s the every Albertan, except, you know, it&#39;s not really his truck he&#39;s just borrowing it borrowing the lease right and and it&#39;s not really his genes and it&#39;s not really his food um so my you know if i were running a war room i&#39;d probably be pulling this up every time we were talking about his entitlement you know he</span>

And I actually don&#39;t, I don&#39;t think that photo does it because frankly, you can&#39;t see Jason Kenney well enough for starters. So you wouldn&#39;t use it in a campaign attack ad. It just, it doesn&#39;t, it creates a nice tapestry for an attack ad, but it doesn&#39;t have the principal actor in it.

            <span class="text">I think the angle, if I can offer a very quick opinion, is exactly what you said, Corey. It&#39;s these folks at the top floor of this building, white linen cloth. This is less about COVID restrictions, more about how they act as, you know, selling themselves as one thing. In this case, a leader who sells himself to Carter&#39;s Point, flannel shirt, blue pickup truck, but acts in this other way. I think there&#39;s perhaps something in that direction. Not to say how much, you know, you&#39;ll have to see how much legs it has two years from now. But I think it&#39;s that direction, not even tethering it to COVID, but more so on the entitlement front. front. I do want to talk about another element of this, the strategy that Kenny took, and frankly, the Mats and the issue managers took around doubling down, saying they did nothing wrong. You know, even the official quote was, we did nothing wrong. Jason Kenney in the legislature today, no, did nothing wrong. We were working, just explaining away. Corey, what do you think of that strategy? And is it the right strategy considering, you know, what Jason Kenney and his cabinet did and more specifically is the right strategy to to kind of keep them out of trouble or would you have proposed something else no</span>

            <span class="text">no i think this is the the real i mean the the misstep was the misstep and i again i i gotta say like how did they think it was a good idea in the middle of edmonton a city that just loathes the government having out in a public setting something that&#39;s clearly violating at the very least the spirit of the covid restrictions right like someone&#39;s going to take umbrage someone&#39;s going to take that picture and and you&#39;re going to lose at the very least a day if not more uh as you manage it right so when you respond with they did nothing wrong and that like that just bold defiance i think only has the ability to kick the story further because then you&#39;re getting health experts saying did they do it properly did they not do it you have dina hinshaw being kind of mealy mouth with her yeah well</span>

Was this not a violation? All of that occurs because you didn&#39;t just fold. And ultimately, all you&#39;re doing is elevating what is patently absurd to Albertans. And I think that that patent absurdity and the defiance and the standing by and saying, ignore what your eyes show you, is much more dangerous than the act itself.

That strikes me as a bigger story, and I would probably go back to keeping my eye on that prize. It was a fun couple of days, but it reminds me of the Danielle Smith bus.

So as I mentioned earlier, Air Canada has paid out $10 million in bonuses to their executives. This is after they agreed with the federal government as part of their $6 billion loan package that they would cap executive compensation at that $1 million until 12 months. Well, it turns out that they, just before signing this deal with But the federal government greenlit this $10 million, this bonus structure to their executives, which they do say is less than what we usually do. Carter, did the federal government just get played here? Or is that not necessarily the narrative and how you look at it?</span>

I mean, we&#39;ve already had the deputy prime minister just tear a strip off them. And I think there&#39;s more to come on this front, more with the real consequences down the road. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think that there&#39;s a hubris about executive compensation now as well, that they&#39;ve earned their millions of dollars in bonuses, and that&#39;s part of their corporate compensation structures. And it doesn&#39;t matter how the company is actually performing. They expect their money. And the fact that they had to be bailed out by the government, the federal government, surely wasn&#39;t their fault. So they still deserve their bonuses. But I think that, you know, there needs to be a bit of a view towards executive compensation because, you know, I mentioned Bezos earlier. Everybody is out of control. The money that is flowing to these people is out of control. And, you know, it doesn&#39;t bode well for society when there&#39;s this kind of an income gap.</span>

            <span class="text">with how people perceive money and they lose touch with how people perceive the issues on a day-to-day basis. And so they feel, well, I earned that. And in fact, they might think, well, in negotiation bailout, I did that. And my friends are making money like this. And if I went to another company, I&#39;d still be making that $1 million additional bonus. And so, of course, I should get that. God, could you imagine if they didn&#39;t pay us $1.5 million? We&#39;d all leave. And then what would they do without us, the highly paid executives at Air Canada that saved this airline by negotiating that bailout? And so the government would probably be fine with this. This just makes sense. I mean, the rules said going forward. So it was before and it&#39;s okay. Like, what would they possibly have a concern about? It&#39;s allowed under the contract and they don&#39;t fucking get the politics at all.

You&#39;ve got to have a good sense of what the public is thinking about these matters, particularly if the government owns half a billion dollars of your fucking company and it&#39;s just given you $5.9 billion in financial assistance.
