          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Alberta's government yet again violating their own Covid-19 restrictions, plus the Air Canada's executive compensation fracas. What is the political price to be paid for whiskey at the "Sky Palace"? How should the Trudeau Liberals deal with Air Canada's leadership giving themselves generous bonuses at the same time they were receiving a government bailout? And has Stephen Carter finally been replaced? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

            <div class="said">Let&#39;s move it on to the headlines, guys. So many headlines to cover, so many stories to cover. Let&#39;s start here with the CBC. Justice Minister accidentally tweets that one of his campaign donors will become a judge. That&#39;s right. Officially, Justice Minister David Lamedi appointed five new judges across the country this week. On Twitter, however, Lamedi announced three additional appointments, including that of a Montreal lawyer to the Quebec Superior Court. The tweets were subsequently deleted and the minister&#39;s office say they were posted by mistake by the civil servants managing the account. Stephen Carter, is this Daniel Urba, if I&#39;m pronouncing it correctly, it&#39;s probably French, I&#39;m assuming. Is he ever going to make it on the Quebec Superior Court now that this article has come out?</div>

            <div class="said">Okay, well, that was all very wrong. I mean, he&#39;s right about many things, but he&#39;s somewhat wrong about this So it is very possible to be acting in a corrupt fashion when you appoint your friends or your supporters. And let&#39;s face it, money often comes also with volunteerism and other things like that. Or perhaps it&#39;s somebody who&#39;s a bag man who is going out and accumulating $1,500 contributions from 10 people, 100 people. These things are all possible. So let&#39;s not dismiss the possibility out of hand. And it is a bit outrageous to suggest that corruption does not exist in this country. If this was a call-in show, I would ask Canadians coast to coast to say, hey, tell me your most corrupt story. And you would have Quebec say, no, we&#39;re the most corrupt. You should see the corruption we&#39;ve had in the past. The mob&#39;s been involved. And you&#39;d have Saskatchewan say, fuck you, Quebec. Most of our government went to jail once in the 90s.

And isn&#39;t being a donor somewhat an example of somebody seeing the world in a similar fashion to you?

            <div class="said">now. Yeah, let&#39;s not talk about Carter misreading situations. Let&#39;s move on to our next headline. This one comes to us from the Canadian press. Majority of conservative MPs vote in favor of defeated sex-selective abortion bill. I want to spend a bit of time on this one, guys. A majority of conservative leader Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s caucus voted in favor of a bill that sought to restrict certain abortions, even as he voted it down, saying he respects a woman&#39;s right to choose. What do we have here? Saskatchewan MP Kathy, I believe, Wagenthal brought forward Bill C-233, which sought to ban doctors from performing an abortion based on the sex of a fetus, which was defeated in a 248 to 82 vote this past week. All but one of the votes cast in its favor came from the conservatives who have 119 members, with the other coming from former party MP and leadership contender Derek Sloan. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you first on this. What do you think of this as it relates to Aaron O&#39;Toole voting it down, but still having a majority of MPs voting in favor of it?</div>

            <div class="said">I mean, this represents what we&#39;ve talked about before. There are multiple factions within the Conservative Party. For many Conservatives, the abortion question has not been settled in Canada. I think for most Canadians, the abortion issue has been settled in Canada. It is not an issue that you will get elected running on most of the time, unless you&#39;re coming from a very Conservative area. It is certainly not an issue that will get you an elected national government. But you can win a nomination race on it. You can win a nomination race on it very, very easily. And so oftentimes the people who are selected to represent us don&#39;t necessarily represent the majority&#39;s viewpoint. They represent a very small portion of it. And I think that the Conservative Party has had challenges in the past managing this particular issue, and they continue to have challenges now. And I would bet they&#39;re going to have challenges in the future.</div>

            <div class="said">It is a fringe case. It is a manufactured thing that people imagine that there&#39;s a stream of women going and making this choice based on that type of criteria. but it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a manufactured issue and when you kind of break down to it if you if you have intellectual conversations with people and you show statistics and you&#39;d have a discussion about it you quickly find that it&#39;s just a it&#39;s a red herring it&#39;s not an actual thing um that people are doing uh in canada i mean i suspect that you know when when china had its one child rule maybe there was a different type of situation but in canada this is uh this isn&#39;t necessarily the the the driving reason for why women are choosing to have an abortion. So I think that Corey&#39;s right. People generally don&#39;t want sex-selective abortions in Canada, but I think that in general it&#39;s used as a red herring, a whataboutism for the right wing to try and sneak one past the pro-choice lobby.</div>

Guys, I want to talk about two stories, both, you know, almost reeking of elitism, both to do with the air, both to do with the sky. Let me tease them out to you, and then we&#39;ll talk about one and then the other. The first one, of course, here in Alberta, where we sit, where Jason Kenney is pictured alongside his fellow cabinet ministers sitting on the patio of the federal building, also known as the Sky Palace. We&#39;ll get into the long history of that in a second. And the story thereafter? Well, Air Canada, after inking a deal with the federal government, which they indicated they would cap their executive compensation to a million dollars until the loan, the nearly $6 billion loan that the government has provided them, is fully repaid, sneakily greenlit $10 million of bonuses for their executives. it is. I want to talk about the ramifications of that for Air Canada, as well as for the government that seems to have gotten played a bit on this deal. Maybe you disagree. But let&#39;s start in Alberta with the story in the sky known as the Sky Palace. As I said earlier, Premier Jason Kenney&#39;s office is defending photos that showed the Premier and his senior cabinet ministers sitting on a patio at the Sky Palace in the federal building saying they&#39;re not in violation of COVID-19 gathering rules. Seems like they might be, but we&#39;ll talk about that. But photos obtained by multiple media outlets indicate Joe Kenney, Health Minister Shandro, Environment and Parks Minister Nixon, Finance Minister Taves, and at least two others sitting on the patio of the offices commonly known as the Sky Palace. They also have two other folks who appear to be servers that are also pictured not wearing masks. Stephen Carter, I want to start with you first.</div>

            <div class="said">fucking cursed. So they made a last minute pivot to change the nature of the space from an apartment to quote unquote offices and hosting space. I worked in the federal building for four years and it was like a rite of passage. People would come in and ask with morbid curiosity, can I see the Sky Palace? Can you take me up to see this penthouse apartment? And I would, you know, I would take them up and I would show them. And inevitably, people would be in uproarious laughter because the idea that it was supposed to be an office because this was sort of the back justification that was made, there was an attempt to sort of pretend for a while, at least that it was not actually going to be an apartment. Like the quote unquote offices were these small, weirdly shaped rooms with closets in them. It</div>

Even with kind of the adjustments made, it was so obviously meant to be a place somebody lived and so obviously not meant to be a place somebody worked. But the NDP government really avoided the space as a result. And in most of my time in government, and in the early days of the UCP, they seem to as well.</div>

            <div class="said">all shied away from it, all got pretty scared of it. And nobody really wanted to be associated with the quote unquote Sky Palace. And so, good or bad, and you can argue bad, because all of a sudden, there&#39;s this government space that&#39;s just not being used, but it&#39;s still being maintained. People stayed the hell away from it. The 11th floor of the federal building, which is the floor this is, has had for almost all of my time there, nothing in it, no activity, certainly nobody was ever situated there. And it was used very intermittently, like I said, almost entirely by bureaucrats. So the place has taken on kind of this cursed feel.</div>

            <div class="said">is a bit of a tempest in a teapot here. And the main reason I believe that to be the case is that we are now coming out of these restrictions, right? And people are generally confused as to what&#39;s allowed and what&#39;s not allowed. And the situation is, you know, obviously not, not following the rules. Like I actually, I will say, I think where the government has gone truly awry is on pretending that this was all above board and that there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s violating the COVID restrictions in this sense. But I just don&#39;t think people carry that much that, that it was broken. And in December, when</div>

            <div class="said">when we had Aloha Gate, the situation was foundationally different. People were making big sacrifices of things that they wanted to do and that they weren&#39;t being allowed to do, and they were staying home for the Christmas break. And yet we had MLAs, we had cabinet ministers, we had them flying off and going everywhere and having a grand old time. And that</div>

            <div class="said">hitting a pitch that&#39;s similar to Aloha Gate is everybody knows how big of a deal that was, but they&#39;re fighting the last war. I think if you were to canvas 100 people, they would say, yeah, it&#39;s fucking bullshit. I hate those assholes. But that&#39;s because that&#39;s sort of the foundational feeling people have about the government right now. The government&#39;s unpopular right now. I don&#39;t think that this has dramatically changed the popularity of the government to the negative. Carter&#39;s right. Was it a social visit? Was it work? I don&#39;t think people are entirely outraged by the notion that working late into the night, the premier might have had a drink. Certainly, we&#39;ve all worked in politics. I think we know how common just casual drinking is in those environments, whether you want to endorse it or not. That is sort of, let&#39;s just say, a multi-party fascination.</div>

This is less about COVID restrictions, more about how they act as, you know, selling themselves as one thing. In this case, a leader who sells himself to Carter&#39;s Point, flannel shirt, blue pickup truck, but acts in this other way. I think there&#39;s perhaps something in that direction. Not to say how much, you know, you&#39;ll have to see how much legs it has two years from now. But I think it&#39;s that direction, not even tethering it to COVID, but more so on the entitlement front. front. I do want to talk about another element of this, the strategy that Kenny took, and frankly, the Mats and the issue managers took around doubling down, saying they did nothing wrong. You know, even the official quote was, we did nothing wrong. Jason Kenney in the legislature today, no, did nothing wrong. We were working, just explaining away. Corey, what do you think of that strategy?

And the reopening going from, you know, we talked about this a couple of days ago, going from 20 people in our backyards or in a social gathering to 100,000 people at the Stampede in a single day. That strikes me as a bigger story, and I would probably go back to keeping my eye on that prize. It was a fun couple of days, but it reminds me of the Danielle Smith bus. You know, like the busty bus gets you a couple of days of bad coverage coverage or good coverage if you&#39;re if you&#39;re against them but it&#39;s not going to be the defining moment of the campaign cory same question though</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, I think that there&#39;s a hubris about executive compensation now as well, that they&#39;ve earned their millions of dollars in bonuses, and that&#39;s part of their corporate compensation structures. And it doesn&#39;t matter how the company is actually performing. They expect their money. And the fact that they had to be bailed out by the government, the federal government, surely wasn&#39;t their fault. So they still deserve their bonuses. But I think that, you know, there needs to be a bit of a view towards executive compensation because, you know, I mentioned Bezos earlier. Everybody is out of control. The money that is flowing to these people is out of control. And, you know, it doesn&#39;t bode well for society when there&#39;s this kind of an income gap.</div>

And if I went to another company, I&#39;d still be making that $1 million additional bonus. And so, of course, I should get that. God, could you imagine if they didn&#39;t pay us $1.5 million? We&#39;d all leave. And then what would they do without us, the highly paid executives at Air Canada that saved this airline by negotiating that bailout? And so the government would probably be fine with this. This just makes sense. I mean, the rules said going forward. So it was before and it&#39;s okay.
