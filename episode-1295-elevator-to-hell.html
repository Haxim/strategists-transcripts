            <span class="text">Well, there is a new development that I think is worthy of bringing up and worthy of discussing. So last week, the liberals came out with another attack on Jenny Byrne. This is the conservative advisor. She&#39;s a caucus advisor to Pierre Polyev. She&#39;s a longtime conservative strategist. She ran the Harper campaign in 2015. Well, on</span>

            <span class="text">on Thursday, the Globe and Mail last Thursday reported that a federal lobbying firm is located at the same office as Jenny Byrne and Associates. This firm was set up on the same day that Pierre Polyev won his leadership. It&#39;s called Four Check Strategies. They use the same back end as Jenny Byrne and Associates. And, of course, this firm does not include Jenny Byrne Carter. The liberals are saying this is a</span>

            <span class="text">a smoking gun, that the same person who&#39;s influencing Pierre Polyev is now having a GR firm influencing clients, giving them access. It&#39;s using big words like lobbying and back end and strategist, all those words that buzz the media. My question to you guys here is that is this a thing? And I ask it in two ways. Is this a thing from a real perspective? And then is this a thing from a potent political attack? Let&#39;s start with the second part first. Corey, can I start with you on this? Yeah, please go ahead.</span>

And if you dab enough of those squares, you start to think something really nefarious is happening here. And you have things like new company, same day, right? That&#39;s number one, right?</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;ll get there. I&#39;ll just throw on the table. Like a lot of these things are fairly common within the consulting industry more generally. we can talk about whether they&#39;re right or appropriate or not but um you know having a lot of business cards in your pocket and having some of your colleagues conflicted out of some of those businesses and you not being in others also pretty common in consulting but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, Corey&#39;s wrong. There is no there there. It is just trying to dig up dirt on Jenny Byrne. I mean, if you really want to dig up dirt on someone, try Pierre Polyev. He&#39;s the leader of the party. Jenny Byrne is an advisor who&#39;s barely on the payroll. I mean, it has no impact on the overall scheme of things. And I think the Canadians will see right through it. There&#39;s lots of reasons not to like Pierre Polyev. Jenny Byrne&#39;s behavior is not one of them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what do you think of that? Carter&#39;s with a definitive no. He&#39;s saying this is not a thing. The Liberals seem to have, This is the second time they&#39;ve gone into this well, right? First time was Jenny Byrne and Loblaws. This is where we had a long episode where we kind of talked about, you know, since when did strategists and advisors become part of the political attack circle, so to speak, become targets? But Carter&#39;s saying no, there&#39;s not a there there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, he makes a good point in the sense that she is not on any ballot, right? And I just don&#39;t know how much people are going to hold her actions against Pierre Polyev. But there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there are instances where people hold the actions of the advisors against the leader, because as we talked about in that episode, the leader gets to pick their team. And so in a way, the leader should be more accountable for the actions of that team of advisors than they are of the MPs or the MLAs that they just end up stuck with a lot of the time. And so I&#39;m not sure you can say it&#39;s 100% all free and clear for Pierre Polyev. The other thing is it does sort of suggest, again,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">again, the facts need to all come out. The facts on their surface are not as scary to me as perhaps they&#39;re being made out to be by the Liberal Party. But there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is a certain hypocrisy charge that can be made as well, right? Pierre Polyev said, no lobbyists, I&#39;m going to get them out of here. And then immediately, like another lobbying firm is set up by his most senior of advisors, or the people around his most senior of advisor would be the more accurate way to put it. And so, yeah, maybe, maybe, probably, Pierre Polyev skates. Could it be a pain in the ass for a bit for him? Could it come up at inopportune times? Could it be used as a reinforcing piece if there are other ethics challenges?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, here&#39;s where the liberals have taken it as a step to, and I&#39;m curious to hear your analysis of this strategy. They have talked about, they&#39;ve once again reintroduced the line that we talked about a few episodes ago that was introduced by Frazier, Pierre Polyev doesn&#39;t care about you, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right? And they now say he&#39;s working for big corporations. Were they up all night on that one? Yeah, it&#39;s really good stuff.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">working for big corporations and rich friends. And what they try to do is they try to take the Jennyburn attack, they put it in together in this 40-second video that they&#39;ve produced, which seems like it could have a 30-second ad cut. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true, but I&#39;m</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">kind of mentioning this. They talk about Jenny Byrne. Then they talk about Melissa Lansman, who used to be a lobbyist herself, worked for Walmart and other companies. And then they play Pierre Polyev&#39;s clip where he says, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here, corporate lobbyists are useless, right? They mean nothing. So they&#39;re trying to use his own words against him. They&#39;re trying to draw Jenny Byrne into this. Is that an effective political attack? And if no, I want to talk about what could make it better if this is a lane they are committed to, Carter.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely not an effective political attack. It is a it&#39;s something that you&#39;re trying to maybe partisan hacks will get excited about. But even then, I think that most partisan hacks know more</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">more lobbyists than they know actual politicians. This is just it&#39;s just lame on many levels. I mean, does this rise to the scandal level of foreign interference or the We Charity scandal or any of the different things that have actually hit and stuck to Justin Trudeau? This doesn&#39;t seem to fit any of those categories. And and I&#39;m not sitting, you know, I&#39;m no Pierre Polyev enthusiast, but I just can&#39;t see how this actually has any impact at all.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what do you think here? Like, they&#39;re trying to, you know, they didn&#39;t stick on the Jenny Byrne thing, but they said as soon as it, they almost seem to have a part two ready, right? Where it&#39;s like the Jenny Byrne thing comes out, they try to push it, it has a day of its thing. And then their part two was, oh, we&#39;re going to use Pierre&#39;s words against him about his principal advisor. Two inside baseball? Give me analysis and then let&#39;s make it better for them in terms of what would be more effective and potent. Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s okay. So as we&#39;re talking about this, I get actually less enthusiastic for the liberals doing this, because it goes back to one of the things that I&#39;ve said about them for a long time.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, this is the challenge, right? This is one of these charges that seems like it&#39;s more easily leveled against you than your opponents. Or are you just trying to bring them down to, quote unquote, your level in the eyes of Canadians? Do we really think Canadians think Pierre Polyev is too establishment? Like he&#39;s too connected? Like that&#39;s not the fear Canadians have of Pierre Polyev. They have a fear that he associates with wingnuts. It might be one himself, and that he might be an asshole. But they don&#39;t think that That he&#39;s just too Bay Street. Like nobody thinks Pierre Polyev is too Bay Street, do they?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And one of the things that we always say here is that, you know, you want to take reality and bend it just a little, right? You want to bend it just a little. Whether you&#39;re trying to make a positive story about your candidate, you know, you take their good elements and you just forget about all of the bad ones and you just put the good in.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

I mean, technically, yes, that&#39;s what the pay was for. But practically, no, practically, it was just MLAs got paid this much, and they were expected to serve on X number of committees. But if they weren&#39;t on a committee, I&#39;m sure they were doing other things. So I could tell you when that first came up, I mean, obviously, there were some elements where I thought, Oh, that&#39;s interesting and probably bad for people. But I&#39;ll tell you, I also at the time I was working for the Liberal Party, the Alberta Liberal Party, we had MLAs on that committee. So</span>

Like, I just think you have to be very careful about saying something that is so obviously, you know, a charge that could, in macro, be laid more easily at your feet.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, there&#39;s some really fascinating updates in this recall for Jyoti Gondek. We&#39;re going to go hyperlocal. We went national, we&#39;re going to go hyperlocal. But I think there&#39;s just really fascinating strategic conversations here. Carter, to catch people up to speed, you guys both need to help me. I&#39;m just going to paraphrase. There was a recall for Jyoti Gondek, a campaign that requires a shit ton of signatures. That&#39;s a technical term. More signatures than than people who voted in the election to recall Jyoti Gondek. It was started by a guy, a small business guy here in Calgary. Seems to have started it on his own. We then understood that there was lawn signs going up. There was recall campaigns in person and plus 15s. There was billboards. There was backing through other financial sources. People had made donations. People were attaching onto this. We&#39;ve talked about how this is a data mining, data elevation exercise. Well, we chatted, was it last week or a few weeks ago? I don&#39;t even remember, Carter. What is time anymore? But we chatted about with these additional forces being added onto it, is there a sympathy strategy for Jyoti Gandek? Is there something that she could say to say, look, look at these outsized forces against me? And then something fascinating happened. And this week, it was revealed that she met with the individual that took out this petition, that started this petition, I guess is the best way to put it. And I want to analyze that strategy. I want to analyze it for the particular purposes of this conversation, but I also think there&#39;s really something interesting around the human element of saying someone&#39;s trying to do something against you. you, when does the human element kind of come in? When does just sitting down and leveling out come in to equation? When is it good strategy at the end of the day? So on the specifics, and then on the broader principle of sitting down with the other side, when is it good strategy? Carter, let&#39;s talk about the specifics. What did you make of the move here? Corey, I&#39;m going to come to you in a second.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I thought it was ridiculously stupid. I mean, first of all, you don&#39;t need more talking points on the recall Gondek piece. So giving the media another talking point that&#39;s going to give you two three four five more days of media coverage on this particular topic so it&#39;s not even on your own side of the talking points now you&#39;re elevating landon johnson and his talking points to the point where it is now the dominant theme uh on top of that you&#39;re not getting any sympathy you&#39;re still the high-powered mayor talking with a with a with a citizen um so you look like you&#39;re you know what was the outcome that you were expecting Were you expecting to bully him out of the recall petition? Were you expecting him to say, I&#39;m sorry, I was wrong? These things were never going to happen. And now you&#39;ve elevated him, given him more time, given him more oxygen. And Landon Johnson looks like he&#39;s on equal footing to the mayor of Calgary, which I think is lunacy. see this</span>
