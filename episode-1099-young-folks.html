Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start with you on this one. Where do you think the first mistakes were made?

            <span class="text">Well, I think that government&#39;s in a really interesting position on this. They didn&#39;t do anything wrong, right? The government is, you know, as much as we love to crap on the government of danielle smith this is not her problem right this is even even when you get to the health minister and say well maybe they should be commenting on it yeah probably maybe but there&#39;s a process in place uh to deal with public health outbreaks and the minister isn&#39;t you know isn&#39;t going to jump onto his or her horse and uh ride into town and save the outcome or or in some fashion change the outcome for these individual patients and we&#39;ve found i found ourselves in this a lot when you would be in government something&#39;s going wrong uh you know i think i&#39;ve talked about when we had a young adult scalded to death um in a private home um you i mean heartbreaking</span>

You can&#39;t rush in and say, you know, we have to make sure that there you know, that there&#39;s more more analysis, more more inspections of these facilities. For all you know, there could have been an inspection 15 days before. And, you know, some of that&#39;s coming out now. There were inspections. There were problems. You know, we move. We&#39;re supportive of business in Alberta. Well, this is a private business. Maybe we have a problem. We we don&#39;t like regulation. We don&#39;t like red tape. Well, regulation and red tape are what prevents these things from happening. So how do you weigh in when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening? How do you weigh in when it goes against kind of the mantras of what you&#39;re talking about?</span>

That&#39;s true in the economy. That&#39;s true in health care. that&#39;s true in private enterprise more generally, as we&#39;ve seen here. It&#39;s just true. And so if there&#39;s a problem the government had right now, it&#39;s that they were clearly not reassessing from sort of baseline public view on a daily basis and saying, okay, this has hit either the metric that government is now involved</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I mean, we were very critical. I&#39;m going to jump in, Corey, because we were very critical when Danielle Smith went and bought all that children&#39;s Tylenol or the knockoff children&#39;s Tylenol. There is a time and place. Corey said it very well. I wish I&#39;d said it this well. I&#39;m very disappointed in myself. This is someone else&#39;s problem, right? The government did not do this. The government was not responsible for this outcome. And it&#39;s tangential. influential so if you&#39;re going to put yourself into someone else&#39;s problem you need to have a very good reason for it because you you can&#39;t the other thing is you can&#39;t solve this problem it is a past event that is creating present problems you know past cory used to create all kinds of problems for for present cory and all the fortunately he&#39;s been married now and and things have settled down but you know things were crazy there for a while crazy where Where past Corrie would just absolutely fuck present Corrie. And that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. There is no action the government is going to take that is going to make this better for the families that are impacted. There&#39;s just, there&#39;s nothing. So if you&#39;re going to decide to get into it, you need to have a very good reason to get into it. And what seems to have been the tipping point is when we got into hundreds of children and 20 kids in hospital. That seems to be the tipping point. I think that if they&#39;d reacted earlier with the health minister, they wouldn&#39;t have had to react later with the premier.</span>

And I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve seen anything that makes me think it&#39;s their fault. Nobody loves to hear this, but the reality is we&#39;re never going to do daily health inspections of kitchens, no matter who&#39;s involved in it, at least not government run ones. I think obviously a company should be looking through their kitchen every day. We don&#39;t have traffic lights at every stop. You know, there is kind of like this practical barrier to government action in day-to-day lives. And often what you see is a situation like this comes in, and it causes the government to make very big promises that become very costly and very difficult to back away from down the road. And so I don&#39;t really fault them on taking a beat. They shouldn&#39;t have taken two beats.</span>

But the general population is, you know, is not reacting in the same fashion. This isn&#39;t the outrage machine that&#39;s saying, how dare the government enable this to happen? It is seen as a private problem for private individuals. You know, again, I&#39;ve been involved with some like the Strathcona-Tweedsmere disaster where we had the kids buried in the avalanche. That wasn&#39;t seen as a failure of public policy, right? Right. That was seen as a failure of an individual policy of of of the policy of a organization. And I think that that&#39;s why one of the reasons that we saw a delayed response to this is that the public outrage, there&#39;s public concern, there&#39;s public empathy.

            <span class="text">Yeah, and it was 2005, I think, when the one that we&#39;re talking about happened. So many, many years ago. The monetary thing, I want to pick up on that only because the media has been following this for two weeks, essentially. New story every day. They&#39;re looking for new angles. And the one this week was about parents saying like, hey, we&#39;re asking the daycare for refunds and they&#39;re saying it&#39;s going to be case by case. They&#39;re not giving us answers like it was kind of parents, you know, having issues with a daycare. Talk to me, I guess, two angles there, both from that private business, what their strategy should be doing, what they should be doing when they&#39;re dealing with all this. And then whether the $2,000 is just kind of an easy answer</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, let&#39;s be really clear. You can&#39;t get blood from a stone. And I don&#39;t know the situation for this corporation, fueling minds or fueling brains or whatever it is. But they might likely not have the money to give back here. They have staff costs they&#39;ve got to pay. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all sorts of additional costs that are being incurred right now. I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t find the money, but they might not have it. And so this is actually an area where the government, frankly, doesn&#39;t have that problem. You know, the purse is pretty deep when you&#39;re in government. So in a way, I kind of like it because it&#39;s a solution government can come in with and say, like, we don&#39;t really need to concern ourselves whether this corporation can afford it. Here&#39;s some money for you. This is going to help resolve some of the challenges that we&#39;ve heard here. In some ways, it&#39;s the perfect place for government when there is sort of a failing in an area that is, you know, the corporate sphere, the government can say, okay, we&#39;re going to get in. Now, I can hear the counter argument is corporate welfare. Sure. But again, if they don&#39;t actually have the money, what</span>

But it&#39;s a pretty big hurdle to get over, pretty hard to forgive mass poisoning of children. So, you know, different outcomes, different kind of culture that you&#39;ve got to lean on there. And that&#39;s going to drive different corporate strategies. And that&#39;s going to drive different actions by the government as well.

Maybe they can, maybe they won&#39;t, right? I don&#39;t know how deep their pockets are. I don&#39;t understand, you know, the legal shields that may or may not exist.

Like, they have got to make sure that their actions hold up to any kind of scrutiny, and they act the way that when this story is written, they&#39;re not going to be embarrassed showing that story to their children. And look, I think it&#39;s a tough one, and I know nobody wanted this to happen, but it did, and now we just got to do right by the kids and provide the support to them and their families as much as we can. And I am not a thoughts and prayers person, but, oh, my God, am I really thinking about the kids that are there and the families that are going through what&#39;s happening?

And especially the fact that like the feds in municipal, this is like kind of all happening at the same time. I&#39;m</span>

It&#39;s obviously a big local issue here in Calgary. But it&#39;s also and well, I think I&#39;ve noted on this podcast, we hit a very grim milestone this year in Calgary, where a median income was no longer enough to support a median mortgage for a median house, right? That&#39;s bad. I don&#39;t like to see that. I don&#39;t like to see that as a Calgarian. I think one of the big advantages of Alberta has always been, we keep an eye on that affordability. And we try to make sure that you know, that the goal of home ownership, which so many of us have is available to many people. And that&#39;s part of, I think, the Alberta ethos in our thing, right?</span>

Calgary and Edmonton, even though it&#39;s not as bad here, we&#39;re saying we don&#39;t like where this is going and we&#39;re moving forward on various solutions. But what I want to say is kind of weird for me, and I&#39;ll talk local and then maybe I&#39;ll talk with the liberal, is, and</span>

            <span class="text">and i&#39;m going to talk locally obviously pierre polyev&#39;s all over this but locally the conservative side has been about regulation and we saw this on climate change with a carbon tax which to me seems much more naturally like a conservative solution to these things and there seems to be a weird realignment that&#39;s happening on a few of these issues, where all of a sudden people who have historically been opposed to market solutions are all about the market solutions. And people who have historically supported the market solutions are very opposed to those market solutions. So I wonder if this is kind of a canary in the coal mine for a bigger realignment, like we sometimes see where the parties flip. It&#39;s happened a lot. Like if you go back in Canadian history, you look at the liberals were in favor of free trade in the early 20th century, they were opposed to free trade by the the end of the 20th century, you</span>

Like you don&#39;t get in a hole immediately and you don&#39;t get out of a hole immediately in politics here. And in fact, it&#39;s often much more of a long climb out than it was a fall in.</span>

Where people are going to say, I don&#39;t want Bobby in my basement forever. Or I think it&#39;s absolutely disgraceful that they can&#39;t access these things that were available to me. And that will have an effect on the election as well. So yes, there will be seniors who are looking at it more through their lens, perhaps older, where their kids have houses as well, right? People in their 70s. But there&#39;s going to be a generation too that says, I got a house, but this feels super tenuous and I don&#39;t want my kids to move. I want them to stay in Calgary. I I want them to stay near me. This is going to be a big one because, look, rent&#39;s going up 40% plus in a year.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">progressive people and councillors municipally pushing this, And then the federal conservatives are almost their biggest ally. Like when Michelle Rempel came out pretty hot, that was what changed this, the municipal vote the first time and why we&#39;re back in this position anyway. So we haven&#39;t really heard from the province. What is the province to do when it&#39;s kind of this issue that is uniting both certain progressives and certain conservatives? Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, the province has a huge responsibility. I generally support the idea that cities should have more rights and authorities. But the reality is the province dictates all of that. They also control things like building codes, and they control things like overall rules around development. And I think it&#39;s actually hilarious how much the Alberta government has skirted responsibility on this issue, because we have the feds talking about it, we have the municipality talking about it, and we have the province kind of whistling in a field, like, not my thing, don&#39;t look at me. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I think that people should be looking to the province for some of the considerations around here. Massive landowners, right? So they could take that Pierre Polyev, let&#39;s get some of that land back into the hands of people. They are a massive regulator, and they are also a massive funder. And so if you want to have things like MSI, you know, municipal grants, whatever they&#39;ve evolved into, flowing freely and richly, the province could put some big strings on that in terms of housing as well. And, you know, I&#39;m sure those conversations are happening. Province should be looking at that storm cloud on the horizon, too. But it is pretty remarkable how little of this conversation has focused on the provincial government.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, what should they do? They should be focusing on different aspects of the housing problem that they can solve. I mean, it wasn&#39;t that long ago that Premier Stelmack had a 10-year plan to end homelessness. There is no plan to end homelessness currently. You know,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know, the low income housing is something that the province can act on right away. And instead, what this government has been doing is unloading their low income housing assets. They&#39;ve been taking the exact opposite action and being able to skate through it. I mean, I think that Corey&#39;s point that they&#39;re not being dragged into this conversation is really good because it is interesting that the group with arguably the most money on arguably the most skin in the game, is the one that&#39;s the least likely to be acting on it. Premier Smith should be jumping at this opportunity to show Calgary and Edmonton that she understands and cares about their issues. And right now she&#39;s just not. And I find that I find that odd. I think this is a great opportunity for the for the provincial government to jump in and actually start doing what needs to be done.</span>

You know, this is not the idea that you can build a skyscraper next to a single family home. It&#39;s so far from that. It&#39;s miles from that. But it is clearly a flip of position. And I do think it&#39;s fairly consistent with Danielle Smith&#39;s worldview that you should be allowed to do the things that you want to do. But it would take courage. You You know, it would be an interesting part of a play to rebrand herself to cities and say, this is how my particular philosophy is relevant to you in the city of Calgary, you in the city of Edmonton. And I just don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to see that.</span>

            <span class="text">Oh, man. Man, I mean, we&#39;ve seen this. This is a movement that is happening. We have governments that are taking control of their own communications, whether it&#39;s through tweets or whether it&#39;s through buying ads or whether, you know, and Corey, you know, was part of this propaganda empire. And this is just another step in the propaganda. I just think it&#39;s a little bit too direct for me. I don&#39;t mind the tweets. I think they were more factual. this this feels a little bit more like opinion than it does just simple facts but uh those thousand people i&#39;m sure are getting their money&#39;s worth when they watch their free youtube do</span>

            <span class="text">mean, it&#39;s fine. It will not shock you to hear I have a little bit more of a nuanced view of it than Stephen does. This is done by the political side of communications. So within government, there is the apparatus that is like the department that is communications and public engagement, which is what I led. And that is really seized with making sure that Albertans have the information they need. And yes, there are other campaigns that are more about out here&#39;s the things that are going on and you need to understand them, but bound by a lot of rules in terms of what&#39;s appropriate and what&#39;s not. Obviously, politicians are always touching that electric fence to see if it&#39;s still on. And you know, there is an appointment, the person who&#39;s doing my job now came from the premier&#39;s office, I suspect it&#39;s probably a little bit more political charged. I don&#39;t know that for sure.</span>
