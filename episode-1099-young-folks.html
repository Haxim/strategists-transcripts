        <div class="desc"><p>The gang meet to talk through how and when a private crisis becomes a public problem and then go nuts on the issue of housing, because this is Canada and all we do is talk about housing. Stephen and Annalise's shared love of municipal politics guest stars.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the politics of somebody else's crisis through the lens of Calgary's daycare e. coli outbreak - and a wild week of housing that saw big moves municipally and federally. When does a government need to make a private crisis a public problem? How did progressives and conservatives end up flipping stances on housing market forces? And is anybody else thirsty for a millkshake? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

I&#39;m going to jump in, Corey, because we were very critical when Danielle Smith went and bought all that children&#39;s Tylenol or the knockoff children&#39;s Tylenol. There is a time and place. Corey said it very well. I wish I&#39;d said it this well. I&#39;m very disappointed in myself. This is someone else&#39;s problem, right? The government did not do this. The government was not responsible for this outcome. And it&#39;s tangential. influential so if you&#39;re going to put yourself into someone else&#39;s problem you need to have a very good reason for it because you you can&#39;t the other thing is you can&#39;t solve this problem it is a past event that is creating present problems you know past cory used to create all kinds of problems for for present cory and all the fortunately he&#39;s been married now and and things have settled down but you know things were crazy there for a while crazy where Where past Corrie would just absolutely fuck present Corrie. And that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. There is no action the government is going to take that is going to make this better for the families that are impacted. There&#39;s just, there&#39;s nothing. So if you&#39;re going to decide to get into it, you need to have a very good reason to get into it. And what seems to have been the tipping point is when we got into hundreds of children and 20 kids in hospital. That seems to be the tipping point. I think that if they&#39;d reacted earlier with the health minister, they wouldn&#39;t have had to react later with the premier.</div>

Nobody loves to hear this, but the reality is we&#39;re never going to do daily health inspections of kitchens, no matter who&#39;s involved in it, at least not government run ones. I think obviously a company should be looking through their kitchen every day. We don&#39;t have traffic lights at every stop. You know, there is kind of like this practical barrier to government action in day-to-day lives. And often what you see is a situation like this comes in, and it causes the government to make very big promises that become very costly and very difficult to back away from down the road. And so I don&#39;t really fault them on taking a beat. They shouldn&#39;t have taken two beats.</div>

This is someone else&#39;s kid. And 300 parents are making an awful lot of noise, and as they should. This is important to them. It is personal for them. But the general population is, you know, is not reacting in the same fashion. This isn&#39;t the outrage machine that&#39;s saying, how dare the government enable this to happen? It is seen as a private problem for private individuals. You know, again, I&#39;ve been involved with some like the Strathcona-Tweedsmere disaster where we had the kids buried in the avalanche. That wasn&#39;t seen as a failure of public policy, right? Right. That was seen as a failure of an individual policy of of of the policy of a organization. And I think that that&#39;s why one of the reasons that we saw a delayed response to this is that the public outrage, there&#39;s public concern, there&#39;s public empathy. But I&#39;m not sure that public concern and public empathy is necessarily manifesting itself in public outrage. age.</div>

And I don&#39;t know the situation for this corporation, fueling minds or fueling brains or whatever it is. But they might likely not have the money to give back here. They have staff costs they&#39;ve got to pay. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s all sorts of additional costs that are being incurred right now. I&#39;m not saying they shouldn&#39;t find the money, but they might not have it. And so this is actually an area where the government, frankly, doesn&#39;t have that problem. You know, the purse is pretty deep when you&#39;re in government. So in a way, I kind of like it because it&#39;s a solution government can come in with and say, like, we don&#39;t really need to concern ourselves whether this corporation can afford it. Here&#39;s some money for you. This is going to help resolve some of the challenges that we&#39;ve heard here. In some ways, it&#39;s the perfect place for government when there is sort of a failing in an area that is, you know, the corporate sphere, the government can say, okay, we&#39;re going to get in. Now, I can hear the counter argument is corporate welfare. Sure. But again, if they don&#39;t actually have the money, what</div>

But it&#39;s also and well, I think I&#39;ve noted on this podcast, we hit a very grim milestone this year in Calgary, where a median income was no longer enough to support a median mortgage for a median house, right? That&#39;s bad. I don&#39;t like to see that. I don&#39;t like to see that as a Calgarian. I think one of the big advantages of Alberta has always been, we keep an eye on that affordability. And we try to make sure that you know, that the goal of home ownership, which so many of us have is available to many people.

And people who have historically supported the market solutions are very opposed to those market solutions. So I wonder if this is kind of a canary in the coal mine for a bigger realignment, like we sometimes see where the parties flip. It&#39;s happened a lot. Like if you go back in Canadian history, you look at the liberals were in favor of free trade in the early 20th century, they were opposed to free trade by the the end of the 20th century, you</div>

Where people are going to say, I don&#39;t want Bobby in my basement forever. Or I think it&#39;s absolutely disgraceful that they can&#39;t access these things that were available to me. And that will have an effect on the election as well. So yes, there will be seniors who are looking at it more through their lens, perhaps older, where their kids have houses as well, right? People in their 70s. But there&#39;s going to be a generation too that says, I got a house, but this feels super tenuous and I don&#39;t want my kids to move. I want them to stay in Calgary. I I want them to stay near me. This is going to be a big one because, look, rent&#39;s going up 40% plus in a year.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I mean, the province has a huge responsibility. I generally support the idea that cities should have more rights and authorities. But the reality is the province dictates all of that. They also control things like building codes, and they control things like overall rules around development. And I think it&#39;s actually hilarious how much the Alberta government has skirted responsibility on this issue, because we have the feds talking about it, we have the municipality talking about it, and we have the province kind of whistling in a field, like, not my thing, don&#39;t look at me. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. I think that people should be looking to the province for some of the considerations around here. Massive landowners, right? So they could take that Pierre Polyev, let&#39;s get some of that land back into the hands of people. They are a massive regulator, and they are also a massive funder. And so if you want to have things like MSI, you know, municipal grants, whatever they&#39;ve evolved into, flowing freely and richly, the province could put some big strings on that in terms of housing as well. And, you know, I&#39;m sure those conversations are happening. Province should be looking at that storm cloud on the horizon, too. But it is pretty remarkable how little of this conversation has focused on the provincial government.</div>

          <div class="said">know, the low income housing is something that the province can act on right away. And instead, what this government has been doing is unloading their low income housing assets. They&#39;ve been taking the exact opposite action and being able to skate through it. I mean, I think that Corey&#39;s point that they&#39;re not being dragged into this conversation is really good because it is interesting that the group with arguably the most money on arguably the most skin in the game, is the one that&#39;s the least likely to be acting on it. Premier Smith should be jumping at this opportunity to show Calgary and Edmonton that she understands and cares about their issues. And right now she&#39;s just not. And I find that I find that odd. I think this is a great opportunity for the for the provincial government to jump in and actually start doing what needs to be done.</div>

          <div class="said">mean, it&#39;s fine. It will not shock you to hear I have a little bit more of a nuanced view of it than Stephen does. This is done by the political side of communications. So within government, there is the apparatus that is like the department that is communications and public engagement, which is what I led. And that is really seized with making sure that Albertans have the information they need. And yes, there are other campaigns that are more about out here&#39;s the things that are going on and you need to understand them, but bound by a lot of rules in terms of what&#39;s appropriate and what&#39;s not. Obviously, politicians are always touching that electric fence to see if it&#39;s still on. And you know, there is an appointment, the person who&#39;s doing my job now came from the premier&#39;s office, I suspect it&#39;s probably a little bit more political charged. I don&#39;t know that for sure.</div>
