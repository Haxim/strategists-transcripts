          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">all right well Well, firstly, most importantly, this is not a federal issue. This is a provincial issue in another province. That</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">That is the wrong bill. Sorry, but that really is misleading. It&#39;s federal in the sense that it&#39;s outside of Alberta.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Very Alberta of you, by the way. There&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s Alberta in federal.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">You&#39;re right. That word should be provincial, not federal. Well done.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Second of all, second of all, and more to your question and more to your point, Right. It&#39;s maybe a little bit of all of the above. Maybe he was only half in. Maybe he suggested he was more in than he was. Maybe these liberals did play themselves because they should have known the immense risk they were taking by putting their future and to an extent their party&#39;s futures in the hand of somebody who was not even a member of their party when they wrote this letter. But it&#39;s wild. I mean, there&#39;s a couple of ways you can read this and they&#39;re not mutually exclusive right one is he um he played him he absolutely played him he dangled them along he&#39;s like yeah maybe he got them on the reel he got them to expose themselves as supporters of mike schreiner and then he said fuck you all and suckers and here we are right totally possible carter you love</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">oh i i love that you love that i do love that i love that he was just that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that he was playing three-dimensional chess with people who can&#39;t play checkers this is my favorite idea it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">doesn&#39;t really like match my view of mike schreiner right just based on my limited exposure to him but it&#39;s possible the other possibility is he got cold feet um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um he may have thought that this was going to work he&#39;d maybe given positive signals to them like yeah i think this is really something we should explore and when this letter landed uh with a thud maybe Maybe the website, the Draft Mike website, got no</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">no views, no engagement, right? It had the conversation driven by people like us and nothing came of it. And he thought, fuck, this is actually not something people want. I&#39;m going to come in fifth in this leadership contest. And so I&#39;m out. That&#39;s a real possibility after his week of a listening tour. You can actually imagine a scenario where Act 1 was supposed to be Draft Mike, Act 2 was mike expressing interest and act one didn&#39;t go well enough for him to immediately express interest and so then it became softened to well let&#39;s see where this goes over the next week or two and it went nowhere and he fucking bailed on the whole thing yeah that&#39;s absolutely possible in my opinion and then door number three is that these liberals actually took this flyer no</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">absolutely insane flyer where they put it out</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Look, that&#39;s the shocking thing about it, Stephen, right? Because if that is what happened, it is perhaps the worst tactical mistake in Canadian political history. It&#39;s just unbelievable that you would do that. Because as I said, you&#39;re sort of putting the fate of your own credibility into the hands of somebody not in your party. You&#39;re kind of burned for a while if you&#39;re on that particular list. And there&#39;s a sitting MPP on that list. Carter,</span>

The idea that you put something out and you ask people to mobilize and show their support. And you see this all of the time in advocacy campaigns. And Carter will back me up on this.

It really has to be something where they feel like they are fighting for the underdog, that they are on the positive, good side. and i&#39;m not sure that mike schreiner um is is that high enough bar uh to actually get actually get people to sign up for it you</span>

You better have the money, you better have the resources, you better have the people. I mean, how many people signed that letter? 30 people signed that letter? I mean, that should be a significant chunk of money going into his leadership campaign. It should be enough grassroots support that he can actually start doing something. I mean, he had, as Corey has eloquently pointed out, he had fucking MLAs signing that letter. They had no business signing that letter. They sit in someone else&#39;s caucus. the fact that they signed that letter should have indicated that he had fairly decent grassroots support um so the fact that he didn&#39;t the fact that this stalled out is really just kind of almost unbelievable uh and a tremendous malpractice but i&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sure i mean lesson number two right now is if you are those liberal organizers and let&#39;s just assume for a minute that the cold feet scenario is is the correct one before you go out on a limb like that before you take a step that has other steps that need to unfold for you not to look like a fool you better be 100 sure you can deliver on them so like you you talk about a list of 30 people steven you talk about mike schreiner maybe not seeing what he wants in terms of like signups to that particular site you should be like okay okay, Mike, how many do you need to see? And if he says 10,000, amongst you and your 29 compatriots, you&#39;ve got to say, are we 100% sure we can get Mike Schreiner 10,000 signups on this particular website? How are we going to do it? What are you going to be on the hook for? How are we going to confirm that you&#39;ve actually done those things? Because what they did is they absolutely removed any of their own agency after step one, and they gave it all to Mike Schreiner. Or at least it seems that way from the outside. So</span>

It comes from being able to get numbers in some ways. I, you know, I just want to say, we talked about it, like being the wilderness. And I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t believe that it was her strategy to build up a reputation and a brand outside of elected politics, and then come storming back in through a leadership contest that happened. But I don&#39;t think that was like a master plan of hers as she was moving forward. but um but you know it actually does suggest that maybe a better model is just to be a personality known by tens of thousands of people uh able to be brought forward so hey look maybe there&#39;s hope for us on the strategy no</span>

But there&#39;s also kind of a, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a class type of designation or not. But, I mean, here I am out in Revelstoke right now. And out in the parking lot, it&#39;s filled with Alberta license plates. And every Alberta license plate is a pickup truck towing $4,000 to $6,000, $14,000 snowmobiles. and each one of those snowmobiles will be going out into boulder creek or boulder mountain and they&#39;ll be ripping up the the mountain trying not to cause avalanches albertans there&#39;s a group of albertans who love their toys and the ucp has said essentially the albertans who love their toys are more likely to love us so we will give those albertans a break on the kananaskis pass and And let&#39;s be clear, McLean Creek, one of the areas that is being targeted here, it is in Kananaskis. And Kananaskis was set</span>

This to me is it&#39;s just simple choices. I am choosing we&#39;re choosing them over us. Right. And this is the UCP to me. The UCP is constantly choosing them over us. Yes. Us being, you know, the people who are listening to this podcast, the people who don&#39;t have $14,000 recreation vehicles, the people who don&#39;t go out in their pickup trucks and see how deep they can get their truck stuck and then have their buddies pull it out over a couple of beers.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s interesting because that was immediately my thought too like how many votes do you think move on an announcement like this to them i actually think that the ucp uh took an incredible risk by taking an action like that one of the things that we always uh in issues management during the budget and we&#39;re in budget season here in alberta the budget&#39;s being released least last or next week so i did four budgets for the government of alberta and one of the things in issues management we would do is we would have a table of literally every announcement with an issues management lens on it it would be like dollars impacted people a bunch of details don&#39;t need to tell you every column here but one of the things we looked for was are there really unfortunate pairings here like we are cutting 30 million from here and we&#39;re spending 30 million in there and if there were such bearings we we flagged them and we said be very careful right and you might want to consider different ways to present these numbers maybe over four years don&#39;t present that like apples to apples like this and unfortunately for the ucp that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;ve done by essentially giving about as much money as is coming from these bloody passes and so people can very easily say hold on a second you are charging me to go to the park And you were taking those charges and you were giving it to people to tear up the same fucking park over</span>

And it&#39;s the kind of thing people tend to get very angry about. And so my feeling is if any votes move on this, it&#39;s probably away from the UCP. because there is kind of like a like listen there are a lot more albertans than i think</span>

So opposition services is essentially whatever press release comes out of the government today. We are going to oppose it. It is bad. And that&#39;s been the NDP. they are all over everything all at once and even with their health care announcement which i personally loved last you know was it last week that health care announcement yeah was stepped on immediately by their mlas they all started talking about other things that mattered to them i&#39;ll tell you what matters to you guys fucking health care your party put out its first big fucking platform you don&#39;t speak of anything else for at least 14 fucking days shut up do what you&#39;re told talk about this issue every time you think you&#39;ve got a better issue you&#39;re wrong and that&#39;s been that&#39;s been the pattern that they&#39;ve been doing they need to find this narrative whether it&#39;s this us versus them you know us versus them narrative whether it&#39;s a narrative of you know families first what do we do like we did 13 different slogans before we&#39;ve done all kinds of different narratives for them we have given six different narratives on this podcast alone pick one go with it and once you&#39;ve chosen the narrative don&#39;t give up on it because you don&#39;t have any more time anymore you&#39;ve got to stay with the narrative because while we&#39;re paying attention every single day the</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. And you know, CBC had some polling last year that showed that Albertans increasingly increasingly think more fondly of the Rachel Notley years, right? This is something that just got people thought more fondly of the George W. Bush years afterwards, like time does tend to put that shine on people. So yeah, it&#39;s uncommon. You don&#39;t often see this. You don&#39;t often see the rematch, although we might see one between Trump and Biden, if we&#39;re lucky, coming forward here too.</span>

Now I say usually because sometimes you get a new premier, they&#39;re unknown, the opposition leader&#39;s been there for a while, flips, but to have two people who are both so well-known by Albertans with such well-defined brands in the province of Alberta, it&#39;s going to be interesting because it does mean that there&#39;s a certain less</span>

It does not mean making things up. This is lying and making things up. The 15-minute city stuff is really, I think, baffling and probably, unfortunately, emblematic of just discourse right now. But the idea that groups can come out and say things that I think would be fairly non-controversial, you know, a decade ago, like, hey, we should make sure that neighborhoods have amenities and that they&#39;re kind of self-sufficient and sustaining. And people would look at that and say, you&#39;re trying to separate us into zones. This is all part of a global world order. And soon we won&#39;t be able to travel between zones without passports in our own city. And this is tyranny. It&#39;s bonkers. bonkers um and then to have people stand up and have to say no we&#39;re not planning to have you have to have a passport between zones to steven&#39;s point actually does introduce a backfire effect it&#39;s so bonkers that we would have to say like there&#39;s going to be people who even hear this right now and are going to be sitting there thinking like a day later like yeah</span>

He&#39;s obviously been bitten by the bug. He wants to be involved. He gets some juice out of it. He wants to help. He&#39;s an emergency room doc. He should find different ways to help. That&#39;s my fundamental belief about Raj Sherman. If he was so inclined to get involved in politics again, he</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he needs to put himself on the bench. Like, let&#39;s think about all of the things he&#39;s done like he was a PC MLA he was a junior like a parliamentary secretary or something he crossed to be an independent he played footsie with the NDP with the Greens with the Alberta Party with the Liberals joined the Liberals joined the Liberal leadership won the Liberal leadership ran in that election under like a very left-wing platform which I know because I wrote it he then veered hard to the right again after he was elected so he went kind of like right left right right all the way through there he resigned just before the next election which made david swan the leader um he told anybody he could talk to that like he was very happy that rachel notley won as a result of that so again we&#39;re talking now veering back more towards the left disappeared for a while came back out of nowhere to run for the conservative leadership uh under you know which daniel smith won that&#39;s a weird thing to do at that particular moment um and then And then after Danielle Smith wins, the most right-wing candidate in the race, arguably, decides he&#39;s going to run for a PC or a UCP nomination. No, like none of this makes any sense. Like, what are you doing? And also, by the way, in Edmonton, Whitewood, writing that, I would bet a lot of money the NDP win by like 40 points.</span>
