      <h1>Episode 1038: Skimobiles and Federal Politicians</h1>

        <div class="desc"><p>The Zain-free gang dive into misinformation, Ontario politics and the upcoming Alberta election, discussing the UCP's growing "us vs. them" problem and the challenges the NDP have holding onto narratives.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Mike Schreiner leaving the Ontario Liberals at the altar, Danielle Smith's growing "righteous indignation" problem and how 15-minute cities became the latest conspiracy theory. Did Schreiner get cold feet when not enough people wanted to "Draft Mike"? How do you inoculate the population against conspiracy theories? And how many skimobiles fit in a four-car garage? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

But it&#39;s wild. I mean, there&#39;s a couple of ways you can read this and they&#39;re not mutually exclusive right one is he um he played him he absolutely played him he dangled them along he&#39;s like yeah maybe he got them on the reel he got them to expose themselves as supporters of mike schreiner and then he said fuck you all and suckers and here we are right totally possible carter you love</div>

You better have the money, you better have the resources, you better have the people. I mean, how many people signed that letter? 30 people signed that letter? I mean, that should be a significant chunk of money going into his leadership campaign. It should be enough grassroots support that he can actually start doing something. I mean, he had, as Corey has eloquently pointed out, he had fucking MLAs signing that letter. They had no business signing that letter. They sit in someone else&#39;s caucus. the fact that they signed that letter should have indicated that he had fairly decent grassroots support um so the fact that he didn&#39;t the fact that this stalled out is really just kind of almost unbelievable uh and a tremendous malpractice but i&#39;ll</div>

And if he says 10,000, amongst you and your 29 compatriots, you&#39;ve got to say, are we 100% sure we can get Mike Schreiner 10,000 signups on this particular website? How are we going to do it? What are you going to be on the hook for? How are we going to confirm that you&#39;ve actually done those things?

It comes from being able to get numbers in some ways. I, you know, I just want to say, we talked about it, like being the wilderness. And I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t believe that it was her strategy to build up a reputation and a brand outside of elected politics, and then come storming back in through a leadership contest that happened. But I don&#39;t think that was like a master plan of hers as she was moving forward. but um but you know it actually does suggest that maybe a better model is just to be a personality known by tens of thousands of people uh able to be brought forward so hey look maybe there&#39;s hope for us on the strategy no</div>

And every Alberta license plate is a pickup truck towing $4,000 to $6,000, $14,000 snowmobiles. and each one of those snowmobiles will be going out into boulder creek or boulder mountain and they&#39;ll be ripping up the the mountain trying not to cause avalanches albertans there&#39;s a group of albertans who love their toys and the ucp has said essentially the albertans who love their toys are more likely to love us so we will give those albertans a break on the kananaskis pass and And let&#39;s be clear, McLean Creek, one of the areas that is being targeted here, it is in Kananaskis.

          <div class="said">it&#39;s interesting because that was immediately my thought too like how many votes do you think move on an announcement like this to them i actually think that the ucp uh took an incredible risk by taking an action like that one of the things that we always uh in issues management during the budget and we&#39;re in budget season here in alberta the budget&#39;s being released least last or next week so i did four budgets for the government of alberta and one of the things in issues management we would do is we would have a table of literally every announcement with an issues management lens on it it would be like dollars impacted people a bunch of details don&#39;t need to tell you every column here but one of the things we looked for was are there really unfortunate pairings here like we are cutting 30 million from here and we&#39;re spending 30 million in there and if there were such bearings we we flagged them and we said be very careful right and you might want to consider different ways to present these numbers maybe over four years don&#39;t present that like apples to apples like this and unfortunately for the ucp that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;ve done by essentially giving about as much money as is coming from these bloody passes and so people can very easily say hold on a second you are charging me to go to the park And you were taking those charges and you were giving it to people to tear up the same fucking park over</div>

It does not mean making things up. This is lying and making things up. The 15-minute city stuff is really, I think, baffling and probably, unfortunately, emblematic of just discourse right now. But the idea that groups can come out and say things that I think would be fairly non-controversial, you know, a decade ago, like, hey, we should make sure that neighborhoods have amenities and that they&#39;re kind of self-sufficient and sustaining. And people would look at that and say, you&#39;re trying to separate us into zones. This is all part of a global world order. And soon we won&#39;t be able to travel between zones without passports in our own city. And this is tyranny. It&#39;s bonkers. bonkers um and then to have people stand up and have to say no we&#39;re not planning to have you have to have a passport between zones to steven&#39;s point actually does introduce a backfire effect it&#39;s so bonkers that we would have to say like there&#39;s going to be people who even hear this right now and are going to be sitting there thinking like a day later like yeah</div>

He&#39;s obviously been bitten by the bug. He wants to be involved. He gets some juice out of it. He wants to help. He&#39;s an emergency room doc. He should find different ways to help. That&#39;s my fundamental belief about Raj Sherman. If he was so inclined to get involved in politics again, he</div>

          <div class="said">he needs to put himself on the bench. Like, let&#39;s think about all of the things he&#39;s done like he was a PC MLA he was a junior like a parliamentary secretary or something he crossed to be an independent he played footsie with the NDP with the Greens with the Alberta Party with the Liberals joined the Liberals joined the Liberal leadership won the Liberal leadership ran in that election under like a very left-wing platform which I know because I wrote it he then veered hard to the right again after he was elected so he went kind of like right left right right all the way through there he resigned just before the next election which made david swan the leader um he told anybody he could talk to that like he was very happy that rachel notley won as a result of that so again we&#39;re talking now veering back more towards the left disappeared for a while came back out of nowhere to run for the conservative leadership uh under you know which daniel smith won that&#39;s a weird thing to do at that particular moment um and then And then after Danielle Smith wins, the most right-wing candidate in the race, arguably, decides he&#39;s going to run for a PC or a UCP nomination. No, like none of this makes any sense. Like, what are you doing? And also, by the way, in Edmonton, Whitewood, writing that, I would bet a lot of money the NDP win by like 40 points.</div>
