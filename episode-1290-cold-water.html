            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">was like a half hour</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">hour this is gonna be a good half hour well it&#39;s not thanks to me it&#39;s thanks to you guys that these topics take a long time okay these random musings i was watching joe biden give the state of the union address um yeah he</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and you know what i find interesting is that he tripped over a lot of words he was joe biden decent you know sort of script writing for sure uh i&#39;m sure like as folks know that these things take months to put together here&#39;s what struck me and i know we&#39;ve had a version of this conversation before but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">but man is just the oratory better in the united states or am i fooling myself with some like romanticism carter like this was joe biden a guy who&#39;s 80 tripping over his words and i was like this is better than mostly the product i I see here. Am I wrong or am I romanticizing what I see in the U.S. as being a higher order and skill set of politics? And I&#39;m talking now specifically from the politicians, or is there some merit to what I&#39;m saying here, Carter?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, given the recent passing of Brian Mulroney, I mean, he was probably our last great orator at the federal level. Justin Trudeau, We&#39;ve talked about how performative he is when he speaks. There are moments when he comes across as real and authentic, and I think that just makes the other moments just even more jarring. We haven&#39;t seen a great orator for a number of years. I mean, I think that Danielle Smith gets close. She&#39;s a great communicator at the very least.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">least. I thought Kenny got close in some ways. Kenny</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Kenny was okay. Well, maybe the questioner is what makes— He</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">He wasn&#39;t great. What makes a good orator versus a good communicator? Is there a difference, or are we leaning into semantics?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">semantics? Oh, yeah. I think that we&#39;re great communicators, other than Corey, and none of us are great orators. It&#39;s a different medium.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">We talk about all the different ways of writing, right? There&#39;s different types of writing. There&#39;s poetry. There&#39;s prose. There&#39;s all kinds of different things.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Chat GPT. Novels. All kinds of different writing. Copywriting. The same is true for speaking. speaking right what we do on our podcast is very different than a scripted podcast or you know is very different than a television show or you know it&#39;s different than anything that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;re great they&#39;re good and the same can be said of orators and in Canada we do not have a history of producing great orators and outside of really Brian Mulrooney and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m misremembering him I think I remember him as as a a great orator you</span>

            <span class="text">well i do think it&#39;s a little bit more part of their civic religion this idea that you&#39;ll make a great speech and and And that&#39;s going to change the way people think about you. And so I do think it&#39;s a skill that politicians there curate a little bit more. And we&#39;ve talked about this before. The State of the Union is given by the president. Sure. Our equivalent is the throne speech. It&#39;s given by the lieutenant governor, right? And she does a great job.</span>

            <span class="text">We don&#39;t have the same traditions or culture here. And as a result, politicians, it would be a misallocation of time and effort for them to develop the skill that is necessary for that kind of speech. Because let&#39;s be clear, a State of the Union, not</span>

And let&#39;s be clear, Joe Biden has been doing this for 54 years. He is very old, and he&#39;s been doing this a long time. So the other thing is experience does matter.

            <span class="text">this is a really fascinating story. So, Canada has been long pressured to resume its funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, the UNRWA. There was rumors that we would be doing it. The minister responsible, Ahmed Hussein, who happens to not just be the minister responsible, but also of the broader Muslim community, was facing a lot of pressure from community members, from stakeholders writ large, to resume this funding for Canada&#39;s lack of urgency on this file. And it seemed like, Carter, Cannon was on the path. In fact, it was reported by CBC News Tuesday, where court today on Thursday, that there was going to be an announcement on Wednesday. And lo and behold, Ahmed Hussain was ready to have an announcement with Bob Ray.</span>

I want to split the first part of the story being like, what the hell could be going on here? Almost into raw speculation. And then I want to get into the strategy of when you delay, I shouldn&#39;t say the inevitable, but when you delay an announcement, when you delay something that still ultimately happens, what changes as it relates to strategy, expectations, and communications? What do you need to have into account? If the PM is to go out tomorrow and do this, What changed from having Hussein do this on Wednesday? That&#39;s the second part of the conversation I want to discuss. But Carter, do you want to get into our reckless speculation? What the heck could be going on here?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">why not? There are a lot of things that could potentially be at play here, as Stephen said. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of sequencing, as Stephen said. Maybe it&#39;s a situation where the government has been given additional accusations about the organization. You&#39;ll keep in mind, of course, that we cut funding in the first place because Israel alleged and then the UN did an investigation and found 10, I believe, with two others who were deceased and so kind of, but like that were involved in the attack on Israel on October 7th. And so that was a damning accusation. That was quite the thing that the UN had to do.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for all parties involved here. But it&#39;s possible, for example, that the state of Israel heard that, listen, I&#39;m not saying this happened. You asked for reckless speculation. This isn&#39;t even speculation. This is just a thing that could happen. You could say, hey, we&#39;ve got additional evidence that the problem is not resolved in this organization. And the government of Canada maybe needs a day or two to look at that evidence and sort of assess that. maybe it&#39;s a situation where they&#39;re very close to a ceasefire and they just need a tiny bit of sweetener so nations across the globe are saying okay well what can we say that we could really ramp up if we do this like not only can this aid resume but we could increase the aid if there were a situation where all of a sudden we were we&#39;re in a ceasefire but that&#39;s going to require that hostages get released maybe it&#39;s a situation like that it&#39;s it&#39;s impossible to know for sure But Stephen&#39;s right. This is international politics. This is diplomacy. And it is a delicate dance. And frankly, maybe it was always a requirement for one of the many reasons we&#39;ve discussed that Canada go a bit later and maybe somebody fucked up and scheduled it five days before it could happen for any of the things we&#39;ve talked about or 100 other reasons that would never even cross our minds.

I mean, I can think of a couple of ways, and i&#39;m going to circle back to it but i want to say that the biggest risk now is if there is any reason for another delay now they&#39;re in serious trouble it&#39;s kind of a general rule in the in the business world you should try to follow too like you can reschedule a meeting once don&#39;t reschedule it twice right because that&#39;s when people start to say what in the hell is going on here why can you not figure all of these things out and so um that would be the big concern</span>

You can work those things through staff. You can talk to reporters if you had legitimate reasons for it on background and all of that. It will still end up a line in most of the stories, I would imagine. But you don&#39;t need to sweat it too much. But</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">kind of does, doesn&#39;t it? Because the psychology of people is they remember that there&#39;s a big recency bias, and you also get to put a bigger number on the table because you haven&#39;t been doing it earlier. So, you know, think about healthcare, for example, you can, you can cut it 1% a year for three years, and then you can give it like an 8% increase. And that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s not even really making good to the inflation that it otherwise would have been. But people are like, wow, 8% fucking huge way to go, guys. That&#39;s great. I&#39;m so excited about that 8% increase. And so there is a school of thought that says that loading is even more important than almost what you&#39;re loading it with. And you just want to kind of front load the pain and you back load the joy and then it all sort of works out. And yeah, very cynical to talk about when there&#39;s so many lives on the line, you know, and there&#39;s, you know, humanitarian crisis unfolding. But as we said, there&#39;s a lot of diplomacy and politics involved here. And it is quite possible that a country like Canada, a country like the United States would say, okay, well, messy now. Let&#39;s jump in later. And we&#39;ll just go really hard. And we&#39;ll do what we can. And maybe people will remember us for that. Now, it doesn&#39;t appear that&#39;s what the Americans are doing right now. They&#39;re building docks and they&#39;re airdropping into Gaza. They&#39;re trying to find another way to deliver aid. But yeah, I mean, I hate to say it, but that is a strategy that often works. Carter,</span>

But you know, ultimately, I know this is a pretty consequence-free thing for me to do. When you have that kind of intensity, and it&#39;s already a Conservative seat, and the Conservatives have every reason to take it for granted who live in the riding, and they come out anyways and they just really really increase that size of of the margin i think it says something about kind of this natural intensity that&#39;s kicking out here and let&#39;s be clear whose seat was it that jamil giovanni just got it won it by 30 tools yeah yeah</span>

Or are you still in the back of your mind planning another summer recontouring of this guy? That was really what&#39;s interesting to me right now.

            <span class="text">Well, one of our central premises of this podcast is that campaigns matter. And if campaigns matter in a four, six, eight week period, then surely politics will matter over the course of months and months and months. So everything can change. I&#39;m not necessarily sitting here saying everything will change, but everything can change. And all that has to happen, you know, if I were running Pierre Poliev&#39;s campaign, about the last thing I was talking about is is the inevitability of the win. Right now, would I be working on it? Would I like to be where he is? Abso-fucking-lutely. Being that far in front does indicate that he&#39;s probably going to do just fine. But I&#39;m not going to lose my mind now and just kind of say, well, fuck it. We can do whatever we want to do. But</span>

Pierre comes to you and says, says, guys, I&#39;ve got assist lead by being me. I don&#39;t want another summer campaign to try to remodel who I am. I don&#39;t want to do this old disciplined approach bullshit. This is what&#39;s gotten us here. I&#39;m going to do it. As a strategist, how would you be thinking of that? Like, would you be doing polling about that, Corey? Would you just be giving them the green light? How would you be responding to a moment like that, where the candidate in this case is being like, stop trying to fucking shame me. I&#39;m good.</span>

Well, and look, politicians, get that feeling like when they start they start thinking they forget about the entire organization and apparatus behind them that made them good and they start to believe their own press because part of that apparatus&#39;s job is to make politicians look godlike right yes reflex is faster than anybody so clever you know their videos are so well constructed all of that and that&#39;s just not reality right they are they are the actor on a stage but there&#39;s an entire crew behind the curtain who are helping make them the person they are so listen that happens i&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t i do think though you can pretty readily point to some things and say no no no what&#39;s working here is this disciplined approach that you are the heart of and you are the leader and you can change that approach i mean that&#39;s fundamentally a truism here but look at the stats it was when we started to soften your image when we made you speak or not when we made you speak but when you spoke to that conservative convention in a way that was telling a story about all of those people across canada who are worried about the next thing that&#39;s going to happen to them because of this government that is the product that has been so successful over this last bit and if you look at the trend lines from the the polling i we talked about this the other day it&#39;s</span>

There&#39;s no doubt that Pierre Polyev has softened some edges, and there&#39;s no doubt that that has worked. So why would you stop? And you&#39;re not going to just start squandering points. You want the majority. You might want the biggest majority. You might want to have that mandate that allows you to have that free hand here. And yeah, so there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to walk away from what&#39;s working, you might lose discipline. I think that&#39;s more likely, but you&#39;re not going to strategically...
