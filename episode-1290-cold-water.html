            <div class="said">this is a really fascinating story. So, Canada has been long pressured to resume its funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, the UNRWA. There was rumors that we would be doing it. The minister responsible, Ahmed Hussein, who happens to not just be the minister responsible, but also of the broader Muslim community, was facing a lot of pressure from community members, from stakeholders writ large, to resume this funding for Canada&#39;s lack of urgency on this file. And it seemed like, Carter, Cannon was on the path. In fact, it was reported by CBC News Tuesday, where court today on Thursday, that there was going to be an announcement on Wednesday. And lo and behold, Ahmed Hussain was ready to have an announcement with Bob Ray.</div>

And then I want to get into the strategy of when you delay, I shouldn&#39;t say the inevitable, but when you delay an announcement, when you delay something that still ultimately happens, what changes as it relates to strategy, expectations, and communications? What do you need to have into account? If the PM is to go out tomorrow and do this, What changed from having Hussein do this on Wednesday? That&#39;s the second part of the conversation I want to discuss. But Carter, do you want to get into our reckless speculation? What the heck could be going on here?</div>

You&#39;ll keep in mind, of course, that we cut funding in the first place because Israel alleged and then the UN did an investigation and found 10, I believe, with two others who were deceased and so kind of, but like that were involved in the attack on Israel on October 7th.

You asked for reckless speculation. This isn&#39;t even speculation. This is just a thing that could happen. You could say, hey, we&#39;ve got additional evidence that the problem is not resolved in this organization. And the government of Canada maybe needs a day or two to look at that evidence and sort of assess that. maybe it&#39;s a situation where they&#39;re very close to a ceasefire and they just need a tiny bit of sweetener so nations across the globe are saying okay well what can we say that we could really ramp up if we do this like not only can this aid resume but we could increase the aid if there were a situation where all of a sudden we were we&#39;re in a ceasefire but that&#39;s going to require that hostages get released maybe it&#39;s a situation like that it&#39;s it&#39;s impossible to know for sure But Stephen&#39;s right. This is international politics. This is diplomacy. And it is a delicate dance. And frankly, maybe it was always a requirement for one of the many reasons we&#39;ve discussed that Canada go a bit later and maybe somebody fucked up and scheduled it five days before it could happen for any of the things we&#39;ve talked about or 100 other reasons that would never even cross our minds.

You can work those things through staff. You can talk to reporters if you had legitimate reasons for it on background and all of that. It will still end up a line in most of the stories, I would imagine. But you don&#39;t need to sweat it too much. But</div>

            <div class="said">kind of does, doesn&#39;t it? Because the psychology of people is they remember that there&#39;s a big recency bias, and you also get to put a bigger number on the table because you haven&#39;t been doing it earlier. So, you know, think about healthcare, for example, you can, you can cut it 1% a year for three years, and then you can give it like an 8% increase. And that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s not even really making good to the inflation that it otherwise would have been. But people are like, wow, 8% fucking huge way to go, guys. That&#39;s great. I&#39;m so excited about that 8% increase. And so there is a school of thought that says that loading is even more important than almost what you&#39;re loading it with. And you just want to kind of front load the pain and you back load the joy and then it all sort of works out. And yeah, very cynical to talk about when there&#39;s so many lives on the line, you know, and there&#39;s, you know, humanitarian crisis unfolding. But as we said, there&#39;s a lot of diplomacy and politics involved here. And it is quite possible that a country like Canada, a country like the United States would say, okay, well, messy now. Let&#39;s jump in later. And we&#39;ll just go really hard. And we&#39;ll do what we can. And maybe people will remember us for that. Now, it doesn&#39;t appear that&#39;s what the Americans are doing right now. They&#39;re building docks and they&#39;re airdropping into Gaza. They&#39;re trying to find another way to deliver aid. But yeah, I mean, I hate to say it, but that is a strategy that often works. Carter,</div>

You even had in your question, Zane, is this just being like a surrogate? Well, people have had political surrogates forever, right? Who go out, and this is an old tactic, right? This is this idea that I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s going to level with you. I&#39;m the gal who&#39;s going to level with you. Let me show you behind the curtain. Let me show you your strings, puppet. I&#39;ll show you how these people are trying I&#39;m trying to spin you as I spin you, right? It is really about the channel. That&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s fundamentally changed here. You used to go on a show and give this kind of analysis. You could easily imagine Michelle Rempel going on CBC News World and just saying the exact same things. Yeah, absolutely. But you put it in the paper, you talk to reporters, you don&#39;t get that anymore. And so you use your own channels, you push that out. The audience is a little different. It tends to be the true believers who then carry your message further. But yeah, it&#39;s kind of the 21st century version, I think, of the same stuff politicians have been doing for a long time.

When you have that kind of intensity, and it&#39;s already a Conservative seat, and the Conservatives have every reason to take it for granted who live in the riding, and they come out anyways and they just really really increase that size of of the margin i think it says something about kind of this natural intensity that&#39;s kicking out here and let&#39;s be clear whose seat was it that jamil giovanni just got it won it by 30 tools yeah yeah</div>

And if campaigns matter in a four, six, eight week period, then surely politics will matter over the course of months and months and months. So everything can change. I&#39;m not necessarily sitting here saying everything will change, but everything can change. And all that has to happen, you know, if I were running Pierre Poliev&#39;s campaign, about the last thing I was talking about is is the inevitability of the win. Right now, would I be working on it? Would I like to be where he is? Abso-fucking-lutely. Being that far in front does indicate that he&#39;s probably going to do just fine. But I&#39;m not going to lose my mind now and just kind of say, well, fuck it. We can do whatever we want to do. But</div>

Pierre comes to you and says, says, guys, I&#39;ve got assist lead by being me. I don&#39;t want another summer campaign to try to remodel who I am. I don&#39;t want to do this old disciplined approach bullshit. This is what&#39;s gotten us here. I&#39;m going to do it. As a strategist, how would you be thinking of that?

You want the majority. You might want the biggest majority. You might want to have that mandate that allows you to have that free hand here.
