        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Quebec hijab issue, the Alberta UCP leadership review rules and changes to provincial election laws.

Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

But having won it four years in a row, I think we&#39;re a little hesitant to give it to him yet again. Again, so if you could just tweet at StrategistPod with your nominations for the Not Going Places Award. No, I will not explain what the criteria are for winning it.

Quebec teachers removal for wearing a hijab. A quote-unquote cowardly move, minister says. Let me fill you guys in with some background. and I think we&#39;ve all heard of this story or a lot of us have heard of this story this week.

Multiple politicians are speaking out to condemn the reassignment of the elementary school teacher who was forced to leave her job after being told that the hijab violates the province&#39;s law that forbids teachers from wearing religious symbols. It&#39;s cowardly, said Crown Indigenous Relations Minister Mark Miller. This type of discrimination isn&#39;t reflective of the Quebec society we live in. Jagmeet Singh coming out, others. Notably, and I&#39;ll add this one final piece of context before we get into the discussion, Aaron O&#39;Toole, maintaining Quebec&#39;s controversial secularism law is a provincial debate on this item and not budging from the national stance. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start here. Let&#39;s talk about this. This is an extension of the fireworks moment of the debate in this last federal election, of a key series of questions in the 2019 federal election, and now rearing its head as a real-life example of someone wearing a religious symbol in Quebec against a discriminatory law which discriminates against three groups of people. Muslim women seek men and Jewish men who wear a kippah, and here we are with a real-life example of this happening in Quebec.</div>

I&#39;m not religious and I&#39;m not particularly interested in seeing a bunch of religious symbolism in public classrooms and those types of things. But a hijab and or a crucifix around the neck or, you know, these these kind of low key religious symbols don&#39;t bother me as much as the, you know, for example, the Ten Commandments, you know, painted on the on the steps of the courthouse or or, you know, portraits</div>

Your job is to kind of say, okay, I put together a strategy for Jagmeet Singh that kind of de-risks it so that it doesn&#39;t maybe have negative impact for the party down the road, that it isn&#39;t to Carter&#39;s strategy of beating the drum excessively hard.

Were we playing, you know, tackle football? Or were we playing flag football? Were we playing, you know, were people able to join online? Or was this going to be on the field with a high rate of, you know, membership costs to be able to attend. Well, we got some clarity this week when the UCP board of directors and the executive rejected calls for more than a quarter of its constituencies associations to hold an early leadership review before March 1st. So that&#39;s off the table, as you guys predicted. In a letter, they said that that is not happening. We&#39;re going to be April 9th in Red Deer, in person only, no independent body verifying the votes. You dissenting members, fuck off. It&#39;s in April, on the 9th, in Red Deer. The board is set, and there&#39;s probably some other pieces we want to get into. But, Corey, initial reactions when you saw the scope that was now put on the table for what this leadership review would look like for Jason Kenney and his political future? Well,</div>

And that&#39;s not suggesting any great political genius came from that, right? Like that was becoming pretty widely telegraphed by the time we were talking about it. But the constituency associations get to request a special meeting. They don&#39;t get to dictate the terms of the special meeting. And that&#39;s what we said. And that&#39;s exactly what the president of the party said in her response to these constituency associations. So, April 9th, in person, $100.

You reduce the geography, the in-the-middle metropolitan area. Let&#39;s talk about the cost, $100. You know, you&#39;ve run a party before.

He&#39;s had a solid sort of win behind his back. He engineered a headline that was better, arguably, than even the optimistic one we&#39;d said on the podcast after that AGM. He&#39;s been on this economic cheerleader boosterism tour. You know, is he getting standing ovations and such? No, but he&#39;s definitely not talking about Omicron. He&#39;s He&#39;s not talking about COVID. And now he is set the table for this strategy. The insurgents couldn&#39;t afford you, Stephen Carter, but they&#39;re hiring you again. And I need you to go down this path to say, OK, you&#39;re back on board for them. This is a group of wild cards. They all don&#39;t even care for the same leader to take over from Jason Kenney. But they know one thing. Holy shit. He&#39;s actually running laps around us. Even though we may have different people that we want to take over the chair, this guy&#39;s fucking with us. We need to get on board together. What are you telling them right now, knowing that the game board has been set? $100 in person, Red Deer. He&#39;s got the economy by his side. He&#39;s got a new message. He seems to have a new lease on political life, and he&#39;s going fucking nowhere. What are you starting to tell these people in terms of what they need to start doing so he at least, at the very least, stops running laps around them within the confines of their own party?</div>

As in this case, government, but a government that&#39;s trailing in the polls. Is that how you would see this?
