            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s probably just worth reminding people about the Not Going Places contest. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">please do so. We are still looking for nominations. We put out the call to our thousands and thousands of listeners. We got one nomination so far. So it&#39;s looking like a pretty even race for that fellow. We could use a couple more. Obviously, Zane is always automatically a nominee for this particular award. But having won it four years in a row, I think we&#39;re a little hesitant to give it to him yet again. Again, so if you could just tweet at StrategistPod with your nominations for the Not Going Places Award. No, I will not explain what the criteria are for winning it. That would be very much appreciated. Yeah,</span>

Carter, please don&#39;t jump in at any point during this episode to fill those in that may not have listened to the last episode regarding the contest. But let me tell you something. Your base fare will be paid for. That&#39;s all I&#39;m</span>

Quote, if you&#39;re on this call, you&#39;re part of the unlucky group that is being laid off. Unquote, the CEO said, looking stiff and unemotional on the call. Carter, these individuals did not want to go places. They actually wanted to be part of our context, but now they&#39;re packing their bags and taking a Flair Airlines trip to another destination, which will not be Better.com, unfortunately.

Is that what it&#39;s supposed to be? And let the let the word circulate through the company. Don&#39;t take the Zoom meeting. Don&#39;t take the Zoom meeting.</span>

Quebec teachers removal for wearing a hijab. A quote-unquote cowardly move, minister says. Let me fill you guys in with some background. and I think we&#39;ve all heard of this story or a lot of us have heard of this story this week. Parents from the Chelsea Elementary School in Quebec said they found out that a teacher was being removed last week</span>

            <span class="text">when they received a letter about it. Some later learned it was due to her hijab and the teacher herself ultimately confirmed the fact in an interview to the Canadian press. In a statement to the Canadian press, the Western Quebec School Board, which was previously come out firmly against Bill 21,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the Quebec law, declined to comment specifically specifically due to confidentiality. Multiple politicians are speaking out to condemn the reassignment of the elementary school teacher who was forced to leave her job after being told that the hijab violates the province&#39;s law that forbids teachers from wearing religious symbols. It&#39;s cowardly, said Crown Indigenous Relations Minister Mark Miller. This type of discrimination isn&#39;t reflective of the Quebec society we live in. Jagmeet Singh coming out, others. Notably, and I&#39;ll add this one final piece of context before we get into the discussion, Aaron O&#39;Toole, maintaining Quebec&#39;s controversial secularism law is a provincial debate on this item and not budging from the national stance. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start here. Let&#39;s talk about this. This is an extension of the fireworks moment of the debate in this last federal election, of a key series of questions in the 2019 federal election, and now rearing its head as a real-life example of someone wearing a religious symbol in Quebec against a discriminatory law which discriminates against three groups of people. Muslim women seek men and Jewish men who wear a kippah, and here we are with a real-life example of this happening in Quebec.</span>

            <span class="text">just don&#39;t even know what to say. I mean, Quebec has always been a little out of step with the rest of Canada with some of their laws before it was the language laws. And now we&#39;re seeing, you know, this type of religious, anti-religious law. And I say this as someone who is not religious. I&#39;m not religious and I&#39;m not particularly interested in seeing a bunch of religious symbolism in public classrooms and those types of things. But a hijab and or a crucifix around the neck or, you know, these these kind of low key religious symbols don&#39;t bother me as much as the, you know, for example, the Ten Commandments, you know, painted on the on the steps of the courthouse or or, you know, portraits</span>

So, you know, I mean, it&#39;s a complicated matter in that fear of losing language, fear of losing culture, fear of being overwhelmed is really quite a predominant anxiety in Quebec, right? Which is this French island in this English North America, in this Western world that is predominantly English in outlook and approach, right? And so a lot of these things come from that place.

Or do you think there&#39;s too much to risk for the future of the NDP beyond Jagmeet Singh, that this would poison everything, that he would never do it and be too cowardly to do it from that strategic point of view?

They&#39;ve taken all their spots. You know, the Liberals had the most green platform. The Liberals had the most friendly platform.

That&#39;s not going to change. Just say that same line that you have been for the last, what, three years now? You&#39;re the 101st advisor. Your job is to kind of say, okay, I put together a strategy for Jagmeet Singh that kind of de-risks it so that it doesn&#39;t maybe have negative impact for the party down the road, that it isn&#39;t to Carter&#39;s strategy of beating the drum excessively hard. What would your version of of that if i if i forced you into that corner of providing trudeau with the version what would that look like for him if you were committed</span>

            <span class="text">fascinating we&#39;re gonna leave that we&#39;re gonna leave the headlines there that was a good conversation guys and moving on to our first segment that&#39;s right province most with leader best and membership most also yes we are headed into the uh we are headed into the uh north korean segment of the show where we discuss our province we&#39;ll be talking all things alberta guys there&#39;s so much to talk about i mean bill 81 we&#39;ll tease that out for folks what that&#39;s about but let&#39;s start here uh with a bit of a victory lap i in sort in a sense of sorts uh because cory you guys had a couple weeks ago i don&#39;t remember how many weeks ago uh definitely prior prior to the Zune episodes that we did, had mentioned how you felt like the Jason Kenney leadership vote would go, maybe not in terms of outcome exactly, that&#39;s still to come, but in terms of putting the pieces together, the restrictions, how the chessboard was set, what sport were we playing? Were we playing, you know, tackle football? Or were we playing flag football? Were we playing, you know, were people able to join online? Or was this going to be on the field with a high rate of, you know, membership costs to be able to attend. Well, we got some clarity this week when the UCP board of directors and the executive rejected calls for more than a quarter of its constituencies associations to hold an early leadership review before March 1st. So that&#39;s off the table, as you guys predicted. In a letter, they said that that is not happening. We&#39;re going to be April 9th in Red Deer, in person only, no independent body verifying the votes. You dissenting members, fuck off. It&#39;s in April, on the 9th, in Red Deer. The board is set, and there&#39;s probably some other pieces we want to get into. But, Corey, initial reactions when you saw the scope that was now put on the table for what this leadership review would look like for Jason Kenney and his political future? Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, as you said, I mean, you can roll the tape. They played it exactly like we thought they would. And that&#39;s not suggesting any great political genius came from that, right? Like that was becoming pretty widely telegraphed by the time we were talking about it. But the constituency associations get to request a special meeting. They don&#39;t get to dictate the terms of the special meeting. And that&#39;s what we said. And that&#39;s exactly what the president of the party said in her response to these constituency associations. So, April 9th, in person, $100. And it seems like, barring any kind of significant, significant changing of the landscape,</span>

And then I also want to talk about what he needs to do here on in. So, okay, we talked about the in-person versus online, right? Like you reduce the pool. You reduce the geography, the in-the-middle metropolitan area. Let&#39;s talk about the cost, $100. You know, you&#39;ve run a party before. When you see $100, it&#39;s not the $500, $600 that you often can sometimes pay to be an observer or the couple hundred that you have to pay often to be a delegate of an AGM. It&#39;s $100. What does $100 mean to you? I&#39;m kind of curious if there&#39;s anything that you felt like might be, and I know we&#39;re speculating a bit, the strategy behind $100.</span>

He&#39;s had a solid sort of win behind his back. He engineered a headline that was better, arguably, than even the optimistic one we&#39;d said on the podcast after that AGM. He&#39;s been on this economic cheerleader boosterism tour. You know, is he getting standing ovations and such? No, but he&#39;s definitely not talking about Omicron. He&#39;s He&#39;s not talking about COVID. And now he is set the table for this strategy. The insurgents couldn&#39;t afford you, Stephen Carter, but they&#39;re hiring you again. And I need you to go down this path to say, OK, you&#39;re back on board for them. This is a group of wild cards. They all don&#39;t even care for the same leader to take over from Jason Kenney. But they know one thing. Holy shit. He&#39;s actually running laps around us. Even though we may have different people that we want to take over the chair, this guy&#39;s fucking with us. We need to get on board together. What are you telling them right now, knowing that the game board has been set? $100 in person, Red Deer. He&#39;s got the economy by his side. He&#39;s got a new message. He seems to have a new lease on political life, and he&#39;s going fucking nowhere. What are you starting to tell these people in terms of what they need to start doing so he at least, at the very least, stops running laps around them within the confines of their own party?</span>

            <span class="text">for dramatic effect. So the first lane is just do a better job than him. You&#39;ve got a larger base to draw from. You know that there&#39;s more party members who are opposed to his leadership than not. Get the money. Get your people out. Do the same things he&#39;s doing and do it better. You&#39;ve actually got a bigger pool to draw from. So if you can organize half as good as him, you should still be able to win this thing. That should still be possible. Now, I don&#39;t actually think they can organize half as well as him. So I still feel like it&#39;s probably his to have there. And then there&#39;s a different one, Zane.

He&#39;s still going to be the guy running the election campaign. And he either wins or he loses. And it sounds like he&#39;s going to lose, which means you&#39;re now a backbench opposition MLA, if you&#39;re lucky. If you&#39;re lucky, because right now, as it stands, unless you&#39;re in rural Alberta, and by definition, then batshit crazy, you&#39;re going to be done. You&#39;re going to be done. There&#39;s no way that anybody who has a major municipality in their riding is going to be able to hold on the way that things are currently looking. So, well done, guys.

But I guess the overarching question I have is, do you, like some folks, see this as shifting shifting the goalposts when you&#39;re in power to make certain actions legal, amenable, justifiable, advantageous to your current situation. As in this case, government, but a government that&#39;s trailing in the polls. Is that how you would see this? Or is that in your mind, perhaps not the accurate way to digest at least what we know thus far of 81? We&#39;ll revisit it throughout, but I&#39;m curious from your perspective, top line.</span>

And the same type of thing should be done with election laws. We&#39;ve tinkered with our election laws in Alberta quite a bit, Whether it&#39;s the Local Authorities Election Act, which governs the municipalities, or the Election Act, which governs the provincial elections from nominations to leadership contests, as well as third-party advertisers. They are shit now. They are really bad. First, the NDP weakened them and made them bad, and then the UCP came in right afterwards and made them worse. and nothing</span>

I mean, that&#39;s just, that&#39;s stuff that&#39;s very hard to wrap your head around. But the notion of somebody doing that to you, that does feel a bit like a violation.

They know they&#39;re not just private clubs, which is why they give themselves exemptions from rules that they apply to other people. The simple reality is, in our system, a citizen&#39;s access to political power is intermediated by parties. So it is in the public interest that parties are required to run elections with the same sort of integrity we&#39;d expect a general election to be run by.
