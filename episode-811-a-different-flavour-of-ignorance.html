          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the continued WE Charity fallout and how COVID-19 should factor into political strategy for Trump and Biden. How much trouble is the Trudeau government in? What should Biden's COVID-19 strategy be? And is Zain behind the #FreeWoj hashtag?

Justin Trudeau&#39;s brother, Alexandre Trudeau, got paid $32,000, so totaling close to $300,000 in speaking fees. With that piece of information layered on top of what we had talked about last week, and if you want the backstory on last week, you can go to last week&#39;s episode. But let&#39;s start here.

With the facts we have at the table, it&#39;s a conflict of interest. The Conflict of Interest Act describes it as Because, you know, a benefit, which, by the way, doesn&#39;t even need to be pecuniary, as we said, doesn&#39;t need to be about money for either yourself, your family, or your friends. And it was arguable whether or not it was a benefit for friends. But when you&#39;re talking about family, immediate family being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by an organization, so, like, the idea that, okay, it&#39;s the profit wing of the nonprofit charity, I mean, that&#39;s a distinction without a difference at this point.

And it&#39;s hilarious to me people are talking about Cabinet making this. You know, Cabinet is where things go to get ratified, not decided. The decision was made prior to it getting to Cabinet.

Uh, then media providing, Hey, here&#39;s the receipts. I think that was actually Canada land. That&#39;s it. Uh, well, we&#39;ve got receipts this show you did. And then they replied, Oh yes, we did our bad. So lying to the media, not a great strategy. Um, but this plus a number of other difficulties that we has been dragging along different accusations about how money is spent and all of that. And I&#39;m not saying that any of them are legitimate.

I don&#39;t want to start with the party. Corey, I want to start, if you are hired by Dr. Fauci right now to say, hey, listen, this is happening to me. This is happening to my role. This is happening in the midst of a very serious second wave, first and a half wave, however we want to assess it. What are you communicating? How are you advising me to communicate should i just stay low and let the politicians be the politicians or do i need to actually defend my voice because lives are at stake well</div>

So I can fully appreciate what he&#39;s doing. And I think that it&#39;s very easy to think that somebody&#39;s job is only the part of their job that you can see. But I suspect this is still a relatively small part of his job. Now, public communications, obviously a big part of the the overall consideration of government health apparatus, he&#39;s probably nudging it in a hundred different ways. He&#39;s probably talking to his counterparts at the state saying, just get out what you can. Just do your thing there. Everybody is trying to make a sandwich out of this shit right now. And if I&#39;m him, I&#39;m probably just picking my moments wherever I can. But I do not think that</div>

So when you&#39;re seeing younger age groups coming out massively for Biden, it doesn&#39;t matter too much to me. And there&#39;s one other thing that I saw on a poll that, you know, former Warren supporters are all voting for Biden. Former Bernie supporters are almost all voting for Biden. That is a very, very marked departure from where we were in 2016. And that will matter as well.</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, I&#39;m not actually spending a lot of time on polls this election. Not yet, at least. least. If polling is accurate, Biden has the election. And so I&#39;m looking for signs that there may be a bit of a polling miss, first and foremost. So part of my big scan is just identifying where narratives are playing in. I go to Fox News every day, I subject myself to that. I go through all of these different channels. And I try to see whether there are dents in the armor for the Republicans. And you&#39;re starting to see Republican channels criticize Republicans. Because if there there is a polling miss, I think it&#39;s largely because Republicans have decided not to engage in the polling game in many ways. Insofar as I am looking at polls, and this is certainly not something polled with frequency, but it&#39;s really on Biden himself and characteristics about Biden. I still worry that he is just, despite having been the vice president for eight years, despite having these decades of tenure, that he&#39;s a bit of a blank slate, he&#39;s a bit undefined, and that Yet most people have have locked or quote unquote locked place their vote at at least when pollsters call right now based more against Trump than for Biden. And certainly the polls show that that that is a real vulnerability for Biden, because if all of a sudden people start focusing more on Biden and decide, actually, I&#39;m not so wild about this guy. Maybe I&#39;m going to vote for Kanye or something like that.</div>

            <div class="said">Maybe not Kanye, but you hear what I&#39;m saying. All of a sudden, you could find that that lead could just evaporate overnight. night. So I&#39;m more looking for a polling fail. I&#39;m looking for the risk that Biden could absolutely collapse if the spotlight&#39;s on him. That&#39;s what I&#39;m spending my time. Beasley</div>
