            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">callback. Yeah, there you go. All righty, guys. So last week, Stephen Carter, of course, prognosticated that this story was not that big of a deal. a few more developments have</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">My record for prediction remains exactly the same, exactly the same as it always has. I am amazing at it. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So the fact that over a quarter of a million dollars has now been paid to the Trudeau family, that is new information. That&#39;s new information that I did not have when I last made the prediction. Let&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s start with that because there&#39;s been several layers of new information, But I don&#39;t think none as more relevant as what you just mentioned, Carter, which was over the course of 28 events, Margaret Trudeau got paid a quarter of a million dollars. Justin Trudeau&#39;s brother, Alexandre Trudeau, got paid $32,000, so totaling close to $300,000 in speaking fees. With that piece of information layered on top of what we had talked about last week, and if you want the backstory on last week, you can go to last week&#39;s episode. But let&#39;s start here. Carter, is this now scandal territory with what we&#39;ve learned this week? Let&#39;s start with this first sort of adding to the layer. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that scandal is an interesting word, but this is absolutely potential conflict of interest territory. This is absolutely, yes, they should go to the ethics commissioner and get a ruling territory. Scandal is not for us to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to decide. That is determined by the people and whether or not they choose to give a fuck. At this particular moment, they don&#39;t, so it doesn&#39;t seem to raise to scandal level. Certainly the political commentators care, the conservatives care. I care. I mean, I&#39;m looking at this and saying this doesn&#39;t pass a smell test. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me that someone didn&#39;t know that this was actually happening. When we made our comment last time, my belief was that Trudeau and his wife for giving their time freely to a charity, and I didn&#39;t see it as a conflict.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">This is bringing new information, and I eagerly await to find out what the ethics commissioner says, because this very well could be now a conflict of interest.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, where do you classify this with the new information we&#39;ve learned this week?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, if you don&#39;t care about this, you don&#39;t actually care about conflict of interest. It&#39;s not a potential conflict of interest. With the facts we have at the table, it&#39;s a conflict of interest. The Conflict of Interest Act describes it as Because, you know, a benefit, which, by the way, doesn&#39;t even need to be pecuniary, as we said, doesn&#39;t need to be about money for either yourself, your family, or your friends. And it was arguable whether or not it was a benefit for friends. But when you&#39;re talking about family, immediate family being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by an organization, so, like, the idea that, okay, it&#39;s the profit wing of the nonprofit charity, I mean, that&#39;s a distinction without a difference at this point. The two are basically joined at the hip.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That is a conflict of interest. That is a textbook conflict of interest. And there&#39;s just no getting around that. And the liberal whataboutism and the partisans right now going around saying no big, it&#39;s driving me mental because it&#39;s a big, it&#39;s a significant concern that the prime minister would not recuse themselves from a cabinet decision like this. Carter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, do you feel like this conflict of interest, especially with Trudeau, do you feel like it would have made a difference had he actually recused himself from the decision? Or do you feel like the damage here is done regardless?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I think that he could have recused himself from the decision and the decision would have been much cleaner. I mean, they keep trying to drag other people into this problem. I mean, today you&#39;ve shared with us the Globe and Mail article trying to bring Katie Telford into this and Seamus O&#39;Regan. um you know because they raised four hundred thousand dollars that&#39;s not their benefit they&#39;re they&#39;re connected to the charity that is not a conflict of interest in my mind um bill</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">bill borno the finance minister&#39;s daughter volunteered with the organization not a conflict of interest as soon as money changes hands that is a conflict of interest and it&#39;s easier to sit out the decision especially when you&#39;re prime minister this isn&#39;t really your decision to make um yes all decisions are made by the prime minister&#39;s office but at the same time the decision can be made and they can stand on the sidelines we&#39;ve seen this dozens of times where politicians will all but make the decision stand aside for conflict of interest reasons the decision gets made and they&#39;re able to say see i stood aside the conflict of interest there isn&#39;t one because i took the step to to remove myself from the final decision making process that&#39;s what should have been done those Those around the prime minister should have advised him to do that. Don&#39;t worry, sir. We got this. You don&#39;t need to be in the room. Why would you put yourself in that type of position is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the real question here for me, because that&#39;s where the judgment failing is. It&#39;s not a problem with, well, I didn&#39;t like the decision to</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, they would have been on legally more solid ground for sure. It wouldn&#39;t be such a slam dunk case of conflict of interest. But there&#39;s still the foundational how was this decision made, right? I mean, let&#39;s not forget there was still this sole sourcing of this contract. And it&#39;s hilarious to me people are talking about Cabinet making this. You know, Cabinet is where things go to get ratified, not decided. The decision was made prior to it getting to Cabinet. There had to be briefs. there had to be a briefing of the prime minister i am sure and uh and everything had to be signed off ahead of time before it even got to that final gate and um and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so yeah like the fact that he decided he needed to be in the room for it is is wild to me i i think that if he was in any way aware of these speaking fees that were coming in for his family and by the way the one for his wife not a big i mean it&#39;s twelve hundred dollars it&#39;s not nothing i think it&#39;s twelve hundred but the The idea is, like, we&#39;re talking hundreds of thousands for his mother. Like, that&#39;s a totally different game. Like, that&#39;s not, I forgot money. That was my income, money,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I want to go to you in a second, but Corey, back at you for a minute here. You mentioned if he knew that his mother was getting paid this money, is it reasonable for us as citizens to expect? Is it reasonable for Trudeau to know about these things? I want to get to that reasonable question because we&#39;re talking about distinctions without difference, something you brought up.</span>

            <span class="text">At this point, it doesn&#39;t matter. The coziness relationship is trying to be injected into the narrative with the liberals at large. This concept of whether he was in the room or not, people are putting that as a distinction, you know, without any difference. Should he have known, though? And does that matter?</span>

But like, it doesn&#39;t even make sense. It&#39;s like, hey, mom, how have you been? Oh, you&#39;ve been speaking at we for the last, I don&#39;t know, year and a half, pretty consistently. Well, that&#39;s, that&#39;s pretty tough to suggest that you don&#39;t know there&#39;s some sort of relationship there, unless you just do not have a relationship with your mother. And I don&#39;t know, I just I am at a loss on this one. I have no idea how many fail safes had to fail for them to move forward, knowing now what we know now.

This this should have been known. I think I know that the two speakers, you know, so this is represented through a speaker&#39;s agency. right so his mother and his brother are both going through the same speaker&#39;s agency i would ask the question who represented justin before he became prime minister in terms of a speaker agency i&#39;d be willing to bet it&#39;s probably the same speaker agency because he you know he&#39;s been a celebrity he&#39;s been you know out</span>

Yeah, that&#39;s a mistake. The mistake in my mind is forgetting is not protecting the principal. That&#39;s the job of the staff. They have to protect the principal. And they didn&#39;t.</span>

Like to your point, I know you were you&#39;re baffling, perhaps even struggling for words, which has never happened on this podcast before, as to what you think about this. But Carter said, it&#39;s the last line of defense ignorance. ignorance is it a line of defense is it a reasonable line of defense right now if you&#39;re the liberals sitting there with your strategic hat on you&#39;re thinking of all the moves is one of them on the table hey the pm just didn&#39;t know is that a reasonable action well</span>

            <span class="text">depends on how you define reasonable it is reasonable in the sense that as far as your bucket of tactics goes it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty empty and that&#39;s one that&#39;s still there um i i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know that it&#39;s incredibly persuasive, right?</span>

            <span class="text">Because look, the legal consequences of a conflict of interest are the same, whether it&#39;s apparent or real. And if you knew that your mother had a relationship with We Charity to the depth that she did, if you knew your brother did, again, like did this not come up over Thanksgiving dinner? We&#39;re supposed to believe you&#39;re totally unaware of just the the sheer volume of speeches that were being done for money. You have to act in a better fashion than that. And I guess, ultimately, this is part of why I&#39;m at such a loss. I think this is a pretty clear-cut case. This is a real problem. And</span>

The media seems to think that the way to cover this story is to try and track down everybody that&#39;s ever spoken at a WEA event and try and connect them back to Cabinet. That&#39;s diffusing the problem. I&#39;m loving that. I&#39;m loving the diffusion. So as many diffused voices as can be – because you can&#39;t take us all down. So let&#39;s go add in as many voices as possible and then try and get the ethics commissioner to rule before, I don&#39;t know, August the 15th. Obviously, this is a very important case, Mr. Ethics Commissioner. We need it by the 15th of August so that we can continue to govern. And then splash it out, do</span>

Now them supporting a charity is a sign of a conflict of interest. And that&#39;s true. Them Them supporting a charity is not a sign of a conflict of interest. And this expansion where it&#39;s just anybody who has touched the Kielberger&#39;s orbit or Wee&#39;s orbit makes them a conflict of interest is dumb and it dilutes the core argument.

So they seem to be going down two tracks right now, Carter. The first is calling for an RCMP investigation. litigation. I want to get your reaction to that. And then the second one is our good friend, Pierre Paulier of the Tories, saying that he&#39;s going to try to compel Justin Trudeau to testify as a witness at the House of Commons Finance Committee. What do you first, before we get into what they should be doing, let&#39;s assess what they are doing.

This one is the Trump administration undercutting Dr. Fauci. So not letting him brief, as Carter had mentioned, going against some of the advice advice and the backroom conversations where he was guiding and advising strategically what the country should be doing. I don&#39;t want to start with the party. Corey, I want to start, if you are hired by Dr. Fauci right now to say, hey, listen, this is happening to me. This is happening to my role. This is happening in the midst of a very serious second wave, first and a half wave, however we want to assess it. What are you communicating? How are you advising me to communicate should i just stay low and let the politicians be the politicians or do i need to actually defend my voice because lives are at stake well</span>

So I can fully appreciate what he&#39;s doing. And I think that it&#39;s very easy to think that somebody&#39;s job is only the part of their job that you can see. But I suspect this is still a relatively small part of his job. Now, public communications, obviously a big part of the the overall consideration of government health apparatus, he&#39;s probably nudging it in a hundred different ways. He&#39;s probably talking to his counterparts at the state saying, just get out what you can. Just do your thing there. Everybody is trying to make a sandwich out of this shit right now. And if I&#39;m him, I&#39;m probably just picking my moments wherever I can. But I do not think that</span>

On a scale of 1 to 10, how bad would it be for political communications? 1 to 10 for political communications if TikTok actually is banned from the United States?</span>

            <span class="text">insofar as it has any political cachet, it&#39;s usually in the cringiest sense. It&#39;s somebody goes on it, like Jagmeet Singh, who then jumps on a bunch of TikTok memes, and then everybody outside of TikTok fawns all over them, like, oh, look at this guy, look how hip he is. But, you know, it&#39;s not a deeply political medium. I think politics will survive in its absence. Carter,</span>

It&#39;s been above the average. and um there&#39;s there&#39;s just kind of this competing set of of data now when we talk about these salaries immediately everybody is going to say well okay but our cost structures are different there too if i&#39;m the government i&#39;m making sure that the doctors also have the ability to show their cost structure now every doctor has made these calculations already that&#39;s what they had to do when they filled out their taxes for</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to stop paying your doctors so much. Because every time we give give a raise to our doctors. The doctors across the country get a raise. And the reason for that is we pay the highest amounts. Now, we also have the highest salaries and the highest expenses. And that&#39;s why nurses also get paid the highest amounts. So if you&#39;re going to be doing cuts to doctors, you&#39;re going to be, you know, like nurses, doctors, all of these people, they get paid more in Alberta because the expenses are more because this is this is the market that we have have uh in the market i don&#39;t think we want to undermine it um doctors are significant small businesses within our communities and i don&#39;t think we want to undermine it in this particular moment this is the worst time to pick this fight and uh chandro knows it because he wrote it on march 24th 2013.</span>

She then accused a member of the UCP government for making faces and nonverbal intimidation. Long story short, the acting speaker asked her to apologize. She did not. And then she was booted out. How would you rate her handling of what&#39;s happened? And perhaps even just a broader analysis in your mind very quickly as to what you made of the situation?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, under, way under. In a week where the UCP introduced introduced legislation to expand private health care, destroyed the ability of unions to advocate for their members, and basically abolished overtime. Why would you move the focus to this? You took the focus off the big issues, issues in your box, in your frame, health care and jobs on the organized labor front, and you put it on you, Marie Reneau. Representatives who make it about themselves, parties who make it about themselves, instead of the people they represent, have lost lost their way. This was an amateur move by the NDP.

But you chose to be an MLA. It&#39;s filled with conflict. And now is not the time. There was a time we could have done this a few few weeks ago we could have done this at the height of the black lives matter movement discussions there are other times to do it but not this week this week is about your agenda items and that uh has been completely undermined um we still don&#39;t know what the bills are that have been introduced in the legislature because we&#39;re talking about this and if you&#39;re talking about out the wrong thing on your time then you&#39;re really screwing up quite</span>

            <span class="text">yeah so that kind of behavior matters a great deal non-verbal intimidation matters a great deal trying to trying to make people uncomfortable in the workplace matters a great deal but you were there you&#39;re fighting for a cause here and you&#39;ve got to matter you got to think about what matters the most and uh at this particular moment you have moved focus off of the things that could have have really moved the dial for you and um and yeah this would be fine if it was a different week but the fact that it occurred this week sometimes you&#39;ve just got and you know what i can already hear the counter arguments like this no that kind of behavior should always be called out</span>

So when you&#39;re seeing younger age groups coming out massively for Biden, it doesn&#39;t matter too much to me. And there&#39;s one other thing that I saw on a poll that, you know, former Warren supporters are all voting for Biden. Former Bernie supporters are almost all voting for Biden. That is a very, very marked departure from where we were in 2016. And that will matter as well.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I&#39;m not actually spending a lot of time on polls this election. Not yet, at least. least. If polling is accurate, Biden has the election. And so I&#39;m looking for signs that there may be a bit of a polling miss, first and foremost. So part of my big scan is just identifying where narratives are playing in. I go to Fox News every day, I subject myself to that. I go through all of these different channels. And I try to see whether there are dents in the armor for the Republicans. And you&#39;re starting to see Republican channels criticize Republicans. Because if there there is a polling miss, I think it&#39;s largely because Republicans have decided not to engage in the polling game in many ways. Insofar as I am looking at polls, and this is certainly not something polled with frequency, but it&#39;s really on Biden himself and characteristics about Biden. I still worry that he is just, despite having been the vice president for eight years, despite having these decades of tenure, that he&#39;s a bit of a blank slate, he&#39;s a bit undefined, and that Yet most people have have locked or quote unquote locked place their vote at at least when pollsters call right now based more against Trump than for Biden. And certainly the polls show that that that is a real vulnerability for Biden, because if all of a sudden people start focusing more on Biden and decide, actually, I&#39;m not so wild about this guy. Maybe I&#39;m going to vote for Kanye or something like that.</span>

So I&#39;m more looking for a polling fail. I&#39;m looking for the risk that Biden could absolutely collapse if the spotlight&#39;s on him. That&#39;s what I&#39;m spending my time. Beasley</span>
