        <p>Zain Velji is back in the chair, leading Stephen and Corey through a discussion about the consequences and strategic considerations around the Poilievre victory, the Green Party implosion and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Pierre Poilievre's overwhelming victory in the Conservative Party of Canada leadership and what effect the new King will have on our body politic. Should the Liberals be concerned about Poilievre? Is now a time to reconsider our relationship with the crown? And is The Strategists' soundboard the only thing less reliable than the Green Party of Canada? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We&#39;ve had enemy Paul. Of course, they they build her as the the leader that would make a breakthrough. And then, of course, as soon as she didn&#39;t make that breakthrough, they will by starving her of any resources or any sort of campaign strategy. They they turn on her. Elizabeth May said, listen, I don&#39;t want anything to do with it. She now is proposed to be a co-leader of the party. And now we&#39;ve got some other drama happening in the Green Party, Stephen Carter. I&#39;ll save the Green Party stuff for our final sort of segment or over under in our lightning round. But just quickly, your hot take on the Green Party as it stands right now, a hot topic on this podcast and one that I don&#39;t want to just shelve simply till the end, although that is when we&#39;ll discuss most of it.</div>

Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, we can say this was never a particularly competitive race. And we talked a bit about this as it was going on. We thought that the membership as it existed supported Pierre Polyev. Pierre Polyev sold the most memberships. This is in some ways not shocking, but the scope of it is. The idea that Jean Charest, who was seen as a credible candidate by many, including myself, not that I thought he was going to win per se this weekend, only got 16% of the points and, as you mentioned, only got the majority or plurality of the points in eight of the 338 ridings is pretty shocking.</div>

And I think for a lot of people, they&#39;re seeing that as perhaps the soft spot, the soft tissue in pure polyeth. Would you agree, Carter, that this guy&#39;s got these two different wavelengths he&#39;s operating? Or do you see it the other way, saying that, no, this guy actually has the flexibility to operate in two different wavelengths and own both of them at the same time, and they&#39;re in his coalition?

Case in point, let me give you an example. One of the comments that&#39;s been circulating the last couple of days is that why doesn&#39;t the left or the liberals or some third party group just say, Pierre Polyev&#39;s a white supremacist, that he hangs out with white supremacists? Shouldn&#39;t that be enough to just define this guy and get it over and done with?</div>

So you say white supremacist, yeah, that should be disqualifying. And those words have a lot of charge. But you do that three years out from an election, by the time the election comes, people are going to be somewhat numb to that charge. So when we talk about defining him at this time, it&#39;s making people feel things about him, but not salacious, shocking things, just things about his record right there. It&#39;s almost Pavlovian. You say Pierre, I say restricting a woman&#39;s right to choose. You say Polyev, I say it would kill childcare, universal childcare. childcare and so a lot of what your definition needs to be now is really around that um there&#39;s also a stream of work that is really about just wrong footing him over the next bit arrange some votes in the house of commons about canadian</div>
