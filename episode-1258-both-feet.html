          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, it depends on what we want to do. But here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been pitching to the two of you via text pretty aggressively all weekend. And I think as it&#39;s evolved, I&#39;ve gone through oscillation of, well, maybe we shouldn&#39;t. And those feelings of maybe we shouldn&#39;t are exactly ultimately why I think we should. And of course, talking about the Hamas terror attacks in Israel, and more specifically, the political reaction here in Canada, we&#39;ve seen some wild stuff. My personal quote unquote, favorite, and by favorite, I mean, like, the one that just needs to be talked about was Olivia Chow putting out a statement condemning the attacks. Two hours later, adding to the thread on Twitter, you know, saying there are also people suffering in Palestine or something to that effect, and then kind of like taking it down and doing a do-over on it all here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">then going quite hard after that, right, on the pro-Palestine sort of gatherings that were happening in Toronto, so to speak. So, like, multiple iterations, like going through a different chapter, a different version</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">over the course of 12 hours, maybe? You are seeing so many statements stacked on statements as people are trying to assess this. And there is some interesting</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">interesting stuff to unpack there. And I think that at a moment like this, where obviously something horrific has happened with Hamas&#39;s terror attack, and I just, like, let&#39;s start here so we&#39;re not misunderstood. Well, I&#39;ll give you my view. I&#39;m not going to put words in anyone&#39;s mouth, but the targeted murder and kidnapping of civilians, civilians that include children and the elderly, and the murder</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">murder and kidnapping of civilians was the point, to be really</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;re not saying collateral. This was the plan. That</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That is abhorrent. It&#39;s indefensible. It is not something that anybody should be standing up and supporting. It&#39;s fucking awful. There are a thousand dead in Israel, 800 dead in Gaza, countless injured, homes lost, families traumatized. It&#39;s fucking bad. And it&#39;s fucking bad ultimately because Hamas decided to take a terror attack.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s my bottom line on this one here. And there&#39;s no defense for this particular action. There is no series of actions that will make me okay with the actions that Hamas took. That&#39;s my personal view on it. I&#39;m going to throw that out there right there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is however a difficulty in in politicians are facing in how they&#39;re supposed to address this issue with</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">with a broader context there and even saying that is something people don&#39;t want to hear yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t want to talk about at this moment and i actually think that that&#39;s a very understandable response but if you&#39;re a politician what we saw for the first 12 hours 24 hours 48 hours was them wrestling with that and i think their good sense kind of broke when when they didn&#39;t realize they could immediately condemn terror. But part of it is this, you know, the overall views in Canada towards the two-state solutions and Israel and Palestine have been very dramatically shifting over the past 30 years. So,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="text">Hamas, you know, going after, as their core objective, to terrorize, right? There&#39;s a bunch of context we can go And we can talk about how abhorrent that is. But I want to get your take on what Corey&#39;s suggesting here, this sort of your initial take on this. And then let me add some shape to it. If we want to go in this direction, I can add some shape to it, because there&#39;s a few threads I want to pull at in terms of the domestic response. This podcast will not try to act as experts on the foreign policy front. We are not that. There are other people smarter than that. Carter and I both got fired as being Jerry Butt&#39;s assistant at Eurasia Group, right? There&#39;s a reason for that. Yeah,</span>

We&#39;re entering pure speculation, but I think for a good cause, so we can try to explain the broader macro of what might be going on here in terms of politicians wrestling with the message box and where it is in this very devastating crisis.</span>

            <span class="text">when what was interesting about this particular issue is we didn&#39;t you know People very quickly can come to condemning Hamas and the attacks and everything. But I think people were not 100% sure – I&#39;m talking about politicians here – what was expected of them in this particular moment because of how, in macro, the situation has evolved and Canadians&#39; views have evolved on this here. So, like, I&#39;ll get to your answer, Zane, but there was some polling done in 2020 about – and look, I looked at the poll questions, and I think the thumb was on the scale. I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re necessarily the greatest phrasings of questions, but it was polling done by ECOS, and it was legitimate polling, and it asked, effectively, how do you feel about Israel looking to abandon, you know, a two-state solution? solution and canadians very opposed three quarters opposed to it and um and why i think the thumb was on the scale a bit is the question did say like canada supports a two-state solution israel&#39;s now walking away from it how do you feel about i mean</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but in addition to that almost a half of canadians wanted sanctions against israel at the time and and views are not so reflexively supportive of the israeli state amongst canadians as a whole as they were in decades past and and some of that is demographics and maybe we can get into that in a minute and some of that&#39;s not maybe some of that&#39;s just shifting worldviews but to get back to olivia chow and what the hell do i think happened there is there was a statement of oh my god this is horrible and then somebody or somebodies or groups of people around olivia chow said you</span>

            <span class="text">you there are all of these other events where people have died in numbers and gas and if If you look at it over the past 20 years, the number of civilian deaths and casualties on the Gaza side far eclipsed what&#39;s going on now. I&#39;m sure somebody said that, and I&#39;m sure Olivia Chow, well-intentioned, said, my goodness, I think I need to comment about how there is problems on each side of the Gaza barrier, right? And did that. But</span>

And, you know, this is where the comments are. And so then it was kind of like a pull down and a redo. And as this evolved, and as the scope of the terror attack became clear, and as the reporting became more filled out, and as people all started shifting towards that, you know, decision that they were going to give the full-throated support to the state of Israel, which I think collectively politicians have largely decided to do at this point. That&#39;s where we&#39;ve converged,</span>

And it&#39;s not fascinating to me where they ended up. It&#39;s fascinating to me that there was the moment where, you know, a not insignificant number of people weren&#39;t quite sure what to say and weren&#39;t quite sure what to do, largely because it was colored by the broader shifts on this issue before kind of the full scope of the terror was</span>

And I know we&#39;re right in the middle of this, and this is another hot button issue, right? So I&#39;m asking you, hey, are we creating political rules as we see this develop? That&#39;s not what I&#39;m saying. But there is something to Corey&#39;s point around, well, let me just address it straight up.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Does anyone care about context when something so acute and horrible happens? And this is where I ask you about the political rule here, right? If you were advising someone today, and let&#39;s say this had happened on the other side, right? And there&#39;s arguments to be made on the other side, right? But does the context matter, right, to Corey&#39;s point? Or as a politician, is your response to reflect where people are at today in this acute moment? And treat this as an event rather than as a continuum. Maybe that&#39;s a better way of phrasing it. And so I&#39;m just kind of curious if you&#39;ve got any thoughts on that. Because that is what the, at least the expectation of many, was to treat this as an event, not as another milestone, as horrible as it is, in terms of a long historical continuum. Your thoughts on that? Yeah,</span>

And it kind of put us back into a box that we&#39;ve been in a number of times when I talk about leadership versus reflection, right? right? There used to, you know, foreign affairs used to be a place where leadership could consistently exist. And that leadership, because we didn&#39;t know very much, right?

But Corey, I wanted to kind of get your reaction to this event versus continuum, right? And if there is an emerging, if not already baked rule for how political leaders need to think about this, is context around the continuum of history important?

They&#39;re looking for you to show compassion to their particular set of pains, and they&#39;re looking for you to try to help as best you can. They are not looking for you to say, well, we ended up in this situation because of A, because of B, because of C. And that is true, even if A, B, and C are so fucking big, they&#39;re neon signs on the side of the wall.</span>

But there&#39;s also this, if you take a side based on an event, and other people, and especially with the demographic change in the courtroom, this might be a good time to talk about the demo changes in this country, are viewing this as a continuum, and you take a side on an event, that&#39;s</span>

And that is a shifting reality, but that is the reality we sit in right now. And particularly, when you think about Ukraine in a place like Alberta, significant Ukrainian population, as large as it gets outside of Ukraine.

And this is for fucking sure not all something that you can lens through religion. But let&#39;s talk a little bit about religion for a moment. In 1991, there were more practitioners of the Jewish faith in Canada than Muslim faith, by about four to three. It wasn&#39;t like a massive advantage, but there were more practitioners of the Jewish faith than Muslim faith. Fast forward to 2021, it&#39;s now five to one practitioners of the Muslim faith over the Jewish faith. In a young city like Calgary, 15</span>

And Zane, I was saying this to you before we hit record here, but we&#39;re getting to a place where there is probably more likelihood of you knowing somebody or being related to somebody in Gaza City than Tel Aviv, right? Those connections are shifting, and they&#39;re shifting rather significantly over a relatively short period of time historically. And so those worldviews and those cultural concerns and context are shifting too.</span>

We are not experts on the Middle East. but there is this this western tradition of viewing uh you know world war ii and the holocaust and you know the establishment of the state of israel and the immediate attacking of the state of israel that is kind of fading in history and that&#39;s fading culturally as different cultural groups come come kind of to the forefront of canadian uh conversation and so conversations are changing as well and it&#39;s really interesting to me what those consequences are if you play them forward and what kind of effort and work it will take to</span>

And that interpretation is unpredictable at the current moment, right? So this is forcing us, us being the political class, if you will, to dodge around the issues until we see exactly how the facts are going to be received.

            <span class="text">Well, Corey, jump in. I was just going to add, you know, just to kind of support Carter&#39;s point, you know, this confusion that politicians are having as well extends beyond the response of the first 24 hours, right? As these, if you want to call them counter protests, some may call them pro-Palestine protests, others have labeled them as pro-Hamas protests, whatever they are, the timing of them really kind of puts into jeopardy perhaps the pro-Palestinian movement in terms of what they were out there advocating for. um but politicians really were mealy-mouthed and confused on this until there was pushes to say well look at the timing of this even if this is pro-palestinian this is not making sense what are they out there celebrating right a little bit in poor taste i know i know and so and so you know for for those that that were even were looking to respond to this after they put out their initial statement and they you know they put it out and they said the response and they hoped that it would land there is going to be more of this there is going to be significantly more of this this is not like a one and done, we got through it this time, I read the tea leaves correctly, thank God, licked my finger, the wind blew the right way. There is going to be iteratively more of this, and we need to be tooled as both political practitioners and, frankly, as like citizens in terms of how we want to necessarily understand and digest these issues.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, so there is the political political conversations to come, as well as the past 96 hours at this point that have occurred. Because Carter, you did say people are, and Zane, you sort of agreed, a little confused about this. I think that&#39;s true. It&#39;s more true, I think, in the way you said it, Zane. People have somewhat gravitated to the position of, no, we just need to be very strong against terror. We need to be very strong against Hamas&#39;s actions there. And that is ultimately where the politicians have landed, I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">actually think 12 hours later than they should have, you know, but anyways, that&#39;s in some ways a fascinating reflection of some of those, you know, changes on the issues that have occurred that are, you know, kind of floating out there and almost kind of polluting judgment is my personal view on it there. But there is, there is the issue of time the other way, like you can make these bold statements, you can make these dramatic statements, and then reality is going to hit you in the face the next day in terms of now, Now what do you say about the rally, right? Now what do you say about – we&#39;re at a moment in time right now where – What do you say right now where</span>

            <span class="text">where – like I don&#39;t know if this is where you&#39;re going, so not to interrupt you. I apologize. But like when the death toll of civilians in Gaza outstrips – if I don&#39;t mean this to make a comparison – outstrips the death toll of Hamas&#39; terror attack against Israelis. Are you now going to be – I think the answer is going to be no because we&#39;ve never seen it in this country. but it opens up that same fucking question of like you took a bold stance you got through it but did you so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so that is where i was going i do want to say right now before i go a moment further there is a big difference in intent like again i&#39;m asked targeted civilians you know but but you&#39;re right i mean and we we do know that the history of these uh you know these uh offensive and counter-offensive thrust and parry is often that it&#39;s the civilians in gaza who end up disproportionately affected in the long term again there are questions of intent and targeting and i am not trying to diminish any of that and i am not trying to kind of prejudge that those things are going to happen hopefully the idf does a very good job of avoiding civilian casualties but the uh you know history has sort of trained us that that&#39;s not likely to be the case and we will likely get to another place and have you gone so far out one way that</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">are fascinating questions. Especially to your earlier point, as the ground shifts demographically. If you, as a politician, to Carter&#39;s frame, want to reflect versus lead on certain things, if the grounds are shifting demographically, and more, to kind of use my analogy, are viewing this as a continuum, and may already have, to Carter&#39;s point, figured</span>

            <span class="text">figured out their position and are not kind of looking to oscillate on it every time there&#39;s another, you know, unfortunate milestone or in the historical continuum, then you&#39;re going to have to figure out how you, you know, deal with this in a real meaningful way. And it just seems like we just don&#39;t have the political tools, the political sort of patience to be able to do that. And I might be asking for too much here, Carter, am I?</span>

We&#39;re going to still be on the side of Israel in that particular one here. I know you&#39;re trying to broaden the issue here. I want to say that at the very least, there are bigger challenges and bigger kind of context in terms of Palestine and the two-state solution. And it&#39;s an interesting question through that lens and what might occur in the future. And And let&#39;s be really clear, like, a month ago, we were all kind of pissed at Netanyahu, right, for what he was doing in Israel to kind of civil society in Israel. So, you know, point taken, but, you know, I think that because the politicians have been so emphatic about this is about Hamas, I think they&#39;re somewhat inoculated</span>

Like, they&#39;re framing this as Hamas, but there&#39;s also a conflation now, which leads me to this next point, Carter. Carter, how far back do you think this has set any sort of pro-Palestinian movement, perhaps, in the Western world from this context? I&#39;m just kind of curious to get your read as we live it, and that&#39;s never a good idea to, like, read the historical context while you live in it.</span>

I want to know to what degree, because I feel like even a couple years ago, I think we recorded a podcast about this, the ability to say, you know, that anti-Zionism is not being anti-Semitic, that line of, you know, thinking, especially after what happened in 21 and 22 became very popular, right, very culturally and socially possible</span>

Certainly we talked about it. We thought, you know, there are reasonable people who had reasonable ideas about how this would be a potential solution, that this is something that could work.

            <span class="text">Like, what would you advise politicians as a result of this? I guess this is my question. Like, would you say, you know what? what, if you are active on X, you&#39;re going to be caught in the trap of speed. I&#39;m just making this up, but like, go with me. No, you&#39;re right. You&#39;re going to be caught in the trap of speed, and I don&#39;t want you to be caught in that trap anymore. There&#39;s more social license than ever before to call this place toxic and filled with misinformation. Get off X, and your new strategy buys you more time so that you don&#39;t have to be in the moment. There&#39;s no demand of that sort of thing. I&#39;m just kind of curious if this is setting some parameters where we are culturally with speed, because I I think some of the mistakes, I&#39;m putting mistakes in quotes for those that can&#39;t see it, around folks that made statements or that needed to course correct or needed to kind of figure out where the pulse of the country was, was that they wanted to do it quickly. They were being demanded to do it quickly. So talk to me where we are culturally on speed right now.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, look, I think that it has always been a complicated algebraic equation as to speed and content, right? And there is a general rule we&#39;ve talked about, which is the quote, later it is, the more thorough it&#39;s expected to be, right? Like the more specific. I do think areas like X, you know, Facebook, Instagram have kind of broken those equations a bit. And now there&#39;s an expectation of being thorough and fast because the conversation moves so bloody quickly.</span>

Well, yeah, I mean, that&#39;s certainly probably the best defensive strategy, but defensive strategies don&#39;t tend to win politics in the long run yeah right and i think that that&#39;s the reality that people are crashing up against there and so you&#39;re gonna have to you&#39;re gonna have to get a lot better at thinking a lot clearer and a lot simpler about these things and you know i&#39;m actually a little pissed at myself that in the last round where i said like we i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good idea if counselors should be expected to be experts in the middle east that&#39;s not even what we&#39;re fucking talking about i think it&#39;s not much of a stretch to say counselors should be able to to condemn terror attacks okay but like you know the overall point lands that we ask people to go outside of their lanes an awful lot but uh but that&#39;s just the reality of politics this day that&#39;s been the reality of politics always people don&#39;t care about what order of government you are carter tells the story about joe clark being asked to fix street lights or whatever the fuck it was and</span>
