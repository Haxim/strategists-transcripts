And I think as it&#39;s evolved, I&#39;ve gone through oscillation of, well, maybe we shouldn&#39;t. And those feelings of maybe we shouldn&#39;t are exactly ultimately why I think we should. And of course, talking about the Hamas terror attacks in Israel, and more specifically, the political reaction here in Canada, we&#39;ve seen some wild stuff. My personal quote unquote, favorite, and by favorite, I mean, like, the one that just needs to be talked about was Olivia Chow putting out a statement condemning the attacks. Two hours later, adding to the thread on Twitter, you know, saying there are also people suffering in Palestine or something to that effect, and then kind of like taking it down and doing a do-over on it all here.</div>

So, like, I&#39;ll get to your answer, Zane, but there was some polling done in 2020 about – and look, I looked at the poll questions, and I think the thumb was on the scale. I don&#39;t think that they&#39;re necessarily the greatest phrasings of questions, but it was polling done by ECOS, and it was legitimate polling, and it asked, effectively, how do you feel about Israel looking to abandon, you know, a two-state solution? solution and canadians very opposed three quarters opposed to it and um and why i think the thumb was on the scale a bit is the question did say like canada supports a two-state solution israel&#39;s now walking away from it how do you feel about i mean</div>

And as this evolved, and as the scope of the terror attack became clear, and as the reporting became more filled out, and as people all started shifting towards that, you know, decision that they were going to give the full-throated support to the state of Israel, which I think collectively politicians have largely decided to do at this point.

If you were advising someone today, and let&#39;s say this had happened on the other side, right? And there&#39;s arguments to be made on the other side, right? But does the context matter, right, to Corey&#39;s point? Or as a politician, is your response to reflect where people are at today in this acute moment? And treat this as an event rather than as a continuum. Maybe that&#39;s a better way of phrasing it. And so I&#39;m just kind of curious if you&#39;ve got any thoughts on that. Because that is what the, at least the expectation of many, was to treat this as an event, not as another milestone, as horrible as it is, in terms of a long historical continuum.

And this is for fucking sure not all something that you can lens through religion. But let&#39;s talk a little bit about religion for a moment. In 1991, there were more practitioners of the Jewish faith in Canada than Muslim faith, by about four to three. It wasn&#39;t like a massive advantage, but there were more practitioners of the Jewish faith than Muslim faith. Fast forward to 2021, it&#39;s now five to one practitioners of the Muslim faith over the Jewish faith. In a young city like Calgary, 15</div>

As these, if you want to call them counter protests, some may call them pro-Palestine protests, others have labeled them as pro-Hamas protests, whatever they are, the timing of them really kind of puts into jeopardy perhaps the pro-Palestinian movement in terms of what they were out there advocating for. um but politicians really were mealy-mouthed and confused on this until there was pushes to say well look at the timing of this even if this is pro-palestinian this is not making sense what are they out there celebrating right a little bit in poor taste i know i know and so and so you know for for those that that were even were looking to respond to this after they put out their initial statement and they you know they put it out and they said the response and they hoped that it would land there is going to be more of this there is going to be significantly more of this this is not like a one and done, we got through it this time, I read the tea leaves correctly, thank God, licked my finger, the wind blew the right way. There is going to be iteratively more of this, and we need to be tooled as both political practitioners and, frankly, as like citizens in terms of how we want to necessarily understand and digest these issues.</div>

Like, you sometimes do get called out more for, like, being the person who, you know, swapped your statement out for something else changed course didn&#39;t know i want to just talk about this notion of the double down in terms of you know this is where i stand it might be missing some of the elements we&#39;ve societally converged on but this is where i&#39;m at and i&#39;m comfortable with it and i know there&#39;s a conviction element to this that i&#39;m not even addressing like you know this person might have a conviction that like you know this is what i want to say and i don&#39;t give a fuck and i&#39;m willing to lose political capital on this like i&#39;m spending it and I&#39;m fine.

You&#39;re going to be caught in the trap of speed, and I don&#39;t want you to be caught in that trap anymore. There&#39;s more social license than ever before to call this place toxic and filled with misinformation. Get off X, and your new strategy buys you more time so that you don&#39;t have to be in the moment. There&#39;s no demand of that sort of thing. I&#39;m just kind of curious if this is setting some parameters where we are culturally with speed, because I I think some of the mistakes, I&#39;m putting mistakes in quotes for those that can&#39;t see it, around folks that made statements or that needed to course correct or needed to kind of figure out where the pulse of the country was, was that they wanted to do it quickly. They were being demanded to do it quickly. So talk to me where we are culturally on speed right now.</div>
