            <span class="text">that was your zane yeah it was pretty good terrible zane um okay i you know what i i try to when i get faced with something that i have I have such like an immediate visceral negative reaction to, I try to create like a charitable read of it. I try to say, okay, that&#39;s, that&#39;s me. That&#39;s my baggage. That&#39;s what I&#39;m bringing into it. Let&#39;s step back. Let&#39;s, let&#39;s get to intent. So why don&#39;t we start with intent? Okay.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This seems to be an act designed, well, not seems to, I have the legislation open or the draft legislation in front of me, seems to be an act that is designed to allow the Alberta government to change any of its laws, any of its regulations, any actions taken by any provincial entity, which we&#39;ll get into, in order to stymie the federal government. Should they do something that the provincial government decides is either A, unconstitutional or B, harms Albertans?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s, you know, like B is pretty big. You know, A is like kind of the narrow version you could have expected of this bill. We feel the government&#39;s being unconstitutional, so we&#39;re going to act in a certain fashion. B is like, we don&#39;t like it. Therefore, we are going to do this.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i just gotta throw this on the table now how that is done is there is a simple vote of the legislature on essentially we think the federal government&#39;s doing something bad we propose you look at these solutions there&#39;s a couple of other things there simple vote not not like passing a bill not three readings not full legislation and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then it proposes like a general course of action to cabinet to go away and figure out cabinet</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s pretty problematic because this is a bill that lets cabinet modify acts outside of the legislative process based on their view of federal initiatives because this is the other thing it doesn&#39;t require an actual federal act it doesn&#39;t even require an actual federal action it requires an</span>

And this is where I think we kind of have to go into a little bit of how government&#39;s supposed to function. So government is different than the legislature, which is different than the courts, which is different. But the government itself, the cabinet ministers and the bureaucracy are supposed to be governed by what comes out of the legislature. The legislature passes the laws. Those bills that become law are all passed through the multiple reading process in the legislature, debates, multiple stages where opposition has the opportunity to filibuster, to have their voices heard, where friendly amendments can be made, legislation gets stronger. But ultimately, the legislation is then passed by the legislature. And then within those pieces of legislation, the government is able to put in certain regulations, but they can&#39;t just ignore, they cannot change laws</span>

And actually, that&#39;s one of the other things I want to throw on the table here. It defines the constitution actually in a pretty narrow sense. It defines it based on the written documents, the Constitution Act of 1867, 1930, 1982, and the schedule, which does include a bunch of acts, including the Alberta Act, I&#39;ll mention, which is just the act that created this this province.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But our constitution is more than that. And one of the things I was thinking about is that there are so many people that I have gotten it into on Twitter about the federal power of disallowance, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So for our listeners who are not familiar, our constitution actually allows the federal government, the federal cabinet to disallow any piece of provincial legislation. This is not a power that the federal government has used in almost 100 years. The last Last time they used it, I believe, was in Alberta. There&#39;s also a similar power of reservation where they can kind of hold it and they can say, well, actually, we&#39;re going to talk about that piece of legislation, not the provincial lieutenant governor.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I guess my point would be this. There is an argument out there that because that clause has not been used in 90 years, that clause is no longer active.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The provincial government has now decided we are all just about the written text, right? So their interpretation here, I think in a funny way, sort of would allow disallowance because they&#39;re not including any of the ways that our interpretations of these things evolve over time. They&#39;re not even including like court cases and things of that nature being part of our constitutional body. body.</span>
