        <div class="desc"><p>The gang talk about how budgets are issue managed, Trudeau's ten-month polling slide, the rise of long form content and much, much more.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter assess whether political moves - the PM on podcasts, Liberal budget moves, the Alberta government reversing course on low-income transit passes - are "masterstrokes" (great job!) or in need of "MasterCraft" (break out the tools, this needs fixing). Does the Prime Minister need to "read the room"? How can you assess when a small budget reduction is about to be a big issue? And when will Zain admit that it's over? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">carter before we jump into to our segment for today. Well, talk to me about this. How should we prepare when the Prime Minister comes on to host the show? Now, do you want me to swap into a panel seat? Do we want to reward Annalise&#39;s absence with a guest appearance? There&#39;s some details we need to figure out. And I mean, the patrons are the people to help us out with this. So if you&#39;ve missed it, Prime Minister will be coming on our podcast to host it eventually. I think I missed this. A Prime Minister of a A country will be coming on to host this. We have put the offer out. No confirmation yet, Carter. But you know what they also say? No denial either. So, you know, Carter, it is still very much a open prospect. But we&#39;ve got to figure out some details. Let&#39;s figure out these details now before we jump into our segment.</div>

And Carter, let me start with this one. We talked about this very briefly. In fact, we&#39;ve been talking about it, one would say, for the last 10 minutes. Justin Trudeau doing a bunch of human interest interview me on policy, but you don&#39;t really have a good sense of my policy because you&#39;re probably from America and or you have no idea why my office called you to interview me, so you&#39;re going to give me a softball interview. As a political strategy, Carter, you&#39;re going to bust out some mastercraft tools and make it better? Or is this a master stroke and it actually makes a lot of sense, it&#39;s cogent, and you would do the same if you were in the PMO shoes? Mastercraft, master stroke, what is it?</div>

The pros are you get to talk to people for longer than a soundbite. So you get to expose some of your personality, you get to have a conversation with folks, you get to remind them probably why they liked you in the first place. I think one of the things about politicians that get a little bit longer in the tooth is we start to – it&#39;s just like they&#39;re so well-formed. All we can see is their brand and the caricature of that brand in many cases, and this allows it to break through. And so I get that, and I get the appeal of that. I also think it&#39;s part of an overall trend, which is super fascinating.</div>

Was it the population and just a so, like, paltry sum of it? Or was it more than that? Break it down elementally for me in terms of what ingredients went into creating something that created that software, but more so what lesson could be replicated or what sort of checklist should folks think about when we think about chopping $3, $4, $5, $10 million programs in multi-billion dollar budgets in terms of this as being perhaps a bit of a case study?</div>

I think it&#39;s all part of like a gumbo here, which is cities looked pretty good this week. And the provincial government had a few pretty serious errors when it came to municipal affairs. And so, yeah, they were handed not just something where they could take a stance against the province in a united front, you know, in terms of getting the left and the right of council together, they were also handed a shield with which to protect the very idea of municipal sovereignty. It&#39;s really fascinating. And I mean, you got to be good to be lucky, and they were very lucky this week.</div>

          <div class="said">You know, we&#39;ve heard of these Teflon governments and these Teflon politicians in the past. And I look at this backtrack. I look at Bill 20. There are just a few examples. I look at some of the things they&#39;ve announced in the past, which are in and out of public consciousness and will probably reemerge in public consciousness. Have you determined from your strategy brain, your ops practitioner brain, whether they have actually gained this superpower with the public yet? And there&#39;s a handful of politicians across our Canadian history that we can look to and be like, oh yeah, Harper was Teflon on many things. Doug Ford, a great Teflon-like politician. Are you seeing that yet? Like, converge the tea leaves for me. Just using these two examples we&#39;ve been talking about right now with low-income transit and Bill 20, are they a government that may not pay penalties for backtracking and reversing course slash apologizing?</div>

And one of the reasons is that Danielle Smith is an excellent communicator. Every time she steps up to the microphone, she does a great job of communicating her position.
