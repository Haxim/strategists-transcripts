Now, do you want me to swap into a panel seat? Do we want to reward Annalise&#39;s absence with a guest appearance? There&#39;s some details we need to figure out. And I mean, the patrons are the people to help us out with this. So if you&#39;ve missed it, Prime Minister will be coming on our podcast to host it eventually. I think I missed this. A Prime Minister of a A country will be coming on to host this. We have put the offer out. No confirmation yet, Carter. But you know what they also say? No denial either. So, you know, Carter, it is still very much a open prospect. But we&#39;ve got to figure out some details. Let&#39;s figure out these details now before we jump into our segment.</span>

In fact, we&#39;ve been talking about it, one would say, for the last 10 minutes. Justin Trudeau doing a bunch of human interest interview me on policy, but you don&#39;t really have a good sense of my policy because you&#39;re probably from America and or you have no idea why my office called you to interview me, so you&#39;re going to give me a softball interview. As a political strategy, Carter, you&#39;re going to bust out some mastercraft tools and make it better? Or is this a master stroke and it actually makes a lot of sense, it&#39;s cogent, and you would do the same if you were in the PMO shoes? Mastercraft, master stroke, what is it?</span>

            <span class="text">bit of a bias here, perhaps three people with a podcast might be convinced of the wisdom of podcasts. But here, let&#39;s just unpack it a tiny bit, right? The pros are you get to talk to people for longer than a soundbite. So you get to expose some of your personality, you get to have a conversation with folks, you get to remind them probably why they liked you in the first place. I think one of the things about politicians that get a little bit longer in the tooth is we start to – it&#39;s just like they&#39;re so well-formed. All we can see is their brand and the caricature of that brand in many cases, and this allows it to break through. And so I get that, and I get the appeal of that. I also think it&#39;s part of an overall trend, which is super fascinating.</span>

Has this tactic ever actually carried any water in this country? No, we voted against the budget. It was a confidence measure. We have no confidence in this government. We voted against it.

So yes, I will point you back to my previous comment about he may just be cooked. People just want him gone. They&#39;re not hearing him anymore. Even the things they like, they don&#39;t like.

You are losing votes to conservatives and your solution is to go further to the left does this seem like a pretty solid strategy to you like do you really want to start fighting about the capital gains tax do you really think canadians are that confident about your management of the economy and kind of the business ventures that exist in this country can</span>

And then the province comes out saying we&#39;re reversing course. The minister gives a statement saying, oh, turns out that, you know, the need to support low-income Albertans, and it&#39;s clear that the cities can&#39;t pay for it. That&#39;s a paraphrasing of his statement. I want to split this question up in three ways. I almost want to take the issue and neutralize it for a second maybe like leave our charge on the issue aside i want to talk about like political principles here political strategy principles carter and the first principle is</span>

When the modern day equivalent of Corey Hogan calls and says, what the hell is in this budget that might be scary? I didn&#39;t even think it was scary and I didn&#39;t even put it forward. Like that, I think to me is the most likely thing that happened. So I think to go where I started, it was intentional, but I don&#39;t think it was intentional from the Premier&#39;s office.

This was a $6 million program for the vulnerable. So what – elementally, what was it here? Is it just what I&#39;ve said in the sentence, which is the small dollar amount relative, and the target population? Or how would you kind of, what made this such a uproar, like a 24-hour uproar? Was it the population and just a so, like, paltry sum of it? Or was it more than that? Break it down elementally for me in terms of what ingredients went into creating something that created that software, but more so what lesson could be replicated or what sort of checklist should folks think about when we think about chopping $3, $4, $5, $10 million programs in multi-billion dollar budgets in terms of this as being perhaps a bit of a case study?</span>

So, one of the funny things we&#39;re always on the lookout for is like numbers that were very similar or simple Simple multiples of each other as well. And you got to watch out for that shit.

I think it&#39;s all part of like a gumbo here, which is cities looked pretty good this week. And the provincial government had a few pretty serious errors when it came to municipal affairs. And so, yeah, they were handed not just something where they could take a stance against the province in a united front, you know, in terms of getting the left and the right of council together, they were also handed a shield with which to protect the very idea of municipal sovereignty. It&#39;s really fascinating. And I mean, you got to be good to be lucky, and they were very lucky this week.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, we&#39;ve heard of these Teflon governments and these Teflon politicians in the past. And I look at this backtrack. I look at Bill 20. There are just a few examples. I look at some of the things they&#39;ve announced in the past, which are in and out of public consciousness and will probably reemerge in public consciousness. Have you determined from your strategy brain, your ops practitioner brain, whether they have actually gained this superpower with the public yet? And there&#39;s a handful of politicians across our Canadian history that we can look to and be like, oh yeah, Harper was Teflon on many things. Doug Ford, a great Teflon-like politician. Are you seeing that yet? Like, converge the tea leaves for me. Just using these two examples we&#39;ve been talking about right now with low-income transit and Bill 20, are they a government that may not pay penalties for backtracking and reversing course slash apologizing?</span>

            <span class="text">I think that they&#39;re going to pay penalties at some point. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re paying penalties yet. And one of the reasons is that Danielle Smith is an excellent communicator. Every time she steps up to the microphone, she does a great job of communicating her position. Even if it&#39;s factually challenged, she&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So it looks to me like she&#39;s got the makings of a government that understands how to communicate with their primary audience. And the primary practitioner of the communications in Danielle Smith is so strong right now. I mean, I don&#39;t like giving praise to this government because they&#39;re doing some rather</span>

            <span class="text">She certainly has the ability to bounce back. We&#39;ve seen that in a macro sense, obviously. Sure. And I do think part of her redemption tour really taught her the merits of just saying, hey, shit, got it wrong. going to move on right and that people generally speaking are willing to accept that and she knows it she&#39;s internalized it and she&#39;s made a part of her political bag of tricks and you know all the power to her for that right um does</span>
