        <p>Stephen Carter and Zain Velji finally expose the truth behind the Corey Hogan campaign. The gang discusses how "star" candidates affect volunteer turnout, before diving into a retrospective on the national campaigns. What were the highlights? What were the lowlights? Any why does Zain have such a soft spot for Jagmeet? Corey isn't getting any sleep tonight, but Annalise is here to ask questions and maybe get answers.</p>

          <div class="said">Here&#39;s my theory. this campaign potentially doesn&#39;t redefine, but illuminates what actual profile is and what the value of a star candidate actually should be. And more often than not, a star candidate in a contemporary political sense means someone who&#39;s got a bit of a profile. Rarely does it mean someone who&#39;s got a bit of a profile, or</div>

          <div class="said">or even not as a shining star profile per se, but has a deep deep group of folks that would do stuff for them. And I think one of the things that we often oversample on and overweight in politics is the person with a massive profile. And we undersample and undervalue the person with maybe slightly one rung less than that, where I put Corey in. But he means a lot to a very dedicated group of people, many of which are potentially podcast listeners and that have come out to show support for him and i think there&#39;s really something fascinating about that which is it&#39;s really a parallel between like the celebrity that has no one showing up for them because everyone else thinks everyone else will show up for them right because like they must have their own machine like you know if you&#39;re this gregor robertson must have his own fucking thing evan solomon like i&#39;m just pointing these names out because they&#39;re bigger names than cory&#39;s they just must have their own thing Like, why wouldn&#39;t they?</div>

And I think building community for community&#39;s sake, building your network for network&#39;s sake without having an end in mind, I think is actually quite important. And there&#39;s There&#39;s like philosophies on this beyond what Carter&#39;s talked about around those networks being really important.

          <div class="said">without kind of breaking confidences is that it&#39;s the two or three years that he had the Evan Solomon show, which was nothing to do with politics. it was a radio show across the country that was for three hours that had a call-in segment that he had to talk about whatever the issue of of the day was sure he&#39;d lean into politics every chance he could because that was a sweet comfort zone but you can&#39;t do that to a gen pop audience who wants to talk about fucking movie theater prices or whatever happened this week in sports and that ability to to kind of fully flex to like offer your opinion to monologue for six seven eight eight minutes because no one is calling because the lines are not lighting up about any given topic. I think that makes you a lot more relatable, especially when you don&#39;t have a safety net underneath. There&#39;s no talking points underneath. There&#39;s no sort of like go-to underneath. And I think, you know, the format definitely helps that way. And I think there&#39;s another example of someone who obviously has, you know, political star power.

And if we&#39;re wrong on that, then we&#39;ve got, you know, we got to talk about the most massive polling error in history of this country, if not Western democracy, potentially to discuss after Monday. But the NDP vote efficiency is different than the liberal vote efficiency, but it exists in the sense that it&#39;s not like on its own natural course. It doesn&#39;t just balance out like the rest of the country, like the liberal vote does, which is like, it&#39;s just so perfectly placed. It has very little in Alberta, so they lose by large margins and it&#39;s got a good, you know, you know all the stuff and listeners do. The NDP vote efficiency is very much driven by their ground game.</div>
