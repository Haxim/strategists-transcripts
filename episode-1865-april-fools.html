            <span class="text">there&#39;s such a thing as momentum and that when you have momentum, people come out. I don&#39;t think we can say that we&#39;ve solved the issue. Here&#39;s how you get lots of volunteers because I know that other campaigns, even successful campaigns, aren&#39;t able to draw the number of volunteers that we&#39;re drawing in Congress.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Here&#39;s my theory. this campaign potentially doesn&#39;t redefine, but illuminates what actual profile is and what the value of a star candidate actually should be. And more often than not, a star candidate in a contemporary political sense means someone who&#39;s got a bit of a profile. Rarely does it mean someone who&#39;s got a bit of a profile, or</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">or even not as a shining star profile per se, but has a deep deep group of folks that would do stuff for them. And I think one of the things that we often oversample on and overweight in politics is the person with a massive profile. And we undersample and undervalue the person with maybe slightly one rung less than that, where I put Corey in. But he means a lot to a very dedicated group of people, many of which are potentially podcast listeners and that have come out to show support for him and i think there&#39;s really something fascinating about that which is it&#39;s really a parallel between like the celebrity that has no one showing up for them because everyone else thinks everyone else will show up for them right because like they must have their own machine like you know if you&#39;re this gregor robertson must have his own fucking thing evan solomon like i&#39;m just pointing these names out because they&#39;re bigger names than cory&#39;s they just must have their own thing Like, why wouldn&#39;t they?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Versus a Corey Hogan who comes in, I think, in part due to the podcast with a group of people who intimately feel like they know him over the course of the last 10 years, feel like they could start mid-sentence talking to him because they&#39;ve been mid-sentence hearing him for the last number of years in that way. And I think there&#39;s something really interesting about that. And frankly, from a post</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">post-election perspective, how do you find more of those people and less of the overall sort of, you know, previously defined star version of candidates, so to speak? Because there is a value with someone who comes with the team, even if that team wasn&#39;t even asked to be mobilized until eight days into the campaign.</span>

And it&#39;s one of the core reasons why I don&#39;t even think we&#39;ve talked about enough, certainly on our show, which is the hesitation that Kamala Harris had to go on the Joe Rogan podcast was not the fact about Joe Rogan and the audience that he spoke to. I think that was a secondary effect, right? Like that whole sort of like, oh, he&#39;s already in it for Trump. He says crazy shit about vaccines. Like the platforming, I think, was the B track.

They&#39;ve shed all the the issues I&#39;ve had or in Corey&#39;s case, you know, doing that consistently over many years or being that person in community where, you know, you&#39;re not the person who&#39;s who&#39;s preparing for something and always wanting to do something.

And I think building community for community&#39;s sake, building your network for network&#39;s sake without having an end in mind, I think is actually quite important. And there&#39;s There&#39;s like philosophies on this beyond what Carter&#39;s talked about around those networks being really important. But I think what&#39;s more important is that everyone who forms a network in politics often is very clearly like six months later running for office. Right. And I think it&#39;s not</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s true. Like I&#39;ll use my buddy Evan as an example. So Evan Solomon is running in Toronto Centre. For years, Evan was one of the leading political journalists in the country. He continued to be until the time he left, but he added a beeline to his sort of career, which was he was a daily radio show host. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">without kind of breaking confidences is that it&#39;s the two or three years that he had the Evan Solomon show, which was nothing to do with politics. it was a radio show across the country that was for three hours that had a call-in segment that he had to talk about whatever the issue of of the day was sure he&#39;d lean into politics every chance he could because that was a sweet comfort zone but you can&#39;t do that to a gen pop audience who wants to talk about fucking movie theater prices or whatever happened this week in sports and that ability to to kind of fully flex to like offer your opinion to monologue for six seven eight eight minutes because no one is calling because the lines are not lighting up about any given topic. I think that makes you a lot more relatable, especially when you don&#39;t have a safety net underneath. There&#39;s no talking points underneath. There&#39;s no sort of like go-to underneath. And I think, you know, the format definitely helps that way. And I think there&#39;s another example of someone who obviously has, you know, political star power. He&#39;s definitely a known figure in politics. But I think what&#39;s really helping him, frankly,</span>

But he definitely is having the most fun. And there&#39;s something to be said about that. Where has it gone wrong for them? I mean, you could actually go further back to the campaign. This is a very, you know, this</span>

It&#39;s a kind of convincing line, depending on who you are and how much warm fuzzies you want to feel during the election, which is they knew that if they did that, Pierre Poliev would be prime minister. OK. But where it&#39;s gone wrong for them is really from the basis of not</span>

But the NDP vote efficiency is different than the liberal vote efficiency, but it exists in the sense that it&#39;s not like on its own natural course. It doesn&#39;t just balance out like the rest of the country, like the liberal vote does, which is like, it&#39;s just so perfectly placed. It has very little in Alberta, so they lose by large margins and it&#39;s got a good, you know, you know all the stuff and listeners do.

That is an area, even 10 years ago, Carter, young people want progressivism, young people want free shit, young people want liberal policies was almost baked in.
