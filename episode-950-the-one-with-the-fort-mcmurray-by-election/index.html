        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the strategic considerations of Brian Jean announcing a hostile nomination bid in the Fort McMurray By-election and the drama around the "Civil Liberties Caucus". Should Jason Kenney sign Jean's nomination papers? How might Kenney use Jean's gambit to his advantage in the leadership review? And what did Zain do Thursday nights in the 90s? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Fields. Fields full of rocks. You know what we call that? We call that organic. You owe them 300 president&#39;s choice points, in my opinion. Oh,</div>

Clearly, Air Canada CEO apologizes, commits to learning French as backlash in Quebec grows. Corey, Air Canada CEO Michael Rousseau has apologized and committed to improving his French amid heavy backlash by federal and Quebec officials who called his recent comments about not needing to speak French despite having lived in Montreal for 14 years shocking and disrespectful. He said, quote, I want to clarify that I did not in any way mean to disrespect Quebecers and Francophones across the country. I apologize for those who were offended by my words. He</div>

It doesn&#39;t sound like you actually lived there, if that&#39;s how little insight you have into the city of Montreal and the psyche of Montreal. Air Canada itself is a a very weird organization, because Air Canada was a crown corporation at one point, and there are still these vestiges of government control on Air Canada. The Official Languages Act applies to it. So yet another reason why you probably should have known better than to step into it here. But also, it creates a very weird dynamic, because other airlines don&#39;t have that consideration. You&#39;ll remember, well, maybe you won&#39;t, but when WestJet began, there</div>

If you were prepping a CEO of a company, giving a 30-minute sort of keynote-style speech in Quebec, and you know he&#39;s going to speak for 20 seconds, you&#39;ve helped him prepare the remarks, how would you have armed him to perhaps minimize or blunt the criticism that, of course, he was going to get? And perhaps you may suggest that maybe they were tone-deaf enough to think they weren&#39;t going to get the criticism, but let&#39;s just maybe blow past that.</div>

I actually really think you&#39;re framing for the leadership review for Kenny is actually advantageous. It&#39;s not Kenny versus some sort of like messiahic sort of person that could show up. It&#39;s like this guy. Okay. Now, if I&#39;m in the caucus then, right, let&#39;s start here with this question. Or if I&#39;ve got leadership potential, am I trying to do anything now that Gene is, you know, not denying that leadership is on his mind? He&#39;s even said in some of these early interviews that if Albertans would have me, I&#39;d love to do the job. Clearly, you&#39;re looking at this guy implicitly and explicitly for the top job if he enters the fray. Ray, suppose I&#39;m sitting in that caucus right now, there&#39;s a leadership review, and then the guy that might be the heir apparent, or at least the first to throw his hat in the ring to replace him, what moves do I think I need to make in the interim between now and leadership review to maybe muddle the question of what that leadership review might be about a bit?</div>

Otherwise, you get Brian Jean. And if it&#39;s about Brian Jean, it&#39;s about Brian Jean.

You&#39;ve got to think about the moves that your opponents might be doing, too, and how they might be trying to position you. And one of the things that is obviously going to come at Brian Jean, because you&#39;re already seeing whisper campaigns about it, is it&#39;s all about him. It&#39;s not about the movement. So you&#39;ve got to make it all about the movement, not about him. And I think that that humility that Stephen talked about is exactly what you&#39;ve got to carry into this, at least in your municipal campaign. And you&#39;ve got to go around and when you&#39;re door knocking, make a bit of a show of like, well, I&#39;ve always been clear. Like I started by saying, I do not support this leader.

There&#39;s a lot of controversy around this because, of course, now the scenario of raising the flags on the 11th to lower them again is one that&#39;s been accepted by Indigenous leaders.
