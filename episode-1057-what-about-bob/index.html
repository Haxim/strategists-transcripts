        <p>The gang talk the first two days of the Alberta election - launches, Pawlowski verdict, Smith seemingly dodging the media and more.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the first two days of the Alberta election - the events, the policy launches, the media availabilities - and the lack of all of the above from UCP leader Danielle Smith on day two. Is limiting appearances a strategy that will work for Smith? Can the NDP "make hay" of the Pawlowski guilty verdict? And what are you all hearing on the doors? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

But I think also in general, and one of the things that was chatter on Twitter was that Smith&#39;s campaign team had told reporters a few weeks ago that they would be like, yeah, every day there&#39;ll be an announcement, kind of standard campaign stuff. We actually talked about this last episode. This is the cadence of the campaign.</div>

I mean, it&#39;s not unprecedented in the sense that Doug Ford did a a pretty typical version of this as well. This is happening a lot more, particularly with governments. But what might be unprecedented is literally day two disappearing. Like, I cannot think of a time that has happened. That&#39;s really wild to me. Because at the end of the day, and maybe we can unpack this a bit, elections are supposed to be 28 days of accountability, where we hold a government to account and we consider our options. And the whole name of the game is is availability to voters through the media, right? The idea that you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re just, as the premier, going to talk to voters.

But I do believe in a democracy. That&#39;s kind of the bargain, right? Like we just say, like for these 28 days, there&#39;s no hiding. There&#39;s no sleeping. This is what you do. You&#39;re available to people here. And instead, for a bunch of tactical reasons, they&#39;ve decided perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be wise to put Danielle Smith up. Maybe they&#39;ll ask a question. Maybe that answer will be reported on. Maybe that answer is bad for us. We don&#39;t show up. They can&#39;t do it. They don&#39;t show up. People can&#39;t get outraged. If everything stays the way it is, we&#39;re going to win this thing. And really the only guard we have against, and by the way, it&#39;s not just Danielle Smith, like this is happening more, right? This whole general approach is happening more. And the guardrail is supposed to be, we all get mad about it, right? We say, no, accountability is required. You&#39;re not giving it to us. See you later. But instead we are all so, and this is so ironic as a guy who has this podcast, who is talking to people listening to this podcast, but we are all so up the ass of the meta analysis, right? Right. Like, oh, what&#39;s the tactic? And is this a savvy tactic for Daniel Smith?</div>

And that&#39;s an open question, right? Is the Q&amp;A part of the event? Because I can tell you, it&#39;s not just a UCP thing. I can think of a lot of times when I have, like, even for corporate clients, when there&#39;s a Q&amp;A component, been like, that&#39;s good, but that&#39;s not actually what I&#39;m going to put online at the end of it, because that&#39;s not the message I control.

We&#39;re fine if they&#39;re talking to you and not about Artur Pawlowski, right? And what&#39;s going to be interesting is not so much what the NDP does today, but what they do in the next couple of days and how they adapt to the UCP strategy. Because I 100% agree with you.</div>

You know, I think that he&#39;s a very reasonable individual and he would bring an awful lot to the debate. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re afraid of Derek Fildebrandt. I was willing to accept, you know, Don Braid, their moderator. I mean, I&#39;m just randomly picking a person, but the reality is she can create this equivalency between a mainstream personality on global global television, you know, at PostMedia, and whoever she wants to bring in from the rebel or true north or anything like that, and then almost look like the victim and say, I</div>

One of the things about it is it&#39;s new. And I am sure that they are watching carefully to see its success or not. And so this is a moment where if people push back on it, whether it&#39;s the public or the media in some way, shape, or form, they might bail on it, and they might go to five days a week.
