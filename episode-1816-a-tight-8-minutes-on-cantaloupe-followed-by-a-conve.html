Carter, we do this every time we have a new Democratic nominee. We have a one-question quiz that is presented to you last year. It was in 2020, I should say. It was about Joe Biden. He looked like the presumptive favorite. And I, of course, start a one-question quiz that I ask you. This is really to kind of get us going. In most cases, this would be the pre-show banter, but in this case, we had that excellent cantaloupe section, which people can refer back to if you missed it and you started this podcast at around 7.50. Yeah, if you started late. Catch the first 7.50, and it&#39;s first seven and change. It&#39;s some solid content. Okay, Carter, are you ready for the Democratic nominee quiz? This is, of course, the one-question quiz that we do every four years. Sometimes we do it every eight years because it&#39;s an assumed nominee, but we&#39;ve got some things going on. Well,</span>

And I can&#39;t remember who the first one was, but I remember there was somebody in the Democratic Party who suggested that perhaps he should go.

It looks like this is all being organized. And then, not to jump ahead, but when Harris becomes the presumptive nominee in the sense that Biden points to her and says, she should be the one. Kamala Harris needs to be our candidate. Everyone stops and sort of says, well, where&#39;s Pelosi? And if you look at charts of when people got on board with it, gets to a certain level, plateaus, and then Pelosi says, yeah, good with me. And it basically goes to 100% across the board.</span>

Proving it right now, I want to go through a list of other strategic items. There&#39;s so many things to capture within strategy calls. Corey, let&#39;s start with the Biden letter. He releases it at about 11.45 our time, Mountain Time on a Sunday. It does not include the endorsement of Kamala Harris within the letter. No.</span>

And he got a little bit more of what he wanted. He got to have people talking about him for a bit. Now, I think one of the things we have to acknowledge is the news cycle moves on so fucking fast. I mean, we know this, we talk about this, but you really felt it in the past couple of weeks between the Trump assassination, the RNC, all of the things that ultimately led us to this moment we&#39;re here at. But you could go to the front page of any newspaper website in the country, and you&#39;re going to see Kamala Harris, you&#39;re not going to see Joe Biden, like he&#39;s off the front pages.

            <span class="text">There&#39;s two questions here that I have that I want you to apply your strategic frame to. And I&#39;ll let you guys choose which one you want to go with first, okay? My first question is, is this real or is this a sugar high?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So one&#39;s more analysis and one&#39;s strategic. Which one do you want to start with, Carter? Because it seems like it&#39;s going to be a coronation. None of her rumored competitors are going to run against her. They&#39;ve all endorsed her. So there&#39;s the coronation question. And then there&#39;s the sugar high versus is this real? And then that question is really also a strategic one inherently, because if it is one, how do you make it the other? And if it is, if it is real, how do you keep it real? Carter, where are we starting?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think we&#39;re going to start with the sugar high. Is this a sugar high? Yeah, I think it is a sugar high. But I think that that&#39;s all we get now in politics. You know, I think that, you know, in 2015, Justin Trudeau gave us the, you know, the eight page spread in McLean&#39;s magazine with the family photos, and that&#39;s all we get. I think that, you know, you get these shallow moments. And if you&#39;re able to string enough of those shallow moments together, you get yourself elected now. Donald Trump is the king of the sugar high he just continues to pull out the candy floss and give it to his uh his supporters one event after the other that&#39;s what he does so i think it&#39;s safe to say that that that politics has devolved um to the point where sugar high is what we seek now is it real yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">are real like we you know there&#39;s a there&#39;s something i i guess in science that says the kids you know don&#39;t get a sugar high but i think that parents you know and cory&#39;s cory and you uh will know this better than me now but uh i think parents still complain about their kids when they&#39;ve had too much sugar um so you know this is a sugar high that is real this is actually happening and i think that this is going to be um the defining moment of if she&#39;s able to string these things together we had an assassination attempt last time we were talking talking on the podcast. We&#39;ve all forgotten that already, which is astounding. So she&#39;s going to have to move from this sugar high to the next sugar high to the next sugar high if she&#39;s going to actually be successful in contesting this presidential race, because that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking for. We&#39;ll talk about how</span>

You could feel free to reject it. Is this a sugar high on Kamala Harris on the fact that there&#39;s some joy and possibility that there&#39;s some some optionality that this is not not stuck with Joe Biden, which is what&#39;s caused this? Not to not give her credit, because it&#39;s been an incredible three to four days. Or do</span>

And you have to expect about 20, 30 million of that is from the people who got off their wallets. There was obviously still enthusiasm about it. I&#39;m not taking away anything from the enthusiasm.

            <span class="text">or no so there&#39;s a couple of early polls that suggest maybe there is There is a Harris bump here that I&#39;m sure is causing fits within the Republican campaign. The thing about campaigns is they have an awful lot more polling than we see in the news, even. They&#39;ve got more sophisticated modeling, especially in a U.S. presidential campaign. So they already know what the trend lines are on these particular things. So I get the sense just based on how Donald Trump is tweeting, frankly, that there&#39;s probably something to the overall polls moving right now. But the thing I do want to underline, Zane, is the base matters. And the base was pretty despondent between Joe Biden&#39;s performance and just the general malaise that people had not gotten on board with him. His approval rating was pretty low, continues to be pretty low, his disapproval rating pretty high. They needed this, right? Right.

            <span class="text">point, Carter, as a modern day strategist, what&#39;s the lesson here for you? Because there is, last week, the Democratic Party had a story that was being told about it. And two years ago, Kamala Harris was having a story told about her, that she doesn&#39;t have the X factor, the gumption, the charisma. Now she&#39;s set the single, you know, 24-hour fundraising record, seems to be on the path to becoming the first female president of the United States. What does this tell you about stories as a strategist? Is the Trump view of the world correct that you can easily wash away what happened yesterday or the last second or the last minute, that that is something we need to lean into for better or worse? What is the broader sort of lesson here that you&#39;re learning, both through the lens of the Democratic Party now having new life breathed into it, perhaps even looking like the only political party when you look at what happened at the Republican National Convention, which we haven&#39;t talked about, and or looking at what&#39;s happened with the story of Kamala Harris, which maybe the previous chapter need not apply. There&#39;s a new movement, new person. She&#39;s net new to folks going forward. What do you think? Well,</span>

And I think that that&#39;s ultimately what we&#39;re seeing right now. This is not someone who&#39;s being embraced for being Kamala Harris. This is someone who&#39;s being embraced.

How do you kind of look at this as a political tactician in terms of what this moment, this extremely quick, quickly changing, rapidly developing moment has taught us, even while we live it?</span>

            <span class="text">but there&#39;s more to it than that there&#39;s a couple of things that are always true about political campaigns but especially true about campaigns of this size and scope and it&#39;s that they are vehicles right you are the character of Kamala Harris as much as you are the person Kamala Harris. You have a team. That team constructs you. They&#39;re writing speeches for you. They&#39;re putting ads together for you. They&#39;re prepping you for debates. They&#39;re telling you this works great, this doesn&#39;t. Wear this suit, don&#39;t wear that suit. And that all gets built around you as well. And then also, look, people change. People grow. I&#39;m sure that in 2020, she thought, fuck, I fucking lost to Joe Biden because because I missed these things. I better spend the next couple of years developing these things. Look how good he is with common touch, being able to walk around and feel comfortable with these people. I&#39;m sure she learned a lot from Joe Biden. I&#39;m sure Joe Biden learned a lot from her too. But people evolve based on the people in their orbits. And I&#39;m quite certain she is not the same person that she was in 2020. And she probably has all new deficiencies, but she also has all new strengths.</span>

They&#39;re not going to come in and just do mass firings or mass layoffs. That would send the wrong message. So the message needs to be, we&#39;ve got the strong team, but suddenly the org chart suddenly grows at the top by 5, 10, 15, 20 different jobs. jobs, the group at the bottom, all</span>

Or are you one of the school of thought that, you know, you only have such a limited runway to make make big changes. And if you want your people in right away, because they know Kamala Harris, these people knew Joe Biden, they were running for Joe. Yes, you were on the ticket. But, you know, we know that VPs don&#39;t matter. Like, historical</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s a couple things. First of all, I&#39;m not it&#39;s not clear to me she has another team that could just jump in there. Right. So there is this interesting expediency thing. It&#39;s been observed by a few people. One of the things that I think is a bit of a canary in the coal mine, if we look back on this and say, if this didn&#39;t work, one of the reasons I think it will have failed is because it doesn&#39;t look like she has any political stalwarts that have stuck with her for any length of time, right? Since she began her political career, she tends to rotate through staff, rotate through senior advisors. So she didn&#39;t necessarily have the team that was ready to jump in there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So there&#39;s that expediency thing. You got to have a team to replace the team with if you&#39;re going to replace the team.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But the second one is you don&#39;t want to come in riding this wave of goodwill, wave of donations, wave of, oh my God, you turned around the name of the campaign and all of the campaign creative and all of that in 24 hours. Now, look to your left, look to your right. One out of three of you is not going to be here as I start to retool this thing. That&#39;s just, that&#39;s going to, we talk about riding that wave, that kills the wave. Don&#39;t kill the wave, right? Retool when it makes sense to retool. Don&#39;t retool when you&#39;re in the middle of right</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right in that wave so i think that&#39;s the other thing campaigns do naturally evolve over time look how many fucking campaign managers donald trump had in 2016 yeah i think you can expect people will rotate in and out they&#39;ll be given roles like they were so good so now they&#39;re like executive campaign manager and here&#39;s the new day-to-day campaign manager or yeah we&#39;ve had this conversation before there&#39;s lots of ways to expand your team change your team without firing somebody somebody that&#39;s how we end up with such grand titles on all of these campaigns and i do expect you&#39;ll see some of that as she starts to say i want more of this i want less of this this person really gets me and impressed me this person doesn&#39;t get me at all maybe they were great for joe but they&#39;re not great for me carter</span>

He&#39;s bought into it, timeline-wise, resourcing-wise, including the transfer of the Biden cash to Harris, which is a big component of this, that nearly $100 million that would be difficult otherwise. They&#39;d have to give it away to PACs, which you couldn&#39;t coordinate with if it was a different candidate.</span>

            <span class="text">But it&#39;s a coronation, Corey. And we talk about in politics that coronations aren&#39;t great, even if they&#39;re weak opponents. It&#39;s nice to have an opponent. So you could test yourself out, you can push back that there&#39;s some resistance, you&#39;re running against something. In this case, you can argue she&#39;s running against Donald Trump from day one. So it&#39;s not like you need a process.

Yes, of course, he was the incumbent. Yes, incumbents usually get pretty easy rides, but he was not stress test. And he was going to be the oldest candidate for president, you know, by only beating himself in that record. So I do think that you want to put people through those paces. You want to see how they react in debates. You want to see how they react in or you want to see what people get on them, quote unquote. quote and and how those stories might evolve and it&#39;s kind of robbed of that is</span>

But stress testing implies you&#39;re going to put her in a position where we&#39;re going to see whether she succeeds or fails. And if you&#39;re a candidate thinking smartly and cogently about your campaign, you don&#39;t want to put yourself in positions where you fail, you want to put yourself in positions where you can succeed.

You&#39;ve got the benefits of fits to both, but this is more so a personal sort of strategic philosophy question, strategic upside-downside question. Give me your take. Would you want to inherit a situation like Kamala Harris? You get catapulted in, leapfrogged in, one might say, into the fourth quarter, or would you want a beginning-to-end, you know, I want to do it all, and if I don&#39;t do it all, it&#39;s not as meaningful full to me well</span>

People doubted you. People wrote you off. Your wise mentor stumbles. You step up. You slay the dragon. Like, that&#39;s fucking every Hollywood plot of every adventure movie ever. And you get to live that. And you get to be that and do that if you do things right. And people will remember this for a very long time. I&#39;ll tell you something.

I&#39;m going to do it for you, America, because it&#39;s so important. But I think that the bigger point is, it&#39;s not even a closer. For me, it&#39;s a line change.

I mean, the fresh legs, you get somebody in there, you get to choose the matchup. Joe Biden looked at it. He did the calculations. He decided, A, obviously, it&#39;s easier to go with the vice president. But B, yeah, I think this hunts. And so makes that decision. decision.</span>

Is there strategic value in Kamala Harris leaning into the closer frame, the person who gets it done, the short distance sprinter frame of the campaign with the fresh legs that she has, with the energy, the enthusiasm, the 104 days that you&#39;ve mentioned? Does she just do it? Or does she talk about what she&#39;s doing over the course of the next 104 days?</span>
