Carter, have you gone outside? I know listeners are dying to hear about your outside adventures now that it&#39;s snowing in Calgary.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, we were outside today. We went for a little stroll, but it wasn&#39;t our usual death-defying outside.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was hoping at your age, a hard bowel movement is death defying. So I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I take issue with you, but you&#39;re not that far off.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, our first segment, how the West was won maybe in two weeks. Okay, so we have an election results. We know John Horgan has become premier again of British Columbia becoming the first consecutive two-term premier for the NDP. It seemed like the difference maker for the NDP in this election was A, that they had an election, B, that they flipped old liberal strongholds, including those that the NDP were not competitive in for a very, very long time. But I want to talk about quite a few things here. And first and foremost, Corey, you know, this has been being covered in the media as a gamble. John Horgan&#39;s gamble paid off. He rolled hold the dice with this election, and it paid off. You know, 2020 hindsight being what it is, was this a gamble for John Horgan calling this election?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It might have been a gamble, but it was a smart gamble. And there wasn&#39;t an awful lot of downside risk. It&#39;s like when we look at the US election right now, and if you go to 538, it says Donald Trump has a, I think, 17% chance of winning right now.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that&#39;s if everything breaks Donald way. You know, the reality is, if the polls are right, or even if they&#39;re not incredibly</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">incredibly wrong, Joe Biden will be president. Well, they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they were facing a very similar gamble when they were looking to run this election. There wasn&#39;t a lot of reason to believe that everything was going to break in Wilkinson&#39;s direction. Even if it did, odds were good that Horgan was going to win given the lead he had, and everything did not break in Wilkinson&#39;s direction. So I guess</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">guess the word gambled is overused in politics there&#39;s always chance when you make a decision like this certainly we especially as albertans we have seen people walk into the polls with big leads and just get clobbered i mean there&#39;s a reason why we don&#39;t have premier jim prentice right now and it was because he went to the polls one year ahead of an election with a lead that was somewhat comparable to the one that horgan had these things do happen but they don&#39;t happen that often and the tales we tell ourselves tend to be the outliers the reality is you go into an election with a a lead as big as John Horgan had, you&#39;re probably going to come out of it the other side, still the premier.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, same question to you. Like I said, 2020 hindsight being what it is. Was this a political gamble by Horgan calling this election?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I had hoped that it was. I had hoped that there would be a political price to be paid for calling an election in the middle of a pandemic. But when you look at BC&#39;s pandemic numbers, he did very well through the course of the last four weeks of the election. There was no significant outbreaks. There has been significant changes in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta regarding the pandemic. So I think that he was able to emphasize the pandemic as a strength, whereas it very easily could have gone against him. Maybe it&#39;s because of good management. Maybe it&#39;s because of good luck that the pandemic didn&#39;t become the central issue of this campaign. I had thought that it was a dangerous thing to do because it very easily could have turned into Quebec, where your numbers skyrocket out of control. It could have turned into Ontario,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re suddenly having record numbers. And the same here in Alberta, where we now have record numbers. Now, that may not have been enough to dislodge him. He had a good polling</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">polling record. He had a good reputation. People liked his government, and it was his to lose. I just kind of had hoped that the electorate would hold him accountable for doing something so nakedly</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">nakedly political at a time of great concern for Canadians, where we&#39;re still dealing with significant unemployment. We&#39;re still dealing with people&#39;s lives being upturned. But I guess that was just my hope. In hindsight, it&#39;s painfully clear. The polls did not move. Andrew Wilkinson did not put up a... I mean, Andrew Wilkinson spent three weeks talking about Bozo eruptions, for lack of a better term. You know, so, you know, whatever. I was disappointed, but no, he didn&#39;t pay a price.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">You know, Corey, we&#39;ve talked about this in previous episodes, that Andrew Wilkinson should have been unbelievably formidable, at least from what you see from him on paper, right? The guy&#39;s got a degree in law, a degree in medicine. He&#39;s a Rhodes Scholar, if I&#39;m not mistaken. I think you may want to correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that particular one. And we have a premier who&#39;s called an election in the middle of a pandemic and you have a doctor on the other side. This should have been a perfect sort of recipe for Wilkinson. Give me your take. What do you think went wrong for him on the main here? And why do you think he couldn&#39;t necessarily get the message around what many believed was pure naked opportunism by Horgan and expose that much more?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for starters, naked opportunism is a bit of a process question. And while those are things that drive conversations in downtown Victoria, they drive conversations in capitals everywhere. Voters don&#39;t tend to sit there and discuss these things in such detail. And there is a truism that I think all political strategists need to remember, which is that the things that matter to you are not the things that matter to the electorate. and once it became clear to Wilkinson and the BC Liberals probably within the first week of the campaign that there was just no traction the ground was was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was just going to be slipping underneath them if they continued on this front they should have pivoted a lot harder than they did and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and look I&#39;m not going to pretend that the BC Liberals spent the entire campaign talking about the fact there was a campaign it didn&#39;t get quite there but obviously they needed to do something different than they did and they needed to do a lot harder and a lot faster than they did um but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but but that&#39;s all easy to say the reality is he was always in a bit of a hole and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so when we talk about wilkinson not to repeat content from previous episodes um he&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he&#39;s great on paper he was not such a stellar candidate in person he uh he failed to connect with people on a human level but that&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s also what people tell themselves when somebody is losing like you know defeat becomes this reinforcing forcing narrative. And he never managed to change the story.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Certainly never in a way that would help his party. There was no movement in this election. It was one</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one part, everybody distracted with the US election, which is obviously, you know, all fairness</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fairness to our friends in BC, a much bigger deal right now than the BC election. And it was one part, there was no additional story to tell. It just it wasn&#39;t. And then finally, one part, people didn&#39;t care about the story that that Wilkinson was sending.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, same question to you. I know you&#39;ve had a chance to kick at this a bit in previous episodes, but give me the dissection. What was the reason that Wilkinson couldn&#39;t close the gap here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think, number one, he didn&#39;t go into this with a clear message of who he was and where he was going. Number two, he didn&#39;t ever</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">ever articulate to the people of British Columbia who he was. you know he he wanted to talk about how he&#39;s a doctor i mean he was still introducing his bio three years after he was elected leader that to me is is a significant problem if they don&#39;t already all know that he&#39;s a doctor i mean it starts to sound you know it&#39;s like dave rodney introducing himself and reminding everybody that he meets i climbed everest two times you know like if you&#39;re introducing yourself with a central part of your bio every time um that&#39;s not a great way way to win over people and supporters so for me this is the the uh the primary challenge that that wilkinson had he didn&#39;t get a narrative and then every time he started that maybe try and establish a narrative his own team took him off track um you know with with the two primary bozo eruptions and then when with the with the uh</span>

And what is maybe a lesson about candidates like Wilkinson that perhaps parties need to be aware of, maybe even liberals specifically going forward, need to be aware of going into their eventual leadership race? Is there a lesson to be learned around candidates that look unbelievable on paper like Wilkinson, but that just couldn&#39;t deliver? So maybe if you had some comments, jump in with that and maybe try to answer my question there as well. People</span>

How would you reconcile then perhaps the election of folks like an Obama or a Bill Clinton who, for all intents and purposes, were the smartest person wherever they went at every corner? Was it just that they had another tool, oratory or empathy in either of their cases, respectively, that perhaps kind of rounded them out and made them seem more normal?

He&#39;s surrounded by Alberta&#39;s political leadership, you know, from the premier to the mayors and all of that.

We constructed the story because we went back to him being essentially, we called him essentially the child of all Calgarians. All Calgarians had helped him get to that place where he went to Harvard, right? He went to public school. He rode on public transit. He studied in our public libraries. He was the best of what we could give him, and he was a reflection of what we gave him. And I want to address one more other thing, one more thing that Corey brought up, and that&#39;s Donald Trump. Keep in mind that people were identifying with Donald Trump because Donald Trump speaks like I do. He talks the way I do. Right. And that that was part of this everyman quality is that he was saying things and getting away with saying things that people wish that they could get away with. so there wasn&#39;t every man quality to him because he&#39;s a fucking moron like well</span>

It&#39;s fairly evident that the B.C. liberals aren&#39;t working anymore. You know, this composite, you know, this is not a real party. This isn&#39;t a traditional liberal party. It&#39;s not a conservative party. It is a liberal conservative so-called consortium that has been compiled over time that has people who were attracted to being elected, not necessarily people. And so this happened in Alberta when we lost the PC party. When it collapsed, it was because ultimately if you&#39;re out of power for, you know, or if you, well, we weren&#39;t out of power very long. But if you have no common values except being in power, you don&#39;t stick around together very long. So getting a party builder is going to be super important. And getting someone who can grassroots build 87 constituency associations, find 87 candidates that appeal to their local communities, start to do the outreach that needs to be done as part of a community building exercise.

And you know what? This one and done philosophy, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s serving us very well in politics. I&#39;m not saying that Andrew Wilkinson should be kept, but I think that parties should be a little bit more charitable because this idea that the next winner is just around the corner hasn&#39;t really proven uh hasn&#39;t</span>

Like, we got this buzzy energy, we need to start doing shit right away. So like, what do you need to be strategic about hold off on what you need to do immediately?

Campaign strategy lessons, maybe like tactical lessons. If there was anything you saw during this race that invigorated you, and maybe the The fact that there wasn&#39;t is a lesson in its own right. And then secondly, maybe strategic lessons if I&#39;m a Justin Trudeau watching the results here. Now, we talked about opportunism. We talked about, you know, electorate maybe not paying the price for calling a pandemic election. But is there anything you wanted to add to either of those two buckets on either campaign tactics and strategy and then more so like political strategy about elections more broadly? I</span>

If polls stay the way they are, Trudeau is just going to continue to push Singh around until Singh feels he has no choice but to vote against non-confidence. And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we see something like 2011, I guess, where at a certain point, Trudeau just says, because</span>

It was an anti-corruption committee</span>

            <span class="text">committee that they wanted to effectively kickstart. The liberals, this seems like weeks ago, but it&#39;s just last week, the liberals declared the vote on that conservative motion a matter of confidence. which then put Jagmeet Singh in this box. So I want to talk about strategy. And let&#39;s go through all of the key players that we saw here. And Corey, you&#39;ve alluded to some political outcomes already in your previous answer. So let&#39;s hold off on that for a second. First, Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you. What did you make of the federal liberal strategy, the government strategy, Trudeau&#39;s strategy, to make this committee, the kickstarting of this committee, a confidence motion? What did you make of that strategy? Good strategy, bad strategy? And either way, why? I guess</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">guess it worked. So it must be a good strategy. The Trudeau strategy appears to be this is over now. And it seems to be in line with what generally Canadians seem to think this is over now. There was a time when maybe this was a big issue. You know, we&#39;d watch the polling trends and the polling trend would have little peaks for the conservatives and things would start to get close. But now I don&#39;t think anybody cares. I don&#39;t think that anybody is looking at this thinking this is still the thing that Andrew Scheer told us it was. And Pierre Polyev hasn&#39;t become any more effective at selling it to us. So the liberals</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">liberals say, how can we dispense of this? I know, let&#39;s amp it up. Let&#39;s increase the consequence of voting yes by making it a confidence motion. And we&#39;ll force, I mean, as Corey alluded to, just bully Singh into supporting the government and problem solves itself. And they were right. Problem solved itself. It didn&#39;t have any negative consequences. I mean, maybe we&#39;ll see two weeks from now that there&#39;s a shifting in the polls. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. It was really good strategy. It was one of the stronger pieces of crisis management that we&#39;ve seen from the liberals. but it also shows that the strength of their crisis management comes about two and a half months after the crisis. So that&#39;s not great crisis management, but they&#39;re getting out of it now. And if they can use this or something similarly benign to launch an election campaign, I&#39;m sure that they&#39;d be delighted.</span>

            <span class="text">seemed more than willing to go to an election. In fact, a lot of the commentary that was coming out of Ottawa in the night that we all thought maybe an election could happen was that it didn&#39;t seem to be a lot of good faith bargaining by Justin Trudeau. It was like, no, we&#39;re not going to do that. No, we&#39;re not going to move on this matter. And Singh decided to back down. He blinked. He veered. He swerved into that ditch. And Justin Trudeau drives on. gone the the thing is though i continue to believe that the liberals if the liberals were willing to fight an election on this they are willing to fight an election on most anything they are going to govern like a majority for sure for the next few months unless these polls change in in any kind of material sense and um they&#39;re not going to take shit from anybody they&#39;re just going to run through anything in their platform they think is mildly contentious and effectively dare people to vote against them especially if they think that the thing they&#39;re moving through is something That could have resonance with the public. Because again, let me say, if you were willing to fight an election on the opposition parties running an anti-corruption committee on you because of a legitimate scandal that you did, you</span>

And on top of that, they&#39;ve got really good polling. and as much as Corey and I both think that O&#39;Toole has done a pretty decent job as leader of the opposition since he&#39;s been elected, our view seems to be in the minority in terms of Canadians. They&#39;re still auditioning him for the role of opposition leader. They&#39;re not prepared to cast him yet. So at some point they may, but it seems to me that that might take longer longer um than cory&#39;s six-month window i mean as we&#39;re talking about it i&#39;m trying to envision um</span>

So building on Stephen&#39;s point about what you want the party to be, there&#39;s a lot of things the party could be, and there&#39;s a lot of things that the NDP could extract from the Liberals, but they should be trying to extract them now, and effectively almost daring the Liberals the other way. Are you going to burn this coalition of working-class Canadians, of green voters? Here&#39;s the thing we&#39;re putting on the table. This is part of the confidence motion that we are bringing to you, rather than just fighting on the liberals&#39; turf and losing, losing, losing.

What do you think of their strategy in this entire saga this past week of introducing the motion? Do they do they take a victory lap or any credit for, you know, trying to point to how scared the liberals are on it? And then what do you kind of make of O&#39;Toole&#39;s messaging on not wanting election? I want to get your assessment on what sort of, you know, marks you&#39;re giving O&#39;Toole this week.

I want to put that to the people. Then at least it comes from a position of strength. Um, this isn&#39;t the time or, you know, these weak, these weak positions always anger me. I don&#39;t like weak positions. I rather, you know, I don&#39;t know if people have noticed, but I&#39;d rather take a strong position and be wrong than take a weak position and be right.

But there are things I want more than stable government. I want ethical government. I I want government that&#39;s going to be there for Canadians, that&#39;s going to work for Canadians through this pandemic. That&#39;s fine to me. I don&#39;t actually see this as a big contradiction. And, in fact, the Conservatives voted on</span>

Whether they truly want an election or not, or we&#39;re just waiting for the NDP to come and capitulate, it&#39;s an interesting question. I&#39;m not sure I know the answer to that entirely. But I&#39;m sure they&#39;re much more prepared to go to the polls than the NDP are, and they should be. Because frankly, otherwise, this is going to be a pretty grim minority parliament and the conservatives are going to lose a lot of face. I&#39;ve seen that play out the other way, where Stephen Harper had the minority government and the liberals just didn&#39;t feel like they could do anything except capitulate. It&#39;s tough.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to our next segment. Our next segment, not enough fish in the sea. Guys, I want to talk about the issue that is currently active in Nova Scotia with the Mi&#39;kmaq indigenous people and the commercial fishermen out there. So to summarize this story, on one side, we have commercial fishermen who say that the indigenous Mi&#39;kmaq are threatening their livelihoods by trapping lobster outside of the federally regulated lobster season. And on the other side, we&#39;ve got the Mi&#39;kmaq lobstermen who say they&#39;re being attacked with impunity for exercising their legal right to hunt and fish through rights negotiated in a centuries-old treaty and backed up by a decades-old court decision. It&#39;s currently, you know, started as an escalating fight that&#39;s now seen certain elements of fighting, certain elements of physical violence. We&#39;ve seen police escalation in the sense of more officers there to try to control what has become a very tense situation out in Nova Scotia. And then on the political side, we&#39;ve seen an emergency debate in parliament. Carter, going to you from a high level, how big of a deal is this for the liberals? I</span>

            <span class="text">you know, politicians should have the right to input and tell people how to do these things. They do a little bit. But realistically, we don&#39;t want our ministers telling our police services who to arrest and what for? Generally, government</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">tries to avoid that. So on those two fronts, I think those are both bad issues for Justin Trudeau. I think both of those issues make him look, the policing issue makes him look weak. The Indigenous rights issue, my goodness, is Indigenous rights ever a good topic to be talking about if you&#39;re a federal politician? It&#39;s an issue that is pervasive. It has no easy solution. And when it flares up, it takes a long time for us to walk away from it and figure it out. So I think that both of these issues, both sides of this issue, if you will, are problematic for Trudeau. And I don&#39;t see an easy solution. I don&#39;t think that we can just simply say to people, well, you know, this is the indigenous right. This is the indigenous right to do this and say to the fishermen, you know, good luck. But that&#39;s the answer. I mean, this is an indigenous right. But what now do we then do for the commercial fishermen? Because when people are facing economic strife, they get scared and they get violent and they get angry and they shouldn&#39;t necessarily do those things. But I don&#39;t know how else they&#39;re going to react given the situations that they&#39;re facing.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, same question to you. And maybe I&#39;ll add another one there as well for you to consider. How big of a deal is this for the liberals, the initial question? And secondly, perhaps a little naively, how much of this is a product of the liberals being the party on the center of the political spectrum? They kind of get squeezed from both ends in a situation like this. They can&#39;t lean too much left. They can&#39;t lean too much right. They&#39;re trying to maintain this central position. I mean, they haven&#39;t on many policies. But I just wanted to throw both of those things to you for consideration?</span>

And when the RCMP sits there with bullsidism, I think it&#39;s just, it&#39;s abhorrent. And it is, you know, essentially the federal police service there. And we should expect better.

When it matters most, Justin Trudeau just can&#39;t make a decision. Now, they haven&#39;t said which way, right? But they&#39;ve actually kind of pinned him to this, that this is a guy who delays, you know, says things, but just can&#39;t act. And I wanted to get two things from you. Number Number one, a response to what you heard from Corey, but number two, the effectiveness of that line of Trudeau&#39;s inaction or Trudeau&#39;s lack of action on big ticket items, on value items like this that require more than just symbolism, so to speak.

And one more RCMP staff sergeant or whatever the titles are, who stands out and says, you know, essentially there are good people on both sides, as they did here in Alberta, that&#39;s the ballgame. You&#39;re done. We&#39;re getting a new RCMP commissioner who can come in here and fix this force up. Maybe that&#39;s the decision. But there is no decision.

Now, that sort of burned Husky for any future acquisitions, which is part of why Husky is now the one who&#39;s going as the acquired to the altar. But the problem with that is that that oil company, now very large, Synovus plus Husky, is not going to want you to say it&#39;s bad. And so if you are Jason Kenney, you&#39;re kind of between a rock and a hard place here. You&#39;re not going to want to say anything at all. You&#39;re not going to want to say it&#39;s good because it results in job losses.
