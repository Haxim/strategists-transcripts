        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Alberta's budget and the impending federal speech from the throne. How should the UCP manage Alberta's biggest ever deficit? Should the Alberta NDP be making the province's finances an issue? And now that we have Zain's birthday, can somebody give us the elementary school he went to and mother's maiden name? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

          <div class="said">Anyways, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Wreck It Like Ralph. Guys, I want to talk about our finances here in Alberta and the choices that Jason Kenney has in front of him. So</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="turn" data-start="173">

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">So we had a fiscal update this week talking about our province deficit well above the $20 billion that Corey mentioned, I feel like a few episodes ago when you said something crazy like 20 billion. Well, it was pegged at 24.2. And of course, we&#39;re expecting $100 billion debt come first quarter of 2021. So numbers that are significantly higher than we thought, than we expected. What I want to do in this segment is kind of tease out strategies. I want to talk about what the Kenney government should do, what the NDP should do, what third party groups may want to look at as they expect to see this budget. But let&#39;s start with the UCP. So they&#39;ve come out with perhaps the first honest fiscal update we&#39;ve seen in a long time. Perhaps COVID has provided them that opportunity. But Corey, let&#39;s start there, because I see you already waving your hand against my assertion that previous fiscal updates haven&#39;t been honest. Let&#39;s start with your take on that, and then we&#39;ll go from there. Yeah,</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, I don&#39;t for a minute think that that&#39;s accurate. Picking where the finances are going to be quarter to quarter in Alberta is a mugs game. It&#39;s difficult. The finance department has to peg a ton of different variables, and not all of them can possibly be known to the government at any given time. So on the whole, I think they do better than people give them credit for. Yes, things can bounce around by a billion dollars, two billion. And yes, that is an incredible amount of money. But when you&#39;re talking about a $10 billion deficit, that is 10%, 20% over the course of a year where oil prices may fluctuate by</div>

          <div class="said">you know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say that fiscal updates are not honest in the past. They are always dealing with a certain amount of information</div>

          <div class="said">information deficit. And you get this thing that happens between budgets in particular where the price of oil may have gone down a fair bit, but you&#39;re not going to revise your estimate for oil for the year in all likelihood because it&#39;s just as likely to swing back up in the next bit.

Carter, give me your take on this, because you guys have both been involved in putting together these and communicating these fiscal updates, these budgets.

          <div class="said">and so governments in that time and i was part of that government during that time um have had to try and and uh make that shit smell good and there&#39;s all kinds of spin that we can do um some of which cory just did uh where you you talk about how it&#39;s hard to predict all the various moving variables and things like that i&#39;ll tell you something a lot of the other provinces don&#39;t have quite as hard time predicting where they&#39;re going to be because they haven&#39;t put as much emphasis on relying on natural resource revenue. And ultimately, when you&#39;re talking about, and Corey&#39;s speech notwithstanding about all the variables and all the different pieces, that is absolutely true, except a lot of the variables don&#39;t move nearly as much as resource revenue. And resource revenue has been, it was decided in the Klein era to rely on the resource revenue as a replacement for taxation, for a replacement of certain revenue sources. And now we see, and I used to tell people that natural gas revenue was lower than gaming revenue in Alberta. Now it&#39;s all resource revenue added together is lower than gaming revenue. Just to kind of put things in perspective of how much money has disappeared. And at one point we were looking at almost 60% of total government revenue was coming from natural resource revenue. And now we&#39;re looking at just under 5%. So we&#39;ve had a tremendous swing. That&#39;s not one variable set. That&#39;s willful blindness. And everybody&#39;s going to focus on the $20 plus billion. Last fiscal year, 2019-2020, our deficit was $12.2 billion. This isn&#39;t just a pandemic problem. This is a philosophical problem that goes to the heart of how someone chooses to budget. This is the equivalent of your household. and Corey&#39;s going to get mad at me for using household as an example. This</div>

On the flip side, imagine if we did budgets for five years, like it&#39;s just this is a five-year period budget instead of one. You would see a lot less of that volatility. So historically, Alberta has seen this kind of spike and trough, and our spending has has reacted to it. And I think that&#39;s been a lot of the problem that we&#39;ve seen in Alberta in the past, where we cut in reaction to revenue that may come back, and we&#39;re always sort of chasing the last trend. That&#39;s not been the case so much in the last 10 years, because there just hasn&#39;t been resource revenue, at least in the last five of those 10 years. And it&#39;s been a very painful adjustment to the province. And how we&#39;ve largely done it is instead of raising taxes, we&#39;ve just run big deficits. So to</div>

Because the budget is so large, it is so big, and as long as you actually have the ability to cash flow it so you don&#39;t have the difficulty on the bond market, spend it now. Because it allows you to build that downward trajectory on the deficit that you&#39;re going to want to be able to show in future years.

But you want to make sure that the year after that, the year going into an election, looks like it&#39;s some serious momentum relative to the budget prior to that. So I would be asking about whether we have thought about this from an accounting standpoint. Is there anything that we can just book now? And there are ways that governments can do that, and governments do that all the time, moving things between fiscal years. So that would be sort of step one because, listen, if</div>

But maybe if Jason Kenney wasn&#39;t Jason Kenney, then you could do But Jason Kenney had a central premise to his election campaign, and that was that the province was in financial problems and only he could solve it. And when he came in, that was the plan. That&#39;s what he said. and and i think that the province of alberta is prepared to uh cut him some slack as each province is prepared to cut slack uh for their premier uh but you know there&#39;s jason kenney&#39;s the second lowest premier um right now in terms of approval rating uh he&#39;s not doing well people in alberta are like i&#39;m not sure about this guy because he promised me one thing and and really i don&#39;t think they care about the deficit i don&#39;t think they care about the debt the deficit any of of those things. I think what they care about is their own financial prosperity. And if you&#39;re going to dig your way out of this, then you have to focus on getting us back to where we were. Now, the challenge is, how do you do that in an environment where the resource market hasn&#39;t been playing ball for 13 years? If the resource market had been playing ball as recently as 18 months ago, then we could do what we always did, which is just hope for a rebound. But it hasn&#39;t been been playing ball. It hasn&#39;t given us that economic opportunity that we have come to expect in the province of Alberta.</div>

I believe if you went around Alberta and asked Albertans, they would say Jason Kenney doesn&#39;t want that. So clearly it misaligns the public&#39;s expectations with the potential action. And that&#39;s always challenging because it&#39;s not just that you surprise them. It&#39;s not just, oh, wow, that&#39;s interesting. It&#39;s a sense of betrayal. trail.

I think that he wanted to do what he said he wanted to do, which is to bring back the good old days under Klein and Stelmach when we had the royalty revenues that give us the Alberta advantage, which was our low-tax environment.

And it is just a fool&#39;s, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s a foolish thing to do. The Alberta NDP attacking the deficit, I can understand why on its surface that makes sense to them. It&#39;s, hey, the UCP thought they were going to be so great at it. And look, they&#39;re not. You know, they said they were going to be fiscally responsible. And look, they&#39;re not. But there&#39;s two things about that. One is that I agree with what Stephen said earlier, they didn&#39;t actually run on fiscal responsibility, they ran on jobs economy pipelines, it was more about your personal financial situation would get better. And the province was almost illustrative of the personal woes that people had out there. And then the other thing is, it absolutely does not follow that if you sit there and say the UCP is precluding, I can&#39;t vote for them because they&#39;re not fiscally responsible. Oh, the NDP are going to be the fiscally responsible ones. And it is so confusing to throw this message in right now. This is literally the day before my daughter goes back to school at a time when the NDP is calling for more money for education, which, by the way, is a way better ballot question for the NDP.

What would your strategy be? You see the fiscal update, you see that there&#39;s potentially revenue solution. Is it to say, hey, listen, they actually might be in spending mode right now so as to inflate this number and then show a success on it? Are you staying away? What are you advising? I&#39;m kind of curious. And I know it&#39;s going to be very much subject area specific, but what&#39;s the general sort of counsel that if you&#39;re a third party looking to access government right now, what would that be?</div>

Now, if the government was wise, or at least clever, And I think that they are clever, even if I don&#39;t, you know, I think that they probably put a bit of padding in there and said, okay, we do not want to revise this up later. So let&#39;s make this bigger. And as it comes down, you may find that some fiscal cushion reopens and you want to keep your eye on that. And you want to make sure you&#39;re still putting your asks in and talking about how they would help this current moment. Certainly anything you can do that talks about economic upswing is going to be considered a good idea. I do believe anything around diversification will probably be seen as a good idea.

If we had Canada&#39;s Green New Deal, I&#39;d be focusing on making sure that this worked in Quebec, British Columbia, and Atlantic Canada, and figuring out how I&#39;m going to reconstruct my base voter model. I would suggest that the thing that would probably do the best is that type of a Green New Deal, Canada&#39;s Green New Deal. That strikes me that it undermines the NDP dramatically, and it doesn&#39;t lose you very much with the Conservatives.

This is a minority parliament. You have talked as a federal ND&#39;s child care. You&#39;ve talked about wealth taxation. You&#39;ve talked about housing. What are you kind of trying to pin the government against as the proverbial sort of balance of power? And how are you trying to structure it from that political standpoint?</div>

But as I said, I think if I&#39;m the government coming in, and the polls remain where the polls, there&#39;s been one poll, I think that showed a significant tightening, but most of the others have not. If the liberals look like they&#39;re well into the lead, the NDP doesn&#39;t actually have that much latitude. Because, you know, if they withhold their votes, they just go to the polls. polls so on that note you&#39;ve got to pick something that would actually be very politically awkward for the liberals not to support uh so</div>

And in terms of the NDP, I mean, I haven&#39;t seen any indication that there is a federal NDP other than Jagmeet Singh in a TikTok dancing over the last couple of weeks. I mean, if you were to pull him up in your Google search, he hasn&#39;t done anything. There&#39;s nothing that has happened. I don&#39;t believe that the NDP has any leverage at all when it comes to this new session and the new throne speech. I think that they&#39;re passengers. Everybody knows they can&#39;t afford an election. So they&#39;re going to have to vote to support this government, government, whether it includes universal child care, universal basic income, or a Green New Deal. Whatever&#39;s in there, the NDP is going to say, that was our idea. We like it too. That&#39;s the strategy.</div>

That&#39;s not a surprise. No one&#39;s taken aback by that. Peter McKay said that. You know, the fact that it&#39;s O&#39;Toole, this is not something that the NDP was prepared for because the NDP leader chose not to prepare for it. So that&#39;s the problem, we&#39;re saying.

It&#39;s the budget after that you want to show market improvement. So you don&#39;t want to bring in these tax changes for next fiscal year. You want them for the following fiscal year, the year going into an election where you can show, yes, there&#39;s this improvement. Because honestly, even though I think you want to do these things early in your mandate and get to solution before you get back to the polls, right now you are talking about the difference between March and October. And that&#39;s not a big enough difference to not get that net head upside from the path, like the trajectory that you&#39;d get on.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, okay, we&#39;re going to go to our listener question. I&#39;m going to stick with you. This is a listener question from Jared. Five-star review, obligatory bribe for Zane. Thank you so much. Here is the question. What does the path for electoral victory look like for the federal and provincial NDP, respectively? They also said, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re back. It was exhausting deciding my own political opinion. So thank you, Jared, for the question. We make excellent cocktail chatter that you can plagiarize. Corey, I&#39;m sticking with you. Let&#39;s break it down in two forms. The pathway for the provincial and then let&#39;s go with the federal.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, provincially, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very complicated. And this is where I would sort of remind the provincial NDP, you won once, you won in 2015. There was a choice between different options and people went with the NDP. And that&#39;s because a number of the NDP&#39;s policies are pretty popular, right? A royalty review was very popular. They didn&#39;t fundamentally increase royalties. The notion that you would raise taxes on high income earners is pretty popular when you don&#39;t kind of pad it in a bunch of stuff like raising taxes on job creators or stuff. So be the NDP, follow your best instincts, look at the polling, see which of your planks are popular talk about those understand how a vote decision is made in alberta get those hope you get a lucky break on the right being split so by all means poke them a bit but don&#39;t don&#39;t get yourself thrown into the bear pit and um uh</div>

          <div class="said">uh you do you you didn&#39;t lose by that much last time and you&#39;ve got everything going your way right now it is absolutely possible for the provincial ndp to win the next election but they they&#39;re not going to win it by being ucp light or some sort of weird weird flavor of liberal or something like that. Just you were elected once. Look at why you were elected that first time. Stop trying to be that moderate government that you were and find your fire again and find it on those social issues that Albertans actually care a great deal about.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, I mean, I think that Corey&#39;s right. I mean, they did win before. I mean, the problem was that that the vote where they won before wasn&#39;t necessarily a vote for the NDP so much as a vote against the progressive conservatives. But the good news is that there&#39;s a vote against Jason Kenney that&#39;s developing. But you have to be, I believe, you need to be the party of the Alberta family. And that&#39;s going to rest on, that is a three-legged stool.</div>

And if I were advising the NDP, I&#39;d tell them to stick to those three particular legs and nothing comes out of their mouths for the next three years that isn&#39;t framed in those three-legged stools. The Alberta family has to be their core.</div>
