            <span class="text">You&#39;re watching this motherfucker. That&#39;s right. That&#39;s right. I want to talk about Donald Trump. It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve talked about Donald Trump. And by a while, I mean since last week. Guys, let&#39;s zoom out a bit this week, because I want to talk about his overall strategy and a pulse check on how it&#39;s working. So this week, he talks about how he himself is taking hydroxychloroquine, memeing out posts about Mitt Romney, sucking up all the oxygen at those press conferences.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Basic question, Corey, is this this still working is this still the right political strategy for donald trump i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i guess i mean the guy is his</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">his lowest approval rating has been 37 and his highest 45 in the past what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what almost three years at this point so what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what are you gonna say i mean obviously it&#39;s still working and and even as americans are dying by the tens of thousands he gets right now on 538 i&#39;m looking Looking at it, his approval rating is 43.7%, which in some sense, like, hey, that&#39;s less than 50%. Four in ten, more than four in ten Americans give this guy a pass? That is nuts. So, I mean, obviously it&#39;s still working. He&#39;s just keeping everybody spinning.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe that should disappoint us. It certainly disappoints me. But it really, I think, just speaks to the guy could do anything. Nobody cares. Everybody&#39;s in their corner. They&#39;re all fighting their fight. They&#39;re ignoring each other. And they&#39;re speaking to their bases. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">So the same health check as before. Carter, for you, what do you think? Is this is this still the right thing to do? And, you know, listen, we&#39;re not too far away from an election now. So this 43 percent in a mobilized base is one thing. But can he continue on this path?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, he won. And he won using this strategy of being the reality show candidate. Now he&#39;s the reality show president. And he is speaking only to his base. And he is polarizing the other side and making Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden turn into these people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">people who only speak to their side. so the reason he&#39;s got 43.7 is that the group of people who are saying who are that 43.7 are saying i&#39;m not even going to pay attention to the other side i&#39;m not even going to listen to what they have to say because they just hate donald trump and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and so if you don&#39;t have truth anymore and you just have tribalism then it&#39;s very easy to for him to hold on to the very small group of people that still like him cory</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">cory do you agree with it do you feel like that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i you know i always wonder what donald trump i always have since we first started talking about him in the primaries as a serious candidate serious used in a very different sense than i normally use it how much of this is intentional and how much is just like he&#39;s he&#39;s like a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know it&#39;s instinct he&#39;s he&#39;s an animal trapped in a corner and he lashes out he does crazy things and then we say oh how very clever of that fox to bite that person&#39;s finger you know but the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the thing that I think that both sides really need to think about, at least the reasonable sides of both sides need to think about is how much fodder they are giving to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">to the other, like from a base point of view. So you mentioned Pelosi there. Pelosi calls him morbidly obese the other day.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Probably not wise. That&#39;s going to run in right wing Twitter. I mean, he&#39;s not I mean, he&#39;s a fat guy. He&#39;s not morbidly obese, at least not as it&#39;s defined in any kind of clinical sense. and there&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s just so much exaggeration and so much naughtiness and there&#39;s so much bad behavior that it becomes very easy to find excuses to tune the other side out and um as long as that&#39;s going on yeah they&#39;re just gonna say this is my brand this is this is my team i&#39;m</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">further than that too because it means that we&#39;re not talking about the right things he fired his fourth inspector general on friday another late night purge on friday night getting rid of people who are investigating him or his team he fired his fourth one this is four that&#39;s a lot and he&#39;s and he fired him and what we&#39;re talking about today he&#39;s morbidly obese and he&#39;s taking some drug i mean zane the fact that you were able to say the name of that drug i gotta tell you that&#39;s pro you&#39;re very pro i take</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re talking about those things because that&#39;s the trump playbook oh i did something shitty i&#39;ll do something even more shitty but it&#39;s only going to last three days and no one&#39;s going to be able to remember because our collective memory is about 14 seconds with this guy who continues to set off nuclear bombs boom another new thing boom another new thing that&#39;s his whole modus operandi i&#39;m</span>

            <span class="text">i&#39;m hearing from both of you it&#39;s still working And before I get into Pelosi and Biden, which I want to do in a second, let&#39;s talk very quickly about the media. Corey, if you&#39;re providing comms advice, strategic advice to a media outlet in the States right now, and of course, you cannot provide the journalistic sort of like what you need to do, but how would you tell them to cover this thing? How would you tell them to put the right stuff on air, online? What would that look like? Oh,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so basic and cliche about this, is that they are listening to people like me. They are thinking about it from a comms point of view, what sells, right? It&#39;s not really about holding</span>

When you&#39;re doing proper crisis communications, when something has changed, you communicate it. You don&#39;t just blindly stick to the communication cycle.
