So last week, we left the episode off with some predictions. We did a very long 40 minute deep dive on the front end of last week&#39;s episode, talking about why Jason Kenny had not appeared in front of a mic for, how long was it at that point, nine or 10 days? Well, he certainly appeared this week. Perhaps we had an overexposure of Jason Keddie in all the wrong ways in Alberta this week because he showed up on Monday, he made an announcement, and here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do. I&#39;m going to go through the week chronologically, try to capture as much as we can. Invariably, I will miss something, but I&#39;m going to try to go Monday to Sunday, i.e. today, and try to tackle each of the things that we saw in our province and get your guys&#39; analysis and strategic take.

I was prepared for the government to essentially wrap nothing in a bow and tell us here&#39;s your present. It&#39;s an imaginary Christmas this year, and we&#39;d all move on with our lives.

And some of the steps forward may have been backwards. We don&#39;t really know, and we won&#39;t know until afterwards. So I&#39;m really mixed, for example, on closing junior highs and high schools. We talked about how important it was to ensure that children have access to learning. You know, this idea that everything&#39;s just going to go to online learning, interesting, but it&#39;s probably not going to work for everybody. On top of that, there&#39;s a lot of costs involved with having schools closed. And this idea that half of them will close concerns me. I&#39;m also concerned about the contrary measures, right? We only need masks in certain places. OK, OK, let&#39;s Calgary and Edmonton. And to expand it, it was the Calgary and Edmonton health regions. Corey, just out of curiosity, how familiar are you with the Calgary and Edmonton health region? I&#39;m assuming you could probably draw me a fairly effective map.</div>

But then we have areas in the province that actually have the highest per capita outbreaks of COVID that aren&#39;t impacted by the masks, right? So Ponoka is not impacted by the masks. You&#39;re not having to wear a mask there. That&#39;s insane. insane why not just make it a province-wide mask mandate no one&#39;s suffering when they put a mask on no one&#39;s being put onto a ventilator when they have to put a mask on and then everything is contradicted by the idea that you know the the enforcement isn&#39;t there right so you know 600 people gather in downtown calgary on on sunday or</div>

The question that Carter has sort of floated out there is how in the world does this make its way into a government document? Well, there&#39;s a couple of things you need to keep in mind. One is that the fiscal update document has a couple of different sections normally, right? It&#39;s the fiscal update and the economic update. And then there are a number of charts that go along with all of that. But both of those documents, one of which is really about a narrative, they&#39;re</div>

They&#39;re going to war. They&#39;re coming after public sector. And just keep in mind, like when you pay a nurse, the nurse doesn&#39;t just take the money and disappear, right? Like it&#39;s not some sort of offshore, you know, holding company. That&#39;s for the people that the UCP likes. The people that, you know, the nurse takes the money and puts it back into the economy. So it&#39;s actually 44% of the government is or of our economy comes from from from the public sector, 44%. So you start cutting down the public sector, what you&#39;re doing is taking money out of everybody&#39;s pockets. And so I&#39;m frustrated that he&#39;s decided to go to war.

I want to talk about what you saw from the premier there. This was the second time we&#39;d seen him since that 10-day absence. And I have to be honest, he looked quite tired. Many people online were comparing him to a meme of Mayor Quimby from The Simpsons. You know, he had the unbuttoned top button on his shirt. He looked very, very tired and almost beaten down. So I want to get your take on maybe let&#39;s start with the Facebook Live and then let&#39;s move on to the poll to see if there&#39;s any meat on the bone on that. And Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on the Facebook Live and what you made of Premier Kenny, both doing that as a tactic, but also kind of what you saw with the staging.</div>

And the idea that you would make this statement, though, and expect – I mean, the entire internet called bullshit at the moment. Right, right. Like, let&#39;s find this person. And then, of course, this person was found. And it&#39;s not quite as advertised. It was a little bit different.

Like, I think it&#39;s just a very strange thing to say, because if you didn&#39;t know that, and if you just sort of assumed it and layered it on, it&#39;s a bit awkward. But honestly, every politician is guilty of this to some degree, right? The anecdotes. Bill Clinton was notorious for this.

Bright and early in the morning, CBC&#39;s two investigative reporters outside of Edmondson, Charles Rustnell and Jenny Russell, came out with a story that said secret recordings taken earlier in the summer revealed that political directives and tensions over Alberta&#39;s pandemic response, ultimately concluding from a series of about 20 or so recordings leaked to CBC, that there was what they called political interference. from the bureaucratic suggestions made to Jason Kenney and his government. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you, because I know Corey&#39;s got a take that&#39;s already widely out there. What did you make of, let&#39;s start with the story, and then let&#39;s start with the political damage. I want to hit on two fronts here. We&#39;ll do a bit of a deep dive than we have on the other stories, so I&#39;ll let you guys know that ahead of time. But what did you make of the story? What do you kind of think are the political consequences of the story? Those are the two things I want to talk about right now.</div>

This has never been a situation where they walk into the room and they say, we must do this. What they do is they bring you a range of options. And those options have outcomes and consequences. And you know why they do that? Because these are tough questions. These aren&#39;t questions that have a singular answer as though it is like a multiple choice question on a bubble test.

And on top of that, they&#39;re getting information from one source, which is the Chief chief medical officer of health. There is going to be another set of advisors in another room who are going to be giving them a different set of advice based on the economy, based on how oil and gas sector needs to operate, how we can&#39;t afford to shut down, you know, the in-situ plants. We can&#39;t afford to shut down the malls. We can&#39;t afford to shut down the education system. That&#39;s going to come partly from Hinshaw. It&#39;s going to come partly from other experts. it&#39;s the politician&#39;s job the politician&#39;s job and i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s rachel notley or if it&#39;s jason kenney every time they whatever the decision is their job is to hear the various options and then to choose and it&#39;s their choice it&#39;s not dr hinshaw&#39;s we can argue about whether his chief medical officer of health she gets to make the decision she has chosen not to it&#39;s her job then And it&#39;s Jason Kenney&#39;s job to choose. And it was an absolute hatchet job. It was it was it was a terrible story. And it didn&#39;t reflect my experience of reality.

I don&#39;t know if I necessarily agree with your take on the story not being good, so to speak. You know, I am the odd one out of the three of us, right? If we&#39;re getting personal, I have not worked in government, unlike the two of you, right? So it is interesting to see how I&#39;ve absorbed it, which is perhaps more so in the vein of the audience who may not have worked in government, which I think is interesting. So I would not classify it as a story as such. But Corey, I want to get your take, both on the story, what Carter&#39;s point was that very textured, very nuanced, the story was missing that from what I heard. and then maybe even talk a bit about the political consequences. And of course, I know you had a take about the public servants involved as well. So roll it all up for whatever it&#39;s worth, Corey, and we&#39;ll go from there. Sure.</div>

And you can also believe that public servants should not leak. Those are not mutually exclusive thoughts, and I&#39;ll expand on that in a bit. But the story that Rusnell and Russell got out was effectively one where the chief medical officer of health was being overridden by elected officials. That is literally the system. We don&#39;t have government by expert. We have government by elected official. We&#39;re a democracy. For better or for worse, and usually better, but sometimes worse, we are a democracy and the deciders are the people that we send to Edmonton to make these decisions on our behalf.

There was many retorts and Corey&#39;s last statement there was pretty much the gist, if I can say that, Corey, of your tweet that you put out there, right? That these folks are not heroes, they shall not be celebrated as such. This will have ramifications and a chill on the bureaucratic sort of service and their relationship with government. If I can paraphrase, Carter, there was a series of arguments against that. Public servants are beholden to people, the government steamrolled health professionals, people died as a consequence of that, I&#39;m going to ask you, what is the best argument against Corey&#39;s take here? What is the best argument, at least in your mind? And I know you are aligned with Corey on this, so I appreciate that. But there was some arguments that, like I said, I might be a better proxy of the audience and that section of people that never worked in government. But what is the best argument around someone in the public service who wanted to perhaps leak this?</div>

So I don&#39;t think that we learned anything from this. It just becomes additive, but you know, not additive in the sense that it changes the equation. It&#39;s, it&#39;s like we brought in another variable, but we&#39;re just multiplying it by that. And it&#39;s going to come out at the same number at the end of the day.</div>

And I think that is what the takeaway from this story is. If there is a legacy to this story, there is perhaps that, that this proved that, that that was indeed the case. And I think there is a subtext towards perhaps, and I know certainly Dr. Dina Hinshaw&#39;s statements afterwards were about her, you know, being upset at the potential leaker, etc., right? Saying and stating that she&#39;s never felt like she&#39;s been muzzled or not heard. But there&#39;s almost a subtext that her advice was not being taken seriously.

Jason Kenney goes on Red FM, which is an ethnic South Asian radio station here in Calgary, talks about how the greatest COVID cases in the province are coming out of northeast Calgary, a very multicultural, very diverse part of the city. And then almost, you know, I shouldn&#39;t be too charged on this, berates the folks for these rise in cases without acknowledging, A, the mask rallies and the lack of any restrictions to those the previous day, or B, the fact that a disproportionate number of folks in this geographic area in the city are what you call frontline workers, essential workers, people who have to actually go to their jobs.

And he thinks that he gets he thinks because of his background and who he is, he gets a pass on these things. He thinks it&#39;s a strong foot. Therefore, people will forgive him.

But this narrative around Canada being back at the back of the line started to become much louder as the week went on. Corey, what do you think happened here? Why do you think was it was it just a vacuum that you felt like kind of caused this? There&#39;s been some updates to the story. But I just want to try to tease out from a comms perspective. Was it that the Prime Minister wasn&#39;t following some of those first principles?

They were either blind to it or they they weren&#39;t prepared for or some some such thing the other is that the conservatives finally got a life raft this is something they could actually score a point on because they aren&#39;t going to score a point like scott moe isn&#39;t going to score points by saying i want you to buy more vaccines 10 to 1 is not enough you know they they they needed something um that would actually score them some points and they got it so uh they jumped on it uh like a fat kid on a s&#39;more and they just dug in so that&#39;s that</div>

Running the tapes on Wednesday and Thursday in response to this particular issue will not age well for certain folks. I want to talk about this risk that Corey brought up very quickly, Carter. Before we had today&#39;s interview with the Moderna executive saying that Canada is you know not going to be at the back of the line this may have held a little bit more water but let&#39;s talk about it because it&#39;s something that the the trudeau liberals which you have said are not great at communicating may need to account for which is right now the prime minister&#39;s line is that canada&#39;s entire population will have their vaccine before america&#39;s entire population this this communalist sort of like will get to our end before they get to their end and i want to talk about the risk of that political messaging especially when we might be looking at an individual basis where that communal erosion may occur. And you might be looking at people down south and saying, I don&#39;t give a shit about if we as a country are going to, you know, complete before the rest of them. I care about my vaccine. I care about me, my golden ticket. Is there a risk here? And how big do you think that risk is, Carter, if for some reason we are punched to the back of the line or there&#39;s delays from our at least visible counterparts down south?</div>

            <div class="said">Well, I think it matters how long the delay is, right? Like if first responders, so this is all going to go in waves. So if the first wave of the United States vaccinations happens in January and the first wave of Canadian vaccinations happens in February, I really don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to be talking about a significant issue. If the first wave goes in, you know, in the United States, the second wave goes in the United States, the third wave goes in the United States, forget about vaccinating the entire population the entire population isn&#39;t going to get vaccinated in the united states like it&#39;s just not going to happen it&#39;s probably not going to happen here especially with jason kenney you know promising</div>
