Even without a host, Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter refuse to be silenced in a week that included the Prime Minister announcing his separation, Trump's third indictment and Alberta declaring war on renewables.

        <div class="desc"><p>The gang get together and do their best not to talk about the Alberta election - intermittently failing. How campaigns run against themselves in the last week, the virtues of the "exploratory committee" and more are discussed in this e-day minus seven spectacular.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss whether campaigns have any ability to turn the ship in the last week, the Bonnie Crombie soft launch for OLP leader and a Toronto mayoral race that is being called a coronation for Olivia Chow. Is there a point when the electoral cake becomes “baked”? Was the early Crombie website launch a mistake or a “mistake”? And if I call 587-A0K-ZAIN, will I learn more about his policy on cupboard toasters? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

        <div class="desc"><p>It's debate night in Alberta. The gang assembles to unpack and process their thoughts in real time. They discuss the lines that worked, the strategies, the overall impressions and how each side can "win the debate" - all against the backdrop of an ethics violation that gives the entire affair a surreal energy.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the leaders’ debate in the 2023 Alberta election and an ethics commissioner ruling that hangs over it all. Did either leader do what they needed to do to be declared a “winner”? Will Danielle Smith be able to buffalo her way out of consequences for a damning ethics ruling? And who doesn’t love a blue blazer? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>
