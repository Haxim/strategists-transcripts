Even without a host, Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter refuse to be silenced in a week that included the Prime Minister announcing his separation, Trump&#39;s third indictment and Alberta declaring war on renewables. Do people care if the PM is divorced? Has Alberta destroyed Canada&#39;s most valuable renewable play? And are you glass-half-Hogan or glass-half-Carter?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Zain&#39;s back and provincial politics is back on the menu. We turn back to neglected news about David Johnston&#39;s special rapporteuring (including the hiring of crisis communications firm Navigator) before debating whether Danielle Smith&#39;s leadership is in trouble and what she needs to do to be secure through the summer and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Special Rapporteur David Johnston’s recommendations and communications support, as well as what Alberta Premier Danielle Smith needs to do this summer to secure her leadership. Can Smith be the first premier since Klein to finish a full term? Does the gang still think a public inquiry is an inevitability? And what’s your favourite Dave prequel? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Zain and Annalise have left Stephen and Corey unattended. Now they can tell the world what they really think about the 2023 Alberta election and the quality of strategic advice they provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter give their reflections on the 2023 Alberta election and the immediate challenges facing the UCP and NDP before turning to an “accountability session” and listener question. Can the UCP bridge their right/further right divide? Was the gang wrong about the place of the economy and health care? And did you know The Strategists have a producer? What does that job even entail? Zain Velji and Annalise Klingbeil, as always, are taking job action and refusing to moderate until their demands are met.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang start a series of reactions to the Alberta election by talking about the day after, unpacking just how differently things could have gone with only a few votes and beginning discussion about what the campaigns did well and could have done differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter give their instant reaction to the results of the 2023 Alberta election and talk about what happens the day after the campaign, how few votes separated an NDP majority from a 15-seat UCP majority, and begin unpacking what the NDP might have been able to do differently. Why weren’t Calgary-Acadia and Calgary-Glenmore the predicted bellwethers? How soon does the work for the next campaign begin? And is tonight the night Stephen Carter quashes all beefs? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she&#39;s got you covered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;In 24 hours it will all be over (probably/maybe). But let&#39;s talk about what we think it will be anyways, and dive into how campaign internals and voter modelling works while we&#39;re at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s the night before the Alberta election. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter do what strategists do when there’s nothing left to do: rate the campaign’s highlights and lowlights, make predictions, second guess the data, and try to figure out what it all means. Are campaigns better equipped to read a race than pollsters? Does advance voting skew left and will it result in an “orange mirage”? And why does Annalise keep asking the audience’s questions? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she&#39;s got you covered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang talk a lot about Calgary-Glenmore and Calgary-Acadia, a bit about advance voting and inspire the next generation, which Stephen definitely does not slander. Where&#39;s Zain? We benched him because it&#39;s all provincial politics from now to Monday, baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss what Rachel Notley and Danielle Smith&#39;s actions in the past week tell us about the state of the Alberta election, whether negative campaigning works and what (if anything) to read into advance vote numbers. Does the entire election come down to Calgary-Glenmore? Will half of all voters have cast their ballot by Saturday afternoon? And who should be more afraid of fireworks - dogs or the City Administration? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here.

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about how the NDP and UCP campaigns should be approaching the final days of the Alberta election, undecided voters, polls and Stephen&#39;s final predictions. Was Danielle Smith&#39;s weekend visit to Edmonton a feint? Can we trust polls to tell us what will happen on election day? And if we can&#39;t trust Margaret&#39;s judgement, whose judgment can we trust? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here.

How campaigns run against themselves in the last week, the virtues of the &#34;exploratory committee&#34; and more are discussed in this e-day minus seven spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss whether campaigns have any ability to turn the ship in the last week, the Bonnie Crombie soft launch for OLP leader and a Toronto mayoral race that is being called a coronation for Olivia Chow. Is there a point when the electoral cake becomes “baked”? Was the early Crombie website launch a mistake or a “mistake”? And if I call 587-A0K-ZAIN, will I learn more about his policy on cupboard toasters?

They discuss the lines that worked, the strategies, the overall impressions and how each side can &#34;win the debate&#34; - all against the backdrop of an ethics violation that gives the entire affair a surreal energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the leaders’ debate in the 2023 Alberta election and an ethics commissioner ruling that hangs over it all. Did either leader do what they needed to do to be declared a “winner”? Will Danielle Smith be able to buffalo her way out of consequences for a damning ethics ruling? And who doesn’t love a blue blazer? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she&#39;s got you covered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>
