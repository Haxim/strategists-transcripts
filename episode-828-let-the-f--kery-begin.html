        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the close-out to the US Presidential Election and the Wildcat Strike by health care workers in Alberta this week. Is there a risk of violence on Election Day? Was the Wildcat Strike a communications success or a communications failure? And should Alberta Federation of Labour President Gil McGowan be exposing himself? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

So Carter, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first. Maybe if you want to give our listeners a brief sort of understanding as to what a ballot box question is. I know we&#39;ve done that in the past, but just a quick primer. And then in your mind, do we have one?

That is the last question that they&#39;re thinking about. That is the issue at which the election is being fought over. And it is the prime question.

And then Biden&#39;s really, you know, his campaign to his credit have tried to frame him as someone out of central casting, if your ballot box question is about decency, if your ballot box question is about going back to a version of normal and a politics of normal. So in your mind, do you feel like we&#39;ve settled on a harmonized ballot box question to Stephen&#39;s mind?

So, you know, in the elections that I was winning in the early 2010s, we had an enthusiasm gap for our candidates. So people chose to vote more. People who were more likely to support my candidates voted more. So the voter numbers increased because those people were excited to get out and vote, whereas the other side&#39;s voters weren&#39;t quite as motivated, and they basically</div>

It seems like the Trump campaign, however, and more specifically, Donald Trump doesn&#39;t have any incentive or any, you know, muscle that is going to try to stop this violence. In fact, to the comment that you made about Texas yesterday, where the trucks with Trump flags were kind of barricading and surrounding a Biden campaign van, Trump retweeted that and said, I love Texas, right? Not signaling anything other than saying, yeah, fuck this, I love Texas. this. So maybe, and unfairly, the responsibility is squared on Biden&#39;s shoulder, the Biden campaign shoulders. Is there something they should be saying or doing with 48 hours to go? Is there something that they should be thinking about and maybe using some of their airtime and oxygen for in the next couple of days? Or what would you recommend? Or what would you suggest if you were on the inside of that team?</div>

What this report has suggested, among other things, is dramatic outsourcing of a lot of the functions that are within the healthcare system, but that are not specifically nurses or physicians. So this would be areas like reception, the cleaning of the hospitals, the laundry services that occur, many of which are already outsourced in Alberta. And long story short, this will result in significant job losses within Alberta Health Services. Yes, they would potentially be picked up again in the private sector. But by definition, if you&#39;re finding savings there, guess what, they&#39;re not paying the same, right? And or there&#39;s not as many.</div>

And so there was a wildcat strike in Alberta. Again, depending on where you stand, you might just call it an illegal job action in Alberta, where people walked off the job to protest these changes to the healthcare system, among all of the other changes roiling the healthcare system and all of the other fights within the healthcare system.

          <div class="said">mean i don&#39;t believe the Minister when he says that 11,000 people is going to create $600 million in savings. And this has been the problem with outsourcing from the beginning. We are told that there&#39;s going to be massive savings when we do an outsource. But when the actual outsourcing happens, we find that it doesn&#39;t save us that much money overall. And it doesn&#39;t matter if we&#39;re outsourcing lab services or if we&#39;re outsourcing cleaning</div>

The communications can look like these workers, these are the people who are going to be impacted. This is the services that they actually provide. This is who they are. Show me a communication strategy that builds empathy or some sort of connection between me as a human being and the people who are going to walk off the job. Do the wildcat strike. I&#39;m fine with the wildcat strike but do the wildcat strike in a fashion that actually builds momentum for communication that doesn&#39;t just happen on a monday morning and is shut down by monday afternoon or monday monday night and by tuesday afternoon we&#39;re all talking about obama again uh sinking a three-point shot i guess that&#39;s i guess that&#39;s saturday but the point is that the action doesn&#39;t have any dramatic through line that carries it beyond the the day itself i&#39;ll</div>

The people who they were trying to communicate with, the people that they were trying to get on their side, have a much lower give a fuck factor. So communicate with us, give us a reason to care, give us a reason to understand what is at stake, and then do the job action. I mean, if it&#39;s a wildcat strike, and I don&#39;t believe for a second, uh that this was a uh an action that wasn&#39;t coordinated through the union um you know the union has declined has just said that this is uh this was outside of their control that&#39;s bullshit it never was outside of their control this is something that they&#39;ve been working on as part of their strategy and their strategy sucked and all it did was hurt the people who walked off the job on monday when they could have had all of us caring a lot more if they&#39;d done their homework work in advance and and gotten us into place where when the wildcat strikes occurred we were all bought in cory honest to god people should see the video of your head shaking because it it&#39;s like a bobble head it&#39;s not even like a real head your head is shaking so fast cory</div>

There would be back to work orders imposed. This is going to happen to Corey&#39;s point. This is going to happen. But have it coordinated. Have it so that it lasts more than a day. This is my fundamental problem with it. It lasted a day and it&#39;s gone. And now you&#39;ve taken money out of these workers&#39; pockets because they didn&#39;t work that day.

Is this what you would have advised, perhaps, if you were on the inside?

          <div class="said">Yeah, I think it is, Zane. And I think actually this was one of the big risks for the AUPE, which is what if nobody participates in this wildcat strike, right? Because the last thing you want to do is have an action like that and really be exposed as it not having popular support amongst the membership. So in a way, and this sounds a little perverse, but the AUPE got a break when the government released that report with the layoffs, the 11,000 jobs, because at that point, what do you got to lose? You are losing your job. So the threat of job action is, or sorry, a punishment against you, maybe even losing your job that you&#39;re going to lose anyways, is probably not as big of a deal. And obviously, there is solidarity and strength in numbers. And when enough people go out, that&#39;s protection for everybody. They&#39;ll try to pick off the union leaders, but it becomes impossible to take They take action against everybody. So they managed to get enough people to start the ball rolling with the fact that they&#39;re going to lose their jobs. They added onto it people who say, well, now I can stand with them because they can&#39;t damage us all. They can&#39;t fire us all. And this is serious. I think Alberta is in for a winter of discontent on the labor front. Carter,</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, I&#39;m going to keep it in this segment, but move on to a cousin of the AUPE Wildcat Strikes, which is later this week, earlier this week, I guess I should say, but after the Wildcat Strikes, the Alberta Federation of Labour started a new campaign called Stand Up to Kenny, a three-part digital campaign where step one was to sign the pledge and show Jason Kenney you&#39;re serious. Step number two says, once enough Albertans have joined our movement, we&#39;ll publicly demand that the government negotiate with us to address our concerns. And step three was, if the government doesn&#39;t listen to our demands, we&#39;ll begin a series of one-day province-wide protests that could include work stoppages. I&#39;m kind of curious to get your sense of, you know, on the heels of what we saw with the Wildcat strikes, what do you make of this strategy now coming from the AFL? It seems to be in line with, you know, with some of the things we&#39;ve been talking about earlier. Do you feel like telegraphing, and I&#39;ve used that word quite a bit, to the public that work stoppages and these sort of things could be part of the eventual outcome, but also list building? And as I see right now, close to about 15,000 people as of Sunday morning have signed this thing. What do you make of both the strategy and the tactics of what you&#39;re seeing from the AFL here?</div>

How many people have signed up to that list? How many people who are tweeting at us are members of the public and not just members of the union executive. And I&#39;m not really sure if the labor movement has fully internalized that and fully gotten just the sophistication on the government side. One of the things that is quite different from the 90s and quite different from the aughts is, or in even early 10s, is there&#39;s been a major centralization of labor efforts, not to the point where it&#39;s actually coordination between different employers. I want want to be clear about that but um you know there are there are centralized supports there are central groups that look at these things for the government this level of sophistication has increased dramatically in the past five years they&#39;re watching they&#39;re they&#39;re keeping track of where there are strength and where there are weaknesses and um i think it would be rather</div>

What do you kind of make of, because we&#39;ve talked about, you know, in our past lives and in our current comms lives, this ladder of engagement, usually it&#39;s something that we keep internal when we kind of want to drive our supporters through different rungs of a ladder to expose it so publicly.

Right. This seems to be the ever the ever present nut to crack, which is, you know, of course, your membership, you know, if you&#39;re lucky, are engaged. But this is about building that second concentric circle, which it seems like this campaign, to its credit, is trying to do and trying to explicitly say this is for all Albertans.

What makes somebody want to join one? What makes somebody nervous about joining one? What do you do with people who are frustrated but maybe not in a position where they can voice that frustration more broadly? You&#39;ve got to get back to some of these fundamentals of how you build a movement when that movement is under pretty steady attack, right? Right. This is the government, as I mentioned, has a pretty large majority and they&#39;re going to be comfortably in the seat until 2023 at the very least. You can&#39;t be just putting out lists of numbers like that. You can&#39;t you can&#39;t you&#39;ve got to remember. And again, I&#39;m speaking metaphorically here. This is not a war, but you&#39;ve got to remember that all warfare is based on on kind of deception and you&#39;ve got to have a certain you can&#39;t make it so easy for the government to measure exactly how effective all of your strategies are, Because you need to have the latitude where you can try a ton of things, fail silently on two-thirds of them, and the one-third that are really working, ramp those things up in a big way. But if the government sees exactly what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not for you, they know exactly where to apply counter resources. That&#39;s not a very difficult thing to do if you&#39;re sitting there in the government. So be smart, I guess is what I&#39;m saying. Be smart about it and think tactically about this.

Are you trying to keep an arm&#39;s length? Like, I know this is generic advice, but we know this is going to ramp up. But how are you kind of perhaps if you&#39;re in the position to advise her, hypothetically, what would you be telling her in terms of, you know, labor and its movement versus your party right now trying to build second and third tier concentric circles of support?</div>

You know, the first app that was put forward outside of Cori, maybe another 246,000 people downloaded it. And I believe that most of them like Cori have deleted the app. So we&#39;re in a place where we don&#39;t have a solution. And the app itself, as much as the Canadian version of the app is much better, it&#39;s not going to solve the problem. I think that most people don&#39;t think it&#39;s really that big of a deal.

There are two reasons why the pressure, why my answer is modified from last time we talked about this. One is that Trudeau blaming Alberta for not being on the app does up the pressure.

How do you currently rank Steve Allen asking for a second extension or being granted a second extension on the anti-Alberta oil campaign report? To remind our listeners, this was a very explicit and loud thesis statement that our government put out there, that there is anti-Alberta oil funding, foreign funding being poured in to really push up against our most prime and celebrated resource. resource they&#39;ve been trying to research this put documents together they&#39;ve been fuddling around with terms of references and now they&#39;ve been granted a second extension course cory from a scale of embarrassing to most embarrassing where does this fit on your radar uh</div>

He&#39;s no longer looking at the veracity of claims. So effectively, there could be people legitimately saying things like, hey, this is raising emissions, and that will show up in the report. It is designed entirely to just document money coming in from one side in a global conversation, then money&#39;s flowing in from both sides, make no mistakes.

          <div class="said">mean, it was exactly what you would want. So it was positive for them. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like this great home run where they can just all go pat themselves on the back. It&#39;s just fine politics as usual. We we talked about last episode. Maybe this might change if it went really badly for them, their view of a fall election, a spring election. I don&#39;t think this would change their view at all.

That&#39;s the big problem, or that&#39;s the party facing a big problem right now, not the Liberals.</div>

          <div class="said">No, because you don&#39;t have a winner until everything&#39;s done. Like it&#39;s not just the counting. It&#39;s not just the results, but it&#39;s the idea that they need to be ratified by states. The electors need to get together. You need to support it. So in a truly pedantic sense, you will not have a winner on election night. But beyond that, I think the idea, even if on election night we say, oh, Joe Biden&#39;s got this, I</div>
