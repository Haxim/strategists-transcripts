            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It reminds me of Carter&#39;s comment on our other podcast earlier this week when you said, you know, if aliens came down to see a room and Bill Clinton was sitting there randomly placed, they could pick out the leader. I have a similar sort of vibe with Barack Obama, even within the confines of the Joe Biden campaign team.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. I mean, I think he&#39;s the weakest even compared to Harris. I mean, Harris walks into the room. Everybody knows Harris is in the room. Biden comes in and they wonder where he is when he&#39;s going to get there. like it&#39;s just it&#39;s unfortunate but that&#39;s just the way it is there</span>

            <span class="text">guys let&#39;s talk about the u.s election and there&#39;s a few things i want to talk about i mean we&#39;re only a couple of days away we record this on sunday morning election is on tuesday evening or i should say election day is on tuesday evening as millions upon millions have already voted um maybe let&#39;s start here with a basic question i don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually diagnosed, and maybe now&#39;s the right time to do it, which is, in this election, do we have a unified ballot box question? So Carter, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first. Maybe if you want to give our listeners a brief sort of understanding as to what a ballot box question is. I know we&#39;ve done that in the past, but just a quick primer. And then in your mind, do we have one? Do we have a unified ballot box question, or is this a fractured election where we&#39;ve got multiple questions we&#39;re competing for? I&#39;d love to just get each of your takes on that that very simple, you</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;ll go deep and go back to 2000. I mean, so I&#39;ll explain what a ballot box question is first. What it basically is, is when a person goes to the ballot box, what question do you want them asking in their mind moments before they mark their ballot? That is the last question that they&#39;re thinking about. That is the issue at which the election is being fought over. And it is the prime question. So in 2000, and it was one of my best ballot</span>

            <span class="text">You know, Corey, there seems to be some competing narratives, you know, despite Carter&#39;s comments that, that we&#39;ve perhaps harmonized on a ballot box question with the two camps, you know, Trump&#39;s campaign is largely in most recent weeks been about Biden being corrupt, right, that COVID is not all that bad, that the media is unfair to him, and then recently talking about the economic, you know, upgrades that the US economy has seen in this third quarter. And then Biden&#39;s really, you know, his campaign to his credit have tried to frame him as someone out of central casting, if your ballot box question is about decency, if your ballot box question is about going back to a version of normal and a politics of normal. So in your mind, do you feel like we&#39;ve settled on a harmonized ballot box question to Stephen&#39;s mind? Or do you feel like we&#39;re a bit more fractured in terms of what we might be seeing?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I definitely think we&#39;re fractured. And part of that is the man that is Donald Trump, he can&#39;t stick on a ballot box question for more than a week or two, you can tell his campaign is trying, you know, it&#39;ll be law and order. And then all of a sudden, it&#39;s, it&#39;s Hunter Biden&#39;s laptop. And, you</span>

            <span class="text">you know, and then all of a sudden, it&#39;s the COVID is cured, and the guy bounces around, and he doesn&#39;t show an awful lot of discipline. And that lack of discipline is also flowing into the Biden campaign. Now, all of that said, there are some themes that the campaigns are clearly orbiting around there. You know, it has been mentioned by you, Zane, that both of them are talking about corruption.</span>

But I wouldn&#39;t even do that. I would would be corrupt in those matters so why joe biden must be too and that&#39;s why he&#39;s running around um but you know biden wants to talk about covid the response to covid is always the first thing that comes out of his mouth their compassion and decency are the second trump wants to talk about the economy and building the strongest economy and building it again um and uh compassion and decency are the last things that come out of his mouth but both of the campaigns have are running their own flavor of do we like what america&#39;s becoming and you don&#39;t like campaigns shouldn&#39;t have the same ballot box question that&#39;s not the purpose of a ballot box question if everybody thinks they&#39;re winning on the same question somebody is wrong and so um if we uh if we wake up on wednesday and there is a you know a biden landslide i would say it is because the republicans frankly</span>

            <span class="text">Guys, I want to move it on from here, because this is a very interesting sort of comment around where we find the question and the messaging. Let&#39;s talk a bit about before we head into what I think is the most interesting part, which is the night of and perhaps the the morning after. But let&#39;s talk very briefly about what we call the enthusiasm gap. You know, we&#39;ve talked a bit on our other podcast about voter turnout, but maybe Carter, I&#39;ll go back to you to help us define what&#39;s an enthusiasm gap. And do you feel like the one that we might see in this election could be a factor?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, so enthusiasm is just a simple measure of how likely a person is to vote and it can come from both sides. So, you know, in the elections that I was winning in the early 2010s, we had an enthusiasm gap for our candidates. So people chose to vote more. People who were more likely to support my candidates voted more. So the voter numbers increased because those people were excited to get out and vote, whereas the other side&#39;s voters weren&#39;t quite as motivated, and they basically</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">basically maintained the numbers that they&#39;d had before.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So in other elections, they would have been fine, but in an election where more people people voted, they weren&#39;t fine. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So in this particular election, in the election in the United States, you&#39;re seeing, for example, massive advance voter turnout, where 93 million votes have been cast as we&#39;re recording the podcast this morning. I&#39;m anticipating it might go as high as 100 million advance votes.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s showing an enthusiasm. The question is, is there a gap between the Republicans and the Democrats&#39; enthusiasm? So as we go through and we&#39;re We&#39;re looking and people are, of course, Nate Silver and Nate Cohn are are cautioning people not to read too too much into the early voting statistics. But if you look at the states that have that</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for the Democrats. Why that&#39;s important, that gap may reverse itself and you may see a enthusiasm gap on election night. But if there is a gap for the Democrats, then the polling that we&#39;ve been seeing, which kind of balances these things out and make sure you&#39;re not pulling too many people of any one group. the polling will be skewed because more people turning out for one set for one group with enthusiasm will</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Carter, you make a good point. I mean, this could be the election where we have 330 million people in the United States. You might quite literally have half of America voting, which is an unprecedented Democratic event. We&#39;ll put Democratic in quotes because we want to talk about the day of and the morning after, but could be the most unprecedented voting event that we have seen in the country. And so your point is valid in the sense that if you can&#39;t read who the enthusiasm gap is for or have it necessarily telegraphed to you right now, it&#39;s hard to tell. Corey, your comments on the enthusiasm gap, we&#39;ve heard it a lot in the last sort of weeks or so. Where do you kind of see it playing Do you feel like any side has an edge? Love to just hear your comments on that.</span>

You know, one of the things that even Trump&#39;s aides have have have signaled this morning on the Sunday morning talk shows is that they&#39;re very excited to ensure that that the president is named on the night of, despite what media organizations and social media platforms have said. They&#39;re very excited to claim that they know that their supporters, they&#39;re so nakedly, you know, obvious about this, are going to show up in greater droves on Election Day, as even early polling has indicated on, if we can call it enthusiasm or vote intent, right? Right. So what do you kind of look at when you&#39;re looking at, you know, the election night and leading into the next morning? And we&#39;ve used the V word before on this podcast. It&#39;s been in our in our general orbit and zeitgeist violence. Are you more or less afraid that that might be a reality leading into this, what I&#39;d say, consistent messaging by the Trump camp, even as early as this morning? planning, and now looking at other things like cities boarding up their main streets quite aggressively all across the country, especially in major urban centers, is the threat or perhaps even the worry of violence something that is higher or lower in your mind as you sit here on Sunday morning, two days before</span>

Texas, Corey mentioned the driving off the road of the bus and the swerving and hitting a staffer&#39;s car with their truck. This is already happening. It&#39;s happening quickly.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is most likely to hurt one side more than the other at this stage. If you&#39;re worried that there&#39;s going to be violence at polling stations, if you&#39;re worried that there&#39;s going to be violence on election day, you&#39;re not going to go to the polls. And the group, I mean, maybe the enthusiasm gap is so significant that the people who are going to the polls on that day are Republicans. But right now, virtually every poll that&#39;s asked the question, have you already voted or are you planning to vote, is showing that two-thirds of voters who&#39;ve already voted, voted for Biden. And two-thirds of voters that are going to vote on Election Day are voting for Trump.</span>

So if there is a reckoning, if there is a pushback and fewer people vote on Election Day, there&#39;s only one side that&#39;s going to get hurt. And that side is the Trump side.

I think that most of the states that are most in play and most interesting are going to be giving us results that are mostly there on election night.

It seems like the Trump campaign, however, and more specifically, Donald Trump doesn&#39;t have any incentive or any, you know, muscle that is going to try to stop this violence. In fact, to the comment that you made about Texas yesterday, where the trucks with Trump flags were kind of barricading and surrounding a Biden campaign van, Trump retweeted that and said, I love Texas, right? Not signaling anything other than saying, yeah, fuck this, I love Texas. this. So maybe, and unfairly, the responsibility is squared on Biden&#39;s shoulder, the Biden campaign shoulders. Is there something they should be saying or doing with 48 hours to go? Is there something that they should be thinking about and maybe using some of their airtime and oxygen for in the next couple of days? Or what would you recommend? Or what would you suggest if you were on the inside of that team?</span>

But we need this, we need to be at the end of the day able to say, we held ourselves to America&#39;s better values. And that&#39;s across Across America. And so you cannot take the bait. You cannot start the fight. And if they start the fight with you, you need to find a way to deescalate it as much as possible. And it&#39;s not a very comforting answer.

If you can give our listeners who might not be from Alberta or maybe are from Alberta a basic summary of where Jason Kenney&#39;s most recent conversations with his government have been with health care cuts and then maybe leaning into perhaps what we saw with these wildcat strikes.

            <span class="text">we have – the government of Alberta has gotten a report back, which they commissioned looking for savings within the healthcare system to then reinvest into care in different ways to deal with the growing demands on the healthcare system without investing more money into the healthcare system. system. What this report has suggested, among other things, is dramatic outsourcing of a lot of the functions that are within the healthcare system, but that are not specifically nurses or physicians. So this would be areas like reception, the cleaning of the hospitals, the laundry services that occur, many of which are already outsourced in Alberta. And long story short, this will result in significant job losses within Alberta Health Services. Yes, they would potentially be picked up again in the private sector. But by definition, if you&#39;re finding savings there, guess what, they&#39;re not paying the same, right? And or there&#39;s not as many.</span>

            <span class="text">So obviously, people who are in these ancillary services are concerned. They&#39;re very concerned about the fact that this is just happening. Because of the way collective bargaining goes, it&#39;s unlikely they would have been in a position to strike legally before these actions are just essentially set in stone and can&#39;t occur or and can be reversed, I should say. And so there was a wildcat strike in Alberta. Again, depending on where you stand, you might just call it an illegal job action in Alberta, where people walked off the job to protest these changes to the healthcare system, among all of the other changes roiling the healthcare system and all of the other fights within the healthcare system. They were unsurprisingly immediately ordered back to work by the lrb the labor relations board um and</span>

But when the actual outsourcing happens, we find that it doesn&#39;t save us that much money overall.

The communications can look like these workers, these are the people who are going to be impacted. This is the services that they actually provide. This is who they are. Show me a communication strategy that builds empathy or some sort of connection between me as a human being and the people who are going to walk off the job. Do the wildcat strike. I&#39;m fine with the wildcat strike but do the wildcat strike in a fashion that actually builds momentum for communication that doesn&#39;t just happen on a monday morning and is shut down by monday afternoon or monday monday night and by tuesday afternoon we&#39;re all talking about obama again uh sinking a three-point shot i guess that&#39;s i guess that&#39;s saturday but the point is that the action doesn&#39;t have any dramatic through line that carries it beyond the the day itself i&#39;ll</span>

And the general popular, this is, the people who walked out on Monday have a very high give a fuck factor. The people who they were trying to communicate with, the people that they were trying to get on their side, have a much lower give a fuck factor. So communicate with us, give us a reason to care, give us a reason to understand what is at stake, and then do the job action. I mean, if it&#39;s a wildcat strike, and I don&#39;t believe for a second, uh that this was a uh an action that wasn&#39;t coordinated through the union um you know the union has declined has just said that this is uh this was outside of their control that&#39;s bullshit it never was outside of their control this is something that they&#39;ve been working on as part of their strategy and their strategy sucked and all it did was hurt the people who walked off the job on monday when they could have had all of us caring a lot more if they&#39;d done their homework work in advance and and gotten us into place where when the wildcat strikes occurred we were all bought in cory honest to god people should see the video of your head shaking because it it&#39;s like a bobble head it&#39;s not even like a real head your head is shaking so fast cory</span>

Like having having a multiple week structure of strikes where the union understands the consequences and is prepared to pay them because there will be fines imposed. There would be back to work orders imposed. This is going to happen to Corey&#39;s point. This is going to happen. But have it coordinated. Have it so that it lasts more than a day. This is my fundamental problem with it. It lasted a day and it&#39;s gone. And now you&#39;ve taken money out of these workers&#39; pockets because they didn&#39;t work that day. And these aren&#39;t the people who can afford to not be working that day.</span>

Is this what you would have advised, perhaps, if you were on the inside? And I know neither of us, or none of us, I should say, have a clear sense of perhaps the overall comms plan or trajectory, But from knowing what we do with our knowledge, do you feel like this was something you would have recommended as your pre-coms or first step?</span>

And it&#39;s pretty tough to say that they are just cynically – when you know they are not being made whole by anybody.

            <span class="text">it&#39;s a threat that is in response to their implied threat about legislating because the government&#39;s been pretty clear like hey there&#39;s only so much money it&#39;s either coming through job losses or reductions and we reserve all of our rights right now so i don&#39;t think this is a crazy idea is</span>

            <span class="text">is it is it fair to say that it&#39;s a preview view of the muscle that AUPE or another union could kind of show as to the win behind their back from their membership? Is that a fair assessment?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think it is, Zane. And I think actually this was one of the big risks for the AUPE, which is what if nobody participates in this wildcat strike, right? Because the last thing you want to do is have an action like that and really be exposed as it not having popular support amongst the membership. So in a way, and this sounds a little perverse, but the AUPE got a break when the government released that report with the layoffs, the 11,000 jobs, because at that point, what do you got to lose? You are losing your job. So the threat of job action is, or sorry, a punishment against you, maybe even losing your job that you&#39;re going to lose anyways, is probably not as big of a deal. And obviously, there is solidarity and strength in numbers. And when enough people go out, that&#39;s protection for everybody. They&#39;ll try to pick off the union leaders, but it becomes impossible to take They take action against everybody. So they managed to get enough people to start the ball rolling with the fact that they&#39;re going to lose their jobs. They added onto it people who say, well, now I can stand with them because they can&#39;t damage us all. They can&#39;t fire us all. And this is serious. I think Alberta is in for a winter of discontent on the labor front. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to keep it in this segment, but move on to a cousin of the AUPE Wildcat Strikes, which is later this week, earlier this week, I guess I should say, but after the Wildcat Strikes, the Alberta Federation of Labour started a new campaign called Stand Up to Kenny, a three-part digital campaign where step one was to sign the pledge and show Jason Kenney you&#39;re serious. Step number two says, once enough Albertans have joined our movement, we&#39;ll publicly demand that the government negotiate with us to address our concerns. And step three was, if the government doesn&#39;t listen to our demands, we&#39;ll begin a series of one-day province-wide protests that could include work stoppages. I&#39;m kind of curious to get your sense of, you know, on the heels of what we saw with the Wildcat strikes, what do you make of this strategy now coming from the AFL? It seems to be in line with, you know, with some of the things we&#39;ve been talking about earlier. Do you feel like telegraphing, and I&#39;ve used that word quite a bit, to the public that work stoppages and these sort of things could be part of the eventual outcome, but also list building? And as I see right now, close to about 15,000 people as of Sunday morning have signed this thing. What do you make of both the strategy and the tactics of what you&#39;re seeing from the AFL here?</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m worried about the idea of telegraphing exactly what you&#39;re going to do, shutting down the province, doing those types of actions. I mean, we haven&#39;t seen that. We don&#39;t have that labor history here. We don&#39;t have the labor history of shutting down the province through some sort of action. I mean, I think that Klein faced the biggest labor uprising in our history in, what, 1996, 97, Corey? Is that close? Yeah, around</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, whenever unions do anything, the government is watching very closely to say like, okay, well, how many people showed up to that job action training seminar? How many people have signed up to that list? How many people who are tweeting at us are members of the public and not just members of the union executive. And I&#39;m not really sure if the labor movement has fully internalized that and fully gotten just the sophistication on the government side. One of the things that is quite different from the 90s and quite different from the aughts is, or in even early 10s, is there&#39;s been a major centralization of labor efforts, not to the point where it&#39;s actually coordination between different employers. I want want to be clear about that but um you know there are there are centralized supports there are central groups that look at these things for the government this level of sophistication has increased dramatically in the past five years they&#39;re watching they&#39;re they&#39;re keeping track of where there are strength and where there are weaknesses and um i think it would be rather</span>

What do you kind of make of, because we&#39;ve talked about, you know, in our past lives and in our current comms lives, this ladder of engagement, usually it&#39;s something that we keep internal when we kind of want to drive our supporters through different rungs of a ladder to expose it so publicly.

This is not dissimilar for the rest of the country, except it&#39;s, it&#39;s marginally worse. I think everywhere except, uh, it&#39;s worse than everywhere except Newfoundland. So what are we doing here? And adding more people to the unemployment rolls, reducing people&#39;s salaries. This isn&#39;t the time your restaurant&#39;s going to get screwed. rude if we start reducing salaries, because people aren&#39;t going to be able to afford to go out to eat.

If you&#39;re maybe not even advising the AFL, but if you&#39;re trying to mobilize a group of people, maybe on the heels of perhaps what you&#39;d call some momentum and free media from the Wildcat strikes, from this ongoing battle that you know you&#39;re going to be in, how do you engage, let me put it this way, non-union everyday Alberta folks to kind of join your side, right? Right. This seems to be the ever the ever present nut to crack, which is, you know, of course, your membership, you know, if you&#39;re lucky, are engaged. But this is about building that second concentric circle, which it seems like this campaign, to its credit, is trying to do and trying to explicitly say this is for all Albertans. But, you know, what would you be kind of thinking of as as a proposed alternative to to really help and buffet the labor movement with that second tier of Albertans?</span>

What makes somebody want to join one? What makes somebody nervous about joining one? What do you do with people who are frustrated but maybe not in a position where they can voice that frustration more broadly? You&#39;ve got to get back to some of these fundamentals of how you build a movement when that movement is under pretty steady attack, right? Right. This is the government, as I mentioned, has a pretty large majority and they&#39;re going to be comfortably in the seat until 2023 at the very least. You can&#39;t be just putting out lists of numbers like that. You can&#39;t you can&#39;t you&#39;ve got to remember. And again, I&#39;m speaking metaphorically here. This is not a war, but you&#39;ve got to remember that all warfare is based on on kind of deception and you&#39;ve got to have a certain you can&#39;t make it so easy for the government to measure exactly how effective all of your strategies are, Because you need to have the latitude where you can try a ton of things, fail silently on two-thirds of them, and the one-third that are really working, ramp those things up in a big way. But if the government sees exactly what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not for you, they know exactly where to apply counter resources. That&#39;s not a very difficult thing to do if you&#39;re sitting there in the government. So be smart, I guess is what I&#39;m saying. Be smart about it and think tactically about this.

Maybe I said I was going to round it out with the last one, but I&#39;ve got one more in my mind, which is the relationship that that labor has to the provincial NDP in this province. What did you make of former premier and current leader of the opposition, Rachel Notley&#39;s response? And how are you in terms of thinking of her strategy? Are you leaning into big labor movements? Are you trying to keep an arm&#39;s length? Like, I know this is generic advice, but we know this is going to ramp up. But how are you kind of perhaps if you&#39;re in the position to advise her, hypothetically, what would you be telling her in terms of, you know, labor and its movement versus your party right now trying to build second and third tier concentric circles of support?</span>

And the campaign staff and then the people who staffed the premier&#39;s office by and large were the cream of the crop of the NDP across Canada.

We had some bickering by one member of Jason Kenney&#39;s front bench calling it the Trudeau app. But at this moment, when public health is of utmost concern, how much political damage is this now causing to Jason Kenney and his government for not adopting and bringing in this federal COVID app?</span>

You know, the first app that was put forward outside of Cori, maybe another 246,000 people downloaded it. And I believe that most of them like Cori have deleted the app. So we&#39;re in a place where we don&#39;t have a solution. And the app itself, as much as the Canadian version of the app is much better, it&#39;s not going to solve the problem. I think that most people don&#39;t think it&#39;s really that big of a deal. So while I think it&#39;s stupid that we haven&#39;t signed on to using the app. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s causing much in the way of political problems.</span>

To remind our listeners, this was a very explicit and loud thesis statement that our government put out there, that there is anti-Alberta oil funding, foreign funding being poured in to really push up against our most prime and celebrated resource. resource they&#39;ve been trying to research this put documents together they&#39;ve been fuddling around with terms of references and now they&#39;ve been granted a second extension course cory from a scale of embarrassing to most embarrassing where does this fit on your radar uh</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh most embarrassing and more problematic for the government sets up potential future embarrassments because if this report comes in a day late and a dollar short it&#39;s not it&#39;s not going to look very good and at this this point, Alan has effectively said this report is going to come in a dollar short. He&#39;s no longer looking at the veracity of claims. So effectively, there could be people legitimately saying things like, hey, this is raising emissions, and that will show up in the report. It is designed entirely to just document money coming in from one side in a global conversation, then money&#39;s flowing in from both sides, make no mistakes. There are people from, you know, there are foreign companies putting money in alberta to say pro-oil industry messages but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but apparently we&#39;re only going to look at the interest groups on the other side putting money in to talk about the other side of the issue it&#39;s just going to document that it&#39;s not going to document whether or not they are correct and um like</span>

            <span class="text">mean, it was exactly what you would want. So it was positive for them. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like this great home run where they can just all go pat themselves on the back. It&#39;s just fine politics as usual. We we talked about last episode. Maybe this might change if it went really badly for them, their view of a fall election, a spring election. I don&#39;t think this would change their view at all. They won pretty handily when you kind of adjust for the fact they&#39;re by-elections. The real losers of this was the NDP. That&#39;s the big problem, or that&#39;s the party facing a big problem right now, not the Liberals.</span>

It&#39;s not just the results, but it&#39;s the idea that they need to be ratified by states. The electors need to get together. You need to support it. So in a truly pedantic sense, you will not have a winner on election night. But beyond that, I think the idea, even if on election night we say, oh, Joe Biden&#39;s got this, I</span>
