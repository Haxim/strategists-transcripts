        <p>In fall 2022, Stephen Carter ran a campaign in Surrey, British Columbia that resulted in a tough loss. He presents his <a href="https://www.patreon.com/file?h=74209743&amp;i=12205829">self-drafted campaign debrief</a> to Zain and Corey, who ask the tough questions and demand the simple answers.  </p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen Carter presents his debrief on the Surrey Mayoral Election to the Board of Directors of The Strategists Media Corporation. What went right? Where did he go wrong? And isn't any month a good month for legumes? Zain Velji and Corey Hogan, as always, perform their fiduciary duties as members of the Executive Committee. </em><em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/file?h=74209743&amp;i=12205829">Download the debrief at StrategistsPatreon.com</a></em></p></blockquote><p>For a real thrill, listen to this one back-to-back with Episode 948 - Carter's debrief of the successful Jyoti Gondek campaign for mayor of Calgary (access the archives requires the $10/month patron level or higher).</p>

So the February through till April 2022 section, where we hadn&#39;t launched, we were just in the pre-components. And this is where I think I made several of the more challenging mistakes. mistakes. So first mistake, and I&#39;ll start with that. I&#39;ll start with mistakes. The first mistake was, I believe that initially coming in, I thought we&#39;re going to do a strong incumbent model. Mayor McCallum was in place. He was going to run. He had name recognition, very similar to Justin Trudeau and John Horgan. So I thought, here we go. It&#39;s going to be a strong incumbent model, but he was polling below 10%. He had such high negatives. I thought for sure this was not going going to be a strong incumbent model. And I think that ultimately that was the first mistake because it ultimately was a strong incumbent model. People moved to the incumbent afterwards at the very, very end. And I probably should have beaten the car out of them in the beginning. The second mistake was to dismiss</div>

I think you guys will probably take me through that a little bit. It forced our hands on the RCMP issue, which ironically we&#39;re going through here in Alberta with the dismissing the RCMP for a provincial police force. Well, the good people of Surrey have gone through it and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it. so far. So, um, keeping the RCMP is, uh, not going to happen, but, uh, it was pretty interesting to see it. Uh, and finally, I think the last mistake was when we decided, um, to wait out, wait until June to announce, um, that was a significant mistake. Um, we should have launched in March. Uh, that&#39;s when I pressed to March to launch, but the candidate is sitting MLA and</div>
