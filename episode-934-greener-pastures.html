            <div class="said">it&#39;s being solidified in history let&#39;s move on on to our next headline. Our next headline comes to us from the Canadian press. Let&#39;s spend some time on this, guys. Ontario calls back legislators as government looks to invoke notwithstanding clause. That is right. Ontario legislators interrupted their summer break to kick off a marathon sitting Thursday as the government prepared to invoke the notwithstanding clause to restore parts of a law that restrict third party election advertising. A judge struck down sections of the law earlier this week, but the progressive conservative government said it would restore them through new legislation that includes the clause which allows legislators to override portions of the charter for five years. Corey, maybe I can start with you on this one. And maybe I can start with you with a broad definition of the notwithstanding clause, if it&#39;s okay to help our listeners understand, as this word and this clause has been thrown around quite a few times, especially in light of, you know, some of Quebec&#39;s legislative priorities over the past couple of years. But do you mind giving folks an understanding or just a one-on-one Coles notes on the notwithstanding clause, and then we&#39;ll jump into the politics here?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">So the notwithstanding clause is one of these things within the Canadian Constitution that serves as a bit of a catch-all. So there&#39;s a couple of catch-alls in the Canadian Constitution. The first one is when we denote all of our freedoms, we say, you know, within limits, It&#39;s justifiable within a free society. More on that, because that&#39;s actually pretty important, too, to this story in a bit. And then there is Section 33, which is commonly known as the Notwithstanding Clause, also sometimes called the Override Clause. But what it does is it allows a parliament or a legislature to have an act that essentially overrides parts of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that provides basic freedoms to people. So either Section 2 or Section 7 to 15. It&#39;s not the whole constitution that can be overridden. It&#39;s just a certain delineation of rights that exists within components of it. And it&#39;s not really used a lot. I think that&#39;s the first thing people need to know. It&#39;s existed since the constitution was brought out in 82.</div>

            <div class="said">well, primarily Quebec. So Quebec used the notwithstanding clause on basically everything for years. There is, well, I think literally everything, and including going back and changing old legislation, as a bit of a protest against the Constitution in the 80s, I think until 86 or so, Carter.

I can&#39;t remember the nature of the case. And it&#39;s been threatened to be used in Ontario. It&#39;s also been used in the Yukon. But generally speaking, it&#39;s not used. it&#39;s not used now uh a couple of years ago when toronto&#39;s um city council was reduced in size very rapidly doug ford threatened to use it when it looked like the courts were about to step in and say you can&#39;t do that but then on appeal the government won and so they didn&#39;t need to and uh at</div>

And I think that when you are going to be putting limits on rights, you should very reasonably ask, is this important? That&#39;s part of where the Oaks test was developed. But let&#39;s be clear, the notwithstanding clause was designed for the other cases when there isn&#39;t actually kind of like a rationale that&#39;s based on, you know, reasonable limits, but it&#39;s going further. And it&#39;s a way that was created in the Constitution to say, the legislatures can override and they can override based on, you know, whatever they see to be the relevant criteria. criteria. So, you know, there&#39;s a school of thought that says it&#39;s part of the Constitution. They&#39;ve decided they want to use it in this case. The public should judge them on whether that&#39;s a good idea or not, and they will pay the political consequences for it. That said, there are an awful lot of laws we have that are kind of, in case of emergency, break glass, and we probably shouldn&#39;t be encouraging, for example, the regular use of the War Measures Act. I think people could agree to that as kind of a general counterbalance here. And I do believe that this is probably Probably creating a lot of dread in people because it seems to be this kind of creeping casualness with the use of the notwithstanding clause.

If we use it for something, to Corey&#39;s point, that may not necessarily require it, but we kind of use it, don&#39;t face the political consequences, as Corey said, one should by using this clause, we then now have a new tool in our quiver that we know we don&#39;t really get hammered on if we use.

And I think that that&#39;s sort of playing out in the media writ large as well, like the big federal news right now is not the big federal news you would have expected otherwise today. So good, good for them. But I think kind of of limited value, that&#39;s kind of a win the day sort of thing, maybe a win the week sort of thing. It&#39;s not a win the election sort of thing. However, the value beyond that is probably the value in knocking the Green Party down a bit and having further turmoil to the Greens. And Stephen said last week, and he was so spot on, that the people who fear the election most are the Greens. And I think that there&#39;s a lot of truth to that, and I think that&#39;s indisputable today. You mentioned that she&#39;s a young MP. Well, she would probably like a career in politics.

There&#39;s been some notable floor crossings that have been designed to hurt the party that they were with.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has sent a cease and desist letter to a Calgary-based news outlet, the Western Standard, because of what his lawyers call, quote, false and defamatory allegations in a recent article. The letter from the lawyer obtained by CBC News concerns an article published Wednesday by the Western Standard alleging that Kenney had had several social gatherings at a restaurant, Edmonton&#39;s Bottega 104, in contravention of the COVID-19 restrictions since the new year.</div>

Second thought was, I&#39;m not going to read that shit because I don&#39;t believe it to be true. And then, of course, it made the rounds on the Twitterverse because it doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s true at this stage. People want to believe that Jason Kenney had a private restaurant set up where he could go into a private room in an Italian restaurant and get whatever food he wanted at whatever time he needed it. I&#39;m not here to judge that story. I mean, I have my own interactions with the Western Standard. I think right now they still have a fundraiser running in my name because I threatened to sue them. So, you know, they don&#39;t necessarily tell the truth. They didn&#39;t tell the truth then. They didn&#39;t tell the truth on their podcast. They didn&#39;t tell the truth before that. So I don&#39;t have a great respect for them. But it doesn&#39;t really matter if they&#39;re telling the truth, right? Because people are so inclined to want to believe this. They are willing to believe just about anything about this particular premier.</div>

And this was a story that was destined to get eyeballs. In fact, any of us who tried to read the story online will have noted how slow that page loaded yesterday. And so, you know, I think we also need to keep in mind that media outlets at the end of the day are businesses, and they&#39;re going to do what&#39;s best for their business interests. But, boy, I don&#39;t know. I mean, Carter, I hear everything you&#39;re saying here, but fundamentally, there was a CBC article about something that was just rooted in bad, you know, kind of bad reporting by the Western Standard, or at least not very well substantiated. at this point we haven&#39;t seen a lot of evidence from them i will say one of the interesting things about the cbc story was when they went to the western standard and they talked about like well premier says you didn&#39;t give him the chance to respond he said oh yes no we did he uh we uh we we gave them the chance to respond and it turned out they emailed the premier&#39;s office something like seven minutes before it went to print i mean</div>

This, to me, feels like it&#39;s something that defines the brand of Jason Kenny as he moves forward. When he passes, people will say, what a prick, he had his own private dining room. And it&#39;s taken on a life of its own outside of the social media. It&#39;s taken on a life of its own outside of just the moment. And it is now becoming like Alison Redford&#39;s plane for her and her daughter. You know, those are stories and language that even if it isn&#39;t true, just haunts the premier.

True or not, what do you think something like this does to caucus morale and caucus spirit, as that&#39;s been something that Kenny&#39;s been trying to heal over the course of the last several weeks here. Like, do you feel like something like this, whether it&#39;s true or not, just really, you know, strikes a nerve within those that are in caucus? And as someone who&#39;s been there and managed caucus as a staffer, chief political staffer, tell me what something like this could do. You&#39;ve dealt with the innuendo phase.

And I think you&#39;ve just got to sort of look at some of the blows and the slings and arrows he&#39;s taken in the past bit. And I said this last week, and I&#39;ll say it again.</div>
