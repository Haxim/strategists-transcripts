No, we&#39;re just going straight to the headlines. And it brings me to my first headline from The Washington Post. This is, of course, a ongoing conversation that Stephen Carter and I have.

So that&#39;s probably coming in no time. Maybe that&#39;s what Jason Kenney&#39;s cooking up for Alberta in some sort of Hail Mary attempt to win back voters here in Alberta. That&#39;s what I&#39;m holding out for. I&#39;m not going to book my second vaccination until that&#39;s brought forward. Well,</span>

That is correct. Representative Louie Gohmert, as you may have seen him in the past as an ardent Trump defender, on Tuesday asked representatives from the U.S. Forest Service If it was possible to alter the orbit of the moon or the earth, either or, guys, whichever one you can do, as a way of combating climate change, though it was unclear if he was actually being serious. Gomer was speaking with Jennifer Ebelrin, Associate Deputy Chief of the National Forest System, during a National Human Resources Committee hearing. Stephen Carter, a novel idea. You are all for novel ideas. In fact, you&#39;d waged your entire political strategy career on novel ideas. Too novel?

            <span class="text">it&#39;s being solidified in history let&#39;s move on on to our next headline. Our next headline comes to us from the Canadian press. Let&#39;s spend some time on this, guys. Ontario calls back legislators as government looks to invoke notwithstanding clause. That is right. Ontario legislators interrupted their summer break to kick off a marathon sitting Thursday as the government prepared to invoke the notwithstanding clause to restore parts of a law that restrict third party election advertising. A judge struck down sections of the law earlier this week, but the progressive conservative government said it would restore them through new legislation that includes the clause which allows legislators to override portions of the charter for five years. Corey, maybe I can start with you on this one. And maybe I can start with you with a broad definition of the notwithstanding clause, if it&#39;s okay to help our listeners understand, as this word and this clause has been thrown around quite a few times, especially in light of, you know, some of Quebec&#39;s legislative priorities over the past couple of years. But do you mind giving folks an understanding or just a one-on-one Coles notes on the notwithstanding clause, and then we&#39;ll jump into the politics here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So the notwithstanding clause is one of these things within the Canadian Constitution that serves as a bit of a catch-all. So there&#39;s a couple of catch-alls in the Canadian Constitution. The first one is when we denote all of our freedoms, we say, you know, within limits, It&#39;s justifiable within a free society. More on that, because that&#39;s actually pretty important, too, to this story in a bit. And then there is Section 33, which is commonly known as the Notwithstanding Clause, also sometimes called the Override Clause. But what it does is it allows a parliament or a legislature to have an act that essentially overrides parts of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that provides basic freedoms to people. So either Section 2 or Section 7 to 15. It&#39;s not the whole constitution that can be overridden. It&#39;s just a certain delineation of rights that exists within components of it. And it&#39;s not really used a lot. I think that&#39;s the first thing people need to know. It&#39;s existed since the constitution was brought out in 82.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, primarily Quebec. So Quebec used the notwithstanding clause on basically everything for years. There is, well, I think literally everything, and including going back and changing old legislation, as a bit of a protest against the Constitution in the 80s, I think until 86 or so, Carter. I&#39;m looking at you, but I don&#39;t know why.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. It has been used in Alberta famously by Ralph Klein when he was opposing same-sex marriage. It was overridden by the courts in that sense because, as I mentioned, you can&#39;t override everything in the Constitution. And you can&#39;t say, I&#39;m in charge of marriage now, because that definition was more of a federal power. And then it was used by Saskatchewan, I think. I can&#39;t remember the nature of the case. And it&#39;s been threatened to be used in Ontario. It&#39;s also been used in the Yukon. But generally speaking, it&#39;s not used. it&#39;s not used now uh a couple of years ago when toronto&#39;s um city council was reduced in size very rapidly doug ford threatened to use it when it looked like the courts were about to step in and say you can&#39;t do that but then on appeal the government won and so they didn&#39;t need to and uh at</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the real version of that or potentially the real version. We&#39;ll see if they actually go through with this in the way they&#39;ve been talking about it. But having lost a court case that would have restricted the ability of... So there was a government law that would have restricted unions&#39; ability to advertise before</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">before an election. Now, the law previously had been six months. You could advertise pretty freely up until the six months before an election. At that point, you were subject to limits. Alberta has a very similar What the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And the court struck that down. Because I don&#39;t know how deep you want me to go into this. I suspect not this deep. But ultimately, the courts have determined since the 80s, when you&#39;re going to use kind of that first clause that you can limit fundamental freedoms within kind of, you know, a justifiable band, they apply what&#39;s called the Oaks test. they go through and they basically say there&#39;s four criteria but or more i don&#39;t i don&#39;t but there&#39;s four people talk about but the one that is is kind of germane here is if</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, thank you for that. And I&#39;ll come to you on your analysis for why this is a story. But Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with that question for you, which is when, you know, and maybe I&#39;ll speak for myself. When I hear notwithstanding clause, I hear Ontario just, you know, and I hear this, it just eyes glaze over. Why is this a political story? Why is this a big deal that we should pay pay attention to well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">because canadians are granted certain rights and freedoms in the charter of rights and freedoms and when we as individual provinces uh skirt around those um you know it erodes the freedoms for for all uh canadians and in this particular case um it may just seem like well it&#39;s just an election law it&#39;s not a big deal it&#39;s just it&#39;s just controlling uh the amount of spending except this is the second time that ontario has threatened to bring in the notwithstanding law around elections um it was the first was the the toronto election didn&#39;t bring it in because there was a stay granted by the by the courts but nonetheless the um the idea that the notwithstanding clause can be used to in some fashion control or the outcome or the processes of elections um personally i&#39;m not a big fan of i&#39;m not a big fan of the of the notwithstanding law being used to um you know prevent same-sex marriages i&#39;m not a big fan of of the notwithstanding law being able to skirt around human rights violations by various provinces. I&#39;m just not a big fan of it being used at all, because it strikes me that if we all agree that there&#39;s a set of fundamental rights and freedoms that we should have, then it&#39;s not up to our political masters to say, well, except in this particular case, notwithstanding this particular set of circumstances.</span>

            <span class="text">I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea. Yeah, I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea in this particular case. I continue to, I mean, there are people who just want to put more and more rules and more and more regulations into our elections to try and control third-party spending. Every regulation that we put in is an invitation for more ways to find ways around the rules and regulations. I don&#39;t recall third-party spending being a huge problem prior</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">prior to us actually bringing in all the third-party regulations. We look at the problems that exist in the United States, we imagine them happening up here, and then we try and stop them. And a 12-month prohibition on spending or on keeping it to $600,000 over 12 months, that&#39;s $50,000. In a province the size of Ontario, it&#39;s a blip. $50,000 a month, it&#39;s just an absolute blip. So I&#39;m extremely disappointed by this. They&#39;re supposed to be for freedom of speech. They&#39;re supposed to be for more freedom, and they&#39;re bringing in the notwithstanding clause to curtail those rights and freedoms.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for them to do it. And I think that when you are going to be putting limits on rights, you should very reasonably ask, is this important? That&#39;s part of where the Oaks test was developed. But let&#39;s be clear, the notwithstanding clause was designed for the other cases when there isn&#39;t actually kind of like a rationale that&#39;s based on, you know, reasonable limits, but it&#39;s going further. And it&#39;s a way that was created in the Constitution to say, the legislatures can override and they can override based on, you know, whatever they see to be the relevant criteria. criteria. So, you know, there&#39;s a school of thought that says it&#39;s part of the Constitution. They&#39;ve decided they want to use it in this case. The public should judge them on whether that&#39;s a good idea or not, and they will pay the political consequences for it. That said, there are an awful lot of laws we have that are kind of, in case of emergency, break glass, and we probably shouldn&#39;t be encouraging, for example, the regular use of the War Measures Act. I think people could agree to that as kind of a general counterbalance here. And I do believe that this is probably Probably creating a lot of dread in people because it seems to be this kind of creeping casualness with the use of the notwithstanding clause. Or perhaps by floating it and using it in provinces, it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it is making people kind of numb to the political consequences that are supposed to come with using the notwithstanding clause. Part of the reason why it expires in five years is it basically guarantees if there&#39;s a change in government, they will then have to actively reintroduce it and they can&#39;t just coast on it with the last guys.

            <span class="text">That is an important point here. Because the one area I didn&#39;t talk about in the Notwithstanding Clause was Quebec&#39;s use since the 80s, right? And it&#39;s been used in language laws, sure. But most recently, it&#39;s been used for more than that. And infamously, a couple of years ago, preventing people of wearing religious symbols if they&#39;re in positions of authority, right? And that, or in the public service. And that, I think, is part of the story here, right? People are saying, holy shit, are we just going to use it for everything now?

And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll use a side door to talking about it, which is, do you feel like the forward political strategy here is to desensitize people to the notwithstanding clause? Quebec&#39;s used it a bunch of times on a bunch of issues for them. If we use it for something, to Corey&#39;s point, that may not necessarily require it, but we kind of use it, don&#39;t face the political consequences, as Corey said, one should by using this clause, we then now have a new tool in our quiver that we know we don&#39;t really get hammered on if we use. Do you feel like that could be the political strategy here? Am I reading the tea leaves correctly, or would you say otherwise? I</span>

And, you know, the rights that can be overridden with the notwithstanding clause are, I mean, they&#39;re broad. They&#39;re your fundamental freedoms, as described in there. They&#39;re your freedom of thought, freedom of opinion, freedom of expression, freedom of press, freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of association. And then they are your legal rights. rights, the idea that you can have a trial and be presumed innocent, right? And so on and so forth.

            <span class="text">jennica atwin uh announced Thursday, she has left the Green Party to join the Liberal caucus, mainly because of ongoing internal rifts among the Greens over the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found that quite interesting. You know, Atwin made history in 2019 when she was the first Green MP elected east of British Columbia, but she&#39;s been openly challenged and challenging Green Party leader Annamie Paul&#39;s position on the Israel-Palestine conflict. She&#39;s ultimately said that I stand with Palestine and condemned the unthinkable airstrikes in Gaza and apartheid. Unquote. Three days later, Paul&#39;s senior advisor, Noah Zatzman, expressed solidarity with Zionists in a Facebook post that accused some unnamed Green MPs of anti-Semitism and discrimination. Guys, let&#39;s start with the politics first and foremost here. Carter, how big of a win is this for the liberals?</span>

            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s, you know what, it&#39;s a good tactic in the sense that there was this report on the WE scandal that came out the same day. And boom, just like that, all of a sudden, we&#39;re talking about, you know, like we&#39;re leading this show right now, not talking about this report, we&#39;re talking about a floor crossing to the liberals. And I think that that&#39;s sort of playing out in the media writ large as well, like the big federal news right now is not the big federal news you would have expected otherwise today. So good, good for them. But I think kind of of limited value, that&#39;s kind of a win the day sort of thing, maybe a win the week sort of thing. It&#39;s not a win the election sort of thing. However, the value beyond that is probably the value in knocking the Green Party down a bit and having further turmoil to the Greens. And Stephen said last week, and he was so spot on, that the people who fear the election most are the Greens. And I think that there&#39;s a lot of truth to that, and I think that&#39;s indisputable today. You mentioned that she&#39;s a young MP. Well, she would probably like a career in politics.

            <span class="text">I think there&#39;s a couple of motivations to cross the floor. The first is political survival. I wish to stay elected is generally speaking the number one reason why a person crosses the floor. And the second reason, and it shouldn&#39;t be necessarily discounted in this particular case, is fuck your buddy. There&#39;s been some notable floor crossings that have been designed to hurt the party that they were with. I think of Dave Taylor crossing to the Alberta party here in Alberta years ago where that was kind of a fuck your buddy type of activity. I think that this one is a little bit of both.</span>

And the reason I ask that as a lead in is how something like this transpires, right? Right. Because there must have been several conversations, perhaps several Zoom meetings, text chains kind of putting this together. Is it MP to MP? Is it Stafford to MP? Does it vary? Give us a sense of like, you know, how some of these things may transpire in the background to an announcement today that seemed well-timed and orchestrated by the Liberals with a fundraising email, a social media post, you know, an exclusive with the Canadian press. Like, tell me how, you know, some of the options, I should say, because we can&#39;t know exactly how this one transpired. but how these things kind of work in the background and the lead up to it as well.</span>

There are situations where you send groups of MPs from various stripes off to go to various events where they&#39;ll be talking to each other. Maybe they&#39;ll be going perhaps to represent Canada at some sort of parliamentary junket in Germany or something like that. I mean, obviously that&#39;s not happened in the past year.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has sent a cease and desist letter to a Calgary-based news outlet, the Western Standard, because of what his lawyers call, quote, false and defamatory allegations in a recent article. The letter from the lawyer obtained by CBC News concerns an article published Wednesday by the Western Standard alleging that Kenney had had several social gatherings at a restaurant, Edmonton&#39;s Bottega 104, in contravention of the COVID-19 restrictions since the new year.</span>

            <span class="text">Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on this one. When you first saw this article, and by the way, I should add that the Western Standard stands by its story. They are saying, nope, we&#39;ve got sources, we&#39;ve got people, et cetera, to back this up. The Western Standard has had a checkered past as a, you know, a</span>

Second thought was, I&#39;m not going to read that shit because I don&#39;t believe it to be true. And then, of course, it made the rounds on the Twitterverse because it doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s true at this stage. People want to believe that Jason Kenney had a private restaurant set up where he could go into a private room in an Italian restaurant and get whatever food he wanted at whatever time he needed it. I&#39;m not here to judge that story. I mean, I have my own interactions with the Western Standard. I think right now they still have a fundraiser running in my name because I threatened to sue them. So, you know, they don&#39;t necessarily tell the truth. They didn&#39;t tell the truth then. They didn&#39;t tell the truth on their podcast. They didn&#39;t tell the truth before that. So I don&#39;t have a great respect for them. But it doesn&#39;t really matter if they&#39;re telling the truth, right? Because people are so inclined to want to believe this. They are willing to believe just about anything about this particular premier.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, absolutely. But I think it&#39;s simpler than that. I think the Western Standard is getting a lot of hits from when they report on the chaos in the UCP. And this was a story that was destined to get eyeballs. In fact, any of us who tried to read the story online will have noted how slow that page loaded yesterday. And so, you know, I think we also need to keep in mind that media outlets at the end of the day are businesses, and they&#39;re going to do what&#39;s best for their business interests. But, boy, I don&#39;t know. I mean, Carter, I hear everything you&#39;re saying here, but fundamentally, there was a CBC article about something that was just rooted in bad, you know, kind of bad reporting by the Western Standard, or at least not very well substantiated. at this point we haven&#39;t seen a lot of evidence from them i will say one of the interesting things about the cbc story was when they went to the western standard and they talked about like well premier says you didn&#39;t give him the chance to respond he said oh yes no we did he uh we uh we we gave them the chance to respond and it turned out they emailed the premier&#39;s office something like seven minutes before it went to print i mean</span>

Like, talk to me about the parallels in history here. Like, in our ongoing segment that&#39;s been going on for the last six months, the unbecoming or the dethroning of a premier, like, tell me about this chapter of rumor and innuendo and gossip now kind of floating everywhere alongside discontent and caucus fracture.

This, to me, feels like it&#39;s something that defines the brand of Jason Kenny as he moves forward. When he passes, people will say, what a prick, he had his own private dining room. And it&#39;s taken on a life of its own outside of the social media. It&#39;s taken on a life of its own outside of just the moment. And it is now becoming like Alison Redford&#39;s plane for her and her daughter. You know, those are stories and language that even if it isn&#39;t true, just haunts the premier.

True or not, what do you think something like this does to caucus morale and caucus spirit, as that&#39;s been something that Kenny&#39;s been trying to heal over the course of the last several weeks here. Like, do you feel like something like this, whether it&#39;s true or not, just really, you know, strikes a nerve within those that are in caucus? And as someone who&#39;s been there and managed caucus as a staffer, chief political staffer, tell me what something like this could do. You&#39;ve dealt with the innuendo phase.

One is that it could be just kind of further frustration and demoralization if there&#39;s any kind of suggestion it&#39;s real. But I actually think the more likely at this point is if it is not real, it&#39;s a great opportunity for Jason Kenney to kind of point to the barrage of bullshit that he&#39;s under and make himself a bit of the victim. And I think you&#39;ve just got to sort of look at some of the blows and the slings and arrows he&#39;s taken in the past bit. And I said this last week, and I&#39;ll say it again.</span>
