I think she told us where she launched about seven to nine times in the speech. St. Albans Boys and Girls Club, she launches in Toronto.

            <span class="text">look, I&#39;ll tell you. So I wasn&#39;t going to watch it live. I was intending to watch it a little bit later in the day. I wanted to get on top of it to deal with any questions you might take. In fact, I was about to pitch to you all that we just record tomorrow, right? Because I just didn&#39;t think there was enough going on to warrant</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">What were they freaking out about? I&#39;m curious. Tell me the story and then tell me what do you think they were freaking out about?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then my phone starts ringing</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">with people who are not millennials who are saying, oh my God, are you watching this? You got to turn this on. And I thought, well, fuck, I guess I got to turn this on. And what they&#39;re freaking out about is the uh the official feed of the um of the campaign was pretty dodgy but whatever there&#39;s a cbc feed that was looking cpac and others yeah yeah yeah and then the protests started right and so like i&#39;m watching like kind of escalating chaos and at first i&#39;m like oh whatever it&#39;s just you know those things don&#39;t matter when it was just about like the the quality of the audio on the official feed but then it started to matter a lot because it&#39;s it was protests and then more protests and more protests and by the time i tuned in i&#39;d already missed like three waves of protesting and i still caught two waves and just when i thought they were done and they&#39;d settled into a speech no no more there&#39;s more and there&#39;s pounding on the walls and there&#39;s all sorts of stuff and just watching it was just giving me this sense of like well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well here&#39;s the problem with something like that there&#39;s not very many people who are going to watch in the middle middle of the day, a political speech like that, the people who are watching are the severely engaged, the organizer class, the kind of people that you actually need to go and do the next couple of steps for you in a leadership contest. And there is no way anybody watching that, no matter how they felt about how Chrystia Freeland handled it, and, you know, mixed reviews, I would say, not as good as I think that she thought she was doing in the moment. But there&#39;s no way you&#39;re watching that and you&#39;re thinking, oh, this is good. This is a good sign. This is exactly what I want for the Liberal Party. And that&#39;s going to be the top line and the bottom line. Like, one of the things that I&#39;m curious to hear in a minute here is Carter watched it after, after hearing from you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you and me about everything that was going on. And I watch it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">different. I was just listening to it. And in my experience, I&#39;ll just quickly interject for two seconds before you, because it&#39;s also kind of unique, was I&#39;m listening to this in the car and I&#39;m like telling my wife, I&#39;m like, why is she not fucking saying anything? Like, is the audio dead? And then I realized she&#39;s just taking a break for protesters to get something out of their system. And it was so strange, just like having the audio on of this speech. So you and I watched slash listened to it simultaneously, but you were talking about Carter, who had a little bit of a delayed effect on this as well.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, and my big challenge was, because it&#39;s in the moment and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, and there&#39;s almost that adrenaline and almost on guard feeling you have even as an observer saying, what the fuck&#39;s going to happen next? My ability to hear every word after the first 30 minutes of chaos was fucking zero. And I&#39;m sure it was for everybody else who was watching it too. And while I could clock on style points, and while I&#39;ve gone back through and I&#39;ve watched it again since, or at least portions of it since, I could tell you what she said. In the moment, my ability to process what she was saying did not exist. All I could think was, Chicago, 1968, chaos, people who think Canada&#39;s broken watching this will say, yeah, there you fucking go. Canada&#39;s broken. Like, we&#39;re not talking one moment of protest. We&#39;re talking rolling protests over a bit here. It was about as bad of an image as the Liberal Party could possibly have. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean it was as bad of an image as Chrystia Freeland could possibly have, but it was about as bad as the Liberal Party could have, if you think about the kind of image they want to present going into the next election.

You can tell us if you want, but that obviously makes a little bit of sense. But I got to tell you,</span>

And especially if you&#39;re Chrystia Freeland, and doing the things that Chrystia Freeland&#39;s done over the past several years, she has been the staunchest advocate of Ukraine, arguably in the Western world, right? I mean, you can make arguments for other people, I will certainly entertain them. But there has been no, no weakness from her on that particular killer matter she is one of russia&#39;s top foreign enemies in terms of government she is one of donald trump&#39;s least favorite people and i think that security should have been a massive consideration for the freeland campaign and i am in some ways the thing i&#39;m most floored about</span>

And Stephen&#39;s point is such a very, very essential one when you&#39;re talking about hecklers in a political context, right? She doesn&#39;t need to be right in that moment.

And when you look at the length of the speech, that plus another comment you made about the applause lines, which either could have been put into place as a strategy or could have been a symptom of the situation.

They&#39;re all coming in a beat too late. They&#39;re all stepping on candidate lines. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s excruciating to watch. part of it is because these lines are not spontaneous real applause lines they are the political this is when i want you to applaud i hope you can figure that out applause lines and it just speaks to the fact that we just clap too much like politics is the only business in the world where you get a standing ovation before you say a fucking word right like that&#39;s just how these things work but um yeah certainly christia freeland tried to make way too many things applause lines. And as a result, it did sort of break the flow. And when I was already not able to process things because of the fear of protesters, it was just another thing that affected my ability to absorb the content. But the content, Zane, to get back to the content, now we&#39;re at the 37 mark, right?</span>

Fight, fight, fight. Fight, fight, fight. And we&#39;re going to get this thing done. And that&#39;s fine. And that&#39;s good. But that&#39;s also part of the problem. I think with the protests at the launch, it made her feel like she needed to be extra tough about them, which is probably why she kept going back to the well and continuing on those lines.</span>

You&#39;re introducing yourself. But I will say both Carney and her in some ways treated this like it was the start of a general election.

On the old strategist discord, Jeremy Farkas was asking if this was perhaps like the reality of launches at this point. And I kind of wonder if it is, because now I see a lot of potential.

This is the reaction of somebody watching live. I believe that a lot of the audience was designed to be watching live, right?</span>

It certainly goes through all of her little lines and, you know, the specific things that her and her team have worked on to say specifically the way they want. That&#39;s all good. It&#39;s all working. But, yeah, I mean, if you were watching it live, you probably don&#39;t think great about her or the fortunes of the Liberal Party. or</span>

Because I think that she will do well with being presented to Canadians. And yes, you can make the argument, you become prime minister, everyone&#39;s going to get to know you.
