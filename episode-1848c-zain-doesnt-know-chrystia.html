        <div class="desc"><p>To avoid unending streams of protesters, The Strategists is recorded in an undisclosed location. We are, however, recorded in front of a human wall.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about a day of leadership launches, with a focus on a chaotic Chrystia Freeland campaign launch event. Does this highlight the need for every campaign to take security more seriously? What are politicians supposed to do when protested or heckled? And how are Liberal audiences so unable to applaud at the right time? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And what they&#39;re freaking out about is the uh the official feed of the um of the campaign was pretty dodgy but whatever there&#39;s a cbc feed that was looking cpac and others yeah yeah yeah and then the protests started right and so like i&#39;m watching like kind of escalating chaos and at first i&#39;m like oh whatever it&#39;s just you know those things don&#39;t matter when it was just about like the the quality of the audio on the official feed but then it started to matter a lot because it&#39;s it was protests and then more protests and more protests and by the time i tuned in i&#39;d already missed like three waves of protesting and i still caught two waves and just when i thought they were done and they&#39;d settled into a speech no no more there&#39;s more and there&#39;s pounding on the walls and there&#39;s all sorts of stuff and just watching it was just giving me this sense of like well</div>

          <div class="said">well here&#39;s the problem with something like that there&#39;s not very many people who are going to watch in the middle middle of the day, a political speech like that, the people who are watching are the severely engaged, the organizer class, the kind of people that you actually need to go and do the next couple of steps for you in a leadership contest. And there is no way anybody watching that, no matter how they felt about how Chrystia Freeland handled it, and, you know, mixed reviews, I would say, not as good as I think that she thought she was doing in the moment. But there&#39;s no way you&#39;re watching that and you&#39;re thinking, oh, this is good. This is a good sign. This is exactly what I want for the Liberal Party. And that&#39;s going to be the top line and the bottom line. Like, one of the things that I&#39;m curious to hear in a minute here is Carter watched it after, after hearing from you</div>

          <div class="said">different. I was just listening to it. And in my experience, I&#39;ll just quickly interject for two seconds before you, because it&#39;s also kind of unique, was I&#39;m listening to this in the car and I&#39;m like telling my wife, I&#39;m like, why is she not fucking saying anything? Like, is the audio dead? And then I realized she&#39;s just taking a break for protesters to get something out of their system. And it was so strange, just like having the audio on of this speech. So you and I watched slash listened to it simultaneously, but you were talking about Carter, who had a little bit of a delayed effect on this as well.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, well, and my big challenge was, because it&#39;s in the moment and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, and there&#39;s almost that adrenaline and almost on guard feeling you have even as an observer saying, what the fuck&#39;s going to happen next? My ability to hear every word after the first 30 minutes of chaos was fucking zero. And I&#39;m sure it was for everybody else who was watching it too. And while I could clock on style points, and while I&#39;ve gone back through and I&#39;ve watched it again since, or at least portions of it since, I could tell you what she said. In the moment, my ability to process what she was saying did not exist. All I could think was, Chicago, 1968, chaos, people who think Canada&#39;s broken watching this will say, yeah, there you fucking go. Canada&#39;s broken. Like, we&#39;re not talking one moment of protest. We&#39;re talking rolling protests over a bit here. It was about as bad of an image as the Liberal Party could possibly have. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean it was as bad of an image as Chrystia Freeland could possibly have, but it was about as bad as the Liberal Party could have, if you think about the kind of image they want to present going into the next election.

And especially if you&#39;re Chrystia Freeland, and doing the things that Chrystia Freeland&#39;s done over the past several years, she has been the staunchest advocate of Ukraine, arguably in the Western world, right? I mean, you can make arguments for other people, I will certainly entertain them. But there has been no, no weakness from her on that particular killer matter she is one of russia&#39;s top foreign enemies in terms of government she is one of donald trump&#39;s least favorite people and i think that security should have been a massive consideration for the freeland campaign and i am in some ways the thing i&#39;m most floored about</div>

And Stephen&#39;s point is such a very, very essential one when you&#39;re talking about hecklers in a political context, right? She doesn&#39;t need to be right in that moment.

We should all do something. She didn&#39;t actually show that level of, like, I&#39;m going to navigate this. it was like, this is what I have in front of me, and I&#39;m going to try my best to get through it.

They&#39;re all coming in a beat too late. They&#39;re all stepping on candidate lines. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s excruciating to watch. part of it is because these lines are not spontaneous real applause lines they are the political this is when i want you to applaud i hope you can figure that out applause lines and it just speaks to the fact that we just clap too much like politics is the only business in the world where you get a standing ovation before you say a fucking word right like that&#39;s just how these things work but um yeah certainly christia freeland tried to make way too many things applause lines. And as a result, it did sort of break the flow.

You&#39;re introducing yourself. But I will say both Carney and her in some ways treated this like it was the start of a general election.

          <div class="said">that i started saying i i just want to turn back to is that i suspect that in some ways her audience was that organizer class trying to convince that the you know the more active liberals and the pundits and everybody who&#39;s going to watch it live that she&#39;s the person who can take the fight to donald trump and that seemed to be the general construction of things i i believe at least from a distance i don&#39;t know it&#39;s hard to read these things always what&#39;s going on in people&#39;s minds and the real shame for her is that that anybody watching it live is going to have to get through a lot in order to hear that message and feel those things and it&#39;s funny because i don&#39;t generally believe launches matter very much said as much on part b of uh 1848 here right i&#39;ll say it again said</div>

But the Freeland launch has me now thinking they&#39;re also high risk. And this is not 100% my point. On the old strategist discord, Jeremy Farkas was asking if this was perhaps like the reality of launches at this point. And I kind of wonder if it is, because now I see a lot of potential. Like, here&#39;s the question I now have for the two of you.</div>

This is the reaction of somebody watching live. I believe that a lot of the audience was designed to be watching live, right?</div>
