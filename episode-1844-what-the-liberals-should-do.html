This is, of course, after he was distracted with Panama and Greenland, he comes back to Canada talking about how the bounty of it would be amazing of joining the United States, how he talks about Wayne Gretzky, who met with him over the course of this past week in discussions with Donald Trump and how he&#39;d be a great leader for the country. Trump seems to be obsessed with Canada. Trump seems to be trolling Canada. Canada. But, Corey, there seems to be something interesting happening.</span>

            <span class="text">for having a true, full, contested leadership race. Now, I may have just missed this, but in your mind, was there a threat that we would just go to anointing someone and moving on here if Justin Trudeau were to leave? And let&#39;s talk about that threat a bit in terms of what it would look like today, right? And call me naive and call me dumb. Use me as a punching bag for not picking up on this in previous episodes. But talk about what that threat posits and what that might look like and why we&#39;re seeing these calls for a true leadership race being put on the table so aggressively.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, let&#39;s just say there&#39;s a spectrum of possibilities here, right? And rarely do these things play out and they&#39;re such like a bald, like it&#39;s kind of like democracy writ large, right? People don&#39;t say, I want to end democracy. People say, well, because of these exigent circumstances, we need to take shortcuts and we need to do things in this way. And yeah, we&#39;re still going to have a vote in many cases, but that vote is no longer free or fair.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;ve said this 100 times, will have a massive effect on what the result is. And it would be pretty easy for the Liberal Party caucus and for the Liberal Party executive, and even for the PMO, frankly, and the outgoing prime minister, to set the scales in such a way that the outcome comes to their satisfaction and maybe not democracy satisfaction, shall we say that? So let&#39;s just throw a couple of options out on the spectrum here. One is, I think, about as as close as you&#39;re going to get to the no leadership contest, which is, we decide that caucus is going to choose, maybe caucus narrows it down to two, like they do in the UK Tories, and then there&#39;s a quick vote of the leadership or of the membership, and boom, you&#39;re off to the races. I think that&#39;s about as undemocratic as you&#39;re possibly going to get.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">be clear, it seems like at this current moment, that is very much a Christa Freeland conversation. If you&#39;re supposed to insert a name there, it seems like Freeland&#39;s a person that, at least Butts in his piece, is not going after, but highlighting.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s like one end of the spectrum. Along the spectrum, it could be caucus chooses it, a vote only of existing members, a snap vote done in a couple of weeks. Oh my goodness, we&#39;ve got no time for an actual contest. And then all the way on the other end of the spectrum, miles down the road i think a pretty unrealistic place frankly with everything going on is the liberals do leadership contests like they usually do full-on full</span>

And I think what&#39;s opened up that argument is, I was very quick to say, what the liberals would do if everything was in normal times is not possible. Everybody knows that.

It&#39;s certainly possible. There are mechanisms that allow people to come and do that. But that is what people are now talking about. And what I think is so interesting about the Butts column, not just that it&#39;s hard not to read it as a soft confirmation Trudeau&#39;s leaving. Yes.

It&#39;s like, when this happens, how are we going to organize things? What do we need to consider? Makes a strong case that there needs to be a real contest, avoid a Harris-style coronation. As he puts it, it&#39;s a good line, right? If you want to see if someone&#39;s good at hockey, play a hockey game. If you want to see if someone&#39;s good at politics, get them out in the political arena. you know so so that&#39;s where we&#39;re sitting right now and i&#39;ve probably gone on long enough so i&#39;ll let carter carter reacted so far as uh he&#39;s</span>

Keep in mind, last week, there was articles about, you know, it&#39;s hard, it&#39;s easy to get lost in the Christmas break but there were articles about well you know freeland did this let&#39;s make let&#39;s make this her problem now or let&#39;s give her the opportunity to run this um there will be just as many pieces occurring in the next three days that argue both sides of this issue um so you know the fact that jerry and george are out at the same time making essentially the same points um you know with fewer were adjectives in one of them, is to me just, you know, proof that there is a real threat to this.

            <span class="text">in some ways detailed off of what was going on in France with more open primaries certainly the American influence that was there but it was this idea that you get people in the door not as members but as supporters because people feeling a little funny about party membership they&#39;re not necessarily convinced that they want to be party members and if you looked at the broad trend going from like the 1960s to the 2010s, percent</span>

            <span class="text">percent of Canadians that had party membership was declining. It was declining and it was making... Because we talk about these parties as though they&#39;re private clubs, but one of the things that we often skip past is that a lot more people used to be members of these private clubs. A lot of people used to have memberships in political parties, in part because there was this system, this feeder system you&#39;ll be very familiar with, Stephen, certainly I am too, where you would have the person on your block who was known as the liberal or the the conservative and would sell you the memberships and every time something was coming up they would get you and they pull you into that so my observation at the time not just i mean i wasn&#39;t the only one involved there was a whole team of people that was</span>

            <span class="text">they were part of driving this force too. And so looking at this, looking at the trend, looking at that, yes, it was harder in Alberta to get people to join as liberals in particular, but there were people who were receptive as supporters. And knowing that modern politics had gone away from big donors to small donors, like this was a trend we&#39;d observed, we knew that lists were really important. And one of the ways we thought we would fix this is by creating this new level between just somebody who vaguely supports and someone who&#39;s a member, which is a registered supporter, where that email address, where that home address, where that communication exists with somebody who, you know, has not taken the commitment of purchasing a party membership. Now, in Alberta, we didn&#39;t charge you to be a registered supporter the federal liberals instituted something of a poll tax i think it was five or ten dollars so there was still money that had to come from you during that last contest with justin trudeau but liberals did this it was like a water hose we had tens of thousands of people joining the liberal party in in alberta and bob ray was looking at this and he was interim leader of the liberals at the time federally</span>

Ray was interim leader. There was going to be a leadership contest. That&#39;s the one Trudeau ultimately won, right? So we&#39;re in Ottawa. We&#39;re having these conversations. Obviously, the Alberta contingent has big opinions and big feelings about this. There are people in Alberta who really don&#39;t like the system in part because they didn&#39;t like the leader that was chosen,</span>

            <span class="text">we are the central convening place of Canadians in politics, you know, we&#39;re not too far left, not too far right, then a system that just pushes you towards the middle because there&#39;s such generalist support, maybe not such a bad one. Now, I&#39;ll close by saying we&#39;ve seen some of the hazards of big generalist systems. certainly as a podcast, we&#39;ve talked a lot about the risks of those. I&#39;ve become much more of the opinion that political parties need to be even more like private clubs than they were in 2010 before the supporter system. But that is the journey we&#39;ve been on. And this is the system the liberals have, which basically says, you can register as a supporter of the liberals, you&#39;ll probably have to pay a poll tax, but that gets set by the executive, I believe, unless they&#39;ve changed the rules in the intervening time. And then you get to vote in this leadership contest. It is a point based system. I think that it&#39;s 100 points per writing is the cap. So if you have 30 members, there&#39;s 30 points. If you have 3000, there&#39;s 100 points. If you have 100, there&#39;s 100 points. But that&#39;s that&#39;s what they would normally do at this particular moment.

That&#39;s what I would be putting in place. And that&#39;s why I&#39;d be selling memberships. That&#39;s, you know, all those people who are like, I don&#39;t know if I want to be a member. Good. Fuck off. Don&#39;t be a member. We don&#39;t want you. We want the people who want to be a member, who want to be a part of building this party as quickly as it needs to be built.</span>

I don&#39;t think that the people who are going to be registered supporters are going to be fundamentally a different group than the people who would be members. It&#39;s going to be the people in the door and the people who are keyed in enough that they would probably have bought a membership anyhow, plus or minus a few. And I also think it&#39;s going to, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be a 51-49 election where the membership, if</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so that&#39;s what I ultimately believe is going to occur. The liberals should look at the system. I think the liberals need to reflect on whether it&#39;s the right system armed with everything we&#39;ve learned over the past decade. But also it&#39;s funny. They&#39;ve never actually run the system in a sense because Trudeau – Fucking cleaned up. That was always a bit of a coronation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it&#39;s tough to say with 100% certainty.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So here&#39;s, Corey makes a good point, and so do you, Carter, but I&#39;m going to come to you, Carter, with this particular question, which is, if this is a leadership race of the most engaged, what concern, anxiety, or straight-up opportunity do you feel like there is for special interest groups, groups that have been active in advocating in the thousands or in the hundreds of thousands, depending on their cause? Let me throw one. Pro-Palestine groups, environmental, labor. These are just a few examples. I&#39;m not adding any connotation to any of them, despite my support for all three. But what do you think of these groups that are already pretty much mobilized? Do you feel like a membership model prevents them or clips their wings a bit? Or do you feel like the supporter model is the right thing to do because lists matter in a 2024 environment even more than what Corey would suggest it did back in the early 2000s?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I would probably not be overly excited about having well-organized groups of people come in at this particular moment to choose the leader of the Liberal Party. that&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;d like to see a membership you</span>

            <span class="text">know if there&#39;s a membership fee you know anybody who pays for their own fee is welcome within the party but a lot of these organizations have in the past engaged in multiple membership purchases where they&#39;re buying memberships for their members that type of skullduggery I think would be a problem in this short time frame so if we&#39;re going to see a real leadership race. I think the leadership race should be focused on one</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I guess the other way to ask this question is, how are you thinking about special interest groups in this election if you are part of the Liberal Party? Are you looking at them as pure opportunity, get them on the list, or are they always going to be their own thing trying to co-opt your political enterprise? Give me your sense on this.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So in defense of the supporter system, it was created in part because of special interest Right. If the membership of parties is declining broadly, they are much more susceptible to takeover when all of a sudden you&#39;ve got 10,000 members and an interest group can just come together and say, oh, we&#39;re going to do this. Right. We&#39;re going to take this over. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And I believe we&#39;ve seen lots of evidence that those interest groups will still buy memberships regardless of the system. And, you know, the EB example was just thrown out. It&#39;s a super one. I think you could look at Alberta&#39;s most recent leadership race for the UCP. It happens. Right. Right. And so the idea of a broad based system, as much as anything, was defensive. It&#39;s if you want to reflect the whole of the country, don&#39;t rely on a smaller and smaller special interest driven group. Right. But the other solution and one I think I&#39;m more fond of now is actually going further than what Stephen said there. So I would say, hey, you can be a voter in this particular contest if you&#39;re an existing member and or you can show that you&#39;ve bought or don&#39;t. you know uh bought</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">bought a membership in two of the last five years donated in two of the last five years volunteered in two of the last five years maybe something for youth for hey you just turned 14 because that&#39;s the other thing you can vote in these contests at 14 it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">18 right so hey if you&#39;re between 14 and 16 here&#39;s two other ways you can do it i would still make it show that you are somehow committed to this organization just so you don&#39;t drive a gold rush down to you know, adolescents and teenagers. But the idea would be, no, show me you&#39;re actually a member of the party, not that you&#39;re willing to buy a party membership on behalf of an interest group. So that&#39;s another option you have here. It&#39;s a different solution to the same problem we&#39;d identified back in the day. And it&#39;s one that I think I&#39;ve become much more convinced is the better one, frankly, because it&#39;s so easy to game these systems. Let</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let me leave it on this, Carter. I&#39;ve got one final sort of question after this, But let me leave it on the rule side with this question, which is any long-tail considerations for the liberals in terms of going with the closed system when they were known as the open party, going with short and less democratic when they&#39;re known for being the brokering, more democratic, any sort of long-tail considerations? And I know those are more brand-related that I&#39;ve given you as examples, but any long-tail considerations for the Liberals as they jump into this, what now seems to be more likely than ever, a leadership race of some sort? And, Corey, same question to you before we end it off.</span>

And I think if she did something like that, she would probably lock up the majority of caucus in very short order. And it would end up being a coronation, even if it&#39;s structured in a way that&#39;s not. And so for me, one of the questions is, does anybody really want to fight for it right now? You asked me the question, so I&#39;ll broaden it to that point. And if the answer is not really except for Freeland, and Freeland&#39;s willing to make some conditions on it, like, we know we need a leader. I&#39;m an obvious choice. We&#39;ll get through this, and then we&#39;ll figure out where it is. Some of the logic we&#39;ve said earlier, I think that that would be an interesting thing to observe.

So I&#39;m not convinced that anybody is going to seriously put this forward simply because they&#39;re in such a deep hole. Carter&#39;s comment about like two weak parties together. People in the parties know that too. too. But if you are the Liberals, and if you are a member of the Liberal Party who actually is probably okay with the idea that, you know, United Front is a long-term solution, and let&#39;s be really frank, there are a lot of Liberals who feel that way. There&#39;s a lot of Liberals going back even to Chrétien&#39;s day who thought they should push for a merger of the NDP when the Liberals were the majority because they couldn&#39;t keep fighting this leftward-flank-rightward-flank thing forever. The tea leaves were moving in different directions, and the Liberal Party would would eventually be squeezed out. If you believe that, you might be saying, hmm, huh, interesting here.

But you have to say, look, I&#39;m doing this because the party needs strong leadership in these areas, because I can be a conduit for ideas from people like you. But I think we all need to acknowledge that hill that we&#39;ve got to climb here. And victory in this sense is there is a liberal party still after this election. And I&#39;m going to do my best. And I hope we can surprise people. But let&#39;s be realists here. That&#39;s always been a strength of this party, realism. And I do think you could actually couple that with a couple of things that give you optionality too. Like one of the things I think if I were a leadership contestant in the liberals, I would say is, okay, I&#39;m committing regardless to a leadership contest occurring after this election. I may run again in it, TBD, but I commit to another leadership contest. Because again, you might then have people say, well, this is not my only chance. Because the thing you&#39;re talking about, like I wanna run for two. If you were a Christian Freeland and you&#39;re trying to like lock up a coronation, your biggest risk is people say, We do it now or we&#39;re stuck with her for six years, right? So even if you start walking back some of these things, you give yourself some optionality, you do something like that and you&#39;ve got a stronger hand down the road. Talk</span>
