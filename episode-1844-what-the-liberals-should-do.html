        <div class="desc"><p>It increasingly seems like Trudeau leaving is a question of when, not if. And now, the jockeying to set the rules for the Liberal Leadership contest is in fully swing. What's happening/ What are the considerations? And what should the Liberals do?</p><p>The gang have thoughts. The merits and weaknesses of the Liberal Party supporter system guest stars.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the race for the race - and the increasingly public debate about how the Liberals should set the rules for the Leadership Contest to come. Are letters from </em><a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2024/12/27/liberal-mp-chahal-urges-trudeau-to-stop-needless-reflection-and-resign-accusing-cabal-around-trudeau-of-a-reckless-strategy-of-mutual-political/446474/" target="_blank">Calgary MP George Chahal</a><em> and </em><a href="https://geraldbutts.substack.com/p/the-ballad-of-justin-and-chrystia" target="_blank">former senior staffer Gerry Butts</a><em> signs that the race has already begun? How do you structure a contest when you might be in the polls in a month and still set your party up for success? With the Liberals so down in the polls, why should anyone care? And can you imagine the parallel universe episode where Stephen Carter's phone doesn't ring? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

So let&#39;s just throw a couple of options out on the spectrum here. One is, I think, about as as close as you&#39;re going to get to the no leadership contest, which is, we decide that caucus is going to choose, maybe caucus narrows it down to two, like they do in the UK Tories, and then there&#39;s a quick vote of the leadership or of the membership, and boom, you&#39;re off to the races.

I&#39;d maybe make a little bit of a longer list like three being very explicit does not need to be somebody coming from caucus you go to the party you do a traveling road show in the various regions of Canada where you&#39;ve got a bunch of high energy events that are going to be you know big debates out there you show people what you&#39;re able to do you have an actual membership sales component you don&#39;t just lock off the membership or you have the supporter system where people can register I&#39;m somewhat agnostic at this particular moment but I think you&#39;ve got to go out there and you&#39;ve got got to be able to uh to say that these people ran the crucible in some way shape or form and you do that through january and february you have a prorogued parliament you come back in march introduce a budget fucking right off to the polls i think that&#39;s my preferred option at this particular carter what&#39;s yours uh</div>

And knowing that modern politics had gone away from big donors to small donors, like this was a trend we&#39;d observed, we knew that lists were really important. And one of the ways we thought we would fix this is by creating this new level between just somebody who vaguely supports and someone who&#39;s a member, which is a registered supporter, where that email address, where that home address, where that communication exists with somebody who, you know, has not taken the commitment of purchasing a party membership. Now, in Alberta, we didn&#39;t charge you to be a registered supporter the federal liberals instituted something of a poll tax i think it was five or ten dollars so there was still money that had to come from you during that last contest with justin trudeau but liberals did this it was like a water hose we had tens of thousands of people joining the liberal party in in alberta and bob ray was looking at this and he was interim leader of the liberals at the time federally</div>

Ray was interim leader. There was going to be a leadership contest. That&#39;s the one Trudeau ultimately won, right? So we&#39;re in Ottawa. We&#39;re having these conversations. Obviously, the Alberta contingent has big opinions and big feelings about this.

Now, I&#39;ll close by saying we&#39;ve seen some of the hazards of big generalist systems. certainly as a podcast, we&#39;ve talked a lot about the risks of those. I&#39;ve become much more of the opinion that political parties need to be even more like private clubs than they were in 2010 before the supporter system. But that is the journey we&#39;ve been on. And this is the system the liberals have, which basically says, you can register as a supporter of the liberals, you&#39;ll probably have to pay a poll tax, but that gets set by the executive, I believe, unless they&#39;ve changed the rules in the intervening time. And then you get to vote in this leadership contest. It is a point based system. I think that it&#39;s 100 points per writing is the cap. So if you have 30 members, there&#39;s 30 points. If you have 3000, there&#39;s 100 points. If you have 100, there&#39;s 100 points. But that&#39;s that&#39;s what they would normally do at this particular moment.

Let me throw one. Pro-Palestine groups, environmental, labor. These are just a few examples. I&#39;m not adding any connotation to any of them, despite my support for all three. But what do you think of these groups that are already pretty much mobilized? Do you feel like a membership model prevents them or clips their wings a bit? Or do you feel like the supporter model is the right thing to do because lists matter in a 2024 environment even more than what Corey would suggest it did back in the early 2000s?</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, I guess the other way to ask this question is, how are you thinking about special interest groups in this election if you are part of the Liberal Party? Are you looking at them as pure opportunity, get them on the list, or are they always going to be their own thing trying to co-opt your political enterprise? Give me your sense on this.</div>

          <div class="said">So in defense of the supporter system, it was created in part because of special interest Right. If the membership of parties is declining broadly, they are much more susceptible to takeover when all of a sudden you&#39;ve got 10,000 members and an interest group can just come together and say, oh, we&#39;re going to do this. Right. We&#39;re going to take this over. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And I believe we&#39;ve seen lots of evidence that those interest groups will still buy memberships regardless of the system. And, you know, the EB example was just thrown out. It&#39;s a super one. I think you could look at Alberta&#39;s most recent leadership race for the UCP. It happens. Right. Right. And so the idea of a broad based system, as much as anything, was defensive. It&#39;s if you want to reflect the whole of the country, don&#39;t rely on a smaller and smaller special interest driven group. Right. But the other solution and one I think I&#39;m more fond of now is actually going further than what Stephen said there. So I would say, hey, you can be a voter in this particular contest if you&#39;re an existing member and or you can show that you&#39;ve bought or don&#39;t. you know uh bought</div>

But the idea would be, no, show me you&#39;re actually a member of the party, not that you&#39;re willing to buy a party membership on behalf of an interest group. So that&#39;s another option you have here. It&#39;s a different solution to the same problem we&#39;d identified back in the day. And it&#39;s one that I think I&#39;ve become much more convinced is the better one, frankly, because it&#39;s so easy to game these systems. Let</div>

And I know those are more brand-related that I&#39;ve given you as examples, but any long-tail considerations for the Liberals as they jump into this, what now seems to be more likely than ever, a leadership race of some sort?

And I think if she did something like that, she would probably lock up the majority of caucus in very short order. And it would end up being a coronation, even if it&#39;s structured in a way that&#39;s not. And so for me, one of the questions is, does anybody really want to fight for it right now? You asked me the question, so I&#39;ll broaden it to that point. And if the answer is not really except for Freeland, and Freeland&#39;s willing to make some conditions on it, like, we know we need a leader. I&#39;m an obvious choice. We&#39;ll get through this, and then we&#39;ll figure out where it is. Some of the logic we&#39;ve said earlier, I think that that would be an interesting thing to observe. Does she want it for two elections if she loses is a big question for me.</div>

But if you are the Liberals, and if you are a member of the Liberal Party who actually is probably okay with the idea that, you know, United Front is a long-term solution, and let&#39;s be really frank, there are a lot of Liberals who feel that way. There&#39;s a lot of Liberals going back even to Chrétien&#39;s day who thought they should push for a merger of the NDP when the Liberals were the majority because they couldn&#39;t keep fighting this leftward-flank-rightward-flank thing forever.

But you have to say, look, I&#39;m doing this because the party needs strong leadership in these areas, because I can be a conduit for ideas from people like you. But I think we all need to acknowledge that hill that we&#39;ve got to climb here. And victory in this sense is there is a liberal party still after this election. And I&#39;m going to do my best. And I hope we can surprise people. But let&#39;s be realists here. That&#39;s always been a strength of this party, realism. And I do think you could actually couple that with a couple of things that give you optionality too. Like one of the things I think if I were a leadership contestant in the liberals, I would say is, okay, I&#39;m committing regardless to a leadership contest occurring after this election. I may run again in it, TBD, but I commit to another leadership contest. Because again, you might then have people say, well, this is not my only chance. Because the thing you&#39;re talking about, like I wanna run for two. If you were a Christian Freeland and you&#39;re trying to like lock up a coronation, your biggest risk is people say, We do it now or we&#39;re stuck with her for six years, right? So even if you start walking back some of these things, you give yourself some optionality, you do something like that and you&#39;ve got a stronger hand down the road. Talk</div>
