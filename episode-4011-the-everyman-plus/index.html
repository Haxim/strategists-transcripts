        <p>Stephen Carter and Zain Velji dive into whether looks still shape political destiny, unpack the machinery of campaign makeovers, and debate what “electable” means in 2026. They also turn to the quieter question of who really runs campaigns, and who gets paid to do it. Do voters want someone who looks like them, or someone just a notch better? Has the definition of electability changed? And did Shannon just seize the means of podcast production?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps Carter in line.</p><p></p>

It wasn&#39;t his picture, wasn&#39;t who he was, but nonetheless, people responded to the photograph and voted for him.</div>

But they do need to conform to certain base rules. And one of the base rules is don&#39;t pick on people because of their attractiveness or unattractiveness. As we learned from Jean Chrétien and the Tory-led opposition, which put out that horrible ad mocking his looks. You can&#39;t mock people&#39;s looks and expect to get ahead in politics.</div>

But this was like a real like comment on like looks and looks alone. And it almost seemed like a singular sort of comment related to that one factor, like there was a baseline. And if you don&#39;t meet it, nothing else can overcome for it. And I was just wondering if you find that to be the case, because obviously you didn&#39;t say those words. but but i&#39;m it&#39;s now gotten me just like you&#39;re really questioning like is there like a complete place i like that no level of additional charisma or likeability or sense of humor or anything can&#39;t overcome i</div>
