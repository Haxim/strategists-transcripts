        <p>Stephen Carter and Zain Velji dive into whether looks still shape political destiny, unpack the machinery of campaign makeovers, and debate what “electable” means in 2026. They also turn to the quieter question of who really runs campaigns, and who gets paid to do it. Do voters want someone who looks like them, or someone just a notch better? Has the definition of electability changed? And did Shannon just seize the means of podcast production?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps Carter in line.</p><p></p>

We&#39;re like a multiracial, multiethnic, multi-hyphenate society in many ways, more so than we have been in the 80s and 90s. And I think attractiveness and relatability and the broader suite, and I&#39;m not talking about just looks, are just fundamentally different now, right? Like, I just think there&#39;s just such a wider swath of that definition. It&#39;s not 5&#39;10 to 6&#39;2 white coma. It&#39;s not like Gavin Newsom looks like a fucking character because that&#39;s what politicians used to look like. You know what I mean? like he looks like what they were supposed but like because that definition has changed and i hope increasingly more changes i think these sort of metrics even how you carter like and that&#39;s not a criticism of you but like how you have viewed what a politician needs to look like may actually be wrong on certain things where it&#39;s like you got to own your look versus you know look like something and i and i and i i feel like that&#39;s also like a big factor here which is that the the electorate has changed, the country has changed, politics has changed, conventional metrics of attractiveness have changed since some of these folks were last in politics or running campaigns.</div>
