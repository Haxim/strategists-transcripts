          <div class="said">oh i think it it was Hillary Clinton. And I came in totally expecting Hillary Clinton to lose because all that Donald Trump needed to do to sort of win the expectations game was act like a normal human being. That proved impossible. That proved utterly impossible for him. By my count, there were four comments that I would deem totally career ending for a normal politician. His comment about his temperament as he&#39;s totally unspooling talking about what a great temperament he has like that&#39;s that&#39;s a bad look to actually be losing your temper as you say how great your temperament is his comments about Iraq where he was trying to talk over uh the moderator just ignoring what he was saying about you said this in 2002 this crazy rambling response that included call Sean Hannity call Sean Hannity over and over again weird as f and then his birther comment where he didn&#39;t really have a good reason why from 2011 where he got the birth certificate air quotes around got to 2016 why he continued to push that narrative instead patting himself on the back for for getting the birth certificate and then for five years it didn&#39;t make any sense and then finally his tax return comment i say finally but it was actually the first of those ones i think which was as brutal a response as i have ever seen to that given by him he had nothing he had absolutely nothing to say about it and in fact he seemed to insinuate that he paid no federal taxes like he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t refute that part and in fact he sort of built on top of it when hillary Clinton suggested that might be the case.</div>

But Trump, Trump was trying to connect based on his investments. Charlotte, I have a lot of investments in Charlotte, Chicago. I&#39;ve got a beautiful building in Chicago. You know, I mean, it was, it was about as unapproachable an approach as you could possibly imagine. And it&#39;s really hard to, you know, in some ways we we just jumped right in but can we talk about how in god&#39;s name did that man get on that stage ever i mean i don&#39;t think he could have looked less like he belonged there i</div>

          <div class="said">actually, how it started unfolding at the beginning, I think you could sort of see the wheels spinning in both candidates&#39; heads and maybe I&#39;m just projecting into them what I was feeling watching it, but Donald Trump was really shaky at the start. And I don&#39;t mean shaky like later where he was unhinged. I mean, he seemed quite unsure of his footing and it was almost looking like it was going to be a relatively normal debate with him trying to look as normal as possible, which is what I think he should have done. But it wasn&#39;t working. And I think it was not working because he himself didn&#39;t have the capacity to pull off that thing so then he swung swung hard to uh you know really aggressive donald trump and i&#39;ll say uh that happened right around the exchanges on trade and hillary clinton for a moment i was thinking oh god oh my god she&#39;s not going to be able to handle this and</div>

He sputtered some more. And when he finally finished, she said something like, whoa, well, that was a lot. And the audience laughs, right? Oh, yeah. But nobody&#39;s going to watch a five-minute clip. The clip is going to be the last two sentences of Donald Trump and then her saying that. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to translate as well to the viewer afterwards. So I do wonder if Donald won&#39;t be saved a bit in soundbite simply by the fact that so much of how brutally he did was the rambling and the context that you&#39;re never going to get after the fact.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, it&#39;s clear that Hillary Clinton doesn&#39;t have very good answers on trade. And in fact, I think the whole envelope of what have you been doing for the past 30 years was some of her weakest material. And that means they&#39;ve found a vulnerability. And when they start looking at that game tape, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re going to note that. and they&#39;re going to try to find better answers. Now, of course, it&#39;s an arms race, and the same will be said for Hillary. But, you know, her answers were very, very weak. Even when she was talking about the things she did as senator and secretary of state, as Canadians, we&#39;re really familiar with the 1984 debate, like, I had no option. This was, some of her language got close. It&#39;s like, look, it wasn&#39;t my job. I don&#39;t know what to tell you. That&#39;s tough when you&#39;re in the room and you&#39;re making a big thing about the fact you are in these rooms and having these discussions, to then turn around and be like, yeah, that wasn&#39;t my job. It just doesn&#39;t work when you&#39;re asking for the big job. And so if they can sort of build on those lines of attack and go forward on that, they may find more fruit. But I don&#39;t know. I mean, I kind of think that it&#39;s more likely, based on what I saw tonight, that Hillary Clinton will adjust to that line of attack than Donald Trump will adjust to to deliver that line of attack.</div>

Missed opportunities are effectively either a narrative series or a particular moment that you felt like should have been hit harder or your candidate went left when they should have gone right. Did you see one, let&#39;s start with Hillary Clinton, did you see one for Clinton that you wish you would have done this at that moment of time rather than doing that or had gone down a particular way where you were just sitting to yourself being like no why are you doing this did you find yourself in that in that position oh</div>

He needed to show us today that he was presidential in some fashion. It doesn&#39;t need to be that which is presidential that has been defined by Barack Obama or Judge George W. Bush or President Clinton or any of the others. Everybody else is defining themselves as presidential on their own terms. Trump gets the same opportunity, but he must be able to articulate himself in some fashion uh</div>

The second is is 62% by Hillary Clinton with her unfavorables where they are, and the fact that so many more people were kind of owned by third parties at the time is a very different number than the 67 that Romney had. This is just also, by the way, it entirely reverses the momentum that Donald Trump had, whereas Romney winning reversed the momentum of Obama, and it gave him a month of grief.</div>

And I think you really start applying pressure to Donald Trump. You have to be very careful, though. You don&#39;t want the next debate to be one of expectations that have swung the other way. Right. I think I think you do have to say like that was a very tough debate. I mean, ultimately, I&#39;m I&#39;m arguing with a guy who it&#39;s unarguable. Like I&#39;m used to arguing and debating with people who actually care about the truth and facts and and trying to actually get a cogent point forward. And this man cares is about none of those things. And I think you have to really stress that he&#39;s a disaster. But the fact that he&#39;s a disaster makes it challenging to argue with him. I think you have to manage expectations going forward because right now it looks like such a beating. I&#39;m worried about expectations. Carter,</div>
