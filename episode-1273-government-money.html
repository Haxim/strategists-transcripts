            <span class="text">know what? Not yet. But I think we can repurpose show A for other purposes. Oh, by the way, that was a Patreon episode. A lot of people aren&#39;t going to know what we&#39;re talking about here. That&#39;s fine.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">was pretty good. I feel like it&#39;s what Friday afternoon listening and recording should have been, which was an emotional roller coaster with two people, Corey and I, who were marginally informed about what was happening, Annalise, who was negatively informed, so less than zero information, all concluding to our desperate plea to get whatever we could, which ended up being Robert Herjavec, the dragon and shark from CBC and ABC&#39;s Dragon&#39;s Den. shark tank respectively so i mean i think it was it was perfect so i&#39;ve summarized it for you uh you don&#39;t need to spend six bucks no</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Interesting kind of strategy piece on this that I want to dig in with you guys is what the NDP are doing here. They are branding it as the NDP&#39;s National Dental Care Program and saying that they forced the government to do this. It wouldn&#39;t exist without the NDP. So let&#39;s jump into this one. And then we&#39;ve got a bunch of other things things that are also making news that we will talk about. Corey, do you think this is a transformative program? Do you think people care? Do you think it&#39;s going to help the Libs?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you know, well, let&#39;s just say that it&#39;s rare to come across a government program, no matter what the size or scope is, that the government doesn&#39;t try to claim as transformative in the most breathless language possible, finding the examples of the people that it would benefit the most. I honestly don&#39;t know whether this is, you know, some big numbers of people who would get support who otherwise wouldn&#39;t get support. That&#39;s awesome. them. I think dental care is one of those underappreciated parts of healthcare. I kind of have to say that my wife&#39;s a dental hygienist, but I also believe it to be true. But, you know, it&#39;s not, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it doesn&#39;t seem to be entirely as advertised and maybe a good first step, but really a lot of the dental coverage that people need, you know, it can get very expensive very quickly. And it can, you know, change in scope very dramatically going throughout your life. So So devil is in the details, as with all things, I don&#39;t know enough about the details. But I&#39;ll tell you, it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s interesting that the government is once again trumpeting a new spending plan when you have the polyeth conservatives essentially attacking them on spending the inflationary nature of it. We have some limited polling that suggests there&#39;s a certain fatigue with new plans. So wondering</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">wondering if this is actually going to be something that bears an awful lot of fruit in the polls you know politically but um you know a big part of that ndp liberal deal was looking at things like this so of course uh you know that&#39;s that&#39;s the other major component of it zane</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">zane let&#39;s talk about that thread that cory has put on the table in terms of um in terms of the spending in kind of like that big plan there was this one today um there&#39;s reports saying tomorrow a big housing announcement is coming um about about blueprints and how we&#39;re going to build houses and stuff do you think there&#39;s appetite for sort of these big let&#39;s spend a lot of money and veil transformative plans in in this environment it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it depends on the audience cory points out something that i was going to lay out as well which is the current sort of</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">political suite of issues that are at the top of folks priority list certainly don&#39;t include let&#39;s put housing aside for a second certainly don&#39;t include a massive multi-billion dollar multi-year rollout dental plan.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">This was, of course, something that is a byproduct of the deal with the NDP, but it&#39;s also a hangover effect from the pandemic, where for that very narrow window, we bought into the new worldview, and we bought into the times of lower inflation, of course, we bought into this big social change moment around childcare, dental care, care, pharma care. And you also saw the government driving very cleanly, at least from a narrative perspective, less so from a how they would get their execution perspective, which, by the way, could be said as a chief criticism of this government around making this their legacy, the cares, right? The pharma, dental, and of course, at the top of it, the one that they&#39;ve gotten furthest down the line, child care. I think it finds itself right now where there certainly is is going to be an audience for something like this. I think the reason that this program, beyond the practicality of it, starts with the very elderly, at least in its initial rollout, is that those folks vote. Yeah, 87. Yeah, like those folks vote if they think they live. Do</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Do the 87-year-olds vote? Yeah, they do. The</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">The mobile polls in the seniors&#39; facilities, kind of tongue-in-cheek, also totally not, right? Like, I&#39;m actually totally, like, being serious about that. Like those polling stations across the country, it&#39;d actually be really interesting to do a deep dive on mobile polls, especially where they&#39;re located in seniors facilities, and look out the turnout at some of those. But the simple fact is, and the reductive fact is that those folks vote, right? So this is a entitlement. This is as well as it&#39;s one of those things for the larger sort of bleeding heart progressive clan, which is, this is a social good. The core effects of it from a policy perspective, I still think are years away to understand if it fully is internalized, if it&#39;s socialized, two meanings of that word, of course, like socialized in the sense that we keep funding it and socialized in the sense that we accept it. I think that&#39;s still years away. There&#39;s still a provincial negotiation. There&#39;s still a, you know, the dentists competing with each other on if they&#39;re going to accept the fee guide that the government has built into this particular plan. But there is a moment and there is an audience for this high spend sort of plan. Now, what the conservatives do with it, how much time they spend on it, and I also want to discuss how much time the government spends on it, because I think that&#39;s fascinating in terms of how they brand it. But what I&#39;m really interested in is, are the conservatives, are they going to attack this or not? I see merit for them to attack the fringes of it. I don&#39;t see merit of them to get off their main issue, the bread and butter issues that have gotten them the lead in the polls. But I think we&#39;re still months away in terms of understanding, if not years away, its true sort of policy impact in that sense.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">So how much time do you think they should spend on it? And I guess, Corey, feel free to jump in. Like, talk about that. We&#39;ve had that conversation about narrative and storytelling and going into the next election. Do you go really hard on this and this like narrative of we care?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, maybe. That&#39;s certainly a choice. And it still remains to be seen whether the Liberals are going to try to tack to the quote-unquote center and have an economic message or talk about supports and the things that they&#39;re doing for people. Well, this is certainly along the lines of supports, right? It is about filling the gaps. It&#39;s about providing care to Canadians who wouldn&#39;t otherwise have it. You know, the federal government took pains to stress during their presser that this wasn&#39;t to replace provincial programs.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This was to quote unquote fill gaps. And, you know, it&#39;s really, you know, it&#39;s a copay based system too, I guess is the thing I would say. So if you are really finding difficulty paying,</span>

            <span class="text">you know what&#39;s really interesting thing about this. And I&#39;m curious if Corey agrees. And this is just like a momentary instinct that I have, which is that this file is a fascinating one, not just because of what it does with the liberal conservative competition, but there is with the current decline in the poll numbers that the liberals have experienced, they might be in like a classic Ontario-like progressive primary with the NDP around who actually does the progressive stuff. If their poll numbers start are getting in the same range. And I know that there&#39;s just a natural sort of precondition that the liberals are always going to be ahead of the NDP. That happens until it maybe doesn&#39;t, right? And like, and there is something to be said that taking credit for a big social program might actually have to be the first step for the liberals here, as they battle it out with the NDP in some weird, strange way, the co-authors of this program, right? And then the NDP also has a fascinating political calculation, which is, do they want to make $13 billion sound like $130 billion? Because you can, through narrative and comms, right, by making it the biggest thing ever, when you also might have a chance to complete for those orange-blue, more economic sort of minded voters and say, but these guys just, didn&#39;t they put in this like $100 billion dental program? Of course, it&#39;s not true, right? It&#39;s only $13 billion. But if you advertise it in such a way, And I don&#39;t mean that advertised like from a money spend perspective, but if you broadcast it and market in a certain way, you also have certain limitations on your overall growth that you might have as the NDP. So there&#39;s a fascinating progressive primary here, not just on this file, but if these numbers remain where they are and the liberals still get a couple points knocked out of them, enter some dynamics that we haven&#39;t seen in a very long time, which is the concept of of the NDP and the Liberals competing with each other to figure out who can ultimately be the transfer of the progressive vote when push comes to shove during an election. And I think that jockeying is perfect for Pierre Polyev. It&#39;s the same dynamics that Doug Ford has been able to preserve in Ontario. I&#39;m not saying Polyev is on the verge of engineering it, because there still are some Liberal advantages, i.e. government that they have. But there is fascinating sort of elements that could come into play relatively shortly, if not at this current present moment.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, you know, it&#39;s really, for me, what I think is most interesting about this plan is that it does seem, if anything, a play for kind of lower income households. And I don&#39;t mean like below poverty line households, I mean, below 70,000, where there are no co-pays, right?</span>

That seems to be a group that All three of the major political parties are competing with pretty aggressively or competing for pretty aggressively at this point. And I&#39;d be so fascinated to see what the demographic breakdowns are on this particular plan and support for it. Because it&#39;s also quite possible that when you talk, and Zane, I love what you&#39;re saying about kind of the liberal NDP primary, like maybe they&#39;re just trying to get ahead</span>

            <span class="text">trying to make dental care into a cost of living argument is not a good strategy. Just like you tried to make childcare as your response to cost of living. If you recall during two Christmases ago, right, cost of living was becoming that issue. Inflation was at record highs. And Trudeau stood out there and said, we&#39;re not going to throw any checks in the mail to you. We&#39;re not going to give you any sort of reduction on your heating. We understand, but our solution is child care. Just look what we&#39;ve done here. Don&#39;t repeat that mistake. There&#39;s two reasons not to repeat that mistake. Trying to make dental care into your response undermines the rest of the suite of things that you&#39;re actually doing for cost of living. And secondly, you are taking away from the impact that this dental program could have around clarity, around value, and to Corey&#39;s point, around audience. If you muddy it as a cost of living solution for all versus a targeted solution for the few on the lower cost and elderly age, that&#39;s where you potentially have the ability to lose out from both sides. You underwhelm on cost of living and you underwhelm on the audience that you&#39;re trying to deliver this specific program to.</span>

Like we got the plan and then this incompetent government couldn&#39;t deliver on the plan is like just simple. It&#39;s not so hard for them. But it is an interesting question how much credit you can possibly get when it&#39;s the other people who are implementing it at the end of the day. Will Canadians see this as an NDP plan or will they see this as a Liberal plan? I&#39;ll tell you from the media coverage today, feels like they&#39;re going to see it as a liberal plan,</span>

And then at the end, you know, smashed in some NDB quote about how good the plan is and how it&#39;s them who did it. And that&#39;s just, you could think like, you know, some people are like, oh, it&#39;s at the end, it&#39;s the last thing they&#39;ll remember in an article. Absolutely not the case.

            <span class="text">Here&#39;s my crazy strategy idea for the NDP. Well, first of all, both of these pieces would have to be in place already. So this is advice for four months ago. Go back to your time machine. Yeah, so this is great. It&#39;s really good. Number one, in the agreement, I would have actually told the governing liberals how much I wanted the ad campaign for this particular rollout to be. That would have actually been one of my negotiating terms. Alongside the policy, I would have wanted a dollar amount. I wanted to have seen the media spend proposed plan. I wanted to have that spend be pretty sizable from a government dollar perspective. And then what I would have wanted to do is run parallel ads, which are going to be a fraction of the government ads, because we&#39;re the NDP, right? Right. We don&#39;t have all that money right now. And we&#39;re probably holding it till the election to run on crazy things. I would have actually talked about it being the NDP dental plan. Roll it out on a similar timeline. Make it really interesting, creative, perhaps like conversational creative. That is the best chance to have the volume and reach and frequency of government advertising with you doing a victory lap on your own for you to take credit on with this particular file. I don&#39;t know if it would work. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I would have proposed it, though. But the main sort of strategic point is, if you want it to go loud, you can&#39;t do it with your own money. You don&#39;t have enough. You don&#39;t have enough earned media. You&#39;re going to be at the bottom of the article. Leverage the government&#39;s resources with a sizable media spend. If it&#39;s a $13 billion plan, get a sizable media spend. Say it and justify it. Make it terms of the plan. Run your parallel advertising. Hope that there is a collective conflation in the minds of Canadians. Even if that means a couple more points towards you around taking credit, you&#39;ll take that. And it was worthwhile, the party investment, and you frankly paid fuck all for it on the government side.</span>

And frankly, I&#39;m not going to like, you know, unilaterally put my sword down just to be like, you know, this is maybe not like, this is how the world works in some ways, and they should have taken advantage of it if there was an opportunity. Now, are there other considerations? Absolutely. Am I being a bit reductive? Yes, on purpose. But to make a point around the fact that there is something to be said around taking credit and using some of the liberal sort of halo on this or energy on this or even earned media analysts on this and trying to divert it to you. And there&#39;s nothing to say you can&#39;t do your own little ad campaign, something that&#39;s creative, something that&#39;s already in the can tested around this, especially if you were saying this is the largest social program in Canadian history, and you want legacy level credit for it, there&#39;s got to be something more than, you know, an earned media strategy that ends you up in the sixth paragraph of every article. hypothetical</span>

I&#39;d say even without these government ads, which may or may not happen. I don&#39;t think they are, but it may not happen. But who knows? Time will tell. And we may not even see them because we&#39;re not part of the Target demo. If Stephen was here, he would certainly see them as an 87-year-old man.

            <span class="text">when you&#39;re advertising okay first of all let&#39;s say this about government advertising most government advertising is not remotely controversial like you wouldn&#39;t even think twice about it it&#39;s like hey make sure you&#39;ve renewed your license right and crap like that that doesn&#39;t necessarily give any kind of upside to anybody right there are times where you want to advertise on the issues of the day certainly when there&#39;s a new policy you need need people to be aware of it you need them to know the pros and the cons but that&#39;s kind of for me a bit of the line like you you is your job if your advertisement is informing that&#39;s one thing and if it&#39;s obfuscating that&#39;s another thing like i&#39;ve said those lines are not always clear in the real world but you know they&#39;re generally not that unclear and i can think of examples for example in 2016-17 when the government of alberta was advertising on the climate leadership plan Lots of money spent on climate leadership plan ads. Those climate leadership plan ads were pretty forthright about both the upsides and the downsides. You will pay more was part of those ads. Here&#39;s the things that will be done was part of those ads. But it was clarifying for people what was actually occurring at that particular moment. If you were just running an ad saying this is only the greatest thing ever, and concurrently the NDP were running ads saying brought to you by the NDP of the same thing, I&#39;d</span>

            <span class="text">Well, ultimately what it&#39;s saying is that the liberals have to be careful about negative ads, that negative ads in their own right aren&#39;t sufficient, and that there&#39;s going to be positive to reinforce the entire message for the liberals. I&#39;d say that there is some merit in that, but I think it&#39;s also like a fundamental misunderstanding of advertising. And I think what you see right now with the liberals is that they have some</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">some things that they are testing in the field, largely like organic social content that&#39;s video, which this columnist points out as being advertising. But I think that the more sort of global point here is something that&#39;s often misunderstood, that there needs to be like an equivalency between negative and positive on the same medium. And I&#39;d see this all the time when developing ads or talking to folks, which is like, you know, if we do a negative spot, we need an equal spend, same reach, same frequency, same audiences on a positive spot, because, you know, that&#39;s how we get both sides of the story. And often it&#39;s not that neat, and it&#39;s strategically not that neat. There&#39;s a lot of cases where you want to top load negative, where you want to go 90% negative, where you want to do positive on different mediums, where negative can be masked as things that don&#39;t look like negative, like wit or humor or different flights that you use. So you give people a bit of a break so there&#39;s no fatigue on it or replacing the type of creative and pace that you do. And I think the lazy conclusions we often get to and ones that we often accept is that, yeah, I know we got to tell the positive side of the story and we just assume that it&#39;s going to be that same equivalent, when often that is not the case. Often campaigns that run multi-million dollar ads, especially in politics, have a tilt. Sometimes that tilt is positive, generally when you&#39;re ahead, but a lot of times when you&#39;re behind, that tilt is negative. Not because you&#39;re not telling a positive story, but because you&#39;re trying to do specific things. And often with negative advertising, sometimes it disguises different things, or other times the positive is delivered in other mediums. you gotta you gotta effectively put out a lot more negative than than you um uh than than people fully appreciate is is the larger story and so my concern with articles like this is that it finds itself in terms of conventional wisdom right like that that people are like yeah it&#39;s gonna have a the conventional wisdom is that you can&#39;t negative isn&#39;t sufficient enough sure but negative advertising is often sufficient enough because the positive is being told in other mediums by by other players, by earned media, by other focus points, by validators. And there&#39;s so many other tools that help you tell the positive. And I feel like, you know, if I&#39;m the liberals taking in this messaging, I would not burn a lot of money on positive right now.</span>

You&#39;re not just trying to get share of money. So when you&#39;re selling most products, for those who don&#39;t know, we talk about share of mind. We just want to be like one of the top three options that you have so that when you actually go into market to purchase these things, you&#39;ll be like, well, I remember Toyota. I remember Ford and I remember Hyundai. So I&#39;m going to go look at cars at those three places. And hopefully, a lot of those other things that you&#39;ve got working for you in your marketing context, like the nature of the car, you know, the bells and whistles that will appeal to different demographics will get you over the line. And the job of a lot of advertising a lot of the time is just to make sure you remember and that you&#39;re at the top of the list or in the top three when you go buying something. something.</span>

            <span class="text">there&#39;s two streams of political advertising. There&#39;s picking the apples off the ground, the things that are loose, the people that are loose, they don&#39;t have have an opinion. They&#39;re the undecided voters, right? And they&#39;re shaking the tree to get the apples on the ground. And sometimes you&#39;ve got to shake the tree. You&#39;ve got to remove people from the conservative orbit. You&#39;ve got to remove people from the liberal orbit. You&#39;ve got to pick them up. And negative advertising is about shaking the tree. It&#39;s about making people say, I don&#39;t think I can support them, right? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s there. Now, where I think that this gets into what this analyst was saying, and look, it&#39;s an analyst, as quoted by the Toronto Star, we don&#39;t know what the full length of the commentary was. We just know what the reporter found interesting enough to put in a column. But I&#39;ll say this, or like the newspaper found to put in the column after it got through the editors, because I think they actually wrote it. But I will say this, it&#39;s</span>

They&#39;re like, you know, vertical social media posts that, by the way, if they ever advertise, just take a look at them. It would make sense to no one because they&#39;re about house votes and like, you know, clips of Pierre saying one thing and saying it&#39;s so inside baseball. It&#39;s so misaligned to where they need to be. If they&#39;re actually doing advertising right now, those are not the pieces, to be clear. this is more so my sort of you know broadcast to them go negative go hard disguise negative as being other things you don&#39;t need to spend money on positive right now you&#39;re in such a big fucking hole right get to neutral and then figure out your story man well</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">your job right now if you walk us through this thing well i do believe that because of who rachel notley is and and frankly what she has been able to do taking this this party from her leadership nearly a decade ago to forming government and to now forming the largest opposition. There is a lot of pent-up admiration. There is a multiple victory lap, so to speak. And you want to cash in on that, not just for like the halo that that gives you as a leader, not just to run back the clock on the legacy of what she&#39;s been able to build, what I&#39;ve just talked about in broad strokes, what she&#39;s been able to do, but also for the money. And you want to be able to activate the donor class. You want to kind of do certain things, whether that&#39;s events, final goodbyes, digital fundraising. So I think that needs to find itself in like a medium sort of terrain. I think extending it beyond that looks like you&#39;re kind of like overstaying your welcome. I&#39;m not giving you specific times in terms of how long, how many weeks I&#39;m talking about here, but you want to be able to accommodate a few of these final sort of like send-offs that are both financially helpful to the party and solidify her legacy. So that would be, right, start the conversation with her, right? Would be like, if you are planning to do this, which we do not know, but there it is rumored, if you&#39;re planning to do this, here&#39;s what I would think of. We want to make sure you solidify the legacy, which, by the way, is also code for saying, have some directionality in terms of what your successor looks like. Like, I think there on after the advice is to stay out of it. But of course, different leaders have different sort of models of how they think about that. And then it&#39;s about the financial health of the party. What can we do to maximize the send off in that regard? Those are a couple of considerations I would have.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think it really depends on goals. There are leaders who leave and they want to leave quietly, either because they just that&#39;s who they are or because they just don&#39;t want to draw attention to what was a failed tenure. tenure that&#39;s obviously not rachel notley right she was the first ndp premier of alberta she has the largest opposition that&#39;s not a failed tenure so i don&#39;t see why she would try to make things as quiet as possible like a leaving announcing you&#39;re leaving a friday in december is the political equivalent of an irish goodbye right like just ghosting on the party part way through just you know everyone&#39;s over by the dip you just get your coat and you slink out the back it&#39;s just not It&#39;s not what&#39;s going to happen.

Does she want to take any grenades for the party, do anything unpopular on her way out the door that her, you know, successor would otherwise have to deal with really early on?

But because I think of the unique character of the Alberta NDP at this moment and that that unique character as it was basically created by Rachel Notley in its modern form. She&#39;s got a lot of latitude to stick around and she&#39;s going to have a lot of authority. Yeah.</span>

So it really does depend on the situation and the leader&#39;s connection with the party. And, and honestly, I can&#39;t imagine a stronger one.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I think like any good government paid political ad, Corey&#39;s been able to persuade me that party health should be looked at beyond money. So I would kind of like, to me, I would almost dictate those goals saying like, your legacy has to be top of it. The party health, I talked about fundraising. I think that&#39;s huge because, you know, that is. And frankly, the fundraising element also extends to the rules of the leadership race. So when Corey talks about it, like how you contour that, how your influence looks like on that, the entry fee, do you want to take care of that before you go, the rules around like how long you have to be a member, all those sort of things, like all of that will actually affect the financial health. And then this is where I initially disagreed, but would probably agree with Corey around like the health of the party beyond like around the shit, the baggage, all that sort of stuff, what you can clear out of the way for the next person. But I would still say the number one goal is like, as long as you feel like it does not affect the long term legacy here, because I think Rachel Notley, she&#39;s young, relatively young, has probably another chapter to write in some way, shape or form. It may not be politics, but she will be remembered as the greatest progressive premier that this province has had. And I mean, that is a huge accomplishment. accomplishment and um so there is another chapter for you as a person there&#39;s another chapter for you and how you are celebrated politically um around how you&#39;re kind of seen within the ndp wherever it goes from here regardless of the next leader and i think solidifying or at least beginning the process to try to put it on a track i think is one of those first things cory might disagree with me that you that you can&#39;t do that right now it&#39;s all about the the short strokes in the moment but to me if i&#39;m advising her and just her like and that is my like client so to speak that would be top of the list for me well</span>

So many people leave the leadership of a political party, not on their own two feet, like they&#39;re just, it&#39;s dictated to them, either they&#39;re ousted or they don&#39;t really have a choice.

It&#39;s there for both starting right away to start solidifying the memories, the validation, the accomplishments, the history, all that sort of stuff, tightly packaged, emotional, emotive, that sort of stuff. I&#39;d start that stuff right away, because people will want to move on to the speculation of who&#39;s next, what&#39;s next, what are the rules like that&#39;s just the nature of this sort of thing so as soon as you announce you want to also bake in a built of like you&#39;re now going on your own track and you&#39;re like announcing a bit of this this um uh down memory lane uh compilation in some way shape or form as well i think the press conference to me is is not the way to do it i think it&#39;s not controlled i don&#39;t think it has the emotional sort of uplift that you need it doesn&#39;t give you the the reach one One would argue you could even pay for some of this additional stuff if you need to, depending on what you do and how you do it with these other creative pieces. But for me, it&#39;s a video. That is kind of like this. That&#39;s the first comms product or marketing product that I would look at.</span>

            <span class="text">And I&#39;d say the video format allows you to feel something. It&#39;s tightly produced, you can manipulate emotion, you can effectively get to a point where in this canned, produced, like contained, and I think this is really important, right? We talked about long format working, but you&#39;re not going to get a moment in a 30, 15-minute, 8-minute press conference. You&#39;re going to get a clip. Most people who see it, Corey, are not going to see the buildup and the emotion. I&#39;d rather have a contained set piece that allows me to feel something about someone rather than see someone feel something and see like a 14-second, like they applauded, she&#39;s gone, next news story, who the fuck is next?</span>

And it is done through video. She does go to media. So your question is, I think she does one-on-ones. I think she may do a press availability, whatever she needs to. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the primary instrument of how people find out.</span>

That video is produced by Rachel Notley in celebration of Rachel Notley, right? It&#39;s so so much better to have the announcement and then have a video come a little bit later made by other</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I get it. Like, you want the party, you want validators, you want a bunch of people she&#39;s impacted, you want all that sort of stuff. Yeah, you can do that at the final $1,900 ticket gala.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that then. It&#39;s put on completely, it&#39;s going to be held at Government House, okay? That&#39;s where it&#39;s held, right? We don&#39;t care. We&#39;re getting a free rental at Government House on the government dime. No, but Corey, you make a good point, right? You are fundamentally limiting the scope of that video. It&#39;s going to be a lot of voiceover, B-roll, memory lane, news clips potentially around what she&#39;s been able to do. It&#39;s tougher. You&#39;re not going to get like that. But still, I would still go for that above and beyond the news conference, just because of the fundamental limitations of the news conference. I like the impromptu. I&#39;m all about the impromptu. I like the emotive. I like the human wall. I hate it. But for this particular sort of circumstance, I like a lot of what you&#39;re saying. But I just think that as it relates to the primary goal of reach, frequency, and legacy, it does not help as much as a contained video.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I disagree. I don&#39;t super strongly disagree, Zane, but I disagree. I think that you just sort of have more of an opportunity to create a moment. Like, I think a video like that is going to be like out there for a day. You know, it&#39;ll be shared with the diehards for a week. And the press conference</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, okay. Well, like, look, and we can think about examples of when videos have really worked, taking my talents to South Beach, right? And we can think of examples where press conferences have really worked, where people start to talk about this is the end of their career, and this is the end of their legacy. Both can potentially work. But I think that the consequences of kind of flubbing a video, like,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">no i think for a couple of reasons one is he um he is given i think a pretty sensible explanation that this was not supposed to have been used in that particular venue and unless there were evidence that came forward that strongly you know that suggested that was not the case i i think you should sort of accept that this was a semi-private video that went a little bit too far and you can easily understand how that happens it seemed good let&#39;s put it out on on the convention floor, it&#39;ll be a hit, right? And let&#39;s do that. So that&#39;s one. It doesn&#39;t entirely erase the judgment lapse that resulted in this. You shouldn&#39;t have done it in speaker rope, shouldn&#39;t have done it in the speaker&#39;s office, you know, for sure. But you can kind of understand how it happened. Doesn&#39;t mean you need to accept it. The second is, I really don&#39;t like that we would churn through speakers at such a rate. And let&#39;s be clear, it&#39;s not like the conservatives were particularly in love with the speaker from day one, right? And somewhat tied to this let&#39;s call it 2a 2b like he&#39;s canada&#39;s first black speaker you&#39;re gonna get rid of him in like two months like let&#39;s be let&#39;s be clear about the signal that that sends to you know black youth who want to be speakers someday and all</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right and people see how people get treated and i think you&#39;ve just got to give them a bit of a shake i would expect any speaker to be given a shake i think particularly given the stakes of this you got to give them a give them a shot like a fair shot here to be the speaker we need him to be zane</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">cory&#39;s made a lot of good points including yeah i want to pick bring up the fact that he&#39;s the first black man to hold this role one of the most</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">most important things of his apology was his apology to like youth and racialized youth in particular like he almost has this burden which a lot of people of color racialized people do to be like i&#39;m sorry like i&#39;m the first one of us and i kind of fucked up and i&#39;m really like i would would never see a white person make that apology to be totally and i think it like explains a lot of the psyche of like racialized people we&#39;re like if they&#39;re the first to get there and even if they&#39;re not they&#39;re one of the few to get there it&#39;s like you are carrying so much more weight than you realize you&#39;re actually like your own person but you&#39;re also not and i think one of the things we need to realize is when we hear phrases and i&#39;m not sure if i&#39;ve talked to you guys about this but like every time like the pep talk that we all of us get right and this is kind kind of a cliche is that like, you got to be 10% better because non-fireable offenses for you become fireable offenses, right? Like, because regular scheduled program is only a heartbeat away, right? And by regular scheduled program, a white man generally in this case. So there&#39;s something incredibly important about that, that like the ambassadorial sort of role and like how what would not be a fireable offense for most can often be fireable offenses for a lot of racialized people or be thought into. Now, here&#39;s the game I think the conservatives are playing, which is the classic game of resignation. We were talking about the resignation of someone who&#39;s popular. When someone finds themselves in sort of hot water, the resignation game that you want to play is you want them to ultimately not resign, but ask for their resignation so they are weakened. Usually want someone weakened to hang around. And so the conservatives here should be careful, and I hope they&#39;re playing that game, which is the game we have seen so many times, which is someone who should definitely not be fired. You ask to fire them so they seem weakened so that if you ever need to go back to it, remember this is that same speaker that we asked to resign and shouldn&#39;t even have a job in the first place, but you actually don&#39;t want them to leave. Let&#39;s just hope that&#39;s the game the conservatives are playing because if they&#39;re playing the other game, which is the linear, let&#39;s kick this shit can this guy, I think that&#39;s a terrible mistake for all the things that Corey&#39;s mentioned.</span>
