        <p>Zain continues to put off his Alberta election 2023 campaign retrospective by asking the gang to discuss what's next for the NDP: the decisions to be made, their importance, and in what order.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the question on everybody (Zain's) mind: whereto from here from the Alberta NDP? What questions need to be addressed, in what order and how are the topics discussed in this party reform extravaganza. What needs to be resolved inside a leadership contest and what can be resolved outside of a leadership contest? What role does brand have in the conversation to follow? And why are we talking so much about anchors? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Rachel Notley is back. She had a press conference this week. She said she&#39;s staying on as leader for now. I want to talk about what the strategy for the Alberta NDP is going forward. There&#39;s been a lot of speculation about leadership change and when and party policy and party name. But what I want to start is at a more fundamental level. I want to ask you guys, what are the right questions to be asking right now? Because the media environment is clearly focused on the questions that are big and existential. And you guys might lead me in that direction around party brand, party name, etc. But the questions I want to ask you to start with, Carter, are what are the questions the Alberta NDP should be asking themselves in this moment? Still off a loss, still trying to figure out who takes on certain critic roles, what their overall strategy is, heading into the summer, heading into the fall. So the question I want to ask you to start with, and maybe I&#39;ll give Stephen Carter the first shot at this and we can yes and it and build a list together, are what questions should the Alberta NDP be asking themselves right now, Carter?

          <div class="said">what a bonkers top of the list, like, how fucking crazy is that? But it&#39;s actually 100% correct, in a way, and I might have phrased it a bit differently. But, you know, I have said before, and I&#39;ll say again, one of the reasons why I think the NDP was successful in 2015, is because they didn&#39;t allow themselves to get distracted by the same things the Wild Rose got distracted by, the Liberals got distracted by, the Alberta Party got distracted by. And this was a time when all of those organizations were actually political parties with representation in the legislature and could conceivably have become something right but they were way into the existential stuff that i suspect we&#39;re going to get into in a minute and i suspect a lot of the ndp wants to get into and the ndp were pretty clear on who they were they were pretty clear on what they needed to do and they were fucking dressed and ready for the bus and one of the things that has been the ndp&#39;s great success in the past 10 years in my opinion is they know know when it&#39;s time to put their pants on. And so it would be a real shame if as part of thinking about what NDP 2.0 is or 3.0 or however you want to kind of number it, they lost that. So there is kind of a foundational readiness. We are an organization that exists to fight elections, and we need to maintain that readiness, particularly in times of, let&#39;s</div>

Because they weren&#39;t thinking about – they were thinking about electability in a way like you think of a game of risk. Like, well, if I just get this country and that country, then I can invade these other countries. But politics doesn&#39;t really work like that. Politics is really about stories. So I guess what I will say is, for me, it&#39;s actually less the philosophy and it&#39;s more the story that the NDP wants to tell. That&#39;s the important thing for me. And that, to me, is more important than brand. It&#39;s more important than leader at this point, assuming that leadership will just be a conversation that flows out of it. But if the NDP can resolve the question of the story that they want to tell about Alberta and Alberta&#39;s future, why they exist and why you want to vote for them, and that&#39;s not work that requires policy conventions. That&#39;s work that requires, you know, a strong hand at the till and like some directionality here. That, to me, that&#39;s</div>

It says right in our constitution, our goal is democratic socialism. Did you even hear the word socialism during the conference? The reason we were successful in 2015 is because our job is to be there for the working person. And we lost sight of that. We came out of nowhere in 2015 because that was a platform that reflected a party committed to democratic socialism. And the last two elections, even though we faced these historically bad, historically unwelcoming to worker leaders, we instead went to the middle. That was a massive mistake. We betrayed who we were. And that&#39;s why we didn&#39;t see the success we saw in 2015. You&#39;re going to have people saying that. And</div>

We&#39;ve got to be a party that wants to be committed to the free market and the ideas of being almost like a PC-ish. That&#39;s not the words they would use. I was much more articulate on the other side, but they would find words like, we&#39;re going to be there and we&#39;re going to create prosperity for everybody. And the job of the NDP is prosperity through those market mechanisms that exist. And we get it. We don&#39;t deny economics. This is who we are as New Democrats. This is who we&#39;ve evolved to be.

He spelled all these things out. He wrote this farewell address. And then he walked away.

How remarkable that is, I think we forget, because it&#39;s now 2023. 23, but in, you know, the 1790s, how remarkable, or the 1780s, I guess, 1780s, 1790s, um,</div>

The first thing people hear tends to be how they interpret everything else that comes after. And so by being the first to move, you&#39;ve got a very powerful way to anchor the conversation.

If you change the name now, and you are still the same organization, and I&#39;m going to continue on that same track, perhaps in the leadership contest, there is a big conversation about how the goal of the party is democratic socialism. And that&#39;s a big debate. And that&#39;s a debate now being held under the new name. That new name is tied to that conversation forever. But if that&#39;s a conversation that has had, and at the end of that leadership contest has decided to set aside that purpose in the party, well, isn&#39;t that rebrand the perfect way to kind of put the bow on that for the public and say, now we are a little bit different, right?

We got to, we got to un-muddy some waters. you might decide to leave, you might decide not to leave, right? But there are some things that will be common on both decision trees. Like you imagine if you decision tree them out and how they&#39;re going to act on caucus, how you&#39;re going to act on, you know, critic appointments, which I suppose could be part of caucus, how you&#39;re going to act in fundraising. And if you&#39;re going to act the same way on the leave and not leave paths in those areas, well, that&#39;s easy. Take it off the table. Then you know what you&#39;re doing there. That&#39;s super simple, right? And then you&#39;re left with a relatively small bucket of things that you have to decide what you&#39;re going to do with because you act differently depending on whether you&#39;re going to leave or not leave so things like your farewell address we were just talking about obviously</div>

They&#39;re able to put forward a solid and compelling case as to why the BC NDP need to think about different priorities. And all of a sudden the BC NDP, in order to hold on to the party itself has to actually kill her candidacy, which make them look weak, made EB look weak, and it undermined the overall, you know, strength and direction of the party.
