        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan give their assessment of the GOP convention in progress. How did the media jump on top of the Melania Trump's plagarism so quickly?

Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

However unlikely that was, the fact of the matter was, on day one, there was still business to take care of. There is now no business to take care of. The vote is just perfunctory. It is pro forma. It is just going to end with Donald Trump being elected. There are very few opportunities for him to get additional black eyes on a process standpoint. So when you think about day one for Donald Trump, day one was, I&#39;m safe. I&#39;m Republican. And those messages certainly reflected that. Carter,</div>
