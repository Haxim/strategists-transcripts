          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter return after a three-week hiatus to give their "best takes" on matters like the PM in Tofino, O'Toole and Kenney's grips on leadership. What considerations will go into building the Liberal cabinet? Can Jason Kenney survive to (and through) a spring leadership vote? And why aren't there more Nobel prizes? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

We&#39;re going to run through a list of items, and we&#39;re going to get you and Steven to give your best takes on topics that might be, let&#39;s just say, a week old in certain cases, two weeks old. Developments may have occurred on certain things. I might tee you guys up with a strategy question related to them. I might just ask you for your pure analysis on where they stand right now, how they impact a certain party, a certain leader. We&#39;ll freeform it. But what we want are the best takes. takes. And Corey, I&#39;ve heard from one Stephen Carter that you provide the best take. So I&#39;m going to start with you. Stephen, you will be going second. Corey, first topic on hand, Justin Trudeau on the fine, fine beaches of Tofino, British Columbia, on the day of, on the first National Day of Truth and Reconciliation. Your take from what you saw on the beach, to being chased down, to the silence, to the prime minister&#39;s schedule saying he was in private meetings, all the way to what we experienced as the apology, something Trudeau&#39;s getting very good at. Maybe not good at, but certainly doing a lot of on the back end of that trip. Your take on Tofino and what it might mean for Justin Trudeau.</div>

The idea that we would have the election at all, because it seemed like an unnecessary thing to be occurring at this time in Canada when there were so many other things going on, he got dinged for that, too. And so then the election ends, and what does he do? He decides, well, now I&#39;m going to go on vacation on a holiday dedicated to reconciliation. And I mean, a lot of it is just, it&#39;s kind of a a slap in the face in about eight different ways and so one of the things that i just i&#39;m not quite able to put my finger on is what the hell is this guy&#39;s long-term plan if this is where his head is because i get people being tired after election i get the need to spend time with family after you&#39;ve just gone all out for that but to um on the very first day of truth and reconciliation The first one that you</div>

I mean, these are not the actions of somebody who&#39;s intending to be prime minister for the next six years, right? They&#39;re the actions of somebody who thinks he just survived the thing and doesn&#39;t give that many dams about what&#39;s going to be coming next. And I find that fascinating. And it doesn&#39;t really reconcile with other things that he&#39;s done, but I find it&#39;s not something you could ignore when you start thinking about Justin Trudeau&#39;s future.</div>

Don&#39;t do it. Get a new staff because people need to be able to say to the boss, this is dumb. This is the wrong day to do this. And if you&#39;re not surrounded by people who can say that to you, you&#39;ve got to get new people. And this idea that Corey&#39;s pushing forward, that there are no staff, that everybody&#39;s on vacation. At the very least, there should be a transition team. There&#39;s a group of people. I know it&#39;s the same government to the same government, same number of seats to the same number of seats, but they have a transition. They should have a transition plan, and that transition team should at least have some eyes on the prime minister&#39;s schedule, because that&#39;s what professional governments do.

And so the rank and file of the membership is more right wing, arguably than the caucus even. And that&#39;s an interesting situation to be in here. So if you are a centrist, or if you even just think the center is where the votes are, and that&#39;s where we want the leader to be, you have to know if you drop Aaron O&#39;Toole, you&#39;re going to be moving further away from that ideal. And so I think that&#39;s also afforded Aaron O&#39;Toole a certain protection, because nobody thinks they&#39;re going to replace Aaron O&#39;Toole with a more centrist leader. You know, the concept execution problem is absolutely academic, because the membership believes that the party wasn&#39;t right-wing enough, at least the current composition of the membership.

And instead, all of it&#39;s been given back to the prime minister&#39;s office because these people are too afraid.

So it&#39;s a tricky balancing act, always difficult cabinet making, and often you have to just make a decision at some point along certain lines, like, okay, well, this is the thing that I am going for.

Where&#39;s gender parity? And so that&#39;s going to be an expectation. But as you&#39;ve noted, there are a couple of holes to fill in the cabinet in that context. Right. There&#39;s then female ministers who are just not there anymore, not available for cabinet-making purposes. And then when you start looking at some of the things like regional balance, like let&#39;s talk about Calgary, let&#39;s talk about Edmonton. These are big cities in Canada. They&#39;re some of Canada&#39;s biggest cities. They now have liberal MPs, both male. You</div>

So you have a couple of choices here. Either you&#39;re not going to have one with gender parity, you&#39;re not going to have one with regional representation, or you&#39;re going to have an enormous cabinet.

So because politics is a little less stable, we have fewer people who you can point to and say, that&#39;s the professional, that&#39;s the expert. And so there&#39;s more training wheels on ministers. Sure.</div>

            <div class="said">I guess the point I&#39;m making is it is complicated. I can understand why ministers have had their power diluted over time, certainly at the federal level. But one of the things that needs to occur here is you&#39;re just going to have to trust some of these people. And some of them are going to fuck up and you&#39;re just going to have to replace them with more competent ministers down the road. governments are very risk averse but ironically i think that risk aversion has made them worse everything going through the prime minister&#39;s office everything going through a premier&#39;s office is no way to run a government all organizations are rate limited by decision makers and if we make them only have one decision maker well they&#39;re doomed especially if they&#39;re as big and complex as government carter</div>

So the minister already named, right? Trudeau at a press conference, Bella, you know, points to her and be like, yeah, Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister, non-negotiable, right behind me. She&#39;s going to do this shit. We talk about leading from Corey&#39;s question, what is Trudeau&#39;s mid-game slash long game in terms of leadership? Many people speculate her. And then today, the story comes out regarding the KGB, yes, that KGB, you know, looking at Krista Freeland when she was an activist and kind of a fixer on the ground there in the Ukraine as someone that, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here, really annoyed them, but they were also very impressed with. That story had to have been planted, put out there from Team Freeland around leadership sort of potential brand perspective. Does it not, Carter? Do you see that race already starting? I&#39;m putting this in the cabinet category, but it is kind of about leadership overall. Do you see this as the first or one of the first proof points of the secondary race already starting and perhaps the focal point of maybe, I shouldn&#39;t even say tension, but liberalism under Freeland kind of also being emergent as a parallel stream as this cabinet is made and some of the big milestones are reached in the upcoming months?

And I&#39;m certain you&#39;re going to see more of this as it&#39;s going forward, because it&#39;s not just going to be from her, but there&#39;s going to be jockeying by a lot of people. The first jockeying is the subtle, just look at me, I&#39;m important, I&#39;m impressive stuff, right?

            <div class="said">Carter. Final sort of conversation I want to have is about Jason Kenney here in Alberta. Heading into Thanksgiving, let&#39;s do you know, a lot of ink has been spilled on on Jason Kenney over the last couple of months regarding obviously handling of COVID, the impacts on the federal election, his popularity, caucus revolts, things seem to have tampered a bit, but not really. Give me your take on what you&#39;re seeing heading into this Thanksgiving weekend, where you ultimately told Albertans we&#39;ve made progress. If we fuck up, you fucked up. Once again, introducing personal responsibility in a different packaging heading into the long weekend. Do you feel like Kenny&#39;s out of the woods? Is this getting worse? We now have more UCP constituency associations signing on for an earlier leadership review sometime in November to vote on that. Matt, just give me your take on what&#39;s going on with the politics of Kenny here in Alberta.</div>
