        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the close of Act I in the Canadian election. Is the Liberal decline real? How do the parties "seal the deal"? And does anybody have any Toronto Centre numbers for us? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.

You did say, after prompted by an excellent question by myself, that there was a chance that the O&#39;Toole campaign may indeed be doing shitty posts on social media and, by extension, this week, perhaps their literature to try to get some virality and attention. attention seems to be that that might be the hallmark of the firm that they&#39;re using to help them with some of their communications.

So in many ways, it&#39;s a very convenient excuse. But ultimately, I don&#39;t think that, to Stephen&#39;s point, particularly when you look at some of the stuff we were talking about at that moment, which was that Willy Wonka video, when you&#39;ve got conservative premiers dunking on it, when you&#39;ve got your own base saying, just delete this, you&#39;ve got your MPs saying, just delete this. If this was your strategy, it was a poorly executed one because you probably should have at least given the heads up to the people in your caucus that this was your strategy so that they are not taking a round out of you. So, you know, maybe, maybe not. If it is an intentional strategy, I&#39;m still not convinced it&#39;s a particularly good one.

He took issue with the Liberal and NDP proposals for new health care funding that would be tied to specific areas such as long-term care. He said federal health care transfers should be enhanced substantially and then annual increases of 6% locked in. Simultaneously, he had praise for Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s plan regarding health care. And he mentioned that he liked generally where O&#39;Toole was on that side of things and liked his pledge for the 6% increase. But he said provinces would also want an initial boost to the Canada health transfer. Carter, let&#39;s talk about the politics here. Legault, obviously, a premier that wields a big stick, that when he shows up can make a splash. slash he&#39;s decided to enter on today which i believe is day 12 of this campaign jumping in 11 or 12 jumping in into the campaign smart strategy for the go let&#39;s start here and write areas to hit on and then talk about what you think he&#39;s trying to do and what he&#39;s trying to get out of this um as the well as as the premier the liberal premier of quebec every</div>

This is a fight that you want on terms that you want, that only you can set. So why not set these terms? Why not say, you know, Aaron O&#39;Toole? It&#39;s going to cost you nothing in the overall scheme of things. This This isn&#39;t going to reset your agenda. What it does is it allows you to stand up for the people of your province, outline what you think is important at a time when really it doesn&#39;t matter. And I said this to some people today.

          <div class="said">Corey, I&#39;ll get your initial take on this as well. But give me let me just give you some added context. Legault said that health care and immigration reform are two crucial issues on a list of requests he laid out in that letter. He said, quote, We need to remember that Quebec is an island of francophones in a sea of anglophones in North America. It&#39;s math. If new immigrants don&#39;t integrate, don&#39;t learn French, well, then it&#39;s the future of the French language, the future of our nation that&#39;s at stake. What do you make of Legault&#39;s strategy, jumping into the campaign with the big stick he wields and knowing that the majority status that Trudeau wants, and frankly, the seat gain status that other parties need go right through his province?</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">a couple of things you got to keep in mind. I think foundationally, it&#39;s that Legault is more of a conservative than he is a liberal in a small L sense. And so he&#39;s not too fussed about perhaps putting up that easy lob to his pal Aaron O&#39;Toole. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re actually pals, but I think ideologically, they&#39;re a little closer than Justin Trudeau. And of course, also, there&#39;s kind of the pettiness</div>

          <div class="said">pettiness of local politics, right? The fact that Trudeau is from Quebec, Legault is from Quebec, there can be only one top dog in Quebec. Why the hell not, right? I&#39;m not really sure every premier could get away with it. I think that only he can get away with To the degree that he will get away with it. Because Carter said, well, they&#39;re not going to punch back at me if you&#39;re Legault.</div>

          <div class="said">You know, that&#39;s not true if you&#39;re Jason Kenney. That&#39;s not true if you&#39;re Scott Moe. I think that Justin Trudeau would love that fight. I think he would love also to define the conflict for the exact same reasons that Jason Kenney does because it&#39;s a free hit, right? You get to knock them around. You get to look like you&#39;re a tough federalist when there&#39;s not a ton of consequences like, oh, I don&#39;t know, dissolving the country, at least right in front of your face as there is with Quebec. And you can tie them to his good pal Aaron O&#39;Toole. That&#39;s a lot harder to do with Francois Legault. So this is something I think you can anticipate in any general election is that there will be demands, maybe not always so overtly placed by the province, and that everybody reacts to it and acts on eggshells. And, you know, you can talk about whether that&#39;s good for for the notion of Canada or not. But certainly it&#39;s not new. And, and there&#39;s always a bit of this winking as to who they would prefer to support or not without saying they support. I did find it interesting. They basically called or Legault called the NDP and the liberals, these these quote unquote centralists, right? I</div>

But I want to ask you, Carter, you talked about Jason Kenney. How would Kenney do something like this? You know, Corey gave the reasons why it wouldn&#39;t be possible. How would Kenny do something like this if, from the simplest math perspective, Carter, there is no swing status in Alberta? There&#39;s no path to victory that goes through our province? What leverage does Kenny have, should he or any other premier that isn&#39;t Legault in this particular sense, have to make this same case and get the attention and wield that quote-unquote big stick? dick</div>

          <div class="said">he&#39;s already doing it we&#39;re running a municipal election across the province it&#39;s going to you know try and strike out part of the equalization discussion across the country kenny has taken up this big fight and he could take it up again with a provincial uh provincial police force he could talk about the mismanagement and the culture of um the culture in the rcmp and and how it doesn&#39;t represent Albertan values. He has the opportunity to take some big swings at the pension plan. You know, if our pensions here had had positive returns ever in the last five years. Anyways, this could happen, and theoretically he could go after Trudeau on any number of fronts. It wouldn&#39;t be the same. He&#39;s not necessarily going to go after it. I mean, he could go after it on the health transfers. Don&#39;t tell me how I&#39;m going to spend money in Alberta. Alberta is unique. We have different needs. Why wouldn&#39;t he go after after that? And sure, Corey&#39;s right. Trudeau probably doesn&#39;t mind fighting with Kenny the same way that he finds fighting with Legault. But that&#39;s because there are like two to Corey&#39;s point on power and politics today. Hope you tuned in and saw him in real life. He&#39;s very handsome. Very handsome. His his point is that maybe there&#39;s six seats in play.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, okay, so Carter gives me his analysis on daily tracking. You are welcome to do the same, but maybe I&#39;ll tag on an additional question. I think where I want to go, the symbolism of being under 30, even in one daily tracking poll, what would that do to morale? What does that do to operations? What does that frankly do to strategy? Because that&#39;s where I want to get here, which is if you&#39;re inside the liberal camp right now, you were up plus 10 before this thing started. Now we&#39;ve just normalized, you know, a horse race, like in 12 days, we&#39;ve just been like, fuck it, you know, it&#39;s just normal that O&#39;Toole is gained. And that&#39;s where we&#39;re at now. So give me your analysis on what this number means, maybe from the standpoint that Stephen Carter did, which is, yes, it&#39;s one day, but also, let&#39;s start having the conversation of inside the liberal camp right now. And how are you reading it in there?</div>

I&#39;m not going to sit there and say everybody saw this coming or whatnot. But like this is such a tiring and disappointing campaign. We&#39;ve gone from the whole sunny ways to the end of days with Justin Trudeau where all of a sudden he is just kind of raising all of these alarms about this political party that only has a chance to be government because he&#39;s decided he wants an early election. And it&#39;s just it&#39;s impossible to ignore the cynicism of that. And I think it&#39;s just too much. I think it&#39;s just been put in front of Canadians to a degree where they&#39;re just they&#39;re not having it. They&#39;re not happy. And I&#39;m so disappointed, because I feel a bit like Lucy with the football, you know, this time with the Liberals, it&#39;ll be different. We always say that, right? Oh, Chrétien, he won&#39;t be like Turner. Oh, Turner, he won&#39;t be like Trudeau. And here we are now with another Trudeau, and he won&#39;t be like all of those other guys, right? Right. But no, it&#39;s started with a bunch of grand promises very quickly. It went from breaking promises on how quickly they were going to bring people in from Syria. That was supposed to be the last election under first past the post. It&#39;s just, you know, the cynicism of it all and the cronyism that came along with it.

And I really did think that that video was that was put out of Justin Trudeau was not, not the best work I&#39;d ever seen. You know, it&#39;s, here&#39;s what I&#39;ll say more foundationally. When you are a political party that starts a campaign by saying this is about the future of our country, post COVID, everything has changed, everything has changed. And we&#39;ve now got to go to the people to talk about things we never could have talked about before. You don&#39;t bring out the same fucking tired attacks on health care that you&#39;ve run for every election since I&#39;ve been alive, right? And this is part of what I mean where I say there&#39;s just like this foundational dissonance in how the liberals have run their campaign to this point.

You know, get to this point of O&#39;Toole could win, but he shouldn&#39;t. And talk about your plan for child care. Talk about your plan for COVID, sure, but be very careful. Talk about growing the economy and jobs and finding the liberal way to do that and define these things. As I think you successfully did during the budget.

Let me talk a little bit about O&#39;Toole because he&#39;s also, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s not knowing that you&#39;re not going to do perhaps a power down script of the next 12 days. He&#39;s been really confusing up until this point. Maybe you&#39;ll disagree. I&#39;m actually curious to hear if you do. He&#39;s been going with some very dog-whistle-y things that he has in the platform, but announces some union-related items this week. He talks about gig workers and their future. He&#39;s doing some worker stuff back and forth. How do you deal with O&#39;Toole? And maybe more specifically, let me actually make you switch teams, Corey. How are you planning Act 2 if you&#39;re O&#39;Toole? You have the same 12-day stretch. You may not need a rewrite, but you certainly need an expansion pack to make sure more of this good feeling of what the first 12 days have been continue. What are you doing if you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole right now, knowing that Trudeau is also probably going to lean into his strength somewhere in the ballpark of what Carter was saying?</div>

Tell me about your experience having had done that, I&#39;m assuming, having had to do these mid-campaign rewrites. What are some hard lessons learned or stories or anecdotes that you would share if someone from that camp right now is listening to some advice for them as they head into this rewrite and this whiteboard session? profession</div>

          <div class="said">would probably say that most of the errors that we&#39;ve made in previous campaigns that i&#39;ve done um are because of off script moments right so suddenly there&#39;s a young staffer who&#39;s suggesting that danielle smith doesn&#39;t understand families because she doesn&#39;t have her own kid the whole fucking world you know blows up and we&#39;re taken off script yeah we&#39;re we&#39;re going down a path that no one wants to be on no one thought this was a thing this is certainly not not a scripted moment.
