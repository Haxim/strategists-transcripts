        <div class="desc">
          <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dig into the Conservatives' pipeline motion, the Liberal response, and why Ottawa is spending its time debating make-believe infrastructure. What's the real strategy behind a motion about a pipeline that doesn't exist? How should the Liberals handle a fight built entirely on hypotheticals? And is Manitoba ready for the unique brand of chaos that follows Carter everywhere? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

It&#39;s a great way for them to get up off the mat after the beating they just took at Mark Carney&#39;s hands on matters having to do with the economy. It&#39;s a great way to wedge your opponent. And, you know, any day that you are united and your opponent is in disarray is a good day. Those are the best issues. And it allows Pierre for the maybe the first time since the election to punch back on an economic issue and get out of the culture wars that he&#39;s been kind of stuck in. So it&#39;s great for all those those reasons. And when the liberals all vote against it, he can send out his fundraising emails saying, see, the pipeline wasn&#39;t real. They&#39;re just faking it, which is, you know, a silly message, but fine for the base.</div>

Pierre Pallieva has been very, very good at putting the spotlight on the House and using it to communicate something broader to his base in particular. So I fully anticipate them using these kinds of tactics on this topic at committee and in other ways. And so, yeah, he might be able to get a little bit more knock on effect through to January and to really drive it home to his base, in particular, the people who are going to convention in Calgary. Those are good for him. And the reason why it&#39;s good is because we know that this has created tension within the Liberal caucus.</div>

Calgary liberal MP votes against pipeline. And that&#39;s a headline that, while not completely true, is also not inaccurate after the end of today&#39;s vote. And so what political cost does something like that ultimately mean for Corey? I&#39;ll kind of throw that question out there. Shannon, if you want to address it directly or not, you can.

And the last part of this conversation I want to hit on, which we can get into right now, is, okay, so this vote happens. It&#39;s happening as we speak and as we&#39;re recording right now. But what do each of the parties need to do going forward? And so for the liberals, do you think it&#39;s like tripling down on the serious concept? Do you think they&#39;re communicating to their base? do they need to move on quickly from this or do you think they can now do a bit of judo i&#39;m curious what their maximal approach on this or strategy is after this vote and then same with the conservatives who will close on at the end so carter let&#39;s stick on the liberals and give me a sense of what they need to do going forward well</div>
