Do you think that makes any difference?

Here in this country, if I&#39;m collecting anything about you, that&#39;s not publicly available. And so that&#39;s like essentially your name and your phone number. If it&#39;s in the phone book, I have to get your permission to do so. And the amazing thing about Canadian laws is I then, it&#39;s incumbent on me to check back and ensure that that information is still in the public domain. If you pull it out of the public domain and I don&#39;t take it out of my database, base, I&#39;m in violation of Canadian privacy laws. That has effects. There&#39;s no question about that because you can only layer in so many things that you can cross tabulate on. But ultimately, the only reason that information is useful in the United States is because they can get the larger sample sizes and they can cut it down to those segments. That&#39;s</div>
