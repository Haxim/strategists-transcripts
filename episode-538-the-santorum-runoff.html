            <span class="text">you too i think for any political nerd it&#39;s code because 538 is the number of electoral votes in the united states and we are here in a in a u.s federal election year i mean this is uh what are the odds that all of our episodes our entire back catalog would align line this way it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay guys we wanted to record this on july 4th but like any good american podcast we have procrastinated but we do want to talk about american</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">american politics here not just the the candidates the primaries but we also want to dig deeper into the strategy and the comparisons you know as strategists here in canada we owe a lot to um our colleagues down south but we also want to have a compare and contrast as to what&#39;s possible here, what&#39;s not possible here. And frankly, what we can do here in this country that is impossible in the States. So let&#39;s move on to our first segment. Our first segment, nation of narcs, where&#39;s your messiah now? Let&#39;s talk about two things right here. First of all, the narc in the race, and then we&#39;ll talk about the messiah. So I want to enter and give people a little bit of context. The American election is going to be November 2016. We&#39;ve got our primaries going on right now in the GOP or the grand old party, as well as the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But on the On the GOP or Republican side, there are 15 declared candidates, including one that stands out. A guy that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that is a noted egomaniac, and no, not Stephen Carter. What?</span>

            <span class="text">who actually has some hair. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s worse, having really bad hair or having no hair. I could have that hair for the right amount of money. Let&#39;s talk about Donald Trump, because I want you guys to first assess the situation of what he means to the GOP. But I also want to afterwards go into what that looks like in a Canadian context. And I&#39;ll get to that in a second.</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">second. Corey, I&#39;ll let you go first. He means ruin for the GOP. This is a bad election year to have a nut bar like Donald Trump running because there are so many people. There&#39;s what, 20 candidates declared? There&#39;s 15</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">speculated. Yeah, that&#39;s crazy. And in a race like that where there is no tall poppy, nobody looks better than the rest of them, you have a situation now where Donald Trump with 15% of the vote is the frontrunner and he&#39;s saying all this crazy shit so what americans hear is the front runner for the gop thinks that mexicans come to the country to rape and murder them and i suppose some of them are okay people perhaps</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean trump is is a caricature of everything that is wrong in american politics to be sure but he&#39;s a flash in the pan and the republicans have experienced the flash in the pan phenomenon phenomenon uh for quite some time my the 2012 election was one of my very favorite primary seasons because everybody came in got the 32 points and then dropped like a stone newt gingrich is going to save the party uh so santorum santorum who makes trump look sane santorum i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">first foray. Let&#39;s take this down to a strategy level, because if I am running a campaign for any of these 14 other, I&#39;m going to say guys, and they&#39;re all guys. Well, you got Carly Fiorina. She&#39;s not going to win. You got 13 guys in Carly, right? If you are running a campaign for someone that you think is formidable in this race, I&#39;m thinking Marco Rubio. I&#39;m thinking maybe a Jeb Bush, maybe a Chris Christie, who maybe have a little bit more chops. How do you get out of the noise that is Donald Trump, and that is going to be the next crazy person that arrives post-Trump? It could be Ben Carson, could be someone else. How do you get past that noise if you&#39;re running that campaign? Well, I think</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? You sit down and you do your work, you raise your money, and then you put your oppo research team to work, and you allow these candidates like Trump to raise themselves to the point where they just get popped.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">getting early leads in party races? I don&#39;t remember seeing this either in the liberal leadership in the last two decades or on the conservative side. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but what&#39;s the salient difference here? Or</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">how would we ever know? I mean, you can&#39;t really effectively poll in a Canadian leadership contest because the people who are determining is not the general public. We&#39;re not with we don&#39;t with the exception of the liberals, sort of. We don&#39;t have a primary system in this country. So you have to be a dues paid member. You usually have to be a member for X number of months before that. Then, of course, there&#39;s waiting by writing, which has had various formulas over the years. So I&#39;ve seen polls in a lot of the major leaderships, but they&#39;re always seen as just kind of junk science. I mean, there&#39;s nothing behind them that you can really put your</span>

            <span class="text">back. I mean, it&#39;s not just that. I mean, Canadian politicians migrate to the middle. American politicians of late have been testing this let&#39;s go further right or left. because there&#39;s only two parties there can you can kind of approach things like really to win the base of the Republican Party I have to go far right and you&#39;ve seen a number of people leap to the front with that type of strategy they haven&#39;t won yet</span>

I mean your state government, your federal government, your local government, your county government, they&#39;re all Democrats or Republicans with a few notable exceptions. They pick their team and then they move through the ranks and that has a strange effect because all of of a sudden you&#39;ve got positions that would be well outside the mainstream federally but they&#39;ve gotten enough success in an area such as arizona where you&#39;re able to propel yourself to a higher level of profile instantly one more thing i wanted to say yeah i was thinking here i</span>

            <span class="text">I want to go back to your larger point of polling here, because I think it&#39;s very interesting. The robustness of the American polling system and the political system, even in the primaries on both sides, is enormous. It&#39;s something like we haven&#39;t seen here in Canada, and we don&#39;t witness here. Carter, take us through what you you see as the differences between polling here in this country, which as of late has a horrible rap, and polling in the United States where you&#39;ve got people, you know, 538 and Nate Silver, who&#39;ve been able to project almost everything that&#39;s going to happen. What&#39;s the deficit? What&#39;s the delta that&#39;s taking place between the two countries? First</span>

Now, the highest number of independents have been registered in the united states ever right the independent movement because you can&#39;t call it really a party the independent movement is uh has grown faster now in the u.s and is not the highest level they&#39;ve seen i think ever um</span>

            <span class="text">so but even then it&#39;s a pretty small subset right so there are now more registered independents than there are registered republicans or registered or Democrats. But when you have this two-party system, A or B, you have a much higher likelihood of being able to set it and forget it kind of a mentality on polling. So you are either going to be predisposed to vote Republican</span>

Here in this country, if I&#39;m collecting anything about you, that&#39;s not publicly available. And so that&#39;s like essentially your name and your phone number. If it&#39;s in the phone book, I have to get your permission to do so. And the amazing thing about Canadian laws is I then, it&#39;s incumbent on me to check back and ensure that that information is still in the public domain. If you pull it out of the public domain and I don&#39;t take it out of my database, base, I&#39;m in violation of Canadian privacy laws. That has effects. There&#39;s no question about that because you can only layer in so many things that you can cross tabulate on. But ultimately, the only reason that information is useful in the United States is because they can get the larger sample sizes and they can cut it down to those segments. That&#39;s</span>
