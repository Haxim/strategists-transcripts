        <p>Zain Velji is back from the UK with exciting facts about the physical dimensions of their parliament buildings. Plus: Kenney vs. Smith on the Alberta Sovereignty Act, Doug Ford's "strong mayor" system of municipal government and the strange death of the Alberta Liberal Party.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about constitutional crises, "strong mayor" systems and - inexplicably - the Alberta Liberal Party's inability to find a permanent leader. Could a Lieutenant Governor really disallow an "Alberta Sovereignty Act"? Will Doug Ford's municipal reforms result in better municipal government? And how many recalled Capri Suns could fit in the UK House of Lords? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>
