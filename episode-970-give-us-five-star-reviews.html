Can Justin Trudeau "declare victory"? Will a balanced budget change the political narrative for Jason Kenney?

Ready to go for another two hours. Let me tell you something, folks. Let me tell you. There was a lot of feedback we got from that last episode. And let me categorize it in the order, not the order it was received, the order of the popularity of the comments. Two basic tranches. Number one, two hours. What the fuck? Number two, what is Stephen Carter still doing here? here. Stephen Carter, many people disappointed that your resignation from the podcast did not last longer than, what, 15 minutes? No</div>

I think that most people who were observing it thought it was a strong use of police force that didn&#39;t go overboard, but did get the result that we were looking for. So I think the Emergency Act has been a tremendous success in doing what it needed to do to restore law and order. I still think this needs to be picked apart. I think that it needs to be picked apart about why we had to get to the place where it required the Emergency Act. But I think that anybody watching this who&#39;s on the side of law and order needs to say that the Emergency Act worked, which then begs the question, why do the Conservative Party no longer feel like they need to be the party of law and order?

Number one, this never needed to happen in the first place. And I think the most articulate criticism, at least on the floor, was by one Michael Chong about, you know, saying that this was a concept of rule of law and not acting on it rather than adding more laws, which is what this did. And then the second piece of criticism is, well, you don&#39;t need it anymore. So what are we doing here? And so from your perspective, when you see today and when you see what happened over the course of the weekend? Did this succeed before even kind of getting off the ground, so to speak, in this parliamentary sense?</div>

It&#39;s not, Okay, now that the Emergencies Act has been declared, it&#39;s serious. It&#39;s a limitation on rights.

I just don&#39;t think the situation has fundamentally changed simply because downtown Ottawa has cleared out. There&#39;s all sorts of reporting about the fact that many of these people have just gone to various camps in the Ottawa area, right? Now, realistically, that&#39;s</div>

And so I guess I&#39;m of two minds, and maybe not the same two minds as you two, which is not convinced it needed to be used. But if you could pass the threshold that it needed to be used, I don&#39;t think things are so fundamentally different today, as opposed to yesterday, that we&#39;re now out of the woods, right?</div>

I mean, obviously, some of that was because the former police chief was fired because there was a lot of pressure on the police commission or the police board, I guess, the Ottawa Police Board in forcing people to actually act.

But let&#39;s run through them again and see if the ground has shifted. Corey, talk to me about the liberals. What is their political risk right now? They&#39;ve gotten this thing approved through Parliament. They had a confidence vote. They got it. So it continues. I think some of the risks, maybe I&#39;ll just throw it on the table. You can tell me if you agree or disagree or add more. They extend this emergency act. It keeps dithering and takes longer and longer to actually allow them to, you know, finally terminate it or sunset it. The political risk for many saying and perhaps giving the opposition and oppositions in this case with premiers across the country, you know, something to bludgeon them constantly on the civil liberties question. What do you think the political risk is right now for the governing liberals? And then we&#39;ll work through the list.</div>

I think it was already mentioned by you, Zane, that Michael Chong made an impassioned speech with some very cogent analysis. There were a couple of liberals who made the statement that they would have voted against the Emergencies Act were it not a matter of confidence, right? Lightbound and Erskine-Smith. So, you</div>

          <div class="said">I guess one of the things about a major debate like this is it does sort of force an elevation of rhetoric. It was a more serious version of the House than we saw earlier this week, and it forces everybody to be on the record in a very literal sense about this. And so for the NDP to get there, they had to say, we are watching very, very carefully, right? So I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll take a ton to move the NDP off that if all of a sudden there&#39;s stories about rampant abuse of freezing bank accounts or anything like that. And then all of a sudden the liberals are in a real jam there.</div>

Is this crack real? Like, is this worrisome from a political operation point? Are you fine if you&#39;re the liberals this many years into governance on an issue where the center is constantly moving, that you got some people in your own caucus kind of pissed?

So I&#39;ll tease you about that ahead of time, Carter. Corey, any specific communications tactics that you&#39;d suggest as they prepare for this? And I have one in mind, and maybe I just want to stress it with you and then just see what you think. The prime minister speaking to the nation, kind of like how he did to kick this thing off. You feel like, do you close the loop in that regard? Do you let others speak on this file? Do you kind of do like a national address and kind of now expand this out to hatred? Like, I&#39;m trying to think of like what this kind of, like the closing the loop or opening the next chapter on your terms as the bully pulpit and the leader of this country looks like, because there is a political strategy there that I&#39;m sure one would have to think about.</div>

          <div class="said">Ralph Klein did when he held up the paid in full banner. We remember that iconic image from decades ago. Well, he paid it in full with natural gas royalties. Jason Kenney&#39;s paying it in full with oil royalties. And those royalties don&#39;t last forever. Where&#39;s natural gas in this recovery? Certainly nowhere where it was during Ralph Klein and Ed Stelmack&#39;s days. So this is a fake budget that will be based on this promise that oil and gas revenues will never decline, except we&#39;ve seen that they do decline and we see that the results are devastating. dating. This will be, by the way, only the second surplus in Alberta since 2007.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, so I&#39;m sometimes tempted to kind of go deep into the weeds with some of the stuff Stephen said. It is real money, I guess, is the one thing I do want to take exception with, where he says it&#39;s a fake surplus. It&#39;s real money, and that real money does allow Jason Kenney to invest in priorities that Albertans care about, right? And so that&#39;s kind of the communications win that is now available to him that wasn&#39;t in a way that was there previously. But he&#39;s able, I think, to spin quite a positive tail because in Alberta, our decline, our fiscal slide, like we started running deficits around the same time our economy started getting into a rough patch. And it&#39;s always true everywhere to some degree, but it&#39;s very true in Alberta that the fiscal situation and the economy get conflated big time. I mean, it was conflated in the government&#39;s own budget survey, right? What do you think of the economy? economy, I think the fiscal situation&#39;s bad, or something like that was one of the questions, right? But they&#39;re not the same thing. If they were the same thing, we would be talking about Russia being a superpower. We would have talked about Libya being a superpower. Those countries always ran balanced budgets. Russia has a population of 144 million and an economy smaller than Canada&#39;s at 38 million people, right? They&#39;re not the same thing. And Stephen did a pretty good job of running down the challenges that have actually resulted in this surplus. People used to put off payout in oil sands properties by continually investing in them those investments created jobs and building these things those investments aren&#39;t happening anymore the economy is not rebounding in the same way a lot of people getting pretty rich but we&#39;re not necessarily seeing it hit um hit you know the rank and file albertan the way things previously were going here</div>

They become the benefactors of their own lowered expectations on this front here. So they&#39;ve got a couple of weeks of good news here. They have an opportunity perhaps to seize the economic narrative in a way that has eluded governments since at least 2014 in this province, arguably longer. And if they do, they have a pathway to re-election, admittedly through some really rocky terrain. But this communications document, this budget that you&#39;re talking about has so many more bells and whistles than the budgets have of the past few years. Carter,</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Sure. Look, there&#39;s a lot of ways you can kind of look at a budget. I can tell you that the The fundamentals are you have a budget speech, which is tied to a budget lockup, which is the government&#39;s first attempt at controlling the narrative around the budget. There is, you know, the speech itself is a communications document. The first part of the budget is a communications document. Then there are a lot of charts and there are a lot of tables. And those tables don&#39;t necessarily tell the whole story because there&#39;s kind of the under the line numbers that say, for example, this program is getting $5 million and this program is getting $11 million and this program is actually being cut entirely. And that stuff does not actually show up in the budget documents. That stuff bleeds through the stakeholder conversations to come. And if it&#39;s good news, it&#39;s probably stuff that the government&#39;s going to announce individually in the days and weeks to come. So you&#39;ve got the big narrative, the macro narrative. This is what we want you to think when you think of the budget at the end of the day. That is all about day one. And so you have the government, you have the opposition wrestling over that narrative. There are other players on the field, of course. The government is trying to pull in as many validators as possible. The opposition is trying to have as many detractors as possible. But that&#39;s the basic day one of the budget, right? And that happens on a Thursday. And then what you have over the next couple of days is a bleeding out of some news good, some news bad. But what you want to do if you&#39;re the government is make sure that the bad news never gets a chance to stand. And you just stomp on it with good news. You keep them spinning. You keep the thing moving along. And so all of a sudden, you&#39;re at, you know, you&#39;re a committee, and you&#39;re talking about something that&#39;s maybe not great on AISH, right? Well, then there&#39;s a $20 million announcement that afternoon, or $50 million, or you drop another program, or some of that stuff, like I said, that was below the line that you wouldn&#39;t mind getting out there in the conversation.</div>

I would imagine some version of message one, this surplus, every time you&#39;re paying $1.50 at the gas station, that&#39;s where this surplus came from, reminding them not just about the cost of living challenges there, but the fact that this is about a global price of oil. That would be sort of number one. Number two, I mean, is really about talking about they&#39;ve done this by cutting out everything that makes Alberta work. This is penny wise, pound foolish.

Alberta they&#39;re paying more for insurance I mean significantly more almost double in lots of cases they&#39;re paying more right now for their electricity and natural gas than they have paid we would have frozen that in fact you&#39;ve seen through our behavior that we froze that but in fact Jason Kennedy&#39;s allowed that all to just ramp up and so the average the average household is spending more money so that the government of Alberta can can balance their budget and and that&#39;s fine I mean I guess that&#39;s it.

Well, no, that&#39;s not the problem. It&#39;s a bad thing to declare a victory you don&#39;t actually have. That is a problem because then people can throw it back in your face. But you&#39;ve got to make your own weather at a certain moment in time. And especially when you&#39;ve got an election coming up. Let&#39;s put it this way. If George W. Bush had been on an aircraft carrier with the Mission Accomplished banner and the election was in three weeks, weeks, I would think that we&#39;d be thinking that was a smart strategy, even if everything fell apart in Iraq after that.

What would you be telling the leader of the NDP as the Liberals try to define victory, the Conservatives try to do the same, try to tear them down?

Now is the time when you can stake your own path forward. That&#39;s, you know, not super compelling advice, but ultimately, he can&#39;t continue to be the person who says, yes, I&#39;ll do what Justin Trudeau wants, but tut tut, I&#39;m concerned about this.

And then there&#39;s a certain part, some of the population that says, well, I expect you to balance the budget this year. And then there&#39;s a group in between. But if you look at the people who say balance the budget this year, and you add in the people who say balance the budget in any of these next kind of reasonable horizons here, you do see a pretty solid group of the population. And like I said, there&#39;s kind of this conflating between economy and fiscal situation. If that remains, if that conflation, you know, continues to be the order of the day, people will be thinking this means good times are back for Alberta, and the economy will lead to electoral success. says.</div>
