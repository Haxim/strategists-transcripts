            <span class="text">Well, anyways, what happens, I mean, so people aren&#39;t paying attention until the last week. And now that they&#39;re doing that, people are going to start questioning on a totally different level. And they&#39;re not going to be making their minds up in a rational format. I mean, I thought Corey&#39;s blog the other day about this being an irrational action was an excellent blog post because now is when things really start to get irrational. irrational okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">campaigns start to get a little bit wonky we have segments in the show so let&#39;s go to our first one it&#39;s called bold brilliant or boneheaded and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and and the first thing i want to talk about is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is he talking about the three of us i am brilliant</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i got bold i got bold you do have to take boneheaded okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so the first thing i want to talk about i will be both brilliant and bold um rachel notley and her comments around around pipelines, more specifically Northern Gateway.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You know, I have a lot of clients in oil and gas, and I always like to disclose that up front, but that&#39;s almost the point. You know, there&#39;s a lot</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">lot of us in Alberta tied up in this industry, and there&#39;s a big risk that she&#39;s going to alienate a lot of people who are otherwise kind of cruising towards an NDP victory.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t think this is the first time I&#39;ve said this, but you can&#39;t start talking about pipelines that don&#39;t exist as though they&#39;re going to carry oil. So you can&#39;t say, well, we We didn&#39;t get Keystone XL, so Northern Gateway will happen. Or we didn&#39;t get Northern Gateway, so Kinder Morgan or the Eastern Pipeline will happen.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The pipelines that can happen are the ones that are proposed and approved by government. That&#39;s it. And I don&#39;t remember. Do you guys remember which episode that was that I said that before? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I think it was 286. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve got a clip somewhere. We&#39;ll pull it up right now. Okay, great.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, yeah, I mean, and that&#39;s a really good point. What do you think of the fact that Harper&#39;s saying we can take our oil straight to China? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that Harper&#39;s forgetting that we have to put pipelines from here to there. I mean, you can&#39;t just simply take the oil from</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">from Alberta and take it to China. We have no approved pipelines, no pipelines even thought about yet. I mean, we&#39;ve got them on the books, but they haven&#39;t even been submitted to the NEB for approval. And until such time as you have an approval from the NEB, you can&#39;t even start talking about the potential of putting a pipeline in the ground.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But I want to challenge you guys a little bit on that. Was your position extremist? I mean, you had people like Danielle Smith on Twitter defending her position. You had Jim Prentiss himself exploring doubts around Northern</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Northern Gateway. Was her position extremist in any way, or was it just not a time for nuance 10 days in the campaign? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">extreme misses the point. You gave ammunition to your opponents. This is the first thing that the Conservatives have now that they&#39;re really able to hammer Rachel Notley with. This reinforces what is pretty clearly going to be their main message over the next 10 days, which is, you</span>

And on top of that, you don&#39;t play politics with something that&#39;s this process-oriented. The best politicians recognize the things that they don&#39;t want to touch, and this is one of those things you do not want to touch. Adrian Dix, same</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, next one here. Here. The PCs and their one-front war. First of all, do we think they have a one-front war right now with the NDP? And if they do, is that bold, brilliant, or boneheaded?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

So you can pretend that you have a one front war. You can pretend that you&#39;ve only got the Eastern Front. But in fact, you&#39;ve got the East and the West, and they&#39;re now in real trouble.

It wasn&#39;t a very particularly good taste. I think that if she chose to become the progressive, she could become a centre-left progressive.
