And by the way, just to keep those who do not know what&#39;s going on, just to keep you all up to speed, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been going on podcasts. And we have put out the official strategist bat signal. The invite has gone out, by which I mean we&#39;ve been contemplating sending a email to the general info box at Government of Canada to invite the prime minister onto our show, which is a big step for us as it relates to effort. And people are saying, you know, if the prime minister hosted, great, fine. But Stephen Carter is all bluster. He wouldn&#39;t say shit. Carter, what other lines have you prepared for the PM? Let&#39;s take it from the top. Go ahead. Hey, Stephen.</div>

How many times did Pierre Polyev actually meet with lobbyists? Turns out quite a few. How many times did Pierre Polyev meet with Bay Street lobbyists? They actually put them on a map, Zane. They put it on a map the number of times in the locations of his meetings with lobbyists. And they&#39;re picking apart what I think is the hypocrisy of this statement.

And then let&#39;s go back to the executives learning politics and don&#39;t be allergic to this stuff. I&#39;m fascinated by that because we&#39;ve worked with clients, regardless of what the scope of the file is, where the most senior people want to keep their hands away from the politics rather than lean into it. And I&#39;m wondering if this is a sea change in a certain And are we going to see it? And what will that mean for organizations going forward?

I am willing to go on the record right now and say there will be the same number of lobbyists registered in the first year of a Conservative government as there are in the last year of a Liberal government. I am also willing to go on the record and say there will be just as many lobbyist meetings after the election as there were before the election. Because it&#39;s not about the government, it&#39;s about the people who are trying to bring the message. and corporations you know it&#39;s not just corporations that have lobbyists firefighters have lobbyists nurses have lobbyists like everybody has a fucking lobbyist this is what makes the world go round this is why uh lobbying is like the activity that all all political operatives do except me because i&#39;m dumb yeah</div>

But he&#39;s got that general principle. And then he also tells CEOs and executives, you guys need to learn how to play the game. Like, get your shit in order, learn what&#39;s going on. How are you interpreting that, Carter, if you&#39;re advising the C-suite of an organization today, when you&#39;ve been telling them for a long time that it&#39;s about sprinkling all over, it&#39;s about good relations everywhere. And now you have a guy being like, if the liberals fuck you, you tell them that they&#39;re fucking you, and you hold no bones about it sort of thing.</div>

He&#39;s laid down consequences on, you know, CFIB, and he&#39;s laid them down on tech, and he&#39;s laid them down, you name it, he&#39;s laid down consequences on people here. And that was really important. He laid down consequences on two businesses that he saw as not being willing to spend money on advocacy. And he laid consequences down on two advocacy groups he thought were not willing to fight the liberals enough there. And so that&#39;s what this letter is about.
