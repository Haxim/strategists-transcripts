            <span class="text">you know, here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;ve been getting so much feedback from people, which I usually do not get about the show because people don&#39;t don&#39;t talk. Assume</span>

            <span class="text">assume I don&#39;t listen, assume I don&#39;t care. And they&#39;d be right. But I&#39;ve heard so much feedback from people being like, Stephen Carter, that guy&#39;s all fucking talk. If the PM were here hosting the show, Carter would not say jack shit. And by the way, just to keep those who do not know what&#39;s going on, just to keep you all up to speed, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been going on podcasts. And we have put out the official strategist bat signal. The invite has gone out, by which I mean we&#39;ve been contemplating sending a email to the general info box at Government of Canada to invite the prime minister onto our show, which is a big step for us as it relates to effort. And people are saying, you know, if the prime minister hosted, great, fine. But Stephen Carter is all bluster. He wouldn&#39;t say shit. Carter, what other lines have you prepared for the PM? Let&#39;s take it from the top. Go ahead. Hey, Stephen.</span>

How many times did Pierre Polyev actually meet with lobbyists? Turns out quite a few. How many times did Pierre Polyev meet with Bay Street lobbyists? They actually put them on a map, Zane. They put it on a map the number of times in the locations of his meetings with lobbyists. And they&#39;re picking apart what I think is the hypocrisy of this statement. And, you know, I think that overall, Overall, Pierre Polyev put out a big swing, but he wound up taking a pretty big strike.</span>

So I interpreted that as an attack on lobby groups, which are expected to be perpetual and sustained, and they want to sustain for their own existence between governments, right? They don&#39;t want to just be relevant when there&#39;s a conservative government. They don&#39;t want to just be relevant when there&#39;s a liberal government. So they are regularly making sure they have supporters everywhere.</span>

And they&#39;re going to have those conversations, and they&#39;re going to build those bridges. That&#39;s part of their job. And it&#39;s not just because of their clients&#39; interests, I guess, is what Pierre Polyev is trying to say. It&#39;s because of their interests in self-sustaining and self-perpetuating.

Because it&#39;s not about the government, it&#39;s about the people who are trying to bring the message. and corporations you know it&#39;s not just corporations that have lobbyists firefighters have lobbyists nurses have lobbyists like everybody has a fucking lobbyist this is what makes the world go round this is why uh lobbying is like the activity that all all political operatives do except me because i&#39;m dumb yeah</span>

But he&#39;s got that general principle. And then he also tells CEOs and executives, you guys need to learn how to play the game. Like, get your shit in order, learn what&#39;s going on. How are you interpreting that, Carter, if you&#39;re advising the C-suite of an organization today, when you&#39;ve been telling them for a long time that it&#39;s about sprinkling all over, it&#39;s about good relations everywhere. And now you have a guy being like, if the liberals fuck you, you tell them that they&#39;re fucking you, and you hold no bones about it sort of thing.</span>

Now, what he means by that is, if you&#39;re not willing to fight the liberals when they do things, I have no time for you. and he&#39;s much more interested in direct action by these groups and a more hostile stance with with people who have what he perceives as anti-business agendas so like it&#39;s so fascinating to me and actually i gotta say there&#39;s so much in this letter as i read it i think you</span>

            <span class="text">If he had written this letter without naming specifics, this letter wouldn&#39;t scare the shit out of people. And he needs this letter to scare the shit out of people. He needs people to- He means it when there&#39;s consequences. Not only does he mean it, he&#39;s just laid down consequences on the Business Council of Alberta. He&#39;s laid down consequences on, you know, CFIB, and he&#39;s laid them down on tech, and he&#39;s laid them down, you name it, he&#39;s laid down consequences on people here. And that was really important. He laid down consequences on two businesses that he saw as not being willing to spend money on advocacy. And he laid consequences down on two advocacy groups he thought were not willing to fight the liberals enough there. And so that&#39;s what this letter is about. It&#39;s about layering in with specifics, things that make it seem like he means it. But it&#39;s not actually about the companies. I do agree with Stephen on that one. It&#39;s about saying, I will let you all burn if you don&#39;t support me.</span>

Is this a take a beat and this will all go hat? Because this is pre-election posturing.

Number two, if you&#39;re advising clients, would you say Peer doesn&#39;t want it, so you&#39;re not doing it? Or would you still say, no, still do it, because others will attend, and you could still influence Peer that way. So give me both. Give me your sense of what&#39;s going to happen on the tactics. If you&#39;re going to see some of the things he&#39;s outlined, and are we going to see less of them? And number two, if you were recommending to an organization, would you tell them to, you know, swap it up?
