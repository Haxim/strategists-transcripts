          <p>The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth begins, but without regular guest Justin Trudeau - who, with his premiership under fire, skips the ten day festival to go to a four day meeting.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss challenges - explicit, implicit and accidental - to Justin Trudeau's leadership, and Trudeau's decision to skip the Calgary Stampede. Has a bunker mentality set in at the PMO? Do attempts at caucus management risk making the caucus unmanageable? And why did none of the gang make a joke about the Flair Airlines Stampede Party serving half glasses of ginger ale and tiny pretzels? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

It went so bad that the parents that were there, we were trying to manage them so that you would speak in small groups to the trustees. The parents that were there pulled out the bleachers in the gymnasium and demanded that the trustees start talking to them. We literally evacuated the trustees into a hallway. This was all over school lunch programs. I mean, like, it was a fucking gong show. Corey, dude. So people aren&#39;t reasonable, and especially they&#39;re not reasonable in groups. But</div>

Of course, you can&#39;t do stupid things that are going to get you abuse at caucus. But it can never feel like you&#39;re managing the caucus. And so one of the interesting things that they are now having to contend with is they are clearly doing the things Stephen said, which is trying to get into small groups to diffuse the situation. And the minute somebody feels they&#39;re being managed, your ability to manage them drops to zero. It&#39;s probably the same reason why Stephen had that bleacher situation at the CBE, right?

So that they feel like, because you don&#39;t want to go in with all your changes, and then the caucus says, well, that&#39;s not enough, and you don&#39;t have another change in your back pocket. You want to go in and say, these are our first changes, or these are all of our changes. And then they say, that&#39;s not enough. And you say, tell me what would be enough.</div>

            <div class="said">know my advice to any prime minister&#39;s office any premier&#39;s office is facing a similar thing is like, you know, anything you do before it, they&#39;re not going to hear. So just, you gotta, you just gotta get it out of the way. You find it an opportunity to sort of like reset the agenda being like, okay, we&#39;re going to lunch. We&#39;re all going for drinks. It&#39;s the end of the day and try to reset back to all of that table setting activity you do the very next day. But in that first part where you have to directly address these things, I think Stephen&#39;s advice is, is pretty good. I mean, I would, I would make small tweaks, but I don&#39;t even think it fundamentally changes what he said it&#39;s probably more style stuff that would come out like you don&#39;t go in and say here&#39;s what i&#39;m going to do i&#39;ve been thinking about this alone you say hey in those smaller meetings i heard this so here&#39;s what here&#39;s what i&#39;m thinking we can do based on the conversations i had i&#39;m now validating that with you right i heard these things in all of my calls with you all and all of the meetings i had my team had with you over the summer george i heard you about the carbon tax ken i heard you about my hair you know whatever it is right and you just you go through and then inevitably steven&#39;s right your opening bid can&#39;t be your your walk away position you&#39;ve got to have something in kind of the reserve that you can then go and say whoa okay okay i hear that&#39;s not enough ken what if i shaved my hair entirely off like you don&#39;t have to look at it at all i&#39;m not even saying a short haircut ken no hair that&#39;s what i can offer you ken so you know there&#39;s got to be that ability but i do think it would be a real fucking mistake to schedule it in such a way that you&#39;re doing a bunch of shit nobody cares about or is just like all they can hear is that ringing before this conversation and then you leave with that conversation being the last thing you want the last thing to be your reassertion of the agenda so find a way to insert a hard break and then come back and reassert yourself as prime minister with a plan and do the stuff you normally do at a caucus retreat after carter</div>

Like don&#39;t fuck about on these things and just get the caucus meeting together. There is an advantage in that people will not have the opportunity to quote unquote organize against you. You sort of maintain advantage. You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re afraid of people. Well, that ship may have sailed, but imagine that he just said, okay, well, caucus meeting it is then. Gang, let&#39;s get together. I know it won&#39;t be convenient for everybody, but let&#39;s do it. Obviously, this is an important thing. And you just, you kind of look like a leader, right? You look like a leader. You weren&#39;t dragged into it. You moved in a way that said, I can handle this. And that&#39;s so much of what the concern about him is right now. Like, he&#39;s lost the touch. He doesn&#39;t know how to do these things. He&#39;s become too insular. And you somewhat reinforce it if you don&#39;t call the caucus meeting and you start playing these games. That&#39;s my feeling. I think he should have called the caucus meeting.
