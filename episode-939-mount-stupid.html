      <h1>Episode 939: Mount Stupid</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">August 30, 2021</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about political horserace polls, protests at Trudeau events and - through the lense of a game of "Yes, and..." the NDP counterstrategy to Liberal attempts to consolidate anti-Conservative vote. What do the polls say about momentum in this campaign? How does Erin O'Toole keep from being tied to anti-vaccine protesters? And Carter's not serious about his strategy recommendation, is he? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

Nanos plus seven, ecos plus seven as well, were what the conservatives were looking relative to where they were at the start of July, or sorry, end of July, start of August. So one of the things though, that I think we need to keep in mind and look at carefully as we all become very addicted to the aggregators is just, and they all adjust for it in different ways, But it&#39;s important to look underneath the top lines there and say there seems to be at least some sort of – well, let&#39;s put it this way. Last time there was a bit of a divergence between the pollsters that went by phone and the pollsters that went online. And there may be some early signs we&#39;re starting to see that again here where the phone pollsters are seeing a little bit more movement</div>

          <div class="said">Dynata. There you go. And so in many cases, you might be surveying from the same basic pool. The other thing is the longer these go on, it&#39;s tough. To curate a panel is tough. You know, a new panel is better than an older panel because over time, people just drift in and out of it. And that can really change the composition of your panel. So, something worth watching, but I think regardless of the methodology you prefer, regardless of how you feel about one pollster versus the other, they&#39;re all telling a story that&#39;s pretty consistent, which is that the Liberals have declined by a pretty noticeable amount, the Conservatives have increased by a noticeable amount, and the NDP have increased as well. Well, some of the pollsters see as much as the conservatives, some see less. But when you consider the lower starting point, it&#39;s probably, you know, it&#39;s as significant an increase in many ways. So really fascinating stuff here. Real</div>

It was exactly 100 percent inverted when the election day actually happened. And there&#39;s oftentimes a question, does the poll lead the outcome, right?

          <div class="said">use daily tracking. We use daily tracking in an election campaign, but we&#39;re not using it the way these guys are using it. We&#39;re not using it to in some way predict the outcome. What we&#39;re looking for is trends and we&#39;re looking for momentum shifts. And I think that all of us agree that there has been a momentum shift from the liberals to the conservatives in the first two weeks of this campaign. That is true. True. But momentum shifts do not remain constant. Momentum shifts back and forth. And in a five-week campaign, you&#39;ll often see a couple of different momentum shifts. And not only that, how we interpret the momentum shift is often wrong. Corey&#39;s interpretation of the NDP in Greece, which I did not argue with because I&#39;d seen the same polls, turns out when you do a little bit more depth, in-depth study, a little bit more in-depth looking at it, it was incorrect. It was overstated, right? So it&#39;s not actually the thing that we think is happening. So if you&#39;re going to use these daily tracking polls, first of all, never use an aggregator. They sometimes get things right, but for the most part, that is not science that&#39;s guessing. And if you have polling in a ward or in a riding, then you have something that matters. If you&#39;re just aggregating a national poll, what you&#39;re doing is getting lucky is what you&#39;re trying to do. You&#39;re trying They&#39;re trying to take numbers and magic them into the right meaning. So I wouldn&#39;t look at the aggregators at all, nor would I look at a national poll and say, well, this is how it&#39;s going to work out provincially, because it doesn&#39;t work that way. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to tell everybody. Now, sometimes it will. And especially at the end, they will find a national poll that matches it to</div>

          <div class="said">how likely were people to swing votes in previous elections, you know, were they whipsawing around or were they pretty sturdy for one party or the other? I quite often in my own seat projections try to work in the principles that strong stays strong, weak stays weak. It&#39;s the middle that really moves around because parties don&#39;t necessarily have the capacity to follow up on an increase in kind of drifting support. If they&#39;re truly weak, there&#39;s probably not a local constituency association that&#39;s got that strength. strength if you are strong you really hold on to these things you know it&#39;s they&#39;ve got kind of a culture of being strong there it&#39;s the middle where that movement happens and if you think about their share of regional numbers when you look at that you&#39;ve got to sort of adjust for that but ultimately i guess what i would say about seat projections and my caution to everybody here is that you are taking polling which is a science where you&#39;re generalizing based on the results of a thousand people and then you are layering on another thing and so by layering upon layering hearing here, you are getting kind of somewhat removed from the data,</div>

I want to understand how certain demographics are responding. That&#39;s the true value. And that&#39;s what Stephen was talking about here. The horse race polling on the national level is fun to watch and it gives people something to talk about. It&#39;s kind of like sports commentary. It&#39;s like random number generators that allow us to have commentary and narrative. But ultimately, it&#39;s only stepping back. Do you actually see anything particularly interesting there?</div>

          <div class="said">You know, Carter and Corey and I appreciate the comments or even the defensive polling. I can say that all three of us have used it extensively professionally and within the confines of a political operation or campaign. But I want to bring up Carter&#39;s point for a second, which was about me, of course, and the Nancy campaign in 2017. 17. You know, one of the things that we realized from that campaign is that polling had gone from being strategic, where it was always used as indicating viability. And if you were down three points, you could always wave it in front of your supporters to be like, if we get more fucking people out, we can do this thing, or we&#39;re actually in the hunt. It&#39;s always been used as that metric to kind of then being weaponized a little bit more. Good or bad, we don&#39;t really know. On the national stage, however, there seems to be at least a bar for what a registered poll But I&#39;m wondering, just getting your guys&#39; thoughts on, do you feel like there could be a poisoning of the well here, that someone might try to just say, if that momentum keeps continuing for the Conservatives, that a couple outliering polls for the Liberals, will that neutralize polling in your mind? Will that just poison the well and make people confused? I&#39;m kind of curious from the strategic narratives that might come about should a case like the one that I faced and our campaign faced a couple of years ago emerge here. I see both of you chop it at the bit. So, Carter, I&#39;ll let you go first and then Corey jump in. I&#39;m</div>

And we&#39;ve been talking about when do people turn on, when do people start to pay attention to the elections. And I think that these polls have actually will wake people up. And I suspect it&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen in the next couple of weeks is you&#39;re going to see a strengthening of the liberal brand. And what will happen is people will say, well, liberals are now going up because the, you know, the number of violent right wing attacks or the violent protests outside of out of Trudeau&#39;s office. Now, I&#39;m sure that that doesn&#39;t help the conservatives, but I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s actually going to be the causal reason. I think that you&#39;re going to start seeing people return to their normal lives. And as they return to their normal lives, they&#39;re going to start answering the phones differently. I think we&#39;re going to start seeing people engage with this election differently. and the the idea of a 10-point main street poll that&#39;s got a 10-point lead for the conservatives will create a a natural backlash so i&#39;m not seeing it necessarily as the same weaponization that you are i think that i</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, well, I&#39;m not going to go so far as to say that the polls that you&#39;re talking about in the Calgary election were weaponized. I think that we need to make two things super clear. One, Alberta in general and Calgary in particular are very difficult places to poll, particularly for national firms. If you look at the track record for national firms in Alberta elections, it&#39;s not great. It&#39;s really bad. And if you go to 338canada.com right now, and you say how, you know, they&#39;ve got like the pollster ranking, what you&#39;ll see is almost none of them get involved in Alberta, because it&#39;s so not great. And those that do get rankings of like D and C, and they get killed by the local people like Janet Brown, who really understand the market and can adjust for things in a way that is responsive to the Alberta market, right? right? And there&#39;s some reasons for this. And it does ultimately get down to this notion that every place is somewhat distinct. But I think Alberta is more distinct than other places for a couple of specific notions. One of them is that we are a younger province, we are a wealthier province. And so demographically, there&#39;s some tweaking that needs to occur beyond the degree that you normally need to apply in a national context. And so that&#39;s important. That&#39;s got to keep in mind. The other thing is, when you wait, when you&#39;re a pollster, and you&#39;re doing telephone phone polling and you&#39;re waiting you</div>

The way people kind of break and divide may be entirely different in a municipal context. So by waiting to deal with the national adjustment, you may actually be expanding error when you talk about a municipal campaign. We all take for granted, adjust for age and gender, and that will correct your poll. But</div>

I like that because when I was talking about weaponization, it wasn&#39;t targeting a single poll. It was the fact that we had one poll saying the race is 12 points this way, another poll saying the race is 12 points another way. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that to that point, do you feel like should that happen in this race, that we have conflicting polling? Maybe that&#39;s a better use, that there is actually a strategic choice within some campaign or another to say, screw it, my objective here is to poison the well on polling. Because I am down or because I&#39;m behind or because they&#39;re not favoring me, I&#39;m just going to try to get something out there that might tell a different story so that the voting public could just be like, fuck it, I don&#39;t trust this shit at all.

Guys, it was the headline, it was the name, it was the title of Justin Trudeau&#39;s campaign video. We barely heard him utter it at any point during the campaign, but now he might have to act it because for the second time in a week, liberal leader Justin Trudeau has had a campaign event disrupted by protesters shouting obscenities, uttering death threats against the prime minister and hurling racist, and misogynistic insults at people of color and women in his protective detail. While making a stump speech to promote his party&#39;s climate change policies in Cambridge, Ontario, Sunday morning, i.e. this morning, the Liberals were forced to delay Trudeau&#39;s appearance for an hour because of these disruptions. Signs brandished by angry protesters displayed slogans such as, who benefits from the lockdown? And the Liberals ruined the country, with one protester shouting through a megaphone decked out with the name InfoWars, a US-based far-right conspiracy theory website. In response to this, Justin Trudeau said he&#39;s going to power through, he&#39;s going to keep going, he&#39;s going to move ahead. He&#39;s committed too much to these policies, he&#39;s leading into them. Let&#39;s talk about both the situation and then the raw politics of it. And I don&#39;t want to gloss over the situation before getting to the raw politics. Because while we do want to focus on that, I don&#39;t want to be too crass about it. Carter, have you seen anything like this on the campaign trail? I know we&#39;ve seen this sort of rhetoric. This fuck Trudeau rhetoric is pretty popular where we live. So it&#39;s not like this is foreign to us. But have you seen anything like this on a national campaign trail before from what you&#39;re seeing right now with the last two appearances, at the very least, and then the string before with Justin Trudeau and his campaign?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think that we&#39;ve seen this type of stuff before. I think we&#39;ve seen it nationally, you know, where people stand up and they protest and they have signs and that type of thing. Going to the leaders event and protesting the leaders event has been a little bit of a national sport. The difference is the level of anger. The difference is how far this is going. I have video that was sent to me from Chrystia Freeland&#39;s office with With protesters, arguably, assholes, fuckheads, dildos, walking up and down in front of her office, pounding on the windows, telling her to come out. I&#39;ll post that on Twitter so that people can see the actual video. I&#39;ve never seen it get to this stage. I mean, yeah, there&#39;s people who are angry in the past. There&#39;s people who want change and feel like the political overlords are holding them back in some fashion. That&#39;s fairly normal. But to see this level of vitriol and having to see it beyond the leader&#39;s office seems pretty weird to me. I haven&#39;t seen it. I mean, I have seen it in campaigns, the Sandra Jansen leadership, our event, you know, when we went to Red Deer one year and, you know, she left the leadership right after because of, well, the things that were done and the things that were said and, you know, the potential for really bad things. and i&#39;ve you know this isn&#39;t the way the politics are supposed to be done this isn&#39;t the way our democracy is supposed to work but sadly people</div>

But let&#39;s be clear, this is not an Aaron O&#39;Toole crowd. These people probably hate Aaron O&#39;Toole as much as Justin Trudeau, you know, nine out of ten of them. And this is much more of that PPC, Maverick Party ilk. And ultimately, I think they will also be coming after the conservative candidates and they will be just being a nuisance writ large. and i wouldn&#39;t put all of your chips on this and the reason i say it could be a bit of a siren song is if that the liberals really lean into this a it could become clear they&#39;re trying to lean into it and they should be careful about that because pretty ham-fisted well feed that cynicism that we&#39;ve talked about in the past and you continue going back to this well at a certain point people will say well what the hell is going on here um there it also is people who are angry with the prime minister and created an insane tension that canadians are not that wild about but the other thing is you might just be um you know just feeding this this general sense of malaise within the country so be careful be mindful uh a lot of canadians don&#39;t know how to process this right now they are not sure whether this is uh</div>

          <div class="said">what it comes down to is, is you need to create some sense that perhaps they that they are wrong, that in fact, the NDP are the ones who you should put your votes towards. And that&#39;s where all of the momentum lies. And, and so you have a couple of things you can point to. And you can say, No, absolutely not. You know, there&#39;s, there&#39;s about five different reasons why this is a mistake. First of all, the liberals have told you that it would be the last election and first passed the post. That&#39;s clearly not the point. So if you want the things you want, you&#39;re going to have to vote for them. There&#39;s no intermediate step here. The only way to get NDP values, values that you support, is by voting for the NDP. The second thing you do is say we have all of the momentum right here. If you look at the polls, you can see that the Liberals are in decline and you see that the NDP are on the upswing here. If you were to throw your votes to the Liberals, all you&#39;d be doing is money in the situation and keeping that split exactly where where the conservatives need it to be government. So yeah, we agree with the fundamental premise of the liberals, which is you don&#39;t want a conservative government. But we also know that there&#39;s a ceiling to the liberal vote, and it&#39;s dropping rapidly. And the ceiling for the vote is much, much higher. The only option to a conservative government is an NDP government. The liberals just cannot get it done. So all you would be doing is putting your votes towards an opposition that&#39;s going to be run around by the conservative party.</div>

Is it a sit down on network television? Is it buying some airtime somewhere? Is it like making a case? Is there something that could just totally crystallize this, that might be different, unique, could really try to put Jagmeet Singh in second gear if this is indeed the strategy, that we are the choice, not the liberals.

          <div class="said">It&#39;s not fucking great, Zane. We have a situation where we&#39;re seeing COVID climb, and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any kind of next act, right? right? It seems to be how far can this go? Will this wildfire burn itself out? And when will that occur? And as a result, you&#39;re seeing a lot of private organizations fill the gap. You&#39;ve seen, for example, Calgary Sport and Entertainment say, no, you&#39;ve got to be double vaxxed to go to a hockey game. Carter alluded to that earlier. You are seeing, insofar as the government is getting involved at all, it&#39;s the don&#39;t call it a vaccine passport passport that you&#39;ll soon be able to download so that different organizations will allow you to do this. But I think it&#39;s fair to say that Albertans right now are feeling somewhat at the whims of of fate and it&#39;s a very weird feeling to be in and of course to be a province that is just what between 10 and 15 percent the population of this country and be 33 percent of the COVID cases right now is not a comfortable place to be that said I will also say I don&#39;t see people moderating their behavior an awful lot you go out there and you see very full places full restaurants full crowds not a lot of mask use right now. So it does feel like we&#39;re just sort of careening into something here. And we haven&#39;t even gotten back to school yet. We haven&#39;t gotten to cold weather where people are indoors. It&#39;s hard to imagine that this is going to end particularly well. But there&#39;s a certain nihilism</div>

And I think that Jason Kenney has tried to will a new reality that said the Delta variant isn&#39;t going to come back. It&#39;s not something that matters. COVID is done. We defeated it. You know how I know that? Because he said it. It&#39;s done. His team said it as well. And Corey&#39;s point months ago was if we could get to these new measures, if we could see that, you know, maybe it won&#39;t be case count in the future. Maybe case count is a wrong measure. Corey said that. And I&#39;ve been thinking about that ever since he said it. But then what we&#39;re starting to see now is that back is the hospitalization rate. The ICU rates are as high now as they were in the second and third waves. And that&#39;s the problem.</div>

Justin Trudeau announcing a $1 billion fund for provinces that choose to announce a system for vaccine passports.

Carter&#39;s right, it could potentially help here in Alberta, and maybe that&#39;ll be a couple of seats, and maybe that&#39;ll be the difference. But when you talk about the national context, not a huge deal. deal. The feds had already announced that they were going to have a vaccine passport of some sorts for international travel. So this seems somewhat consistent with that in many ways. It didn&#39;t feel like a ton of new news. It felt like it was one of those things that was an attempt at a wedge with Aaron O&#39;Toole more than anything else or to start a fight with Jason Kenney. I wasn&#39;t really entirely sure, but it didn&#39;t seem like it was earth shattering, at least when it was dropped, because correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I&#39;m fairly certain that Ford had already acquiesced.

On that front, do you feel like you&#39;ll be successful, he being Trudeau here, in actually picking a fight with Kenny Carter? I&#39;ll start with you first. Like, do you feel like this will work?
