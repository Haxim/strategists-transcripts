            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">So we&#39;re going to rewind to Thursday is when this all starts. Premier Daniel Smith is at a press conference in Edmonton, and she says that she had asked Alberta Crown prosecutors about charges related to COVID-19 health violations.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">She also said something similar to Rebel News in December, media rights stories. It&#39;s Friday. She walks us back. Her office sends out a statement. um they say she had discussions with the justice minister and attorney general and the deputy attorney general the statement says at no point has she communicated with crown prosecutors as she had previously said again media right stories and then it&#39;s saturday uh she does her little radio show that she does and she says on air that she has urged minister chandro and his deputy attorney general to consider whether the cases were in the public interest and whether there there was a reasonable chance of conviction before proceeding. So she&#39;s now told media three different things, and there are more stories. Before I jump into my questions, which is to come, I think it&#39;s just worth mentioning, former UCP Justice Minister Casey Maddow was temporarily removed as Justice Minister for interfering in the judicial process over a traffic ticket. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">What&#39;s going on? What do you make of all of this? Is she is she lying? That&#39;s what the NDP opposition say. Is she just being, you know, flip it with her language? Does she not know how the justice system works? What is what&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">what&#39;s Premier Smith doing? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">she was either lying the first time or the second time or the third time. One of those times she&#39;s probably lying. So that&#39;s an easiest Occam&#39;s razor type of understanding of what she&#39;s actually doing. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But then there&#39;s another reason or rationale for what she&#39;s doing, and that is to ensure that she is appealing to her base. There is a base of people, like I&#39;m not sure, Annalise, maybe you&#39;ve been following these trials of the pastors that are promised pardons by Premier Smith. But I&#39;m not following those trials. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re somewhere, though. There&#39;s a very small group of Danielle Smith supporters that are following them. And her signaling to those folks of she&#39;s still trying to influence the independent process of the prosecutors. I</span>

But I think that the first lie was told to win over that group of potential voters, because that&#39;s been her modus operandi. She always makes sure that she&#39;s signaling to her base, and then she moves away from it. And that&#39;s what she&#39;s done from Thursday until today.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s two experiences that Danielle Smith has gone through that always push her into signaling to her base. The first experience was when she won the Wild Rose leadership. She felt that the base carried her there, and she will always signal to that base because that base is the group of people that took her there. And the second thing is in 2015, as leader of the Wild Rose, when she crossed over, the reason that she was crossing over wasn&#39;t because she thought it was a great idea. It was because she was losing the caucus that she was leaving behind. There were essentially two caucuses in the Wild Rose. much the same way as there&#39;s two caucuses or three caucuses in the UCP. And she knows that by holding the base, she at the very least holds most of the caucus. So that&#39;s what she&#39;s trying to do, is hold the base and hold the caucus. And she will, I would be willing to bet that you would never be able to pry her fingers out of that base for as long as she serves as UCP leader.</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, so you asked Carter, is she lying? Is she being flippant? Does she not know how the justice system works? Well, I don&#39;t think any of those are mutually exclusive and it&#39;s a combination. It&#39;s also a bit of that old radio host, tall tale stuff. I caught a fish that was this big. I talked to a crown prosecutor that was this convinced, right? And you got to consider who she was talking to when this story originally came out. It was Ezra Levant. And then, of course, she repeated it. And then everybody rolled the tape on Ezra Levant and said, wait, you&#39;ve said this a couple of times. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t be interfering in the justice system. And I think that I agree. My gut is that she never talked to a crown prosecutor. And there&#39;s a simple Occam&#39;s razor version of that. How is she going to talk to a crown prosecutor? Does she have a bunch of them? Is she picking up the phone and just randomly dialing them? Is she choosing them? I feel like she would not be able to put together the pieces to do that. And the most obvious person she&#39;s going to talk to if she has a problem about this in the justice system is the deputy minister, the attorney general, the deputy attorney general. Not really sure that it&#39;s appropriate for her to be talking about a case with those individuals either, but here we are. And to be fair, it&#39;s quite possible, you know, to see your point about does she just not know how the justice system works, that she was using prosecutor in just this insanely general term, right, including the person who the prosecutors report to. the manager of the prosecutors, which would be the attorney general. So, you know, it&#39;s all very possible. But I think ultimately what comes down to is she knows that the people who put her in the job really</span>

            <span class="text">Well, and actually, let&#39;s just say she believes this. Right. I mean, she stood up there and she said that she thought that people who did not get vaccines were the most discriminated against people in history. History is a pretty long time. In her lifetime, I think she actually said, to be fair. Still a pretty long time. Don&#39;t be fair.</span>

            <span class="text">Ted Cruz actually lived the life that Barack Obama was accused of living, just swap Africa for Canada, and we can talk about the racism inherent in all of that too. But basically the entire birther movement was to try to prove something that would have still allowed Barack Obama to run for president and, to my point, something that they were happy to give Ted Cruz a pass for because Ted Cruz was on their side. So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a next because I think that it&#39;s just not a line of attack that you&#39;re going to find as many people willing to trump it. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing. I think that&#39;s a bad thing. But they&#39;re going to give her a pass for this.</span>

I mean, our friend Kent Hare was a minister in Trudeau&#39;s government. Trudeau and Kent Hare faced similar accusations at similar times.

There&#39;s nothing really that forces you to take questions before then, unless you put yourself in front of it. Danielle Smith has shown she&#39;s absolutely fine with saying that&#39;s not on the topic. I&#39;m not going to answer that. So, you know, her version of avoiding could even physically have her in the room, frankly, over the next bit. But, yeah, I mean, if there&#39;s one thing we&#39;ve learned from the first few months of the Danielle Smith premiership, actually, if there&#39;s one thing we&#39;ve learned since 2016, and maybe we should have learned it before, is that we</span>

This is how she operates. She screwed up in 2015. She screwed up in 2012. She&#39;ll screw up. And, you know, like she screws up at every step of the way is part of her story because because she&#39;s offside with a large chunk of the Alberta population. She is on message more than we think that she&#39;s on message. But and this is where we were at the beginning saying she was lying. Yes, but she was lying with a specific intent to bringing along along her core audience. This is what she needs to do in her mind to ensure that she&#39;s able to maintain her core audience and the people that she thinks she needs in order to win the next election.

And so when we talk about message discipline, usually we talk about what we&#39;re intentionally putting out there and trying to make sure that those things are of a consistent package.

I think, in fact, he was leaving because it turned out to not be the job that he wanted. it. There&#39;s a lot of rumor and innuendo that things aren&#39;t going well in that office, that it&#39;s a hard office to be in. You can see that with your previous topic, you know, three different days, three different messages, isn&#39;t an office that people that are trying to run the show really feel comfortable in. And I want to separate, Corey did a piss poor job of this, but there&#39;s two, there&#39;s two different things that were happening. The first is the staffers is leaving. Seeing staffers leave is totally unexpected. Seeing MLA&#39;s leave, this is when they leave. They leave in the last six months. They make sure that someone else can get nominated.

Obviously, we don&#39;t know what happened, but let&#39;s go down the path that this is the start of more. Someone has left. It&#39;s raising eyebrows. She knows that the people close to her know that other people in that office are also not happy. They&#39;re thinking of leaving. You guys have been in those back rooms. You&#39;ve been in those offices. What is happening behind the scenes? What is she doing?</span>

This isn&#39;t an office that&#39;s been staffed from her team. This is an office that&#39;s been staffed from outsiders. You know, Corey talked about the staffers that were with you. I mean, if you look back to Ed Stelmack, that was his undoing. You know, everybody would go to Ed Stelmack&#39;s office and say that the problem&#39;s Ron Glenn. You know, the problem&#39;s Ron Glenn.</span>

So there&#39;s probably a lot of doors that are just simply opening slower and I will leave it to the mighty Corey Hogan to contradict my statement on that.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey Hogan No, I agree with it. I don&#39;t think – so the public service truly does not pick sides in my experience, right? I think one of the funny things that occurs amongst political set is they assume everybody Everybody cares about politics as much as them, and surely if they work in government, that must be the case. But a lot of public servants, it&#39;s a job, and they&#39;re doing it, just like if they worked at Pepsi or for the Calgary Herald or for IBM, whatever it may be. And they may have like kind of a general affinity for their organization, but it doesn&#39;t mean they live or die these things. Interestingly, we are more able to assume that people just not even punch the clock but just do their job and can compartmentalize in basically everything but government. But government is full of people who are just doing their job. Now, the reason why the public service often starts to slow walk things around this time of year is not because of any antipathy towards the governing party. It actually goes back to that I&#39;m just trying to do my job thing. I want you to imagine any other workplace where you&#39;re handed a file and you know in four months any</span>

            <span class="text">that I always like about government is that it&#39;s, you know, when it&#39;s working at scale, and when it&#39;s ramped up, it generally works pretty well. And people People don&#39;t think too much about it, and it really takes something breaking badly to make them think about it. Like the passport office was chaos. How many people were thinking like on any given week 70,000 passports have been issued forever, right? Like it just moves. It moves. It moves. And that&#39;s true of AISH.

They&#39;re going to be able to shake it out and see what money falls out of it. The start is tough. Government is a difficult startup environment. It&#39;s OK when it&#39;s established and it&#39;s moving forward. And so I don&#39;t know why any government would subject itself to creating a new process for such a signature initiative.
