            <div class="said">She also said something similar to Rebel News in December, media rights stories. It&#39;s Friday. She walks us back. Her office sends out a statement. um they say she had discussions with the justice minister and attorney general and the deputy attorney general the statement says at no point has she communicated with crown prosecutors as she had previously said again media right stories and then it&#39;s saturday uh she does her little radio show that she does and she says on air that she has urged minister chandro and his deputy attorney general to consider whether the cases were in the public interest and whether there there was a reasonable chance of conviction before proceeding. So she&#39;s now told media three different things, and there are more stories. Before I jump into my questions, which is to come, I think it&#39;s just worth mentioning, former UCP Justice Minister Casey Maddow was temporarily removed as Justice Minister for interfering in the judicial process over a traffic ticket.

But I&#39;m not following those trials. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re somewhere, though. There&#39;s a very small group of Danielle Smith supporters that are following them.

            </div>
            <div class="said">Well, there&#39;s two experiences that Danielle Smith has gone through that always push her into signaling to her base. The first experience was when she won the Wild Rose leadership. She felt that the base carried her there, and she will always signal to that base because that base is the group of people that took her there. And the second thing is in 2015, as leader of the Wild Rose, when she crossed over, the reason that she was crossing over wasn&#39;t because she thought it was a great idea. It was because she was losing the caucus that she was leaving behind. There were essentially two caucuses in the Wild Rose. much the same way as there&#39;s two caucuses or three caucuses in the UCP. And she knows that by holding the base, she at the very least holds most of the caucus. So that&#39;s what she&#39;s trying to do, is hold the base and hold the caucus. And she will, I would be willing to bet that you would never be able to pry her fingers out of that base for as long as she serves as UCP leader.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">I mean, so you asked Carter, is she lying? Is she being flippant? Does she not know how the justice system works? Well, I don&#39;t think any of those are mutually exclusive and it&#39;s a combination. It&#39;s also a bit of that old radio host, tall tale stuff. I caught a fish that was this big. I talked to a crown prosecutor that was this convinced, right? And you got to consider who she was talking to when this story originally came out. It was Ezra Levant. And then, of course, she repeated it. And then everybody rolled the tape on Ezra Levant and said, wait, you&#39;ve said this a couple of times. Maybe you shouldn&#39;t be interfering in the justice system. And I think that I agree. My gut is that she never talked to a crown prosecutor. And there&#39;s a simple Occam&#39;s razor version of that. How is she going to talk to a crown prosecutor? Does she have a bunch of them? Is she picking up the phone and just randomly dialing them? Is she choosing them? I feel like she would not be able to put together the pieces to do that. And the most obvious person she&#39;s going to talk to if she has a problem about this in the justice system is the deputy minister, the attorney general, the deputy attorney general. Not really sure that it&#39;s appropriate for her to be talking about a case with those individuals either, but here we are. And to be fair, it&#39;s quite possible, you know, to see your point about does she just not know how the justice system works, that she was using prosecutor in just this insanely general term, right, including the person who the prosecutors report to. the manager of the prosecutors, which would be the attorney general. So, you know, it&#39;s all very possible. But I think ultimately what comes down to is she knows that the people who put her in the job really</div>

But basically the entire birther movement was to try to prove something that would have still allowed Barack Obama to run for president and, to my point, something that they were happy to give Ted Cruz a pass for because Ted Cruz was on their side. So I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a next because I think that it&#39;s just not a line of attack that you&#39;re going to find as many people willing to trump it.

This is how she operates. She screwed up in 2015. She screwed up in 2012. She&#39;ll screw up. And, you know, like she screws up at every step of the way is part of her story because because she&#39;s offside with a large chunk of the Alberta population. She is on message more than we think that she&#39;s on message. But and this is where we were at the beginning saying she was lying. Yes, but she was lying with a specific intent to bringing along along her core audience. This is what she needs to do in her mind to ensure that she&#39;s able to maintain her core audience and the people that she thinks she needs in order to win the next election. I would argue they&#39;re an anchor. I think Corey would argue they&#39;re an anchor. But, you know, who are Corey and I except one really good strategist that wins and Corey?</div>

You&#39;ve got the first couple of months. December is kind of a write off with Christmas, New Year, election in May. Do you think we&#39;re going to see more of these sorts of staff departures as we get closer to the election?</div>

I think, in fact, he was leaving because it turned out to not be the job that he wanted. it. There&#39;s a lot of rumor and innuendo that things aren&#39;t going well in that office, that it&#39;s a hard office to be in. You can see that with your previous topic, you know, three different days, three different messages, isn&#39;t an office that people that are trying to run the show really feel comfortable in. And I want to separate, Corey did a piss poor job of this, but there&#39;s two, there&#39;s two different things that were happening. The first is the staffers is leaving. Seeing staffers leave is totally unexpected. Seeing MLA&#39;s leave, this is when they leave. They leave in the last six months. They make sure that someone else can get nominated.

I think one of the funny things that occurs amongst political set is they assume everybody Everybody cares about politics as much as them, and surely if they work in government, that must be the case. But a lot of public servants, it&#39;s a job, and they&#39;re doing it, just like if they worked at Pepsi or for the Calgary Herald or for IBM, whatever it may be. And they may have like kind of a general affinity for their organization, but it doesn&#39;t mean they live or die these things. Interestingly, we are more able to assume that people just not even punch the clock but just do their job and can compartmentalize in basically everything but government. But government is full of people who are just doing their job. Now, the reason why the public service often starts to slow walk things around this time of year is not because of any antipathy towards the governing party. It actually goes back to that I&#39;m just trying to do my job thing. I want you to imagine any other workplace where you&#39;re handed a file and you know in four months any</div>

            <div class="said">that I always like about government is that it&#39;s, you know, when it&#39;s working at scale, and when it&#39;s ramped up, it generally works pretty well. And people People don&#39;t think too much about it, and it really takes something breaking badly to make them think about it. Like the passport office was chaos. How many people were thinking like on any given week 70,000 passports have been issued forever, right? Like it just moves. It moves. It moves. And that&#39;s true of AISH. That&#39;s true of driver&#39;s licenses. That&#39;s true of everything government does.</div>

            <div class="said">But the ramping up of those things is always a nightmare. It&#39;s always a nightmare because it&#39;s the first time that government systems have to interact with other government systems, that somebody who&#39;s interested in defrauding the system is going to get a chance with it. They&#39;re going to be able to shake it out and see what money falls out of it. The start is tough. Government is a difficult startup environment. It&#39;s OK when it&#39;s established and it&#39;s moving forward. And so I don&#39;t know why any government would subject itself to creating a new process for such a signature initiative. Like it&#39;s a roll of the dice. Even if they manage to make it work,</div>
