It is my belief, here&#39;s a quote from a surrogate, we should have a leader in place at the start of summer, ahead of Canada Day. That&#39;s four months from now.

It&#39;s also, I think, definitely true that in Canada, we run painfully long leadership contests. I don&#39;t know. I think we just stole this from the Americans. But like many things, they should just remain in the US system and not come here, right? We don&#39;t need a year-long leadership contest. We&#39;ve had too many of those. I much prefer, personally, the British model where the contest starts, and by the next time you&#39;re actually looking at the news on it, they&#39;ve picked a leader and you go, oh, wow, that was quick. Because frankly, if you are in the the public and not one of those party member diehards it&#39;s you know like you don&#39;t you don&#39;t need all of that stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s so behind the scenes um but let&#39;s be real one of the other reasons is he thinks he can win with these people it&#39;s not just because he thinks philosophically shorter leadership contests are better there&#39;s nothing magic about canada day it&#39;s not as though on canada day all of a sudden uh there&#39;s an election or anything like that um but he wants to make sure that if there are names like Jean Charest being bandied about, they don&#39;t have time to sell the memberships they would need to change the balance in a party that right now skews pretty nutty.

Is it just an easy drive-by to say, they didn&#39;t listen, move on? Does this public advocacy have downside risk versus the backroom chatter, stacking the deck, that sort of stuff that you&#39;d expect from what you&#39;d call a front in a political race so</div>

            <div class="said">but to underline it a bit we talked about this a couple of weeks ago when he came out so strong for the leadership and whether that was the right time for him to announce and you know the logic being he might look like less of a desirable candidate even you know to a conservative party that is pretty right wing right now if um things are coming out about the the convoy protests all of that and and he he kind of has hitched himself to a wagon that&#39;s looking pretty bad at the time. Same logic applies. I just don&#39;t know if you want to let all of this languish right now. You just don&#39;t know the moment you might be going into six months from now.

So from my point of view, what they need is something that enables them to actually have a dialogue about which side of the party is the one that should be dominating. And a longer race gives them a longer time to have that discussion. A shorter race leaves them with Pierre as their primary outcome. So for me, this party needs to define itself. The shorter the race, the more it&#39;s going to tend towards defining itself on the far right wing um you know that i mean that</div>

So like shorter term than even a short term leadership. But what you don&#39;t want to do is just have them turn on the, have the voters turn on the television one day and see that Pierre is the leader. You do want the opportunity to build your brand.

Like us becoming another, I mean, Trudeau and the Emergencies Act becoming part of like the political gamesmanship down south. If you&#39;re the conservative party here, like running into a leadership, and maybe I&#39;ll say more specifically, if you&#39;re one Pierre Polyever running, you know, your leadership, Are you amplifying any of that? Are you kind of trying to bring the American style? I mean, you&#39;re already bringing some elements of it, one might argue, of the American style, you know, populism here. But are you leading pretty unabashedly into that sort of narrative in terms of what&#39;s being talked about, about Justin Trudeau down south? And on the converse, if you&#39;re Trudeau, is this kind of like good news for you in some ways that like, you know, a fringe of the Republican Party is criticizing your political actions domestically is that good news?

But as soon as the Americans start doing it, there&#39;s a closing of the ranks.

Because we&#39;ve gotten the feedback that some episodes are 29 seconds, and others are three days. And I want to try to hit closer to two and a half days on some of these episodes.

            <div class="said">undisputedly been bruised by the usage of the Emergencies Act, the inaction, but like the cocktail of inaction slash action around the convoy, it&#39;s bruised Trudeau. Like, I think the polling reflects that, you know, that in the immediate, like he&#39;s, you know, seen less favorably. And for the conservatives, they&#39;ve been using the Emergencies Act, you know, there&#39;s a debate about it, big conversation point. And we often talk about channel changers, right like if you can&#39;t do it sometimes you get lucky something happens in this case i shouldn&#39;t say lucky but there&#39;s a massive global channel yeah</div>

            <div class="said">channel changer it&#39;s no longer focused on the emergencies act which was just you know a few days ago that trudeau revoked it if you&#39;re the conservatives what i think is interesting from a political strategy level is if your opponent successfully changes or has the channel changed on their behalf how do you keep your attack going How do you ration it? How do you save it? How do you keep it up without looking crass? In this case, you will look crass if you try to like introduce that amongst the humanitarian crisis. So this is like from a strategy perspective. And I know other people want your insights on this as well, as we can hear, Carter. um but but but what would you do like if you&#39;re the conservatives here because this is this worked really well for you you knew you had him at the proverbial sort of wrestling ropes in some ways if the conversation extended if this is all we talked about leading up to the 30-day like review like we&#39;re waiting for the fucking report this guy&#39;s got blood on his hands like why did he do this why did he do this they don&#39;t have that opportunity anymore that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s still not fruit there that doesn&#39;t still mean there&#39;s not political juice there what&#39;s the art between when your opponent successfully changes a channel, how do you kind of ration the hit and make it useful down the road? And I know it&#39;s a very broad question, but I think it&#39;s one worthy of exploring. Because if I&#39;m not reading the tea leaves incorrectly, I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here.</div>

We saw it with the, I shouldn&#39;t even say leaks, but with, yeah, some of the leaks about her previous negotiations and how the KGB had nicknames for her, especially related to Russia, her unbelievable intellect, the brand created with her, as we&#39;ve talked about on this very podcast where Trudeau shows up, you know, sleek suit, slim fitting. She shows up with a binder you&#39;re full of papers being like okay let me tell you what the fucking plan is right like that that sort of story being told about her so to speak and so now we lean into um what many are calling the showdown that she&#39;s been looking forward to you know fluent in ukrainian she&#39;s a published author on russia&#39;s post-communist transition she&#39;s delivered extremely poignant remarks earlier this week invoking mlk the gettysburg and the battle of britain as analogous to this this historic democratic showdown against the bloodthirsty tyrant that is Russia. You know, she kind of even leans into hyperboles. From the perspective of what Chrystia Freeland is trying to propose as her brand, from this perspective, especially now talking about Russia, talking about overreactions, as we&#39;ve kind of introduced, not about her, but as that concept to the table, this seems like something she&#39;s been waiting for.

There was an awful lot that still could be done and needed to be done to have a strong response to Russia.

And you don&#39;t do that with chill. She has been the catalyst to action at this point. She&#39;s been the moral conscience of the NATO alliance on this front because she has that Ukrainian background and can—I mean, she&#39;s not Zelensky.

It looks divisive, it looks overcompensating, and it lacks a certain sense of understanding, not where your lane is, because I don&#39;t think this is about putting someone in their place, but where your abilities as a nation are, not your abilities as a deputy prime minister and perhaps future prime minister of this country are. That&#39;s where my tweak would come in from, which is to that downstream, and I talked about that downstream political calculation. The moment may call for it. I just, I fear she may pay a price down the road for it. That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking, Corey. That&#39;s roughly where my head was at. Not to say I&#39;m playing in this game.

            <div class="said">yeah then then kenny&#39;s looking great now kenny&#39;s kenny all he has to do if it were me i would have tweaked it a little bit more so that we he would have had um a bigger upside that he could have played a little bit more because even financial conservatives fiscal conservatives are hilarious because they always pretend like they just like they want to um not spend money but fiscal conservatives are as responsive to um golden</div>

            <div class="said">golden goose eggs as everybody else so if you were to put more spending into rural schools or you know they put 1.4 billion into the red deer hospital those types of things will win you over fiscal conservatives even though they pretend not to like them so i think that that would have been um the tweak that i would have made some more goodies and the best way to get to those goodies would have been because i don&#39;t think he had to budget he didn&#39;t have to balance it he could have been a 500 million dollar deficit and still been golden and that would have just been an extra billion dollars worth of spending that may have just given them a bit bigger upside. So tweak is my answer. Those are the types of tweaks that I would see.</div>

            <div class="said">Corey, are you tweaking or are you rewriting with how this budget by Jason Kenney was positioned? Also including the fact that, you know, based on today&#39;s oil prices, Alberta could collect more than $10 billion in extra revenue compared with the projections in the budget. So the symbolic surplus, if I can call it that, right, that small surplus in the budget, but really the headlines here are spending restraint, growth in every sector yes acknowledging the energy sector and then the historic nature of alberta leading the country and the surplus in 14 years what do you make of that positioning rewrite entirely are you tweaking it cory yeah</div>

Carter, to that point, who is the audience here? Is this a save my leadership budget? Or did you see this as a more broader budget for a broader suite of Albertans, so to speak.

It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s an order. Door number one is about the NDP, Alberta NDP response to the budget. And here&#39;s a quote from Rachel Notley. Only the UCP could have soaring energy prices and still find new ways to disappoint the hardworking people of the province. Sky-high oil prices and no stability in hospitals, 1,000 fewer teachers in schools, no real plan for jobs, economic diversification, and no help for Albertans who want to pay their utility bills today. She tried to really lean into the areas that the NDP does around, obviously, hospitals, teachers, then talk about affordability, cost of living. There was also mention of the UCP&#39;s bracket creep and, you know, senior couple losing money on Asian, a bunch of other things. But that key line, sort of top line message.</div>

            <div class="said">canada&#39;s banning russian oil imports and will send a third shipment of lethal weapons to ukraine as his military continues to fight off better-armed Russian forces, Justin Trudeau said earlier this week. Quote, Yesterday we announced that we would be sending new shipments of military supplies, including body armor, helmets, gas masks, and night vision goggles. Today we&#39;re announcing that we will supply Ukraine with the anti-tank weapon systems and upgraded ammunition. Trudeau also said that the Canadian Armed Forces will provide airlift support to transport supplies and aid to participate in other NATO efforts in support of Ukraine. Ukraine. Trudeau, you know, obviously being praised for this tougher stance, the U.S. not committing to ground troops. We are also having, you know, a fair share of criticism for Justin Trudeau, saying they refused early to provide the ammunition, the weapons. They did it kind of silently mid-February when they knew things were going to escalate. And now they&#39;re kind of, you know, in some ways behind in terms of what may have been an inevitability.

The only thing left that I feel, there&#39;s two things that are left. Number one, totally cutting off Russian fossil fuels. That has significant economic consequence for the rest of the world.</div>

And I think like the vast, vast majority of people, you know, see a sense of inspiration and hope, and obviously cinematic dramatic drama, to Corey, your point around what we&#39;re seeing in Ukraine. I think one of the narratives that I&#39;ve been focusing attention on is, you know, what happens with this in two ways, the cloud cover that this massive story has provided to other nefarious stories across the world to be dropped and be perhaps go without the scrutiny and the criticism that they require. And secondly, kind of the parallels to what a crisis with, let&#39;s be clear, white European european people looks like versus one where those are not the refugees or the sick people and i think we&#39;re going to unpack that throughout multiple conversations but there&#39;s one thing cory you mentioned here that i think is in our lane in our collective lane which is the the concept of leadership branding i am so just like you fascinated with the zielinski story here right not just a comedian turned president a comedian turned actor on a tv show where he plays plays president, turned president. Carter, I&#39;m going to throw this to you, right? You are the king of the mythology of the brand, the self-perpetuating nature of political leadership brands. Let&#39;s be clear. This was a guy that many people poked fun at, that many people were like, come on. There was eye rolls when he got elected in 2019. There was eye rolls in fucking January, early February about his capacity to lead, his strength, et cetera. But Carter, in the most rapid of circumstances, thankful to the digital age, social media, and of course, some immense bravery on his part. Talk to me about the narrative mythology story that you&#39;re seeing play out in front of our eyes, arguably the most interesting one that we&#39;re going to have to dissect over multiple episodes and perhaps multiple years, regardless of the outcome here. But let&#39;s get started on the tip of the iceberg of the political mythology that we are seeing of won President Zelensky in Ukraine.</div>

This is why we picked Dave as our theme movie, because it turns out in order to be able to play to the people, you must be able to play to the people. And this is a guy who knows how to play to the people. And I don&#39;t say those words to diminish what he has done at all, but he knew his role, he assumed his role without question, and he committed to the bit right and and it doesn&#39;t diminish the the bit is war the bit is leadership and and and putting on but he put on the helmet he put on the flak jacket he stood outside to do his filming he knew what he needed the role that was required he knew exactly what it was and he used his theatrical expertise he committed to the dance the same way he committed with to dancing with the stars in the ukraine he committed to 100 everybody who&#39;s ever danced knows the best way to dance is to go 100% into it. This is the exact same thing that he&#39;s doing with the presidency. He&#39;s going into it 100% and he knows what he&#39;s doing. I&#39;m sure he spends time in his office. I&#39;m sure that most of his day, in fact, is in his office, but he knew the best place for him to do the filming is outside where the people are, where the threat is, because that was was the best theater.</div>
