As I mentioned last time, you know, other podcasts may initiate food drives, may initiate clothing drives. No, not this podcast. This podcast initiates five-star review drives. There&#39;s a pledge in there somewhere. I don&#39;t know where the pledge goes, Corey. But we have initiated it. It is part of what we need. And think about what we could do to the world, for the world, of the world, by the world as well, Carter. We are the world. If we are given these five stars. Corey, do you concur? yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Eyes on the prize. This is what I like about you, Carter. Here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. We have eight political scenarios on the board behind eight different doors.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You are going to choose a door between one to eight. Tell me which door you&#39;re choosing. I will tell you the political scenario that we&#39;re talking about. So think about what&#39;s been going</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s a couple of things in the conservative leadership world. There&#39;s obviously some foreign affairs issues. There&#39;s some wrapping up, so to speak, of Emergencies Act. Of course, our province of Alberta threw down a budget. So there&#39;s a couple of things that we&#39;re contending with. You will pick one of these eight doors. Okay.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And then after you do, you&#39;ve got a choice. Do you want to give the current strategy that you see, the seal of approval, approval the political party or the figure in in mention is on the right track do</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">do you want to tweak it say you know what i actually i like what they&#39;re largely doing here&#39;s my tweak here&#39;s my contribution here&#39;s my free two cents of advice or do you want a complete rewrite do you want to say these people have no fucking clue what they&#39;re doing they should be dismissed of their jobs we should take over but since we can&#39;t take over since really we&#39;re already doing so much for the world being fueled by five-star reviews. What we&#39;re going to do is rewrite their strategy for them as we see it on the fly. And out of this eight scenarios, you have four seals of approval. You have two tweaks that you could do, and you could only do two rewrites. It&#39;s not like you could choose the same thing the entire time. So you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you got to think about what you&#39;re anticipating next in terms of what scenario might be behind the door. We&#39;re not going to know the doors.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You&#39;re not going to know. You&#39;re not going to know. No, I&#39;m going to tell one of you. So, for example, Corey will pick. He&#39;ll tell me door number three. I&#39;ll tell him what&#39;s behind door number three. At that point, he picks whether he&#39;s going seal of approval, tweak, or rewrite. Carter, you then have an opportunity to disagree with Corey, and then we&#39;ll kind of go vice versa. You know what we&#39;ll do? We&#39;ll do a snake draft. You know, we&#39;ll do that. Snake draft.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">rewrites on the first two segments. Yeah, of course you are. We&#39;re going to use our two tweaks when we have no rewrites left, but we&#39;re probably going to rewrite through the tweak. And then we&#39;re going to have to give four seals of approval to some truly heinous shit. That&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen.</span>

So in this case, we have to do what we have to do in the real world sometimes when we&#39;re in a strategy session. uh sometimes except that it&#39;s not hundred dollars an hour yeah bill five hundred dollars an hour and understand that you got to die on certain hills that it&#39;s not worth the fight that you just got to let 80 go and say that you fight to live another day because there might be a bigger battle to be fought and there&#39;s no way to start this than to start it and when i say that on any segment i start with one person and that person is</span>

He&#39;s saying, listen, it&#39;s premature to seriously consider until you know what the rules and the timelines are. I&#39;m taking a lot of phone calls.

I care about leadership, the state of affairs. I care about division. Stephen Carter, the question is for you. This strategy employed that we&#39;ve seen many times over, of Patrick Brown saying, listen, people are calling me, but I&#39;m not committing. He&#39;s not even saying he&#39;s interested.

It is my belief, here&#39;s a quote from a surrogate, we should have a leader in place at the start of summer, ahead of Canada Day. That&#39;s four months from now.

            <span class="text">kind of step on your own foot and fall down or something like that. Yeah. It&#39;s also, I think, definitely true that in Canada, we run painfully long leadership contests. I don&#39;t know. I think we just stole this from the Americans. But like many things, they should just remain in the US system and not come here, right? We don&#39;t need a year-long leadership contest. We&#39;ve had too many of those. I much prefer, personally, the British model where the contest starts, and by the next time you&#39;re actually looking at the news on it, they&#39;ve picked a leader and you go, oh, wow, that was quick. Because frankly, if you are in the the public and not one of those party member diehards it&#39;s you know like you don&#39;t you don&#39;t need all of that stuff it&#39;s it&#39;s so behind the scenes um but let&#39;s be real one of the other reasons is he thinks he can win with these people it&#39;s not just because he thinks philosophically shorter leadership contests are better there&#39;s nothing magic about canada day it&#39;s not as though on canada day all of a sudden uh there&#39;s an election or anything like that um but he wants to make sure that if there are names like Jean Charest being bandied about, they don&#39;t have time to sell the memberships they would need to change the balance in a party that right now skews pretty nutty.

Suppose he talks about publicly, gets surrogates out there advocating for these rules. Corey, if he doesn&#39;t get them, any risk? Does it show that he&#39;s weak, not as strong? Is it just an easy drive-by to say, they didn&#39;t listen, move on?

Same logic applies. I just don&#39;t know if you want to let all of this languish right now. You just don&#39;t know the moment you might be going into six months from now.

            <span class="text">election from an analysis perspective what type of election do you think the conservatives need it almost seems like there&#39;s a couple of templates there&#39;s a soul searching longer figure out the focal point do it in public air it out maybe sell more memberships to a broader group of people get more people in the tent solidify the position as the party with the most memberships and then eventually come out on the other end or do they need a quick decisive who gives a shit if we&#39;re we&#39;re putting our thumb on the scale, like we know our guy sort of race. Like from your perspective, and I say this knowing none of the three of us are like card-carrying conservative members, but from a political strategy level, you know, look at the time horizon, not just, you know, two months ahead, but, you know, as many would say, the next election.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? So from my point of view, what they need is something that enables them to actually have a dialogue about which side of the party is the one that should be dominating. And a longer race gives them a longer time to have that discussion. A shorter race leaves them with Pierre as their primary outcome. So for me, this party needs to define itself. The shorter the race, the more it&#39;s going to tend towards defining itself on the far right wing um you know that i mean that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that that could be the challenge now how long does this how long do international affairs dictate this right like how long you know how long does this define canadian politics you know what&#39;s going on in the ukraine and such and it&#39;s going to be well i I shouldn&#39;t say, but I think it&#39;s going to be relatively short term, right? So like shorter term than even a short term leadership. But what you don&#39;t want to do is just have them turn on the, have the voters turn on the television one day and see that Pierre is the leader. You do want the opportunity to build your brand. So having said that, I would probably pick it before July as well, but as late as possible in June.</span>

But you can build that brand, you can have that conversation in a way that doesn&#39;t take 100 years. I think it&#39;s a bit of a false, like, it&#39;s a phony argument to say we have this time, therefore, we&#39;ll have this conversation.

Big surges of activity at membership cutoff, big surges of activity right before the vote. And, you know, you could have multiple membership cutoffs. We&#39;ve seen that in the past, too.

We want anybody who sees themselves as a conservative to be able to do this, which means our membership cutoff is the day of the vote. Like, you&#39;re able to go there with your $10.

On Wednesday, getting sign-off from the Governor General on the revocation. This is, of course, after the MPs in the House of Commons voted to affirm the use of the act on Monday. Trudeau said the situation is no longer an emergency. He said we are confident that existing laws and bylaws are now sufficient to keep people safe. A lot of criticism for Justin Trudeau. You know, some people saying, listen, you needed this just for a couple of days. Couldn&#39;t we have done this without the existing laws? Was he more bruised than he actually got upside from the use of the law? Stephen Carter, the exit strategy from the Emergencies Act. Did this get your seal of approval?</span>

It&#39;s hard for me to imagine that in just like three days those were cleaned up. But, you know, here we are. The government&#39;s decided this and the sky has yet to fall. I also think I just personally find it nice that we don&#39;t have that as we are talking about freedom in Ukraine and and conversations like that, because as as as fucking so dumb as it is, you know, watching American Republicans declare a parallel between, you know, the situation in downtown Ottawa and the freedom fighters in Ukraine. crane.

Like us becoming another, I mean, Trudeau and the Emergencies Act becoming part of like the political gamesmanship down south. If you&#39;re the conservative party here, like running into a leadership, and maybe I&#39;ll say more specifically, if you&#39;re one Pierre Polyever running, you know, your leadership, Are you amplifying any of that? Are you kind of trying to bring the American style? I mean, you&#39;re already bringing some elements of it, one might argue, of the American style, you know, populism here. But are you leading pretty unabashedly into that sort of narrative in terms of what&#39;s being talked about, about Justin Trudeau down south? And on the converse, if you&#39;re Trudeau, is this kind of like good news for you in some ways that like, you know, a fringe of the Republican Party is criticizing your political actions domestically is that good news? Just give me the calculus, I guess, is what I&#39;m asking here.</span>

And I think that the Canadians feel that way when, you know, we can badmouth our prime minister, we can badmouth our leader of the opposition and such. That&#39;s our right as citizens. But as soon as the Americans start doing it, there&#39;s a closing of the ranks. And most Canadians don&#39;t like it when we get picked on by the Americans. uh there were some and i i would say even more than usual who did like at this time and they but</span>

And for the conservatives, they&#39;ve been using the Emergencies Act, you know, there&#39;s a debate about it, big conversation point.

            <span class="text">channel changer it&#39;s no longer focused on the emergencies act which was just you know a few days ago that trudeau revoked it if you&#39;re the conservatives what i think is interesting from a political strategy level is if your opponent successfully changes or has the channel changed on their behalf how do you keep your attack going How do you ration it? How do you save it? How do you keep it up without looking crass? In this case, you will look crass if you try to like introduce that amongst the humanitarian crisis. So this is like from a strategy perspective. And I know other people want your insights on this as well, as we can hear, Carter. um but but but what would you do like if you&#39;re the conservatives here because this is this worked really well for you you knew you had him at the proverbial sort of wrestling ropes in some ways if the conversation extended if this is all we talked about leading up to the 30-day like review like we&#39;re waiting for the fucking report this guy&#39;s got blood on his hands like why did he do this why did he do this they don&#39;t have that opportunity anymore that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s still not fruit there that doesn&#39;t still mean there&#39;s not political juice there what&#39;s the art between when your opponent successfully changes a channel, how do you kind of ration the hit and make it useful down the road? And I know it&#39;s a very broad question, but I think it&#39;s one worthy of exploring. Because if I&#39;m not reading the tea leaves incorrectly, I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here.</span>

She shows up with a binder you&#39;re full of papers being like okay let me tell you what the fucking plan is right like that that sort of story being told about her so to speak and so now we lean into um what many are calling the showdown that she&#39;s been looking forward to you know fluent in ukrainian she&#39;s a published author on russia&#39;s post-communist transition she&#39;s delivered extremely poignant remarks earlier this week invoking mlk the gettysburg and the battle of britain as analogous to this this historic democratic showdown against the bloodthirsty tyrant that is Russia.

And you don&#39;t do that with chill. She has been the catalyst to action at this point. She&#39;s been the moral conscience of the NATO alliance on this front because she has that Ukrainian background and can—I mean, she&#39;s not Zelensky.

It looks divisive, it looks overcompensating, and it lacks a certain sense of understanding, not where your lane is, because I don&#39;t think this is about putting someone in their place, but where your abilities as a nation are, not your abilities as a deputy prime minister and perhaps future prime minister of this country are. That&#39;s where my tweak would come in from, which is to that downstream, and I talked about that downstream political calculation. The moment may call for it. I just, I fear she may pay a price down the road for it. That&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking, Corey. That&#39;s roughly where my head was at. Not to say I&#39;m playing in this game.

Also including the fact that, you know, based on today&#39;s oil prices, Alberta could collect more than $10 billion in extra revenue compared with the projections in the budget. So the symbolic surplus, if I can call it that, right, that small surplus in the budget, but really the headlines here are spending restraint, growth in every sector yes acknowledging the energy sector and then the historic nature of alberta leading the country and the surplus in 14 years what do you make of that positioning rewrite entirely are you tweaking it cory yeah</span>

Carter, to that point, who is the audience here? Is this a save my leadership budget? Or did you see this as a more broader budget for a broader suite of Albertans, so to speak.

It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s an order. Door number one is about the NDP, Alberta NDP response to the budget. And here&#39;s a quote from Rachel Notley. Only the UCP could have soaring energy prices and still find new ways to disappoint the hardworking people of the province. Sky-high oil prices and no stability in hospitals, 1,000 fewer teachers in schools, no real plan for jobs, economic diversification, and no help for Albertans who want to pay their utility bills today. She tried to really lean into the areas that the NDP does around, obviously, hospitals, teachers, then talk about affordability, cost of living. There was also mention of the UCP&#39;s bracket creep and, you know, senior couple losing money on Asian, a bunch of other things. But that key line, sort of top line message.</span>

I don&#39;t think they necessarily should, but it doesn&#39;t mean the weight of their commentary has been as scattered as I think it feels when you&#39;re just online. But to be clear, it feels pretty scattered online. They need to take the words they&#39;re using and do less of it, right? Fewer words. They need to hone their arguments down.</span>

Quote, Yesterday we announced that we would be sending new shipments of military supplies, including body armor, helmets, gas masks, and night vision goggles. Today we&#39;re announcing that we will supply Ukraine with the anti-tank weapon systems and upgraded ammunition. Trudeau also said that the Canadian Armed Forces will provide airlift support to transport supplies and aid to participate in other NATO efforts in support of Ukraine. Ukraine. Trudeau, you know, obviously being praised for this tougher stance, the U.S. not committing to ground troops. We are also having, you know, a fair share of criticism for Justin Trudeau, saying they refused early to provide the ammunition, the weapons. They did it kind of silently mid-February when they knew things were going to escalate. And now they&#39;re kind of, you know, in some ways behind in terms of what may have been an inevitability.

Although I do think the world&#39;s getting there, and I think that&#39;s a positive thing, and I think we need to keep the pressure up, and we should be thinking constantly about more ways we can apply pressure to the autocrats of the world who step over such clear red lines as invasion, as we&#39;ve got here right now.</span>

But Sweden and Switzerland, I mean, they have a very long history of not going to war and not putting themselves in this type of a position. And for them to take this type of action was really, I think, indicative of the world coming together to say this is wrong and we&#39;re not going to allow it to happen.

There is always going to be a financial consequence for the for the oligarchs that surround him. And there were probably always going to be issues for the Russian people. But I think that this has turned into a fairly comprehensive set of of sanctions with more to come kind of as things develop that makes sense and shows a commitment from the Western world that they&#39;re not going to allow this to happen. The only thing left that I feel, there&#39;s two things that are left. Number one, totally cutting off Russian fossil fuels. That has significant economic consequence for the rest of the world.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, it&#39;s interesting, I look at this similarly, right? And I think like the vast, vast majority of people, you know, see a sense of inspiration and hope, and obviously cinematic dramatic drama, to Corey, your point around what we&#39;re seeing in Ukraine. I think one of the narratives that I&#39;ve been focusing attention on is, you know, what happens with this in two ways, the cloud cover that this massive story has provided to other nefarious stories across the world to be dropped and be perhaps go without the scrutiny and the criticism that they require. And secondly, kind of the parallels to what a crisis with, let&#39;s be clear, white European european people looks like versus one where those are not the refugees or the sick people and i think we&#39;re going to unpack that throughout multiple conversations but there&#39;s one thing cory you mentioned here that i think is in our lane in our collective lane which is the the concept of leadership branding i am so just like you fascinated with the zielinski story here right not just a comedian turned president a comedian turned actor on a tv show where he plays plays president, turned president. Carter, I&#39;m going to throw this to you, right? You are the king of the mythology of the brand, the self-perpetuating nature of political leadership brands. Let&#39;s be clear. This was a guy that many people poked fun at, that many people were like, come on. There was eye rolls when he got elected in 2019. There was eye rolls in fucking January, early February about his capacity to lead, his strength, et cetera. But Carter, in the most rapid of circumstances, thankful to the digital age, social media, and of course, some immense bravery on his part. Talk to me about the narrative mythology story that you&#39;re seeing play out in front of our eyes, arguably the most interesting one that we&#39;re going to have to dissect over multiple episodes and perhaps multiple years, regardless of the outcome here. But let&#39;s get started on the tip of the iceberg of the political mythology that we are seeing of won President Zelensky in Ukraine.</span>

This is why we picked Dave as our theme movie, because it turns out in order to be able to play to the people, you must be able to play to the people. And this is a guy who knows how to play to the people. And I don&#39;t say those words to diminish what he has done at all, but he knew his role, he assumed his role without question, and he committed to the bit right and and it doesn&#39;t diminish the the bit is war the bit is leadership and and and putting on but he put on the helmet he put on the flak jacket he stood outside to do his filming he knew what he needed the role that was required he knew exactly what it was and he used his theatrical expertise he committed to the dance the same way he committed with to dancing with the stars in the ukraine he committed to 100 everybody who&#39;s ever danced knows the best way to dance is to go 100% into it. This is the exact same thing that he&#39;s doing with the presidency. He&#39;s going into it 100% and he knows what he&#39;s doing. I&#39;m sure he spends time in his office. I&#39;m sure that most of his day, in fact, is in his office, but he knew the best place for him to do the filming is outside where the people are, where the threat is, because that was was the best theater.</span>
