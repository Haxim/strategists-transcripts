            <div class="said">There are a number of nominations and a number of finalists. I&#39;m going to read you five finalists, and they&#39;re categorized in a couple of different ways. We had people nominating themselves. We had people nominating celebrities. We had people nominating politicians. And then we had people nominating friends or relatives for whatever reasons. So let me let me walk through a few. We had J.K. Rowling being nominated because of her anti-trans stance. OK, we had someone nominating their friend because he calls himself Connor McMustache, even though that&#39;s not his real name. OK, we had someone nominating their brother because they&#39;re more successful than them. I don&#39;t know if I like that one. We had someone nominating themselves in a heartfelt, genuine way, saying that they were born in mission, that Abbotsford feels like home to them, that they would love to go there and have a weekend escape on our dime. Okay. And then we had finally two nominations for politicians. One, Mike Nicol, a former city councillor in Edmonton, was nominated. And one nomination, which I think personally was kind of harsh, was for MP Bartis Chagger, former minister. Now, nothing. No No parliamentary secretary, no minister, still an MP. So better than most. But those are our finalists. And Stephen Carter, you as the adjudicator, Corey as the individual who sets the terms, deals with the sponsor, Stephen Carter as the benevolent ruler of what we do.

I mean, I think that everybody came out of the election saying that they won, which is indication that they all lost. So no, I don&#39;t think it landed safely. I think that it It landed, you know, like it was one of those bombers that came back from, you know, bombing the Nazis, right? It came back shot up full of holes, but somehow they made it across the English Channel and they were able to set it down in some farmer&#39;s field. And I think that that&#39;s basically the lesson of the 2021 election is don&#39;t mess around with elections just because you think you can win because things do change during elections. Elections matter. We saw it change twice. uh liberals were going to win a massive man landslide and so were the conservatives and we wound up back at the exact same point so i&#39;d say it was shot up damaged uh profusely but it did it did in fact cory</div>

Like if he called it, he&#39;d have a majority government. And so the opposition parties had to treat him accordingly.

And while I don&#39;t think the shine is really truly coming off him, I do think that the prolonged honeymoon is over and you are are starting to see some criticism of his government. Trudeau has gone through these valleys for a while. I mean, where he is, is not even arguably his low mark. You know, we remember blackface Trudeau, remember brownface Trudeau. Of course, I think it would be shocking if that wasn&#39;t the low mark. And the reality is, when you are 50 years old and contemplating, do I want to continue being the leader of a G7 country? Or do I want to go off and do the next kick-ass thing and either way i&#39;m still a rich guy with a beautiful family and all of the world in front of me not so bad also</div>
