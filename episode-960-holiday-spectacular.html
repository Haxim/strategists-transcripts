And one of the ways we spread that holiday cheer is by giving away a flight. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, to our Not Going Places contest. Corey, for those that are just joining the Holiday Spectacular, please tell them what our Flair Airlines Not Going Anywhere contest is all about.</span>

I mean, in the past, we&#39;ve had, you know, first trip on Virgin Galactic. We&#39;ve had, of course, nobody&#39;s going to forget when Carter and Chester originally in 1993 offered to sell the very briefcase that the bribe for Brian Mulrooney was put in. That was cool.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And that kind of brings me to our finalists. Now, I have to say that there was many nominations and many finalists. There are a number of nominations, yes.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">There are a number of nominations and a number of finalists. I&#39;m going to read you five finalists, and they&#39;re categorized in a couple of different ways. We had people nominating themselves. We had people nominating celebrities. We had people nominating politicians. And then we had people nominating friends or relatives for whatever reasons. So let me let me walk through a few. We had J.K. Rowling being nominated because of her anti-trans stance. OK, we had someone nominating their friend because he calls himself Connor McMustache, even though that&#39;s not his real name. OK, we had someone nominating their brother because they&#39;re more successful than them. I don&#39;t know if I like that one. We had someone nominating themselves in a heartfelt, genuine way, saying that they were born in mission, that Abbotsford feels like home to them, that they would love to go there and have a weekend escape on our dime. Okay. And then we had finally two nominations for politicians. One, Mike Nicol, a former city councillor in Edmonton, was nominated. And one nomination, which I think personally was kind of harsh, was for MP Bartis Chagger, former minister. Now, nothing. No No parliamentary secretary, no minister, still an MP. So better than most. But those are our finalists. And Stephen Carter, you as the adjudicator, Corey as the individual who sets the terms, deals with the sponsor, Stephen Carter as the benevolent ruler of what we do. How do you want to decide this? Because we don&#39;t discuss how we figure</span>

This is all you could come up with? This is it? You looked at the entire scope of the Canadian political landscape. And all you came up with was Bartosz Czajger. Come on.

There&#39;s no better way to do this than just to do it. Stephen Carter, did it land in 2021, Justin Trudeau&#39;s election call? Did it land?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it landed, but it landed in a giant fiery mess, I think. I mean, sure. I mean, I think that everybody came out of the election saying that they won, which is indication that they all lost. So no, I don&#39;t think it landed safely. I think that it It landed, you know, like it was one of those bombers that came back from, you know, bombing the Nazis, right? It came back shot up full of holes, but somehow they made it across the English Channel and they were able to set it down in some farmer&#39;s field. And I think that that&#39;s basically the lesson of the 2021 election is don&#39;t mess around with elections just because you think you can win because things do change during elections. Elections matter. We saw it change twice. uh liberals were going to win a massive man landslide and so were the conservatives and we wound up back at the exact same point so i&#39;d say it was shot up damaged uh profusely but it did it did in fact cory</span>

Like if he called it, he&#39;d have a majority government. And so the opposition parties had to treat him accordingly. But there was a real sense that that was shaken right off after that particular election. And there&#39;s now there&#39;s this kind of stench</span>

John Horgan, well, he&#39;s in his second term. And while I don&#39;t think the shine is really truly coming off him, I do think that the prolonged honeymoon is over and you are are starting to see some criticism of his government. Trudeau has gone through these valleys for a while. I mean, where he is, is not even arguably his low mark. You know, we remember blackface Trudeau, remember brownface Trudeau. Of course, I think it would be shocking if that wasn&#39;t the low mark. And the reality is, when you are 50 years old and contemplating, do I want to continue being the leader of a G7 country? Or do I want to go off and do the next kick-ass thing and either way i&#39;m still a rich guy with a beautiful family and all of the world in front of me not so bad also</span>

So Stephen Carter, the index card for Jagmeet Singh, what does it say for him as part of his New Year&#39;s resolution? Please make it better than the answer that you gave me on on the radio show that we recorded last week. There was many people across the country disappointed with your answers.

You&#39;ve got to have a reason why if we were all struck dumb tomorrow, somebody would say, you know what, we really need a political party that does this.

To Corey&#39;s point that we are, you know, centrists and Canadians and compromisers. This is the time that Jason Kenney must be able to reflect those compromises to the Alberta people. And he&#39;s done it a couple of times. He does it on the economy. The economy is actually really strong on it. And if he was to take the economy and say, we&#39;ve weathered the economic storm and now we are going to make sure that Albertans stay employed. And that means keeping nurses employed. It means keeping doctors employed. It means keeping teachers employed. And it means keeping you employed. That&#39;s the focus. And, you know, I think that he could really make a dent in the NDP&#39;s lead, because there&#39;s still an awful lot of people that have moved to undecided instead of back to the NDP.</span>
