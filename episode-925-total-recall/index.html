I want to get your perspective on this. I mean, from a communication standpoint, do you feel like the good— I&#39;m using good and bad, and I don&#39;t know if those are the right terms. They aren&#39;t. But the good of these vaccine selfies, the fact that people are taking them, and the movement building that can happen around them outweigh the downsides or the negatives? I</div>

          <div class="said">now there are two issues at hand here one of them is whether this is actually effective or if people just say gross I don&#39;t like the selfie and they&#39;re not particularly interested but there are people who actually have aversions to needles and generally speaking how you deal with an aversion is you kind of introduce it to them slowly so in a way I sort of think that these selfies would make people feel a little bit better about that, but I&#39;m not sure if that is just wishful thinking by me or whether that particular therapy would be useful in this case. But I guess the point I want to underline here is that this is actually going to take a marriage of communications expertise and medical expertise. This is what we would call kind of like an interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary problem that needs to be resolved. So Carter should get off his high horse too. Everybody should stand on common ground and we should try to figure this fucking thing out using the best evidence available.</div>

Never mind that we&#39;re building the pipeline in Canada. Canada. So the money that was spent in, you know, in the United States seems to have been better spent. But whatever, these things are, they don&#39;t rely on truth. What they do is they rely on the audience desire to actually have the thing be true.

Now, we&#39;ve talked about kind of the failing of war metaphor before in politics, but I think this actually works because you still need the strategic general back saying, OK, how are we going to win this war in two years?

There&#39;s all kinds of reasons for doing representative democracy, but recall is essentially a form of direct democracy where the people themselves have a say in the issues of the day. And both of them are important parts of democracy. They just don&#39;t go well together.

If you were to start making it even shorter through recall, I think you&#39;d get worse government overall. So it&#39;s popular. It&#39;s not.
