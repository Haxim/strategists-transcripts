          <p>Meet Bill Rock. He is a real person, from Amisk, Alberta. And he'd like to be your next Premier. That's all Stephen and Corey know about him too, but they're about to craft his campaign strategy.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter construct the Bill Rock campaign for the UCP leadership - the positioning, the brand, the tactics and more. How does an outsider construct a campaign? What's your best chance to sell memberships as an unknown? And if the smell of BBQ'd salmon wafts through Edmonton, will you know that hell has truly frozen over? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>
