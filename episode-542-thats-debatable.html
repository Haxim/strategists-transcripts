            <span class="text">Barely awake. Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment because I do want to talk about this debate. Our first segment, the morning after the two nights before. Let&#39;s talk about the debate that we&#39;ve been so tardy to comment on on this podcast. Guys, before I get into this debate, our episode about the Alberta debate was a popular one because of your guys&#39; inside track into debate prep. prep. So looking at this debate that that&#39;s being held some seven or that was held 70 some odd days out, what would your preparation strategy have been for for the leaders at large? Corey, I&#39;ll go with you first. Was there anything that you&#39;d keep in mind knowing how far this was from the actual election day?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">think it would have changed how we&#39;d approached it for sure.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">The debates aren&#39;t usually this early in the election kind of relative to the length of the election. And they&#39;re usually just not 70 days before the election. And the way we always do it in the Canadian system is we, well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">well, there are exceptions. And in fact, the campaign I ran was one of them. But the platform&#39;s not usually out by this point. And that&#39;s true of all three of the parties who are on the stage on Thursday night.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">as a result, it became more about, more about, I think, the personalities and setting the stage and who are these guys. And I was looking at an interesting chart of Twitter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Twitter, like the searches of the different leaders, or Google, I suppose, the different leaders as, you know, over time. And it was great, because you could tell when one of them was doing well, they got a spike in Google searches, and Justin Trudeau did well. So we had big spikes in Trudeau, or, you know, searches like that. But there&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">a lot that goes into debate prep in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">in advance, and that&#39;s the other thing. Unless these guys had started debate prep before the election, I doubt any of the prep was as robust as that it would have been under normal cases. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So I&#39;m going to disagree with that because they knew when this debate was going to be held because it was going to be held regardless of an election call. all. So the McLean&#39;s debate was something that had been agreed to earlier by all of the different parties. So the prep had been on. But I think it&#39;s fascinating. I think two leaders did a great job on debate prep. And when I say that, I&#39;m not just talking about lines. Elizabeth May and Stephen Harper looked great and they knew their stuff and they were really solid debate prep wise. And they they were also just solid in how they presented they looked good they sounded good and i thought that mulcair and trudeau were either over prepped on their uh on their speeches like i hated trudeau&#39;s closing which was so over prepped and so overwrought paul wells didn&#39;t know when he was finished he jumped in before trudeau was finished because the long dramatic david</span>

            <span class="text">it bad and so overacted this is the the constant for me it was fingernails on a chalkboard because it and then you contrast that to stephen harper who got his messages across every single time he opened his mouth and elizabeth may</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">honestly those two were the best prep in my mind and the best preparations well look not</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">So what does prep look like when the subject matter, the platform is not out? And so that&#39;s my first question is what exactly does preparation look like? What are you prepping your leaders for? Is it simply lines? Is it a mixture of content? Is it an act in compounding content or distilling it down to its most simplest essence? There&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s about three million things Carter said that I disagree with on there. But the first is, let&#39;s not forget that the reason that those two looked so comfortable up there, Harper and May, is they&#39;re the only ones who have done it before, right? There was a lot of nerves going in, and I expect if Elizabeth May even gets invited to future debates, I&#39;ll be shocked. And Trudeau and Mallcare will get better and more comfortable in that format. And yeah, the debate was always on, but it wasn&#39;t expected to be a writ debate, and I think it was expected to be a very different animal. And then finally, like, Trudeau&#39;s closing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know what closing you were watching, but it was a pretty solid closing. I usually agree with you on Trudeau. I can&#39;t agree with you on that one. I do agree with you that that pause at the end was a pretty hilarious fuck-up. Like, Paul Wales had no idea that he wasn&#39;t fit. I thought he was done. Everybody thought</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">thought he was done. Everyone did. It was totally Mammoth style, man. Like, it was terrible. We should get some Samuel Beckett into the next one.</span>
          </div>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the first vote. And then we had one debate after the first vote. And the first debate that Alison Redford was going to go into, we had very little in the way of policy. I mean, you can imagine that the policy at that point was we&#39;re running. And it was in the middle of summer, exactly the same time. And it was, I think it was, I want to say say in beggarville let&#39;s just say it was in beggarville uh because everybody&#39;s been and everybody knows that uh beggarville is a big hot spot uh in alberta politics oh yeah</span>

            <span class="text">what do you do? You&#39;re in the middle of summer. And on some levels, it doesn&#39;t matter. But on the other hand, it is a tremendously good training ground. And our focus on Allison wasn&#39;t trying to give her the best possible lines. It was to give her the best possible positioning for later debates. We needed her to grow and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and to show that she was becoming a better debater and becoming a better leader. And her first debate performance, we focused principally on just being relaxed on the stage. Then after that, we started to layer in the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the lines and all the other stuff. And I think that that&#39;s where Mulcair in particular</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s a great segue. So I&#39;m hearing Carter say that debates are an iterative game. You&#39;re not trying to effectively swing for the fences, especially if you&#39;re introducing yourself this early. But I do want to pick up on that point of Tom Mulcair as we get into the content of this debate. So Mulcair comes into this debate. Many would argue he looks sedated for the first 30 to 40 minutes of this debate. Corey, I know you&#39;ve got opinions about this. I&#39;ll let you take this and then we&#39;ll go from there.

I didn&#39;t have a lot of time, but let me run you through it. Because what&#39;s in everybody&#39;s head after that is, well, this isn&#39;t a great presentation I&#39;m seeing. They didn&#39;t have a lot of time putting it together, and so that&#39;s going to be reflected in the content. Here&#39;s my tip to listeners out there. Here&#39;s career advice for people out there. You go up, and even if you&#39;ve just managed to slap down a few words on a pile of shit, you say, this is the best presentation you&#39;re ever going to see. because the way the way we work psychologically is is you&#39;ve set the stage you&#39;ve now framed this as the best presentation they&#39;re ever going to see and and um in the same way trudeau can&#39;t go around being like not ready maybe a little naive you know we we just latch on to things like that too quickly uh and politicians</span>

And it was, as Corey said earlier, simply surviving and coming out looking like you held your own. We thought we had a tremendous success in 2012. The media and the pundits said that we&#39;d lost. But the people, when we got back into the polling, the people saw that she&#39;d survived or that, you know, we were getting almost an equal number of victory perceptions as anybody else. And we thought, you know, that&#39;s as good as you can hope for. Stephen Harper did better than that. Stephen Harper did better than Alison Redford did in 2012. Stephen Harper has done better than I think most incumbents do when all the guns are aimed at them. And it&#39;s because Stephen Harper has done this time and time again, and I don&#39;t think that Justin Trudeau is a better debate performer than Michael Ignatieff, and I don&#39;t think that Thomas Mulcair is a better debate performer than Jack Layton.

Stephen Harper, the day after the debate yesterday, was on TV constantly explaining what he meant by the recession answer that he gave. Was that anything that, is there anything he could have done in terms of PrEP and how he navigated that question differently in your mind?

He was getting pretty close to the line. He looked comfortable. It was a little much at times, though, I think. And I think he&#39;s just got to watch his natural hatred for those guys.</span>

I think that Mulcair has got every vote that he&#39;s going to get from the Conservatives. So the rest have to come from the Liberals. And that means that you have to prep him for Trudeau. And Trudeau did better than I think people were expecting, which is why so many people have said that Trudeau won the debate. It&#39;s only because, you know, as Corey Tanik said, you</span>

I wouldn&#39;t play it, but if they&#39;re going to play it, you&#39;ve got yourself a backdrop right now where you can start to say, you know, he&#39;s the only one who looks at the Supreme Court. He&#39;s the only one who&#39;s understanding this. He&#39;s the only one who&#39;s talking about it.

It sounded, I don&#39;t know that it was, but it just sounded so good. And then he kept going on it and he gave Justin the opportunity to explain the Supreme Court&#39;s position and how they&#39;ve said, you need to consider the threshold in context of the question. So a total loss for Mulcair and a total win for Trudeau. I think we&#39;re going to be seeing more of that. That</span>

            <span class="text">That debate or that exchange was between Mulcair and Trudeau. And the person standing completely silent until he chimed in at the last second was Stephen Harper when he chimed in and he said, kids, why are you arguing about breaking up the country? And what that makes me realize, and it&#39;s probably not an insight to any degree, is that there is only one guy in this election that is prime minister and that can have that 10 years of statesman baggage and take it with him everywhere he goes and make comments like that with that gravitas. How important is that when it comes to issues like this, that Stephen Harper has the ability to kind of elevate the debate and stay above the fray? And is that something he will do as we have more debates and as the issues of these debates are put back onto the campaign trail?</span>

So he needs both a strong Liberal Party and a strong NDP. And in some regards, he might even require the Bloc Québécois to pop back up onto the scene every once in a while. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to be unhappy with a minority. A strong minority will suit him just fine.</span>

The first ones, you know, we&#39;d start recording, and I&#39;d realize, oh, shit, I can&#39;t really think of anything I think interesting happened last night. Yeah. And as it went on, more of it kind of crystallized for me. But I do think it matters, but it matters because it didn&#39;t matter, if that works for you. If this debate had become a big moment, it would have changed the tenor of the campaign early on. But no outcome was an outcome, and it meant the status quo was going to continue for at least the next couple of weeks.</span>
