Let&#39;s talk about the debate that we&#39;ve been so tardy to comment on on this podcast. Guys, before I get into this debate, our episode about the Alberta debate was a popular one because of your guys&#39; inside track into debate prep. prep. So looking at this debate that that&#39;s being held some seven or that was held 70 some odd days out, what would your preparation strategy have been for for the leaders at large? Corey, I&#39;ll go with you first. Was there anything that you&#39;d keep in mind knowing how far this was from the actual election day?</div>

So the McLean&#39;s debate was something that had been agreed to earlier by all of the different parties. So the prep had been on. But I think it&#39;s fascinating. I think two leaders did a great job on debate prep. And when I say that, I&#39;m not just talking about lines. Elizabeth May and Stephen Harper looked great and they knew their stuff and they were really solid debate prep wise. And they they were also just solid in how they presented they looked good they sounded good and i thought that mulcair and trudeau were either over prepped on their uh on their speeches like i hated trudeau&#39;s closing which was so over prepped and so overwrought paul wells didn&#39;t know when he was finished he jumped in before trudeau was finished because the long dramatic david</div>

          <div class="said">There&#39;s about three million things Carter said that I disagree with on there. But the first is, let&#39;s not forget that the reason that those two looked so comfortable up there, Harper and May, is they&#39;re the only ones who have done it before, right? There was a lot of nerves going in, and I expect if Elizabeth May even gets invited to future debates, I&#39;ll be shocked. And Trudeau and Mallcare will get better and more comfortable in that format. And yeah, the debate was always on, but it wasn&#39;t expected to be a writ debate, and I think it was expected to be a very different animal. And then finally, like, Trudeau&#39;s closing.</div>

Many would argue he looks sedated for the first 30 to 40 minutes of this debate. Corey, I know you&#39;ve got opinions about this. I&#39;ll let you take this and then we&#39;ll go from there.

I didn&#39;t have a lot of time, but let me run you through it. Because what&#39;s in everybody&#39;s head after that is, well, this isn&#39;t a great presentation I&#39;m seeing. They didn&#39;t have a lot of time putting it together, and so that&#39;s going to be reflected in the content. Here&#39;s my tip to listeners out there. Here&#39;s career advice for people out there. You go up, and even if you&#39;ve just managed to slap down a few words on a pile of shit, you say, this is the best presentation you&#39;re ever going to see. because the way the way we work psychologically is is you&#39;ve set the stage you&#39;ve now framed this as the best presentation they&#39;re ever going to see and and um in the same way trudeau can&#39;t go around being like not ready maybe a little naive you know we we just latch on to things like that too quickly uh and politicians</div>

You must, all you can do is, and so prep for For the 2012 election for Alison Redford, focused on we are going to get absolutely attacked. What does a victory look like for us? And it was, as Corey said earlier, simply surviving and coming out looking like you held your own. We thought we had a tremendous success in 2012. The media and the pundits said that we&#39;d lost. But the people, when we got back into the polling, the people saw that she&#39;d survived or that, you know, we were getting almost an equal number of victory perceptions as anybody else. And we thought, you know, that&#39;s as good as you can hope for. Stephen Harper did better than that. Stephen Harper did better than Alison Redford did in 2012. Stephen Harper has done better than I think most incumbents do when all the guns are aimed at them. And it&#39;s because Stephen Harper has done this time and time again, and I don&#39;t think that Justin Trudeau is a better debate performer than Michael Ignatieff, and I don&#39;t think that Thomas Mulcair is a better debate performer than Jack Layton.

I wouldn&#39;t play it, but if they&#39;re going to play it, you&#39;ve got yourself a backdrop right now where you can start to say, you know, he&#39;s the only one who looks at the Supreme Court.

And the person standing completely silent until he chimed in at the last second was Stephen Harper when he chimed in and he said, kids, why are you arguing about breaking up the country? And what that makes me realize, and it&#39;s probably not an insight to any degree, is that there is only one guy in this election that is prime minister and that can have that 10 years of statesman baggage and take it with him everywhere he goes and make comments like that with that gravitas. How important is that when it comes to issues like this, that Stephen Harper has the ability to kind of elevate the debate and stay above the fray?
