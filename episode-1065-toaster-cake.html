        <p>The gang get together and do their best not to talk about the Alberta election - intermittently failing. How campaigns run against themselves in the last week, the virtues of the "exploratory committee" and more are discussed in this e-day minus seven spectacular.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss whether campaigns have any ability to turn the ship in the last week, the Bonnie Crombie soft launch for OLP leader and a Toronto mayoral race that is being called a coronation for Olivia Chow. Is there a point when the electoral cake becomes “baked”? Was the early Crombie website launch a mistake or a “mistake”? And if I call 587-A0K-ZAIN, will I learn more about his policy on cupboard toasters? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Why don&#39;t you just talk about the Alberta election? It&#39;s all done. You can&#39;t get you. You can&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s all over. So let&#39;s talk about that. I actually want to bring that text conversation live to the listeners because this is considered to be the most pivotal week in the campaign. It&#39;s the week where everyone starts voting. Advanced voting starts tomorrow for those of you in the province and out of the province, and then election day is next Monday. So to many and to the observers and to many in the media, the polls are tight. This is a week that everything that gets done. So let&#39;s talk about the cake being baked and how much is it baked. I want to see if you guys are on the same page here and what is or is not baked at this stage. Carter, give me your analysis first. Corey, I&#39;ll jump in to you with that same question. I</div>

          <div class="said">I mean, the answer is that it&#39;s not yet baked, but the ingredients are all mixed and you&#39;re now putting it in the oven. And what happens in in the oven is entirely anyone&#39;s guess right like um sometimes it comes out and it is entirely as predicted everybody knew the outcome going in and we slide the cake in and out comes the fully baked cake as expected you know it is a uh it&#39;s an angel food cake isn&#39;t that exciting we put you know everything worked out perfectly and other times you put it in and out comes a burnt piece of shit and uh you know that is that also could happen but the</div>

          <div class="said">no i i think that in the last seven days it&#39;s hard to make a better cake so i agree on that point but you can fuck it it up right you can open it up and pull it out and start messing with it start you know second guessing the ingredients you have there putting the cake in the toaster you could yeah you can you could turn the heat up too high you can turn the heat up too high and you can stop you can take it out too early and all of these things can really fuck up your cake and this is part of why i say in the last week campaigns run against themselves they start there there&#39;s no longer ingredients to mix and they&#39;re still in the kitchen and they want to do something and it&#39;s that doing something and it often leads to them fucking things up and it really is about you</div>

          <div class="said">so – I&#39;ve got nothing to talk about. Although, although, although, although, I do want to actually use the story of the soft launch to talk about something that has happened in specific in the Ontario Liberal Party leadership. But I want to maybe use it as a canvas to talk about exploratory committees, Carter, because Bonnie Crombie, who&#39;s the current mayor of Mississauga, who for a long time, even this past week on Power and Politics and with Vashti Kapelos on CTV, was flirting around the question as to whether she&#39;d throw her hat into the liberal leadership race. Well, turns out that on Monday, there was a landing page that talked about her, her ambition, what she would do, should she run. But it was, A, leaked. So the page wasn&#39;t ready for primetime. So they had to take it down. There&#39;s that angle of the story, which we can discuss and how that happens in campaigns and how you keep your data tight and how do you kind of, you know, stop soft launching like she did. but she also tried to perhaps prevent a soft launch by doing something called an exploratory committee. And I know on our podcast, we&#39;ve discussed some of these instruments, these political instruments as length. We&#39;ve talked about vote pledges before. I think we did a deep dive on vote pledges and where they work. We did a deeper dive, and I think you guys touched on this with Annalise as well, as to whether draft campaigns, remember those?</div>

          <div class="said">We&#39;ve talked about those, whether those are effective or those work. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve ever had the opportunity to talk about exploratory. And you know what&#39;s interesting is that from my recollection, At least two out of the four candidates in the Ontario Liberal leadership started with exploratory committees. They started with Yasir Naqvi, who&#39;s now fully in the race, and now Bonnie Crombie, who may or may not enter the race, but seems like with this indication, she probably will be entering the race. have started this exploratory committee angle. And this is something that I know is very common in the United States. I know it&#39;s something we&#39;ve seen often. But Corey, maybe let me start with you. Your thinking</div>

          <div class="said">thinking on this concept of exploratory committees, the strategy behind them, the purpose from them, and the usefulness they have in our broader Canadian context. And there might be a financial context to this, which we can get into. But give me your top line thoughts. And then I want to get into the personal like have you guys used them have you considered using them are they an instrument we should be looking out for more and more what do they signal there&#39;s a whole list of things i&#39;ll talk about before your initial take on exploratory committees um and and their usefulness in the canadian political context well</div>

          <div class="said">well like like so much these days like packs all of these other ways we think about politics they are a bit of an import from the united states where it&#39;s a way to enter the race without entering the race it&#39;s kind of a half in and i mean it is exactly what it sounds. It&#39;s somebody who&#39;s going out there and formally considering whether they are going to run for one of these offices. And realistically, they serve a pretty significant need for larger offices, because otherwise, we&#39;re all playing kind of a silly game. And we&#39;re playing in this gray area of fundraising rules, right? Is it covered by fundraising rules? Is it not? But if you&#39;re running for a big office, like, you know, the leader of a political party in Ontario, President of the United States, the reality is a true canvassing of it, a proper exploration and the resourcing required for a proper exploration, that requires a level of organization that requires something like an exploratory committee, no matter what you call it. And I kind of like exploratory committees because they take it into the light of day, right? They allow you to actually see the organization, know who you&#39;re talking to, have it covered by fundraising rules in many cases, not all cases, depends on the jurisdiction. jurisdiction and and just have a good conversation but they also allow that candidate to have optionality and it is possible and you do often see at the end of an exploratory committee you know run people say well i&#39;m not catching any fire i&#39;m out right like and then it usually takes the like well now is not the time i i could see these ideas and there&#39;s a lot of enthusiasm i want to take that enthusiasm and return to florida with it you know continue my work as governor or i&#39;m going to take that and i&#39;m going to use it in supporting barack obama&#39;s presidency whatever it may end up being but you know the exploratory committee built into it is the idea that it may not happen so what you&#39;ve ultimately done all</div>

So what you&#39;re trying to do, I think, when you put together the leadership, is exactly what Corey&#39;s saying. It&#39;s a big job, it&#39;s a big thing, but you&#39;re trying to circumvent becoming official, right? Because the moment you become official, you have to adhere to the guidelines as articulated by Elections Canada or Ontario Elections or Elections Ontario, Elections Alberta, whatever the situation may be.

Talk to me about that. I find that really fascinating because let&#39;s agree with you. This is another page that you can use and put in your toolkit.

They&#39;re the internalized comedians. They put three bullet notes and they can do 90 minutes. They&#39;ve got the three main stories. They&#39;re not going to say it the same way in the two cities that they tour. It&#39;s never going to sound the same. You&#39;re going to get a different version of the show every night. And there&#39;s some comedians who literally script word for word, right? The Jerry Seinfelds of the world. So I had an experience to talk to one of these comedians, Dimitri Martin.</div>

When he came to Calgary, backstage, I got to go see Dimitri Martin, and he had typed out like six pages. And these six pages were not word for word, but he had actually on note cards had written word for word. So he had typed out six pages. And I mean, not on a computer. I mean, typewriter. Okay. And he had note cards that had the long form version of every joke and each line in those six pages matched to a joke that he would actually recite. And when we went to his green room, Carter, he had a version of this typewriter page with all of these jokes. So like 30 lines, six times, 180 jokes, right, that he had done over the 90 minute set.

And I think the word that I used was just professionalism. But what to me it is, it&#39;s craftsmanship, right? Like the craftsmanship of what you do. Corey, where are you on this scale of things? Like Carter, and before I get to you, Carter, with the Bronnie Crombie thing that we just discussed, how would you document that? Or would you? Like, would that be something as part of your toolkit going forward? Would you write this down and say, I don&#39;t want to forget about this? Like, give me at least a greater sense.

And frankly, that&#39;s a relief that it&#39;s not 20% of the vote. And who knows, maybe something that there was more of a winnowing of the candidates, a ranked ballot, maybe Olivia Chow would get 50% in a model like that. But I&#39;d sure like to know.

We have a lot of problems with this where candidates don&#39;t think they need to become real until some later date in the campaign. And the truth is you need to be very real very quickly in this type of a campaign. And I think that you can see a couple of people really surging into that reality spot where all of a sudden they&#39;re more likely to be known. They&#39;re more likely to get their press releases covered. and as soon as that happens it really doesn&#39;t take much to position yourself like when you&#39;re in second third second third or fourth all</div>

Fewer police officers on the street. Well, then all of a sudden, you are giving your opponents a bit of a hook to come in and say, like, you know, you know, Olivia Chow is soft on crime, and Toronto doesn&#39;t need that right now. And yes, we need to look at other solutions. Yes, we need response times. Yes, we need, you know, mobile phone coverage on the TTC. But you know what we also need? Police right now, today. And that&#39;s something Olivia Chow is just not willing to do. And that&#39;s wrong. You know, you&#39;ve got to almost create this villain version of the candidate in order to get that coalescing that we&#39;ve been talking about. So avoid being the villain by being a reasonable person who is not making broad statements, right? It&#39;s the same as any time you&#39;re trying to build a coalition.
