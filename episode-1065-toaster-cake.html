This is a question I have, and this is, of course, applicable to the Alberta election, but this is a question I have for two of you, campaign strategists who&#39;ve done this numerous times, who&#39;ve put together campaigns that last many months.

Why don&#39;t you just talk about the Alberta election? It&#39;s all done. You can&#39;t get you. You can&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s all over. So let&#39;s talk about that. I actually want to bring that text conversation live to the listeners because this is considered to be the most pivotal week in the campaign. It&#39;s the week where everyone starts voting. Advanced voting starts tomorrow for those of you in the province and out of the province, and then election day is next Monday. So to many and to the observers and to many in the media, the polls are tight. This is a week that everything that gets done. So let&#39;s talk about the cake being baked and how much is it baked. I want to see if you guys are on the same page here and what is or is not baked at this stage. Carter, give me your analysis first. Corey, I&#39;ll jump in to you with that same question. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, the answer is that it&#39;s not yet baked, but the ingredients are all mixed and you&#39;re now putting it in the oven. And what happens in in the oven is entirely anyone&#39;s guess right like um sometimes it comes out and it is entirely as predicted everybody knew the outcome going in and we slide the cake in and out comes the fully baked cake as expected you know it is a uh it&#39;s an angel food cake isn&#39;t that exciting we put you know everything worked out perfectly and other times you put it in and out comes a burnt piece of shit and uh you know that is that also could happen but the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the the person baking it the person preparing it like once you&#39;ve put the ingredients together once everything has happened you put it into the oven and there is just not much left that you can do uh you have done all the mistakes that you have made were done in advance right all the good things that you did were done in advance and now all you&#39;re doing is sliding the prepared batter into the into the oven to bake your cake so my answer is yeah things can still change things can still turn out horribly or really really well but i don&#39;t think that you win or lose an election in the last five days um especially when you&#39;re starting your advanced polls and we&#39;re looking at potentially 50 of voters voting in the first four days i mean people</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, do you agree around Carter&#39;s analogy that the ingredients are there that very difficult to change those ingredients and you&#39;re just popping it in the oven and whatever comes out comes out as your end use product carter still giving a bit of um i guess optionality that there are some things that could change because of that um but do you largely agree that in the t minus and we&#39;re in the alberta context so of course that&#39;s the most relevant but i kind of talk about this as a more general practitioner rule about the final seven days no</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">no i i think that in the last seven days it&#39;s hard to make a better cake so i agree on that point but you can fuck it it up right you can open it up and pull it out and start messing with it start you know second guessing the ingredients you have there putting the cake in the toaster you could yeah you can you could turn the heat up too high you can turn the heat up too high and you can stop you can take it out too early and all of these things can really fuck up your cake and this is part of why i say in the last week campaigns run against themselves they start there there&#39;s no longer ingredients to mix and they&#39;re still in the kitchen and they want to do something and it&#39;s that doing something and it often leads to them fucking things up and it really is about you</span>

            <span class="text">so – I&#39;ve got nothing to talk about. Although, although, although, although, I do want to actually use the story of the soft launch to talk about something that has happened in specific in the Ontario Liberal Party leadership. But I want to maybe use it as a canvas to talk about exploratory committees, Carter, because Bonnie Crombie, who&#39;s the current mayor of Mississauga, who for a long time, even this past week on Power and Politics and with Vashti Kapelos on CTV, was flirting around the question as to whether she&#39;d throw her hat into the liberal leadership race. Well, turns out that on Monday, there was a landing page that talked about her, her ambition, what she would do, should she run. But it was, A, leaked. So the page wasn&#39;t ready for primetime. So they had to take it down. There&#39;s that angle of the story, which we can discuss and how that happens in campaigns and how you keep your data tight and how do you kind of, you know, stop soft launching like she did. but she also tried to perhaps prevent a soft launch by doing something called an exploratory committee. And I know on our podcast, we&#39;ve discussed some of these instruments, these political instruments as length. We&#39;ve talked about vote pledges before. I think we did a deep dive on vote pledges and where they work. We did a deeper dive, and I think you guys touched on this with Annalise as well, as to whether draft campaigns, remember those?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;ve talked about those, whether those are effective or those work. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve ever had the opportunity to talk about exploratory. And you know what&#39;s interesting is that from my recollection, At least two out of the four candidates in the Ontario Liberal leadership started with exploratory committees. They started with Yasir Naqvi, who&#39;s now fully in the race, and now Bonnie Crombie, who may or may not enter the race, but seems like with this indication, she probably will be entering the race. have started this exploratory committee angle. And this is something that I know is very common in the United States. I know it&#39;s something we&#39;ve seen often. But Corey, maybe let me start with you. Your thinking</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">thinking on this concept of exploratory committees, the strategy behind them, the purpose from them, and the usefulness they have in our broader Canadian context. And there might be a financial context to this, which we can get into. But give me your top line thoughts. And then I want to get into the personal like have you guys used them have you considered using them are they an instrument we should be looking out for more and more what do they signal there&#39;s a whole list of things i&#39;ll talk about before your initial take on exploratory committees um and and their usefulness in the canadian political context well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well like like so much these days like packs all of these other ways we think about politics they are a bit of an import from the united states where it&#39;s a way to enter the race without entering the race it&#39;s kind of a half in and i mean it is exactly what it sounds. It&#39;s somebody who&#39;s going out there and formally considering whether they are going to run for one of these offices. And realistically, they serve a pretty significant need for larger offices, because otherwise, we&#39;re all playing kind of a silly game. And we&#39;re playing in this gray area of fundraising rules, right? Is it covered by fundraising rules? Is it not? But if you&#39;re running for a big office, like, you know, the leader of a political party in Ontario, President of the United States, the reality is a true canvassing of it, a proper exploration and the resourcing required for a proper exploration, that requires a level of organization that requires something like an exploratory committee, no matter what you call it. And I kind of like exploratory committees because they take it into the light of day, right? They allow you to actually see the organization, know who you&#39;re talking to, have it covered by fundraising rules in many cases, not all cases, depends on the jurisdiction. jurisdiction and and just have a good conversation but they also allow that candidate to have optionality and it is possible and you do often see at the end of an exploratory committee you know run people say well i&#39;m not catching any fire i&#39;m out right like and then it usually takes the like well now is not the time i i could see these ideas and there&#39;s a lot of enthusiasm i want to take that enthusiasm and return to florida with it you know continue my work as governor or i&#39;m going to take that and i&#39;m going to use it in supporting barack obama&#39;s presidency whatever it may end up being but you know the exploratory committee built into it is the idea that it may not happen so what you&#39;ve ultimately done all</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">all of the fundraising all the organization things aside is you&#39;ve created for yourself an off-ramp you may or may not take at a certain point of public discourse so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so carter is it just a is it just an instrument for hedging bets well Well, like, is it just simply a just so I can get the psychological comfort of never having to fail that I&#39;m going to do this and have an off ramp? I don&#39;t mean to be so like plain about it, but is that what it is or does it serve a broader function than that? I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that what it is fundamentally doing is trying to get around Elections Ontario&#39;s rules. I mean, I&#39;m looking at their so I&#39;m trying to figure out like I know that an exploratory committee is not legal in Alberta. Berta. It&#39;s not legal in Canada, if you were to seek an election there. And it&#39;s actually not</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">not legal in Ontario. From my quick review of this, you must register as a leadership contestant to raise money and or spend money. So what you&#39;re trying to do, I think, when you put together the leadership, is exactly what Corey&#39;s saying. It&#39;s a big job, it&#39;s a big thing, but you&#39;re trying to circumvent becoming official, right? Because the moment you become official, you have to adhere to the guidelines as articulated by Elections Canada or Ontario Elections or Elections Ontario, Elections Alberta, whatever the situation may be. And those rules have become more and more stringent. But, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s really hard to do. Like, for example, when Mayor Sohi launched his campaign in Edmonton, he</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">he launched his campaign on May the 12th and he spent a shit ton of money. He put out signs. He had websites. Everything was ready and everything was done. And I asked the question of myself, how did he raise the money to do it?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">As a candidate, you can only put in $10,000 of your own money and you&#39;re not really allowed to run debt. So how did you put in place a fully scaled campaign ready to put collateral materials on people&#39;s door that day? Because technically it shouldn&#39;t be legal. now what cory&#39;s describing in an exploratory committee kind of hedges around that right it gets us around that legality and we&#39;ve imported it like we have like cory said like we have with tpas</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">or packs was what they call them in the states these these things that have morphed and now we&#39;re trying to control them if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">if we were doing less control we wouldn&#39;t need these things right the exploratory committee would be 15 people around the candidates table talking about you You know, the phone calls they&#39;re making, the potential money pledges they&#39;re getting. But with all these rules now, the second you decide that you&#39;re going to become a candidate, technically you&#39;re supposed to register. And if</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you don&#39;t register, you could find yourself in a heap of trouble. So these are ways around rules. These are ways to avoid them.

We can get into the marketing of And we will, at some point, go through a website review of candidates and campaigns. But this is deliberate, is what I mean to say. This is, they hired a web developer, they put a website together, they&#39;ve created a logo, they&#39;ve ensured that the Ontario sort of official flower is part of all that sort of stuff. So there is an element of polish here. But Carter, the question I have, to maybe challenge the hedge the bets question, is that, have you ever seen anyone in the Canadian context start an exploratory committee and not run? which</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is to say which is to say is it actually let&#39;s disabuse people of the notion is it actually to explore your viability is it actually to explore whether the office is for you or is it something beyond</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">beyond that right i want to actually answer that sort of question because if you are running for some office in this country you probably already know whether you&#39;ve got the ability to raise the money find the people and have a political viability for that office before where you set up a very nice looking website with all this preloaded graphics, preloaded endorsements, all that sort of stuff. So disabuse me of the notion or validate it for me that this is actually for pure exploration of your running for a knockoff. I</span>

Like, who are you calling on behalf of what kind of work are you doing? And sometimes you just need to declare those things to get yourself out of trouble. Imagine as well in NACV&#39;s case, right?

They&#39;re the internalized comedians. They put three bullet notes and they can do 90 minutes. They&#39;ve got the three main stories. They&#39;re not going to say it the same way in the two cities that they tour. It&#39;s never going to sound the same. You&#39;re going to get a different version of the show every night.

And he had note cards that had the long form version of every joke and each line in those six pages matched to a joke that he would actually recite. And when we went to his green room, Carter, he had a version of this typewriter page with all of these jokes. So like 30 lines, six times, 180 jokes, right, that he had done over the 90 minute set.

And I think the word that I used was just professionalism. But what to me it is, it&#39;s craftsmanship, right? Like the craftsmanship of what you do. Corey, where are you on this scale of things? Like Carter, and before I get to you, Carter, with the Bronnie Crombie thing that we just discussed, how would you document that? Or would you?

And often, we throw out good tactics or good strategies or good campaigns within a losing campaign, and we celebrate good, bad sort of tactics within a winning campaign because of factors that were really very limited or not necessarily due to that.</span>

            <span class="text">Could not care less. Person who gets the most votes wins. The fact that there&#39;s 102 candidates makes it a little confusing. But we said this before we knew there was going to be 102 candidates. We said a person who comes in with who is very well known with an existing platform, with an existing brand position, is going to win this election. Shocker of all shocks. That&#39;s what&#39;s happening. There is not enough time. There was not enough time three months ago to launch a viable campaign to actually win. The interesting thing that I think is how vulnerable Olivia Chow will be in two years. Right.</span>

And frankly, that&#39;s a relief that it&#39;s not 20% of the vote. And who knows, maybe something that there was more of a winnowing of the candidates, a ranked ballot, maybe Olivia Chow would get 50% in a model like that. But I&#39;d sure like to know.

But I really don&#39;t feel that passionate about voting for her. So I&#39;m just not going to because she&#39;s going to win anyways. And all of a sudden, your voter turnout model fundamentally shifts. And when we start to see fundamental shifts in voter turnout models, then you start to see strange outcomes, because the polling no longer represents the entire group of the population, right? So the population of polling is everybody who can vote. The population that actually votes could be a different population.</span>

Like when I think about the California Goopin tutorial that Arnold Schwarzenegger won, I would say didn&#39;t end up with that rationalization of the field. Good point. Yeah. Right. But generally speaking, you do see people say, okay, these are folks who are in the game and these are folks who are not in the game. And so if you&#39;re Olivia Chow, you&#39;ve</span>

It can&#39;t be 99 people versus Olivia Chow. It&#39;s got to be a bit of a mix. You got to keep things interesting in the sense that you can&#39;t immediately find yourself on the wrong side of the coalition of 99.</span>

We have a lot of problems with this where candidates don&#39;t think they need to become real until some later date in the campaign. And the truth is you need to be very real very quickly in this type of a campaign. And I think that you can see a couple of people really surging into that reality spot where all of a sudden they&#39;re more likely to be known. They&#39;re more likely to get their press releases covered. and as soon as that happens it really doesn&#39;t take much to position yourself like when you&#39;re in second third second third or fourth all</span>

Fewer police officers on the street. Well, then all of a sudden, you are giving your opponents a bit of a hook to come in and say, like, you know, you know, Olivia Chow is soft on crime, and Toronto doesn&#39;t need that right now. And yes, we need to look at other solutions. Yes, we need response times. Yes, we need, you know, mobile phone coverage on the TTC. But you know what we also need? Police right now, today. And that&#39;s something Olivia Chow is just not willing to do. And that&#39;s wrong. You know, you&#39;ve got to almost create this villain version of the candidate in order to get that coalescing that we&#39;ve been talking about. So avoid being the villain by being a reasonable person who is not making broad statements, right? It&#39;s the same as any time you&#39;re trying to build a coalition.

I don&#39;t know. But if he has no Donald Trump strategy, or if it looks like he&#39;s just going to say how great he is as he runs against him, well, then I think his campaign is dead in the water.
