            <span class="text">uh guys let&#39;s move on to our first segment trump&#39;s tariffs um on monday monday night i believe president-elect donald trump vowed to impose a 25 tariff on canadian and mexican products as soon as he takes office on january 20th he says he&#39;ll keep the tariff in place until canada and mexico stop drugs in particular fentanyl and migrants from entering the u.s illegally in response prime minister justin trudeau has said he will meet with the premiers this week to develop a team canada approach. And side note, Ontario Premier Doug Ford has said Trump&#39;s move is the biggest threat we&#39;ve ever seen to Canada&#39;s economy and is like, quote, a family member stabbing you right in the heart.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Look, I think that Doug Ford has found some colorful language to describe, I think, a pain that we&#39;re all going to be processing over the next bit. And probably we should have remembered existed in the four years between 2017 and 2020. And that&#39;s Donald Trump is erratic. Donald Trump doesn&#39;t care about the longstanding connections between the United States and Canada. Donald Trump&#39;s idea of an ally is somebody who is of value to him today, and he will fucking stab you in the heart to use Doug Ford&#39;s language tomorrow, if he thinks that&#39;s to his advantage. And as Canadians, I think we&#39;re very much not used to that. We take for granted what has been a special relationship with the United States, and people roll their eyes at it, and it becomes a platitude. But there&#39;s rarely in the history of civilization been two countries more closely connected. And so when one takes steps like this, it can obviously be surprising, even if it&#39;s not surprising at all, right? And I think that&#39;s what Canada is grappling with. And our premiers and our prime minister are doing</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Zane Corey mentioned last time around, and I have a list of questions, but that&#39;s one of them. Like, Canada in particular, this liberal government dealt with the threat of tariffs in Trump&#39;s last administration. One may argue that administration was staffed with more like, quote, unquote, normal staff, is Trump looks to purge the U.S. civil service and install loyalists. What does the backroom negotiating look like this time around? And how is this different than last time?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Who knows? I mean, that&#39;s the big Donald Trump question in the sense that who knows, like he just announced a trade representative later this evening, who used to be the former chief of staff to the trade representative last time. So you&#39;re You&#39;re still getting some continuity from the Trump administration as it relates to folks that have been on the file in the past.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You know, if you&#39;re Justin Trudeau from a pure political standpoint, this is kind of what you&#39;ve been waiting for, man. If you believed that the Trump presidency, and should it happen, was what was going to lift you in the polls and reverse your fortunes, you were probably not naive enough, but who knows. You probably weren&#39;t naive enough to just think just the sheer result of Trump&#39;s election would have everyone turn to you and say, oh my God, Justin Trudeau, we can&#39;t believe how lucky we are to have you. No, it was things like this. And so it was the opportunity to be able to present the Team Canada, to act in a crisis, to convene the premiers, to speak for Canada on the quote-unquote world stage. age. So in some ways, the negotiations are ones that Justin Trudeau, while not in the material sense, would have planned for, certainly in the political sense, should have been planning for in terms of this theater, right? Because if he wasn&#39;t, what the fuck were you doing? If this is what you were waiting for, if this is why you weren&#39;t leaving, because Trump might come in, then fucking here you go, man. Like, wear the cape, wear the Canadian flag, convene the premiers. years. And he&#39;s done that, right? So the fast acting Justin Trudeau, he has done that. And I&#39;d say that even over the last 24 to 36 hours, he&#39;s looked more prime ministerial than the guy who&#39;s more than likely still going to take his job. And I think that&#39;s exactly it, right? Pierre Palliev is spouting off slogans, still saying that, you know, I would do it differently. And this is Justin Trudeau&#39;s, you know, a suite of broader issues that Justin Trudeau&#39;s brought to this country. And this is a result of that. And yeah, Donald Trump is wrong. But you know, despite the rhetoric, which Pierre has been able to pretty much, you know, win on on a day-to-day week-to-week basis, which has resulted in his poll numbers, Justin Trudeau looked like the prime minister today and yesterday. And the fact that he convenes the premiers tomorrow, as we record on a Tuesday, speaks to that. So I don&#39;t know, Annalise, what these negotiations will look like. But here&#39;s the moment that our prime minister has been waiting for. And I&#39;m really really curious to see even outside of what this means for his political fortunes can he perform on the pure politics of of this particular moment and the pure sort of theatrics of this moment</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, so, so engaged and so, so smart from Zane. Zane, great answer to that question. Corey, Zane brought up some great, interesting points in there. I guess the first one being, like, is this an opportunity for, let&#39;s start with Trudeau. Is this an opportunity for Trudeau to have a win? And as part of that, is this a negotiation tactic on the Trump side? You know, you start at 25 percent. Stuff happens in the back rooms, as I was alluding to. And then you settle at 5 percent. And yay, look how great Trudeau is. Like, talk to me about how he can. Zayn&#39;s kind of talked about his behavior in the last 24 hours, whatever it&#39;s been. But how does he play this into a potential win?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, let&#39;s start with what Zane ended with, which was this idea of him looking prime ministerial. And I agree, I think it&#39;s pretty easy to look like a prime minister when you&#39;re convening premiers, because there&#39;s not too many people who get to do that, right. And so there are certain trappings of the office available to you. You are the person that Donald Trump is going to call to, to have this conversation, or who&#39;s going to call Donald Trump, I suppose to have the conversation. And it does seem consistent with what the liberals have have said for a while would be their quote unquote strategy, right? Like they&#39;ll show that they&#39;re the ones who can deal with with Donald Trump. So I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve thought an awful lot about the tone and how they want to convey themselves. Any political strategy is going to be based on how you look relative to your opponent. And I think the liberals have determined, I don&#39;t know if I 100% agree, but I think that they&#39;ve determined that Pierre Polyev is going to come off as snide and petty and small. And so he will meet these big moments with big man energy, and he&#39;s going to go and he&#39;s going to be the prime minister that we all need.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Not a new strategy. Jimmy Carter tried this in 1980, the Rose Garden strategy it was called, right? This idea that you would be the president and people would see you as the president rather than you out there campaigning. I will observe he did not win the 1980 election. And so I do think the Democrats</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Democrats didn&#39;t, right? So I do think we do need to think about that very carefully in all of our analysis here, right? right? It is possible for people to disaggregate the person doing the job and the trappings of the job from who they want to do the job. And there is a general realization that you&#39;re always going to look more like you&#39;re in the job when you&#39;re in the job, not to sound too basic about it. But Annalise, you were asking about, does this all end after a bunch of theater at 5%? Well, I think even that would be challenging for me because what Donald Trump has said is we&#39;ve You&#39;ve got this crisis on the northern border, right? All of these drugs, all of these migrants. Well, yes, they are up a little bit. They&#39;re not even a fraction of a fraction of what&#39;s happening on the southern border of the United States. It&#39;s a totally different story. Even that blip has started to decline in the past few months as the Canadian government has already taken action to stem it. And most of the drugs that are caught coming into Canada from or coming into the United States from Canada are being brought in to the United States by Americans. It&#39;s American citizens that are doing this. So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is his entire argument is bullshit. It is utter bullshit, even if you want to accept the argument on the southern border. And I think you have to accept there&#39;s a lot of migrants and drugs coming through the southern border. That is not the situation on the northern border. He is just bundling this all together. He&#39;s trying to use the word crisis like it&#39;s bingo because his power to create tariffs comes from an emergency power that presidents have. And he&#39;s just trying to do Donald Trump shit. He&#39;s trying to be a bully. He&#39;s trying to come in hard. He&#39;s trying to get quote unquote concessions. I don&#39;t know why we should concede on a thing that&#39;s fake, but maybe we&#39;ll get there in a minute. And then at the end of the day, he&#39;s trying to create a condition where even if he puts a 10% tariff, like we&#39;re all patting ourselves on the back. And that&#39;s, that&#39;s dumb. And that&#39;s bullshit. And if we take that approach, it&#39;s going to be a long fucking four years and beyond, because we just can&#39;t play this game. We just can&#39;t play this game. And so I&#39;m not sure I can give the Prime Minister very good marks if that&#39;s where this ends up. But maybe it ends up in a different place for it to end up in a different place. I do believe we&#39;re going to need a little more discipline from our premiers than I think we saw today. Well,</span>

So, yeah, I mean, premiers are going to premiere and try to win over support and try to stand out. And, you know, someone like Daniel Smith has tall poppy syndrome where she has to stand out in her own way, you know, and they&#39;re going to do just that. But the discipline is going to be, to Corey&#39;s point, the big sort of X factor here. Do they have any? And while Justin Trudeau tries to get this real nice balance, fascinating balance, I would say, between doing a couple of things, having a tough approach to the United States, but also recognizing that we&#39;re the junior partner, also simultaneously recognizing we&#39;re a G7 nation, that we actually represent our own, we have our own heft in this situation. recognizing the uniqueness of this while doing some of the simple stuff and what&#39;s fascinating about this trump tariffs threat is that you know i jokingly said to you guys before we went on no one knows what the fuck a tariff is but like and i don&#39;t think one of those people one of those people&#39;s donald trump you know you find this rally clip clip where i believe it was in um in michigan two or three days before the election where he&#39;s got no tax banners behind him people carrying these no tax banners. And then they&#39;re wearing these helmets that say no and tax, right? As he says, I now I&#39;m going to do my favorite thing, my new favorite word, tariff, and people just start erupting, not recognizing that these tariffs to Canada and Mexico will have massive economic ramifications and cost of good ramifications for US consumers themselves. And so Trudeau also has to do some of that work. And what I find fascinating about this file is how far the The Trudeau strategy goes towards educating Americans and trying to get his counterparts in some of these border states to educate Americans around the costs of Trump&#39;s tariffs. And remember, this is a guy who&#39;s not even in office yet. So we have this weird sort of 55-day-ish window to try to resolve this and educate on this before he does, quote unquote, his day one strategy on this particular thing. So it&#39;s going to be really interesting.</span>

I think they need to be coordinated, and I think they need to be playing different parts in theatre, right? Some of the premiers will have good relations with governors that they can then put pressure on the President of the United States and his team. Some of the premiers will just be the heads of provinces with some heft for different reasons. Danielle Smith, of course, big oil producing province, obviously, to state the blindingly obvious. Well, that oil we&#39;re hearing is also subject to this tariff, or at least that&#39;s the saber rattling that Donald Trump is doing. Not part of the exemption,</span>

            <span class="text">So, you know, we should be working connections between Alberta and Texas on, you know, on the corporate side, right? There are things to do.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one of the things that the negotiators on the American side always said was the Canadians were tough negotiators. They were a pain in the ass, because the federal negotiators would always say things like, oh, the premiers will never go for that, right? Premiers will never go for that. And the premiers played the role they needed to play in order for Canada to get to the best deal possible. This is clearly an area of federal jurisdiction, but there are clearly ways that the premiers can be helpful in any kind of conversation. But in those original free trade conversations I&#39;m talking about, the premiers were the people outside of the room where the prime minister of the day could say, whether it was Mulroney or Chrétien, like, I can&#39;t get that past the premiers. It&#39;s almost like they&#39;re like the board, right? The board will never buy that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Exactly right. And our constitution and these watertight compartments and the lack of ability to move unilaterally on basically anything federally became a strength and it allowed the Canadian negotiators to negotiate really hard lines. But the opposite seems to be setting up right now. Now, now you almost see premiers that are running closer to the US position, rather than being the people in the background that that Canadians can or that the Canadian government can say, premiers will never go for this. So I think that that&#39;s a challenge. And I think that it really tells us a little bit about this internationalized political era we&#39;re in right now, where I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a stretch to say somebody like Danielle Smith may feel greater affinity to the government of Donald Trump, because</span>

There are some border states that have much more trade with Mexico or Canada that are going to be hit much, much worse. And depending on what you&#39;re buying, of course, that&#39;s going to have a major, major effect on these things. And again, I&#39;m just talking about the Canada and Mexico tariffs. There are also the China tariffs that are potentially under consideration, all of the global tariffs, which will further increase that. And to Zane&#39;s point, tariffs are a tax. Like, it&#39;s just a tax collected in a different way. So that&#39;s the impact to America. To Canada, I</span>

            <span class="text">if you wanted the dollar to kind of depreciate to a point where the tariffs no longer have the effect and, like, we become economically on export the same level of competitive, competitive, that would be the dollar dropping from about where it is at 71 cents to about 57, 58 cents, right, just to give you a sense of what it would require for us to be as competitive in the US market after. And so I&#39;m not saying we would get there. Obviously, there would be trade with a lot of other countries that would pick up the slack. Some of that just wouldn&#39;t go anywhere. There&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of considerations here. I&#39;m not trying to simplify it. But I&#39;m just trying to say that&#39;s how exposed we are to trade with the United States. And that&#39;s what a magnitude would would be so uh you know it&#39;s just a much bigger deal to us in mexico than it is to the u.s and it is an asymmetry that donald trump has to his advantage like not even counting just the overall heft of the united states we&#39;re more reliant on them than they are on us and we probably should have thought a little bit more about that over the last eight years and beyond and we probably need to be thinking really hard right now even if we get out of this moment of crisis how we find How we find new trading partners, how we find new defense partners, how we just find new dance partners, period, in the world and are not so reliant on a guy like Donald Trump, or</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, for sure. Key messaging has to be a huge part of it. I imagine just based on what some of the premiers have done in the past 24 hours, I might even be sharing some fact base and saying, folks, this is you can&#39;t you can&#39;t concede that this is a thing. If it&#39;s a thing, then we have to do stuff. And there&#39;s nothing to do here. And this is a challenge. Like, how do you?</span>

            <span class="text">Whether they validate his concerns, whether they stroke his ego, he&#39;s going to need to talk to all of them. He does have an advantage in that room, and that&#39;s that he&#39;s been prime minister since 2015. He has negotiated with Donald Trump many times before. I am sure he knows Donald Trump better than any of those premiers. And so he&#39;s going to have to establish his credibility with the group on this particular matter. He&#39;s going to have to reinforce this is a Team Canada approach, and he&#39;s going to need to very quickly isolate players that don&#39;t want to play. And if every other premier, including premiers of the same stripe, conservative, can turn into somebody like danielle smith and say danielle we can&#39;t do this you know i you know i understand the politics god i i don&#39;t like this trudeau guy either but this is this is too fucking serious i think that would be a good foundation from which then to build the approach but the approach is probably as much as anything assigning i think stakeholders and uh identifying opportunities but i&#39;ll let zane fill in more of the details there key messages and stakeholders common understanding that would be the foundation i would start yeah</span>

            <span class="text">think it&#39;s there&#39;s There&#39;s some real leadership basics here, right? You&#39;re walking into a room where you&#39;re the alpha, but every one of the folks in there in a day-to-day basis, perhaps outside of this meeting, is treated as the number one, right? 360 some odd days a year outside of some rare meetings with the prime minister and some meetings with governors and other more senior people, these premiers are treated as the principal. And so you&#39;ve got to recognize that, right? You&#39;ve got to recognize that each one of them thinks that they&#39;re the smartest person in the room. And you as a prime minister have obviously a political but also policy imperative heading into that. If you if you look at this through the lens of corporate governance, which I think is not a terrible lens, because we&#39;ve been talking about that. Point number one, you got to be aligned with your board chair. That means Doug Ford, Justin Trudeau, and which is what I really liked today with Justin Trudeau calling Doug Ford saying we&#39;re meeting, I&#39;m responding to your letter, we&#39;re doing this, you&#39;re the board chair of this organization. Let&#39;s do it. I&#39;m the CEO, you&#39;re the board chair, let&#39;s be aligned. So I think the first thing is making sure Ford is align, at</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">at least on the broad strokes. To Corey&#39;s point number two, I think there&#39;s going to be some hard truths that need to be delivered. He, as in the prime minister, does not need to deliver all of them. I think the best scenario for him is if premiers are talking to one another, and he is very much about strategic alignment. He&#39;s not necessarily the person that speaks first. He&#39;s the person that speaks last. I&#39;m just basically giving you leadership one-to-one stuff, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That Ford leads the meeting. Trudeau is navigating strategic alignment. He&#39;s almost there kind of celebrating certain people and their roles and potential roles that they can have. You know, Daniel Smith and him don&#39;t get along. But Daniel Smith, to Corey&#39;s point, man, you&#39;ve got better relationships with, you know, with Texas and other oil producing places than I ever would. Can you do us a solid and take this role on, right? Can you do that? And she might, you know, say yes or no, but it&#39;s coming from a place of, can you do Team Canada all solid here and make this happen? And so I think those are some of the initial things. After that, I would really get them doing</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">doing the work in the room. I would come in with a, here&#39;s what we&#39;re thinking, right? We&#39;re thinking a campaign. It&#39;s called tariffs or taxes. What do you think? You know, we want to simplify the issue. We want to make it, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re calling it internally. Does that jive with you guys? Does that work? Like, here&#39;s, you know, and just almost being like, hey, here&#39;s 12 really smart people. Was it 12, 13? 13 really smart people in the room. Can you, you know, what do you think of this? And get them doing the work. Get them, like, co-creating together. I think that&#39;s so important when you have a bunch of people who have big egos and perhaps disparate directions and disparate agendas, letting them in on something and getting them to do the work and play a bit of ball, and you facilitate and moderate rather than lead it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That, I think, really can create some forward momentum out of those meetings. I think often when you&#39;re in these meetings, you recognize, and not to say I&#39;m in these meetings, but when you&#39;re in the meeting with the primary, the principal, you realize a couple of things. They usually are the ones that speak last. They&#39;re usually the ones that are, if they&#39;re doing their job well, are not driving their agenda from the top, but effectively trying to, you know, strategically align. Here&#39;s what I hear being said. Here&#39;s, you know, here&#39;s a crazy thought from my end. How about this, right? And then like facilitating, moderating, putting the pieces together. And when you put the pieces together that other people put down, that&#39;s where you start inserting a bit of your agenda, your mold, your sort of thing, so that you can get, everyone can have buy-in that they had something to do with it. That&#39;s what I think a successful meeting could honestly look like. Alignment with your board chair, speak last, moderate rather than, you know, kind of lead and look desperate because you&#39;ve got a political agenda that you need to, you know, turn your fortunes around into. And you look like the person that&#39;s ready to do the work, put some ideas on the table, and get other people in that room to mold them and thank them for their feedback and their directionality on it. And cast the roles to your question, Annalise, as much as you can. Celebrate what people bring uniquely to the table and cast them in those roles and see if they accept them.</span>

I think Trudeau leads. I believe that there is probably an expectation that he does, and if he doesn&#39;t do it, he&#39;ll fail to meet that expectation. So some of it is also, you&#39;ve got to go in there knowing what they&#39;re anticipating you to do. And in</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">general, it&#39;s always good when you go to a meeting, not just to think about what you want to get out of it, but what all of the other people in the room want get out of it too and be really mindful of that and help them get out of the meeting what they want to get out of the meeting and in this case i do believe they&#39;re they&#39;re wanting as much as anything to to know that the federal government has this in hand and the federal government&#39;s not going to do something that screws them so you&#39;ve got to make sure that you&#39;ve got their agendas their industries everything top of mind don&#39;t be surprised for example if some premiers come at it from what you might perceive as a more selfish point of view which is well what if we we look at sectoral exemptions, right? Like maybe oil and gas should be exempted, right? What&#39;s that conversation going to look like when you&#39;re there? And on those ones, to some of Zane&#39;s strategic points there, let the other premiers rein in those premiers and pull them back rather than it feel like it&#39;s somebody coming from up top. But don&#39;t confuse it. You&#39;re the prime minister. You are in charge. You are the head of this country. In charge does not have to mean you drive every single moment of that agenda.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">like, like, to be clear. Right. But you have to you have to start thinking about what you need to do with your allies at the very least. So here&#39;s a few things you&#39;re not going to do. You&#39;re not going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars. And let&#39;s all be clear about this. You&#39;ve asked this in the form of your question on potentially an empty threat and an anchor position for negotiation on Donald Trump to educate Americans on what tariffs are, right? Right. I think a lot of that&#39;s going to happen right now, naturally, in the United States, where the conversation is already coming into and snapping into focus. Because let&#39;s be clear, for us right now, it&#39;s a Canada-U.S. conversation. For the U.S. right now, it&#39;s a U.S.-Canada-Mexico conversation. So they&#39;re talking about goods right now that are coming from Mexico, that are coming from Canada. uh we&#39;re you know to cory&#39;s point uh what i&#39;ve heard in some of the analysis is that it&#39;s a thousand bucks from each side of the border that could be added to to the cost of an average american family so a thousand bucks from canada roughly a thousand bucks from mexico roughly so two thousand dollars you know 200 billion dollars on the nearly 700 billion dollars of um trade that we do with the with the u.s each year could be the tax bill the tariff bill to to Americans alone. That&#39;s not even counting the Canadian side of things. So I think a lot of this work is going to be happening in the United States right now. I suspect Trump knows that the half life on the word tariff is limited, that it&#39;s going to get precipitously less popular as more education on tariffs happens. I think there&#39;s going to be some hardcore folks within the Trump quote unquote base that are going to support tariffs regardless. But the fact is, business Business associations on both sides of the border, governors, consumer groups, all these associations, others are going to come out and start talking about this in the United States. And I think as Team Canada, you need to be prepared to jump on their key messages, not necessarily fuel this fight with an expensive ad spend in the United States. Yours is about stakeholder engagement with governors, officials, other folks, making sure more and more people are on the same page as you. Understanding, be like, your understanding is this as well, right? Check. Good. good. Your understanding is this as well. Yes, check, good. That&#39;s the work that you&#39;re doing right now. And what you need is something simple and easy for folks to understand in terms of a gut check, right? Being like, this is a tax. It&#39;s a tax. It&#39;s this expensive. It&#39;s that expensive. Cool. We&#39;re on the same page. Just making sure you understand that. And just running through the Rolodex of contacts that you have that are strategic stakeholders for you in the United So it&#39;s indirect diplomacy that way. It&#39;s not direct ad spend campaign, Government of Canada funding a multi-billion dollar, because that&#39;s honestly what it would take, campaign to educate Americans. That&#39;s not it at all. But that work is going to be done. And you can already see it happening right now in real time in the United States.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You know, there is the step one, convince everybody it&#39;s a bad idea, get the pressure to come from inside America. The call is coming from inside the House. There is probably also a place where you at least need the threat of a step two, which is some sort of retaliation. And I mean, it doesn&#39;t make any sense to me that we would retaliate with our own tariffs. I don&#39;t know why we would do such a self-own. And I do think that there&#39;s very few things that are available to us that will hurt America more than what America is doing to itself, right? Because it will raise prices for all of these things. But we do need to canvas the options available for us and how we can say, okay, well, America, you did this. We&#39;re not happy about this. Here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to, I don&#39;t know, here&#39;s now how we&#39;re going to withhold something that you need, right? And I sort of struggle to think about what those might be. I was looking for resources, perhaps, that we provide in an outsized way to America. Uranium, potash, for sure. But I&#39;m not really sure. But the federal government needs to be sure. They need to figure out what they&#39;re going to do as a step two. And maybe step two isn&#39;t even about goods. Maybe it&#39;s about treaties. Maybe it&#39;s about strategic partnerships. Maybe this pushes us more into China&#39;s orbit. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="text">To me, Corey&#39;s right. The step two position is the most interesting around what the message is and what the action is, right? Because this comes down to the point of like, we will not negotiate with ourselves automatic. We won&#39;t fall on our own sword and be like, oh, 25, how about five? You know, like, you know, we won&#39;t do shit like that, especially with hollow threats, right? So how does Canada show it isn&#39;t passive, right? How does Canada show that, you know, how does Trudeau deflect the domestic critics, right? How do we celebrate trade wins? How do we talk about the 2018 playbook, right, where we can remind the public that we successfully resisted similar tariffs from the same guy, right, by staying united, by staying firm? I did that. We did that, right? And so in a sense, the message is more domestic around the sense of like, how do you not capitulate? How do you protect workers, right? You know, emphasize reciprocity, but not this weakness that people are expecting you to kind of radiate out in some ways. Let</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Let me jump off that reciprocity point. I think that in terms of finding space for a deal, they need to find something that makes both sides look like they completely won, right? And because Donald Trump has, let&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s just call it like a fictional view of reality, it&#39;s a little bit tough to do, but I think in a funny way, it might also provide some interesting options here. Like, what if you said, okay, as Prime Minister Donald Trump, we understand America is very concerned about migrants and very concerned about drugs at the border. We Canadians too are concerned about things coming across the border, drugs, guns, all of that. So how about this as a deal? When a certain level of busts at the border occurs on either side, each country is committing to reinforcing their border security on the other side, right? So if you&#39;re finding fentanyl come across, yes, that will trigger us having to put more border agents at crossings. If we&#39;re finding guns come across, if we&#39;re finding cocaine come across, that will trigger you putting more things on it. So that creates that sense of reciprocity. It creates a sense that something actually happened. It allows you to save face. And I&#39;m not saying this is the deal, but I&#39;m saying a deal where it looks like it applies evenly to both sides. And actually, because of a mechanism like that doesn&#39;t need us to do anything if there&#39;s not not a real problem, those are the kind of solutions you need to be on the lookout for if you&#39;re the prime minister.</span>

            <span class="text">I think this is about trade a bit. I think it&#39;s about Trump to get a bit of a win, saying something happened. I think his main tariff combatant is China. China I think he&#39;s excited to go after China and cripple their economy and you know to and he&#39;s gonna do that shit uh we might just be a trial balloon in some ways but I think Corey&#39;s absolutely right this may start with tariffs which we need to which Canada needs to make clear and I think domestic uh groups in America will make clear that it&#39;s a tax on both sides and consumers and it needs to land somewhere far away from tariffs it needs to land something to do with border border security, something to do with migrants. And you&#39;re already seeing that strategy or that sort of B-side, if I can call it that, play out with Dominic LeBlanc today, talking about border security, all those sort of things, right? Or drones.</span>

            <span class="text">Absolutely. Drones, other things, like here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to proactively do. Team Canada, quote unquote, is trying to get this thing resolved even before Trump takes office, right? Get us to a deal before he even has a chance to make this a day one priority. And so you&#39;re already seeing that play out. I think this was just starting at tariffs. So to answer your question, I think the possibility of this landing quite far away from tariffs and a percentage number,</span>

            <span class="text">So I agree. But my anxiety is, see my previous points, there&#39;s not actually a problem. So I would like our government to try to find something that is triggered by reality, if that makes any sense. Like, yeah, we&#39;ll do these things based on this data. And if the data goes down, we won&#39;t do these things or something to that effect. Like, yeah, sure, we&#39;ll add a</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to throw this out. A couple billion dollars to put whatever, an additional layer of border guards for a non-existent problem seems like a nice price to pay for what could be billions of dollars in trade tariffs. So I think even landing there, solving his imaginary problem so he can have a TV win, which honestly I think this really could be about, might be the W at the end of the day. I actually would not be surprised if it lands there. I know you want to tether it to reality, but if we go out and solve his imaginary problems with the massive investment in tech, drones, and border agents, fuck it. Sure, Canada&#39;s happy to pay the price.</span>

They&#39;re also sending $250 in the spring to about 18 million working Canadians. The list of what gets a GST holiday is interesting. Christmas trees, physical print newspapers, but not physical print magazines or online news subscriptions. Kids clothing and toys. Definitions, though, of like what is a kid. I think it&#39;s under 14 on the toys. Shoes, diapers, car seats, restaurant meals, books, alcoholic beverages, but only up to 7%. Candy, pudding, granola, puzzles. puzzles, a long list of things.

Here&#39;s good advice coming from someone. Buy it on the 26th. It&#39;s just, you&#39;re going to get it for like 80% off off and an additional 5% off. Because if you&#39;re buying on the 14th, you&#39;re not celebrating Christmas at all anyways, at least not properly. So what the fuck? Listen, three things. Number one, look at the list of all the folks that have got this GST exemption. That is the lobbyist Olympics right there. Newspapers, diapers, whatever, those are the best lobbyists.

Because this now actually fundamentally buys into 150 is not enough to sustain a family in any part of this country anymore. And you need temporary emergency relief that puts us more into a deficit. That&#39;s how bad shit is for you. The acknowledgement there, I think, is so much more damning than the acknowledgement of a two month, you know, constitutes a 12 month, which should just mean new government, right? Like, you can earn that much money in this country, and it&#39;s not enough for you. And we need to give you emergency, you know, relief, so to speak. What I like, part three, what I like about it, and this is purely theoretical, because it&#39;s not strategic, is that it finally acknowledges, and the liberals like everything recently, lethargic, late, out of step, not right timing. But it acknowledges one thing that the liberals feel like they&#39;re not above populist politics. So for me, I&#39;m hoping I I see a bit more of this. I hope it&#39;s more strategically aligned, better timed, et cetera, down the road. But that&#39;s the very thin silver lining in all of this, because I think the rest of it is actually quite revelatory in all the wrong ways.</span>

Wow, that&#39;s a lot cheaper than we thought. Let&#39;s throw that in there too. And then you got to a point where the list felt a little light and you thought, oh, what else can we get that sounds good, but wouldn&#39;t be too expensive?

What if we could relive that glory? And I think it starts there, where someone kind of being like, Serb was awesome. Yeah, it was. Let&#39;s think about that, right? How do we, fuck, how do we have it and not impact the deficit? Let&#39;s make it temporary. That won&#39;t impact the deficit so much. But what if they call it a gimmick? Ah, no, but actually, it&#39;s not a gimmick because we&#39;re a government and they&#39;re nothing and they&#39;re not doing jack shit. Okay, well, what do we include on it? See Corey&#39;s notes, right? List of things. Who do we care about? Okay, well, what do we want to do? We want to show empathy. we want to show we&#39;re action oriented okay who are the people we care about what are the things they care about let&#39;s make a list who else has asked for shit recently add that to the board and then how do we make this a contrast and show where fiscal responsibility we reassure like you know the programs are sustainable everything&#39;s good right and then to cory&#39;s point someone&#39;s building like a the narrative framework someone&#39;s like writing the key messages on criticism someone&#39;s doing the ops plan on it right um someone&#39;s finding historical examples of when this has worked and you know how they get political brownie points so that someone like like me, on a podcast says, oh, but the premiers did it and they were successful, right? Or someone mentions Ralph Bucks, right? So they&#39;re hearkening back. Someone makes sure that that&#39;s part of the key message, right? And then they just refine it and get it out the door. But at the end of the day, when you talk about the name, I think that was not poll-tested, focus-grouped. I think this was the best,</span>

            <span class="text">they also had a problem in that they they were trying to bring this out without people knowing they were doing this. Whenever the government attempts something with the element of surprise, they have a couple of fundamental problems. We&#39;ve talked about some of them in the past, but I just want to hit the treetops of them. One is, they have no idea if people are going to like this or not. They&#39;re looking at other polling, they&#39;re doing conjecture, they&#39;re identifying trends maybe on social media. But it&#39;s what we always say, beware of novel concepts, because people have thought about them for a second, second and they will get turned against them in a second, even if they&#39;ve told you that they like them when somebody comes in with a compelling argument going the other way. If it&#39;s an idea that&#39;s been durably tested back and forth, people have smashed it, people have thrown it off a cliff and people still end up liking it in certain numbers, that&#39;s a lot more valuable to a government than an idea that is 70% approval from a bunch of people who couldn&#39;t possibly have heard the counter argument yet. And so they&#39;re looking at this, they&#39;re saying, hey, free money. And hey, hey, we did a secret focus group of 200 Canadians and they all seem to like the free money.</span>

And so rather than creating big endowments or investments in various things, we did that O2 Alberta thing of just saying, well, let&#39;s just give it to people like Corey Hogan so he can buy his first iPod, right?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">why don&#39;t I tee this up a little bit here? The government of Alberta announced today that they were going to enact their Sovereignty Act, you know, their whatever it&#39;s called, Alberta Within a United Canada Act, whatever their actual legal name is. And they had this brilliant idea where to avoid the emissions cap that the federal government doesn&#39;t, you know, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s like they have an emissions cap, but they don&#39;t have the production cap that the government of Alberta is implying, right? To avoid this emissions cap, what they&#39;re going to say is that all emissions data is the property of the government of Alberta and we own it and you can&#39;t give it to the feds. Only we can give it to the feds. And the feds are not allowed because we&#39;re now declaring this critical infrastructure. Every oil and gas thing, they&#39;re not allowed to come in and get this data from you. And we&#39;re not playing ball. And I mean, all of this is dumb. like i just have to say this is not how government works it&#39;s not how the constitution works this is not how law and order works you don&#39;t just get to say as a provincial government we&#39;ve decided federal laws don&#39;t apply to us gotcha now what are you going to do move on feds that that&#39;s not how this works so i would say this is uh this</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is not nearly as clever as the government thinks these are well hashed issues there is one way that the government of alberta can get out of this, besides taking the political route of convincing the federal government to remove an emissions cap. And that is to convince a court that this infringes on their jurisdiction,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">which they don&#39;t need a Sovereignty Act to do. They need a lawyer to do. They need to go to court and they need to make a case. And that&#39;s how these things work. Because there are two doors here. One door says you are not allowed to do this, in which case the federal government just has to stop because the interpretation of the Constitution is thus. Or there is a door that that says the federal government is allowed to do this. And if you&#39;ve walked through that door,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? There is a concept called paramountcy, which says if there is a conflict between federal laws and provincial laws, federal laws take precedence.

And fact is, I think the public messaging on this has been tough for the postal workers to get across, that this is not something that they want to do, not something that they&#39;re trying to ruin holiday season for. But you&#39;re hearing now the piping up of, it started with small businesses, right, saying this is terrible, worst time of year, Black Friday, all these sort And now you&#39;re going to start feeling it when consumers start putting in Black Friday, Cyber Monday orders, etc., and realize that a lot of those, some of which are delivered through Canada Post, many are not, are not going to show up in time. But this crunch is getting very, very difficult right now. And I&#39;m thinking about what the escalation tactic here is. I&#39;m also curious to see what the federal mediator does here.
