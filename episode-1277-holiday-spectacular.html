Wrong. Okay, we&#39;re going to keep track. Six out of ten, it&#39;s going to be a white Orthodox New Year&#39;s Eve. Here we go, Stephen Carter. First question.

So I&#39;m going to ask you, in the spirit of the holiday spectacular, Stephen Carter, did the Alberta NDP land the plane on every one of their caucus members getting a critic title. We talked about this in depth when it began, but did they land the plane now with some time and some ability to look at this? I wanted to balance off the Alberta conversation. This is one that I think is fascinating. Did that particular political strategy or tactic land for you?</div>

Now, a few thousand votes in different places could have been an NDP government by a squeaker. You could make a pretty strong case this should never have been a close election in Alberta, let alone one Danielle Smith won, right? But there are just some inherent things there. So I do think Danielle Smith probably still has a better chance back to back. I think that because she barely won, she eliminated all of the moderate elements in her party that might have given her trouble from that particular aspect. And so she&#39;s probably – like, you don&#39;t hear a lot about UCP caucus unrest right now. Now, maybe you will in a year. That is kind of the UCP. Yeah.</div>

The way he&#39;s talked about actively, I don&#39;t know, imprisoning people who have different views from him.
