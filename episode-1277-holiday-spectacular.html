The holiday spectacular. The holiday spectacular, which is what this is. We alternate before, sometimes we do it during Orthodox Christmas, which is today. Other times we do it during the, what we&#39;d call, the conventional holiday season, for those that like to observe. Yeah.

Well, he&#39;s also a white. He&#39;s a Vanna White of sorts. He will be keeping track. He will be potentially acting as scorekeeper slash timekeeper, maybe telling Stephen Carter to shape up when he gets some of these questions that are so easy for Corey, but not so easy for Carter. Wrong. Okay, we&#39;re going to keep track. Six out of ten, it&#39;s going to be a white Orthodox New Year&#39;s Eve. Here we go, Stephen Carter. First question.

Guys, I&#39;m going to jump in to four things that happened this year. and ask you, like in Flair Airlines fashion, did this particular political thing land this year? Did it work out? Was it successful? It could be a cleanup. It could be a strategy. It could be a particular agreement. We&#39;re going to go through each one of them. You&#39;re not picking them for me. We&#39;re going to go through each one of them. We&#39;re going to discuss them for a bit, relatively quickly, and then we&#39;ll move it on simply thereafter. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you.

This is something when it first happened, we talked about. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked about it since. So I&#39;m going to ask you, in the spirit of the holiday spectacular, Stephen Carter, did the Alberta NDP land the plane on every one of their caucus members getting a critic title. We talked about this in depth when it began, but did they land the plane now with some time and some ability to look at this? I wanted to balance off the Alberta conversation. This is one that I think is fascinating. Did that particular political strategy or tactic land for you?</span>

That&#39;s one lens. And I would say that hasn&#39;t, in my opinion, assisted them any, although let&#39;s not overstate it either. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been like a fatal flaw.</span>

This is the 13th year in a row, Stephen Carter. It is time for the Flair Airlines rare perfect landing. That&#39;s right, Carter. Rarely does Flair Airlines make it to the tarmac properly on time. And I have got for you a couple of political things that have happened this year that I think would be almost universally described as W&#39;s across the board. You have to tell me which one is the biggest win. And Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you that same question, same list we&#39;ll discuss us, so to speak. So Carter, here&#39;s your list for you.

So I, I mean, I&#39;m, I&#39;m looking at that. I&#39;m looking at the ceasefire from Canada. I mean, I think that us standing opposed to the United States is a big deal. And I just don&#39;t want to give Pierre Polyev anything. So I am between Smith and ceasefire. Smith and ceasefire. I&#39;m going to do the random number generator on chat GPT.</span>

But the advocates who pushed for it collectively, they got what they were looking for with their advocacy. Similar to last year when we talked about on the Holiday Spectacular, CUPE in Ontario pushing Doug Ford to their ends in terms of what they wanted as an outside player and advocate. Corey, Pierre, these advocates on Canada committing to a ceasefire, Danielle Smith, Wab Kanu, Olivia Chow, that is my list. Feel free to add to yours if you think it&#39;s none of these.

So I don&#39;t think that was a perfect landing. Stephen&#39;s done a pretty good rundown on some of the others as to why they can&#39;t be considered perfect landings, right? I</span>

            <span class="text">I would say Pierre Polievs comes pretty close to being a perfect landing. The only reason why I&#39;m not that inclined to give it to him is because we just have not gotten to an election yet. So we just don&#39;t know. No. There is the possibility he&#39;s setting himself the mother of all traps by creating this fake persona that will fall to pieces under the hot lights of a campaign. I don&#39;t actually believe that&#39;s likely, but it&#39;s possible. Can&#39;t call it that one yet. Like, that&#39;s still a flight that&#39;s, you</span>

Like that was very well done, the way they managed that at the summer with the announcement and how little conversation there&#39;s been afterwards.

Now, a few thousand votes in different places could have been an NDP government by a squeaker. You could make a pretty strong case this should never have been a close election in Alberta, let alone one Danielle Smith won, right? But there are just some inherent things there. So I do think Danielle Smith probably still has a better chance back to back. I think that because she barely won, she eliminated all of the moderate elements in her party that might have given her trouble from that particular aspect. And so she&#39;s probably – like, you don&#39;t hear a lot about UCP caucus unrest right now. Now, maybe you will in a year. That is kind of the UCP. Yeah.</span>

They are ahead of the CAC by six points after being behind CAC by, I think, 25 at the start of the year. This is something to watch. And when you start thinking about the volatile conditions that are kicking around here. Oh, just imagine 2025, we have Prime Minister Pierre Poliev.

The way he&#39;s talked about actively, I don&#39;t know, imprisoning people who have different views from him. The threats that his proxies have made about basically everything that we would consider fundamental to a fair and democratic society is so incredibly troubling and yet this man sits there in the polls tied with joe biden sits there unsurmountable in the republican primary now maybe next week we&#39;ll get a bit of a surprise in iowa someone will outperform maybe people will reconsider some things but as it stands right now yeah yeah</span>
