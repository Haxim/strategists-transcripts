Did O'Toole do what he needed to do to sell himself as a prime minister in waiting? And how much do you think Jagmeet Singh can bench? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

It&#39;s not unusual to this country we see the debates being produced in the United States in the same fashion.

And as a result, after that election, there was a commission put on leaders&#39; debates that started running these debates with almost an imprimatur of, This is the independent group that puts it together. It&#39;s got representation from different, I think, political backgrounds and chaired by somebody who is seen universally as nonpartisan, chaired by the former governor general in this case. And after the 2019 debate, there were a bunch of recommendations, most of which seem to have been terrible based on the end result that we got here. uh because while the 2019 debate was no walk in the park this was i described it on twitter as it was like the</div>

She picked her points. She used silence. Like, her lines, I think, are more clippable in some ways.

          <div class="said">I would agree. I would also say Trudeau had, in my opinion, by far the most uneven performance. His first two segments, he was so overwhelmed, right?

He looked almost a little bit sweaty at certain points, and it was in many ways contrasted to, like, by</div>

          <div class="said">by far the most crisp, immaculate suit and all of that. He just looked so put together from the neck down, and it just accentuated him looking not quite as comfortable, I think, from the neck up. And so first two segments, really, I thought he felt like he was under total assault, and he was acting like a man under total assault. He was strongest on the reconciliation section. And what Carter said really, I think, resonated with me, this notion of too many lines or too few lines. In general, I would say he really tried to overstuff his arguments. And that led to a lot of rapid speech, which I think led to that feeling of being overwhelmed that I&#39;m talking about, which you really saw in sections one, two, and five, in my opinion. But</div>

          <div class="said">So, Corey, on the O&#39;Toole front, you know what&#39;s interesting to me is I thought he would be at a strategic disadvantage. He was all the way at the end. He wasn&#39;t beside Trudeau. He wasn&#39;t really in the mix. I thought he&#39;d kind of get forgotten. And sometimes it kind of felt like he did, like he wasn&#39;t in the heat of it in the middle. I think the positioning of the podiums helped Paul in a certain way, because even in the wide shots, you could kind of see her in the mix almost every single time, especially if it was on Singh or Trudeau. But O&#39;Toole did seem to hold his own in a very different manner. He was at the end, but when they came to him, he wasn&#39;t really being attacked all that much. And what I really noticed was how he presented his arguments, which was significantly different than the way Trudeau presented his sort of platform arguments and lines.</div>

And it just, it&#39;s such a contrast to the image of Trudeau that the conservatives want to portray, which is one who just gives high-minded statements, but doesn&#39;t follow it up with action. And the understated nature of O&#39;Toole&#39;s performance, I think, was very much in line with those images they&#39;re trying to present, not just of O&#39;Toole, but also of the prime minister in contrast.

And he was going to be able to gather more votes as a result. And I had to wonder if some of the attacks weren&#39;t effective.

          <div class="said">I mean, this was just my impression. Perhaps it&#39;s entirely wrong and somebody can sabermetrics me on it. But I really got the sense that Singh went after the prime minister two, three times as much as he ever went after O&#39;Toole. And in fact, he was often the hype man for O&#39;Toole&#39;s arguments to the point about thinking, yeah, you don&#39;t get it done. That&#39;s a great point. Yeah, you are a do-nothing prime minister. And so it feels a bit like Singh&#39;s taking a moonshot here. What he&#39;s trying to do is get ahead of the liberals and replace the liberals, supplant them, get all of that progressive vote, much like we saw in 2011. That&#39;s quite a swing. And whether it works or not, TBD. But it also meant that he wasn&#39;t trying to make O&#39;Toole seem even scarier. So the strategy may have worked in two different ways. I have to say, and I really felt it today, Singh has, and I&#39;ve thought this ever since the first time I ever met Jagmeet Singh, before he even was running for the leader, he has about 20% more bro energy than I can handle.</div>

You talked about the rebel media, smackdown, takedown, whatever. I&#39;m sure many folks have heard it already in the scrum yesterday after French debate. You had that plus what seemed to be the line of the night for Trudeau yesterday in the French debate where he told Blanchet that he does not have a monopoly over Quebec. For O&#39;Toole, he had a couple of wins tonight. night uh you know consensus is still gelling so i can&#39;t say we&#39;re there in consensus just yet but seemed to have a good night at least didn&#39;t get attacked or had the sharp elbows that many thought he would get tonight at the very least and then of course he also gets the tacit but not so tacit endorsement of the most popular premier in the country in lego um so carter zooming out of tonight looking at the two front runners give me stock of the race who&#39;s uh who&#39;s doing better right now after the debate behind them with some of the the wind behind their back with some of the items i&#39;ve mentioned i may have missed a few but i think those are the major ones of the last at least 42 to 70 48 to 72 hours well</div>

You know, we talked just a couple of days. It feels like a couple of days ago we were talking about, well, in the next 12 days, we&#39;ll want them to do this.

My word&#39;s not his, but I just truncated a minute of a rant into that. Just absolutely wiped the floor with them. And by the way, I&#39;ve been very critical of how sometimes he delivers it in a phony seeming sense. He seemed sincere. He seemed seething, but in control. It was a really good moment for him. Now, if the rebel media yokels had even just gone out there and said, I&#39;ve got a legitimate question for you, if Trudeau had done the exact same thing, the rebel could have at least said, like, he just didn&#39;t want to answer the question. He&#39;s an asshole. He avoids questions. He just puts the attack back on journalists.

It was a palate cleanser after a French-language debate that wasn&#39;t great for O&#39;Toole, and his French has gotten, it&#39;s been noted by many commentators, shakier over the course This is something that happened to Dion over the course of his leadership, too, with English, right? And I can tell you, I saw it pretty close up in a lot of contexts. When people start trashing your language abilities, you lose confidence. And so much of being able to speak is confidence, right? That&#39;s where you get the fluency from. And the fluency was broken for O&#39;Toole last night. That was really clear. And by</div>
