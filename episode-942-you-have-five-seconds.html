            <span class="text">know be constrained right they all want to be constrained no one wants to be facing a request from um mothers against drunk driving right because then no one wants to say no to mothers against drunk driving but this type of committee creating a commission or or creating a debate consortium which are two different things apparently gives you the ability to say well we&#39;re doing it through this group and that group then has the responsibility of producing it. It&#39;s not unusual to this country we see the debates being produced in the United States in the same fashion. So this is the way that debates are traditionally done and it is a get out of jail free card for the parties themselves. Even locally you&#39;ll see some parties that don&#39;t want to attend forums or debates debates um you know the conservatives are are rather uh famous</span>

            <span class="text">Just the history of it. In 2015, Stephen Harper&#39;s conservatives broke with the tradition of going to these debates that had been set up by media consortium, right? And as a result, after that election, there was a commission put on leaders&#39; debates that started running these debates with almost an imprimatur of, This is the independent group that puts it together. It&#39;s got representation from different, I think, political backgrounds and chaired by somebody who is seen universally as nonpartisan, chaired by the former governor general in this case. And after the 2019 debate, there were a bunch of recommendations, most of which seem to have been terrible based on the end result that we got here. uh because while the 2019 debate was no walk in the park this was i described it on twitter as it was like the</span>

            <span class="text">and jesus they each brought in a different flavor right rosemary barton was a lot more aggressive i think maybe perhaps the point of propriety and in a debate like this um evan solomon he uh he just sort of took over the whole thing i think i saw a look on sachi curl&#39;s face that says i&#39;m gonna kick your ass after this evan um and then some of the others were just more here&#39;s my question okay you&#39;re the moderator sachi and go on it but But anyways, the whole thing was – like</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think that Carter&#39;s point is an important one because it&#39;s not so much the debate, and we&#39;ve talked about this, but it&#39;s how the debate is packaged after the debate, what those clips are that come out of it, how people react to it in general, and the narratives that come from yokels like us who say, oh, I don&#39;t know, it wasn&#39;t enough for Trudeau, and then people start questioning his momentum or things like that. I can tell you who I thought had stronger performances and who&#39;s more likely to get those narratives coming out of it, but I will also confess that I often read these things wrong because I&#39;m looking at them through an entirely different lens.

All the leaders are doing their scrum, saying what they thought about it. Was there anything from your perspective that any of the leaders could grab onto that you thought was packageable and useful for the point that they&#39;re trying to make in the next 48 to 72 hours?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So, I mean, I think that one of the the things that these things are for is if you can get one of those moments right and you and you package the moment you show your video to everybody i think that this format was so disastrous and maybe this is the point maybe this is what the parties ultimately want is a format that is so impossible to clip something from and actually make it your own right this was a gong show from the beginning uh that seemed to get worse as they got tired uh i think the last 25 30 minutes they They were exhausted, and it looked like it.

The knockout punch comes much later often, and we also will misremember the knockout punch. We will misremember the knockout punches. as uh uh you had a choice um mr turner uh that that particular line when you actually watch the videotape doesn&#39;t come across the same way as it does in the packaging or in the remembering so i</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;ll go back to the French debate in a second, Carter. I want to try to get Corey&#39;s opinion on this as well. If he saw anything from his strategist brain, I&#39;m not asking you from your what&#39;s going to resonate with the public brain, but if you were helping one of these parties, did you see, oh, damn, like that Singh response on reconciliation on indigenous issues, Or a line by Trudeau or something by Annamie Paul that you&#39;d say, I&#39;m definitely turning this into, you know, a contender for debate moment as it, to Carter&#39;s point, as the malleable nature of it kind of solidifies over the next 48 hours.</span>

She picked her points. She used silence. Like, her lines, I think, are more clippable in some ways. She didn&#39;t try to deliver her lines while people were talking over her, which I think is a mistake some of the others did, which is probably why Singh went back to his so many times. He&#39;s looking for the right bundling of it. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">I would agree. I would also say Trudeau had, in my opinion, by far the most uneven performance. His first two segments, he was so overwhelmed, right? He came out, like I said, with that haymaker against Paul. And then just everything about his voice seemed almost frantic. He looked almost a little bit sweaty at certain points, and it was in many ways contrasted to, like, by</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">by far the most crisp, immaculate suit and all of that. He just looked so put together from the neck down, and it just accentuated him looking not quite as comfortable, I think, from the neck up. And so first two segments, really, I thought he felt like he was under total assault, and he was acting like a man under total assault. He was strongest on the reconciliation section. And what Carter said really, I think, resonated with me, this notion of too many lines or too few lines. In general, I would say he really tried to overstuff his arguments. And that led to a lot of rapid speech, which I think led to that feeling of being overwhelmed that I&#39;m talking about, which you really saw in sections one, two, and five, in my opinion. But</span>

            <span class="text">So, Corey, on the O&#39;Toole front, you know what&#39;s interesting to me is I thought he would be at a strategic disadvantage. He was all the way at the end. He wasn&#39;t beside Trudeau. He wasn&#39;t really in the mix. I thought he&#39;d kind of get forgotten. And sometimes it kind of felt like he did, like he wasn&#39;t in the heat of it in the middle. I think the positioning of the podiums helped Paul in a certain way, because even in the wide shots, you could kind of see her in the mix almost every single time, especially if it was on Singh or Trudeau. But O&#39;Toole did seem to hold his own in a very different manner. He was at the end, but when they came to him, he wasn&#39;t really being attacked all that much. And what I really noticed was how he presented his arguments, which was significantly different than the way Trudeau presented his sort of platform arguments and lines.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, he really went for reasonable. He was obviously shooting for that. He was trying to shoot for not scary, prime ministerial, and he delivered a lot of lines that I think were well</span>

            <span class="text">well-constructed, better than they were clever. And again, this speaks to Carter&#39;s point about answering questions and creating a presence, right? And I think in particular about his one on childcare, and my wife will disagree vehemently, she did at the moment as we were watching the debate, but I thought his child cancer was stellar. Because in many ways, and I&#39;m a parent of kids around that age, the</span>

And that&#39;s what O&#39;Toole really did a good job of kind of underlining. In five years, some people will have cases or places. This is a plan that gives you money now to deal with your child care concerns. And it struck me as a very interesting thing in terms of just simple demographics.

That was the second section where I said that I thought Trudeau was really flailing because he was really under assault from a lot of people. But when he said, yeah, you&#39;re talking about bigger commitments, but you haven&#39;t met the commitments you had.</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s a half truth. Can we just say because the liberal plan right now, people do see as being able to hit these more ambitious targets. Not everybody, but many people do. But he&#39;s</span>

And what O&#39;Toole suggested was he was going to be the reasonable guy who&#39;s going to say what he&#39;s going to do and do what he&#39;s going to say. And it just, it&#39;s such a contrast to the image of Trudeau that the conservatives want to portray, which is one who just gives high-minded statements, but doesn&#39;t follow it up with action. And the understated nature of O&#39;Toole&#39;s performance, I think, was very much in line with those images they&#39;re trying to present, not just of O&#39;Toole, but also of the prime minister in contrast.

            <span class="text">You know, what he also had help with in making that argument was Jagmeet Singh, who represented that same argument that, you know, these are my words, but you&#39;re the victory lap prime minister. You take the victory lap before even winning the race or sometimes even running the race. And you saw some heated exchanges between Singh and Trudeau. And Carter, that&#39;s what I want to get to you with you is one of the things we brought up constantly throughout our election episodes is what we expect is going to happen with the red-orange switchers. Did tonight Can I change anything for you? Because one of the arguments that Trudeau brought up was the cynicism of progressives regarding, you know, his leadership, used reconciliation as one of them, the proof points of that, that like it&#39;s harmful and damaging and cynical to say we haven&#39;t done anything in that sense.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that what we saw with Singh is that he was the great hitter of the tree to shake off some of the leaves, right? And he was just trying to smack the tree as hard as he could to shake the leaves off the tree with the expectation that they would fall into his pile, right? And he was going to be able to gather more votes as a result. And I had to wonder if some of the attacks weren&#39;t effective. You know, they were effective for sure. but did they actually land the the leaves in the in the in the ndp pile or did they go over you know could they conceivably go to the old tool pile and this comes back to um how he was being used he was the pit bull and the attack dog now this is something that we&#39;re yet that we&#39;re relatively used to we&#39;ve we&#39;ve commented on the podcast how we didn&#39;t understand how the liberals were using freeland as an attack dog right because uh we felt that she was ill ill</span>

So if you&#39;re not going to ever be thought of as a government, then don&#39;t behave like you&#39;re going to be government because this is what happens you become cast as the pit bull right and maybe if he was just the pit bull then we were expecting him to be the pit bull it would be better uh but it wasn&#39;t particularly good tonight even though his performance was super strong cory</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, this was just my impression. Perhaps it&#39;s entirely wrong and somebody can sabermetrics me on it. But I really got the sense that Singh went after the prime minister two, three times as much as he ever went after O&#39;Toole. And in fact, he was often the hype man for O&#39;Toole&#39;s arguments to the point about thinking, yeah, you don&#39;t get it done. That&#39;s a great point. Yeah, you are a do-nothing prime minister. And so it feels a bit like Singh&#39;s taking a moonshot here. What he&#39;s trying to do is get ahead of the liberals and replace the liberals, supplant them, get all of that progressive vote, much like we saw in 2011. That&#39;s quite a swing. And whether it works or not, TBD. But it also meant that he wasn&#39;t trying to make O&#39;Toole seem even scarier. So the strategy may have worked in two different ways. I have to say, and I really felt it today, Singh has, and I&#39;ve thought this ever since the first time I ever met Jagmeet Singh, before he even was running for the leader, he has about 20% more bro energy than I can handle.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s zoom out. Last couple of days, let&#39;s talk about some of the wins each of the two frontrunners have had. You talked about the rebel media, smackdown, takedown, whatever. I&#39;m sure many folks have heard it already in the scrum yesterday after French debate. You had that plus what seemed to be the line of the night for Trudeau yesterday in the French debate where he told Blanchet that he does not have a monopoly over Quebec. For O&#39;Toole, he had a couple of wins tonight. night uh you know consensus is still gelling so i can&#39;t say we&#39;re there in consensus just yet but seemed to have a good night at least didn&#39;t get attacked or had the sharp elbows that many thought he would get tonight at the very least and then of course he also gets the tacit but not so tacit endorsement of the most popular premier in the country in lego um so carter zooming out of tonight looking at the two front runners give me stock of the race who&#39;s uh who&#39;s doing better right now after the debate behind them with some of the the wind behind their back with some of the items i&#39;ve mentioned i may have missed a few but i think those are the major ones of the last at least 42 to 70 48 to 72 hours well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i mean i think that there&#39;s no question that uh o&#39;toole is in a much better spot than trudeau um in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">fact i was thinking about this today you know you&#39;re watching we&#39;re watching the ppc growth and it&#39;s you know whether it&#39;s seven points or 11 points it&#39;s really irrelevant it&#39;s not two it&#39;s not within the margin of error of zero um that&#39;s a significant shift and imagine where o&#39;toole would be if bernier wasn&#39;t taking eight</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">eight percent right if if if if o&#39;toole had been able to hold on to um the far right in the same fashion that he&#39;s held on to the center of the uh of uh the canadian electorate and this would be a very big shift shift um so you know as much as the left loves to talk about vote split costing them um it you know true oh tools inability to hold on to the far right wing uh may cost him quite a bit because had he been able to hold the right and the center of the conservative movement together he would be unstoppable against trudeau right now um he hasn&#39;t been able to uh because it looks like if you move to the center you know in today&#39;s environment moving to the center does cost you the right because it&#39;s very polarized and very, very fraught with things like the anti-vax movement and things like that and Trump-isms.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But basically, I think that O&#39;Toole is probably in a much stronger spot. And I think the other thing is that they&#39;re running on a runway, right? Yeah. You know, we talked just a couple of days. It feels like a couple of days ago we were talking about, well, in the next 12 days, we&#39;ll want them to do this. And then the 12 days after that, we&#39;ll want them to do that. and you&#39;re down to 10 you don&#39;t have you have a play left you have a play left so you better make sure that it works because um after you call the play after the debate that&#39;s it so the the meeting that&#39;s happening right now in liberal hq better be a fucking good one cory</span>

The blast zone on that seems significant for O&#39;Toole&#39;s gains in Quebec. Where do you kind of stack the leaders up based on what you&#39;ve seen over the last 48 hours and some of their big and small wins that they&#39;ve had?</span>

            <span class="text">I do wonder, though, Zane, if that didn&#39;t in some ways antagonize the premier of Quebec and maybe make the statement today a little more forceful. Because like, oh, no, you don&#39;t speak for Quebec, Justin Trudeau. I speak for Quebec. And it&#39;s the kind of thing that petty people get petty about. And I could easily see, even if it was always planned that he would make a statement a bit like this, that the statement may have been a bit more forceful as a result of Justin Trudeau&#39;s caping for Quebec and the idea that he too can champion Quebec values.</span>

But you&#39;re a bunch of garbage. I don&#39;t even want to call you journalists. You own a lot of the discord in this country right now. My word&#39;s not his, but I just truncated a minute of a rant into that. Just absolutely wiped the floor with them. And by the way, I&#39;ve been very critical of how sometimes he delivers it in a phony seeming sense. He seemed sincere. He seemed seething, but in control. It was a really good moment for him. Now, if the rebel media yokels had even just gone out there and said, I&#39;ve got a legitimate question for you, if Trudeau had done the exact same thing, the rebel could have at least said, like, he just didn&#39;t want to answer the question. He&#39;s an asshole. He avoids questions. He just puts the attack back on journalists. But by not even going to the trouble of asking something substantive, they set themselves up to be the biggest wrestling heels of all time. And they got thrown to the fucking mat for it.

But Carter, I need to ask you guys this from a strategist perspective as we close this out. Right. We&#39;re going to record again on Sunday. The world will change certainly by then, because by Sunday we&#39;ll be, what, at that point, I guess, by that night, seven days away, right? And like advanced voting will be. So give me the strategy perspective, Carter. You said it has to be a fucking kick-ass meeting tonight in Liberal HQ. Let&#39;s start teasing out that a bit more. What does that meeting need to include from what you&#39;ve seen? You can&#39;t use the data of how tonight landed. You&#39;ve got to feel, but you don&#39;t really have a read. But you&#39;ve got to make some decisions if you have a read in campaigns. That&#39;s how it works. works what are some of the the items that are on the agenda for tonight uh in in liberal hq cory i&#39;ll tell you up there on after in conservative hq for the same conversation but carter get us started what does that kick-ass meeting tonight need to look like what</span>

It was a palate cleanser after a French-language debate that wasn&#39;t great for O&#39;Toole, and his French has gotten, it&#39;s been noted by many commentators, shakier over the course This is something that happened to Dion over the course of his leadership, too, with English, right? And I can tell you, I saw it pretty close up in a lot of contexts. When people start trashing your language abilities, you lose confidence. And so much of being able to speak is confidence, right? That&#39;s where you get the fluency from. And the fluency was broken for O&#39;Toole last night. That was really clear. And by</span>

He was against the ropes on those things. He was risking his seats in Quebec. And I don&#39;t think those seats that he was in play with are at risk, after the Legault comments.</span>

Ultimately, this was O&#39;Toole&#39;s night, not because it was the most sparkling performance, but because it wasn&#39;t the performance Justin Trudeau needed. O&#39;Toole was already leading in most of the polls, and the people who were most likely to siphon votes from Justin Trudeau did very well. No.</span>
