          <p>After the annual audit of web domains owned by The Strategists Media Corporation, the gang turns to a UCP convention that seemingly gives lots of fodder to opponents of the government and a federal Liberal Party that looks increasingly ready to turn the page on their current leader.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Alberta UCP convention before turning attention to the growing conversation that it's time for Justin Trudeau to step down as Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. Is Take Back Alberta Danielle Smith's biggest strength or biggest problem? Is there a path forward for Justin Trudeau that doesn't involve a walk in the snow? And why has Corey declared war on people who wear political t-shirts, a group that could be charitably described as 95% of our listening audience? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

They&#39;ve got all the powers of the caucus. And so because they control those two things, they&#39;re much more powerful than the board. And that used to be the case.</div>

And the difference now is who controls when the leadership review happens? Who controls what the leadership review looks like? Who controls who has all of the delegates that they&#39;re pumping in? I mean, when we did the leadership review to keep Redford, it was a tremendous amount of work and we weren&#39;t faced with this level of organized opposition. This level of organized opposition is basically unheard of. Most of the time it is flushed out of the party and they go and they form something like the Wild Rose or the Alberta Party before that. Or, I mean, Randy Thurkelstein has been involved in, I think, two or three different parties being set up. It&#39;s really quite amazing that they have taken over the government party.

            <div class="said">I think that it&#39;s really tough to say it&#39;s one or the other neatly. They have got a symbiotic relationship going on. Obviously, Danielle Smith was a very essential part of Take Back Alberta&#39;s early victory. Danielle Smith herself was actively saying she would run against Jason Kenney, became one of the people who was immediately somebody in the conversation, I think far more than we appreciated at the time, to be sure. Like, you can run the tape on that. And we&#39;re like, oh, that doesn&#39;t seem like that&#39;s going to go anywhere. We were wrong. And she was an open, active individual challenging Jason Kenney and his positions in these areas. And so in some ways became the front of house for a lot of these same ideas. Obviously, a lot of that Take Back Alberta energy is what was required to get Daniel Smith over the top. We&#39;ve already talked about the fact that it wasn&#39;t a very convincing win. It took many ballots. And if Take Back Alberta hadn&#39;t been involved, she would not be premier. year so there is a reality that&#39;s there too but i think that as both of these organizations started to feel themselves i mean daniel smith&#39;s organization and take back alberta tensions were going to be natural because</div>

            <div class="said">it&#39;s not about the specifics. Step back and see the whole picture. The individual policies, talking about whether they&#39;re good or bad, they&#39;re basically all bad. They&#39;re irrelevant. What you need to keep focused on is not the specifics. We can&#39;t sit here and argue about the merits of a policy of a 15-minute city or not. That&#39;s what I mean. What I&#39;m saying is you&#39;ve got to see the whole fucking picture here. This is a party that has been entirely consumed, to your earlier point, Stephen, by this particular strand of conservatism. Carter,</div>

            <div class="said">Carter, address the policies, and in fact, address my follow-up question I was going to give both of you, which is, and I&#39;m glad you put the policies on the table, Corey, because it actually allows a few options for this particular question, which is, how should the opposition react and what should they go after? after. Policies, individually or as a package, seem interesting. The board, you&#39;ve got Danielle Smith&#39;s leadership and the phraseology and even her speech, which we haven&#39;t even gotten to, but it was largely rehashed from the throne speech, if I can kind of give it that from both the content and tonal perspective. So Carter, your thoughts on Corey&#39;s response, but then get me started on strategy for the opposition here as well, please.</div>

            <div class="said">Well, I think you want to really quickly figure out what your total narrative is like what is it you want to do like one of the things you see the the opposition doing is is bouncing back and forth between individual policies all the time right one thing one thing one thing one thing and always you you never really get to see the full connection what is it that we&#39;re trying what is the story that we&#39;re trying to tell and the story that we should be trying to tell is this is a party that&#39;s been taken over by extremists and these extremists are driving the province the wrong direction and we&#39;re going to stand up and oppose it not on each individual level you know if we go with cory&#39;s point of view and and he&#39;s not wrong he&#39;s just really poor at explaining it um if you go with cory&#39;s point of view what you what you need to do is you need to explain um how each individual part idea is is coming from extremists the only thing that i think i liked out of the entire weekend was danielle smith saying that uh she She wants to see rail between Calgary and Edmonton. You know, fantastic. We got one smart idea. Everything else should be tied to the extremists that are coming after the province. The extremists who want to create a province that we don&#39;t want to live in. Corey,</div>

Should they just keep that going? It seems like that seems to be, you know, to Carter&#39;s point, something that they&#39;re being consistent on, extending beyond perhaps just a simple news cycle? Or is there meat on the bone here, so to speak, coming out of the convention that should be part of their focus and their narrative in the coming weeks and months?</div>

So that&#39;s always kind of like the next big domino to fall. Like a staff shakeup, I 100% predict at this point, if he&#39;s not just going to resign in the next two months. If he&#39;s looking to hold on, I expect a kind of a more significant staff shakeup to occur. And yeah, and then there are no more levers to pull. You have shuffled your cabinet, you&#39;ve changed your team. I&#39;m predicting this happens at this point. And then what? What do you have? You have only yourself. So this is the trajectory that takes us to a leader taking a, as we say in Canada, walk in the snow, deciding no longer to be leader in the next couple of months here.

The who question, they&#39;re happy to figure that out. Like, they&#39;re happy to kind of be like, fuck it, we don&#39;t care. It just can&#39;t be this guy. versus the big hang-up, perhaps in the summer and even earlier on, where there was initial rumblings of Trudeau&#39;s weakness was that, well, he&#39;s better than anyone else that could potentially replace him.

            <div class="said">I mean, that statement&#39;s just patently false at this stage. I mean, there are very few people who could do worse than Trudeau at this stage because he&#39;s in such a negative situation. situation. He has watched the party. He has led the party as it has gone into a free fall in the polls. And there&#39;s a time that you can say, well, the polls aren&#39;t everything, right? There&#39;s the polls shift, polls change, polls move. All of these things are true. Polls do do all of those things. But when you&#39;ve got a picture over time that is telling this consistent story, the polls aren&#39;t going to get you out of this. You need a significant shift to get out and the significant shift at this point is the prime minister&#39;s head that&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s that&#39;s available to them uh again you know you try and figure out what could you do well what are the what are the other options all you know we could do a cabinet shuffle we just did a cabinet shuffle we could we could get rid of some staff yeah you can get rid of some staff but who&#39;s left to get rid of who&#39;s who&#39;s the person high enough on the uh on the list that actually is in a position to you know in some fashion signal that the the the thing&#39;s going to turn around we you know our last episode was called the d team um by</div>

I want to focus on what the goal should be. So, let&#39;s just say it&#39;s either him leaving or not leaving. I actually kind of don&#39;t care at this point. He must acknowledge that the walls seem to be coming in on him, that the options become more narrow. So, what are you trying to save, right? If the proverbial sort of like ousting is happening, is it about legacies, about final points of policies, about protecting your people? What should his strategic focus and goal be in this case with the fact that, you know, this is the current scenario because there&#39;s many things that one can focus and there&#39;s many distractions um what do you spend your last ounces of political capital on is perhaps a different way to ask it that&#39;s</div>

So if his concern is legacy, well, then last week was about the dumbest thing i&#39;ve ever seen right because he&#39;s blowing up one of his core pieces of policy if the next person the next man or woman did it that would have way less damage to his legacy than him doing it right now uh if his goal is to hang on well</div>

Justin Trudeau in Washington, D.C. when asked about what Canada should be doing with the current situation in Israel and in Palestine, says, you know, we need to cease. And then, of course, pauses. We need to see a humanitarian corridor and exit. He kind of has this Freudian slip. Yes or no? Should we be reading into that more and around his true intentions and what he may want? Or are you just giving him a pass on this particular one?</div>
