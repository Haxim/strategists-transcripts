            <span class="text">well i mean fuck it&#39;s not a segment because what do you want to say about it It&#39;s just insane. It&#39;s just in the category of Donald Trump passing what seems like a grade two&#39;s IQ test.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, Wallace seems to have have struck on a formula that I hope other people remember and take, which is just in the moment being so prepared you can challenge him on the spot. He doesn&#39;t know what to do. No, no. And</span>

            <span class="text">And clearly no one has done this in press conferences. No one has done this on one on ones. even his whole segment with the uh with the biden and sanders combination plan to defund and abolish the police trump asked for an aid to get the the entire printout and of course it&#39;s nowhere to be found it&#39;s just boggling well</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i was the either he&#39;s just grossly uninformed about the contents of that or it was the mother of all bluffs that just just did not work like he was hoping wallace to be like no no no no okay we can move on never happened never happened his</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">his his whole Oh, modus operandi is a series of bluffs that he just blusters his way through and no one ever calls him on it. And I think that this is one of the first interviews where we&#39;ve actually seen an interviewer who was prepared and was prepared to call him on his shit. You know, instead, you know, every press conference, he&#39;s able to just kind of sneak through it because he moves on to the next question, which he he lies about. And then he moves to the next question. He lies about it. It&#39;s like watching a toddler. It&#39;s just embarrassing. Speaking</span>

            <span class="text">of another presidential candidate who is getting called out on his shit, Kanye West saying that Harriet Tubman did not free the slaves earlier this evening, which, by the way, is fucking insane. Just everything about this Kanye, can we call it a rally? Because he&#39;s out there in a security vest that says security on it, which I think is hilarious in its own right. And then he&#39;s just walking around just like, you know, night at the Comedy Cellar testing out some of his revisionist history material. Just real weird shit.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a lot that&#39;s happened in this past week, when we last left, we were talking about the We Media strategy, the Trudeau liberal strategy. And on the heels of us recording that podcast last Sunday, Justin Trudeau went out on Monday with the I&#39;m sorry, apology tour. Let&#39;s start there. What did you make of that as the Justin Trudeau, I&#39;m so sorry, I should have known apology tour that began on Monday, and then I want to get into We in a second. So Corey, over to you.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it tells you that he didn&#39;t have an awful lot of moves left for starters and that this i i&#39;m sorry is a look</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">look maybe maybe he&#39;s sorry maybe</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe maybe it&#39;s as simple as that maybe he&#39;s screwed up and he&#39;s sorry but um it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it it also tells you that um that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that it was probably going to get worse if he didn&#39;t cut right now and just do a bit of a mea culpa the um the other shoes to drop were probably related to the testimony that that was coming. Fascinating testimony over the past week.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know, like the I&#39;m a bad widdle boy defense, it doesn&#39;t actually work in a court of law. So I&#39;ll be curious to see how this plays into the ethics commissioner&#39;s review of this. But clearly, he just decided, I&#39;m just gonna have to take my hits on this one.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">And Corey, do you think it&#39;s an admission of guilt and ultimately, knowing that the ethics report is going to come back in a scathing manner for him?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s obviously an admission of guilt. It&#39;s, I&#39;m sorry I did something wrong.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s probably not going to be a great ethics report, especially given that he has conceded this point. So the best he can do is say, yeah, I already acknowledged I was wrong on this. It&#39;s time to move on. Again, that doesn&#39;t really work with the rest of the world. You break the law. You don&#39;t just get to say, my bad, guys, and move on. So I&#39;ll be curious to see how this plays out from here. Carter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, what is your first take on that Trudeau apology tour that lasted on Monday?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it fits into the framework that I was talking about with trying to get this all done in the summer when people just don&#39;t seem to be paying attention and don&#39;t seem to care. You know, it is a it&#39;s an admission of guilt, to be sure. The ethics commissioner is going to come back and find that this was not proper. I would be willing to put a significant amount of money on. um but at the end of the day i mean the money didn&#39;t go out the door there you know there well some of the money went out the door but for the most part they pulled it back as quick as they could they&#39;ve been they ignored our usual double down strategy um and began the apology tour early tour early this was just one of the uh the final steps of the apology tour they want this over with quickly um that&#39;s a good strategy i think getting it over with quickly is probably your best call So, you know, an apology on a Monday, and hopefully you take a beating for a week or two. And then people forget what happens. Because as Trump has shown us, people tend to forget what happens.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what do you think of Morneau in addition, going on his own apology tour and now him having a potential ethics investigation into his behavior as well?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s more of the same, right? And Morneau and Trudeau are the ones that seem to be in the most jeopardy. But what you&#39;re finding is that other ministers are also apologizing for their role, even if their role is not particularly apology worthy, I think. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know if that is intentional strategy or not. If it is, it&#39;s quite interesting. It basically is the I Am Spartacus approach to the We Charity, right? No, I did this, you know, we were all bad on this. Look, we all did these different things. And maybe just trying to make it look like volunteering</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">volunteering on behalf of the charity is the same as directing money to them, knowing that your mother is getting stipend from them. Those are not the same thing. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but the but the liberals seem to be treating all of this is the same thing. And I think it is consistent with a strategy of just diminishing and saying this is this is a misdemeanor at worse. And it is the equivalent of just being friendly with these people. And so we&#39;re all going to apologize for it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;ve seen quite a few developments this week, and I want to get to them. Corey, you talked about the testimony with the Finance Committee, the Ethics Committee also looking at trying to create their own investigation into this. But before I get into that, let&#39;s talk about we, because we also talked about them last week in terms of what their strategy should be. And like Clockwork, they came out on Monday with an entire Globe and Mail advertorial where they talked about their situation, how they&#39;re perhaps complicit in it, what what this meant for them, the internal reflection. What did you make of both the message but also the tactic of going to a full-page advertorial in the Globe and Mail? Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on this.</span>

            <span class="text">I hate the tactic. If you recall, we were saying put your head down, let the political people try and figure this out and reemphasize your good works by actually doing the good works. again this is a show don&#39;t tell type of model but they they try to talk about all the good things that they&#39;re doing um that doesn&#39;t really matter right and and how you&#39;re going to change isn&#39;t changing so i think that they were going to be given a relatively i mean they&#39;re going to be suffering on their donor base um but that suffering doesn&#39;t go away because they published a full page ad in the globe mail and on top of that who are you targeting with a full page ad in the globe mail mail. When was that a good strategy? I&#39;ve been in politics since 1997. I think that was a good strategy for the first four years of it. It&#39;s not a good strategy anymore. I don&#39;t understand what they were trying to achieve and what they hoped would be the outcome of it because it certainly wasn&#39;t going to be an immediate outcome. It was at the very best a first step towards something vaguely getting better for them. It&#39;s not going to get better. They&#39;ve wasted a bunch of money on an ad that&#39;s not going to do anything and they still need to put in place the the second half which of the the plan</span>

I&#39;m going to ask you a triple barrel question, because I also want you to react to what Carter said, which is, in what&#39;s happened subsequently post-letter, do you feel like they&#39;ve inflicted and opened the door to the conversation of their finances, their over-leverage on real estate, etc.? So triple barrel question, but start with whichever piece you kind of feel appropriate.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, what would you say right now? Because we did this last week, right? Help them stop the bleeding last week. The bleeding seems to be worse this week, especially for them as an organization, as it was revealed, you know, their over leverage on real estate, how much money they would make on this $900 million contract, which, by the way, was $44 million. So not an insignificant amount. You know, some old history about past libel issues coming up as well. Well, if you&#39;re trying to help them stop the bleeding going forward, what are some of the basic principles this week that you&#39;re implementing?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m not going to change really my advice from last week. Go to the base of what it is that you do, right? So if you&#39;re a health organization, you go back to talking about how you&#39;re helping people stay healthier. You&#39;re doing health-related work. If you&#39;re an education organization, you go back to the students. If you are the Kielburgers, you go back to youth and making sure that you are showing and telling the story of youth and how you&#39;re making a difference through whatever your programs are, mentorship or work experience or whatever they may be, how you&#39;re actually making a difference in people&#39;s lives, because that&#39;s what charity is about, making a difference in people&#39;s lives. And all too often, we&#39;re not actually showing people how we make a difference when we&#39;re a charity because we become all about the charity, the donations, the money, the boards. that doesn&#39;t matter at all none of that really matters what matters is are you helping people and that&#39;s where kielburgers when they got their start you know they</span>

            <span class="text">you know that if you&#39;re firing the brothers you&#39;re missing out your uh the brothers of the brand right like the brothers formed this thing they&#39;ve made this thing I mean, it&#39;s really staggering what they&#39;ve made. It is a big thing.</span>

We didn&#39;t start a charity to keep you guys making money or living the high life. They didn&#39;t do it that way. They started to help people. So put them on a plane, send them to somewhere, get the pictures, do all the things that they did at the beginning. They got people excited about the work that they were doing because at the beginning, it was about the work. And if it can&#39;t be about the work anymore, then they should resign. So</span>

Carter has shown heart and soul with his last response. uh i thought he would he would give them the proverbial guillotine he has not um so on that front what would your advice to them be this week right they&#39;ve run this ad the bleeding continues more stories are coming out seems like jesse brown and canada land are not stopping with their uh you know with their trip campaign against uh against we what are you advising them this week well</span>

            <span class="text">that over leveraged on real real estate, the covenant stuff. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a big deal. Covenants are only a big deal if the banks think they&#39;re a big deal. They get written in. There&#39;s a lot of reasons why companies can be in violation of their covenants. COVID right now, I guarantee you, half of the major companies on Bay Street are violating bank covenants in one way, shape, or form.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But some people will think it&#39;s a big deal. And those people will make decisions about contributions. Some people will make decisions on contributions based on the interactions with the federal government some people will make contributions based on or not contributions i guess i should say based on the rumors about we being involved in you know extrajudicial killings i mean that was the most extreme one that we saw out of africa and i guess my point is this there&#39;s a lot of reasons why you might stop and not donate to we right now and um that does not help by you bringing the spotlight on you more like you can do no right at a moment like this and it might be time to go to the mattresses and uh part of that is getting back to your core mission carter is absolutely right uh the the stuff that the kielbergers did originally this idea of stopping child labor and helping african communities out of poverty and uh helping build communities that are self-sustaining even after the charity has left you know their five pillar approach that&#39;s all good stuff right uh me to we we day these were always kind of odd extensions and i think they&#39;re the extensions of restless executives and what they need to do is exactly what steven said which is do you actually want to be in this business stop trying to find ways to be in other businesses that sort of look like the charity business because those things are getting you into a lot of trouble and you need to stop okay</span>

            <span class="text">okay i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna leave that there on the weave front let&#39;s go back to the political parties for a second and let&#39;s talk about the conservatives Because the highlight of this week was Pierre Polierev and Charlie Angus and others of the NDP on the Finance Committee grilling Minister Bartosz Czajger about this particular contract that was revealed, as I&#39;d mentioned earlier, that we stood to receive close to $44 million, which was double the $20 million mark that the government had initially said that we was going to receive.

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">weather this storm of the Finance Committee. But they also did something else, which was they filibustered on the other committee, on the Ethics Committee, so as to delay that particular committee and their investigation. So what do you kind of make of the current sort of dance that the conservatives and liberals are doing on the committee level, back and forth? I just want to get your thoughts and see where you you think uh they&#39;re making the right or the wrong moves well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well it&#39;s tough to know without knowing exactly what was happening behind the scenes but if the liberals believe that more information will ultimately help them look a little bit more innocent then delaying the ethics committee makes sense right you you another week there&#39;s a bit more detail that detail is helpful to you um if your strategy is a rip the band-aid off strategy though why delay it why why delay this ass kicking doesn&#39;t it seem like</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, no, it does. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. It seems unusual, but maybe they think that there&#39;s more to come out. Maybe they think the sequencing of these committees will be helpful. You talked about Bardish-Chagger, and that&#39;s a minister that I think doesn&#39;t really have a ministry, at least not a department in the strong sense. And so I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s really where you&#39;re going to find the real, real answers, but you&#39;re right. Right. Like, actually, I will say that as the testimony came out, I sort of, as a recovering bureaucrat, said to myself, I guess that&#39;s possible. Like, it wasn&#39;t the most outrageous story that was woven by the government as to how this contract could be created and how people could think we was the right people to do it. By the way, that $44 million, that was on like $200 out the door because it&#39;s not like the original contract was apparently for $100 million. So those are some pretty rich ratios there. um it</span>

Charlie Angus may be the worst of the NDP, but he doesn&#39;t quite come close to Pierre and his theatrics of outrage. So I think that that puts people off and people don&#39;t hear what&#39;s being said as much because it&#39;s just it strikes us of the same old, same old. And this is some of what we were talking about, I think, two or three weeks ago, where we were talking about standing up and crawling everything, a crisis and everything is a, you know, the worst thing that&#39;s ever happened.</span>

I actually think the more they let the liberals explain this, the more confused I get about the matter. And, and if other people feel the same, if media feels the same, then the conservatives didn&#39;t do themselves any favors last week. So I do think that what happens right now is it&#39;s got to be less about giving the liberals a platform to tell their story. If you&#39;re the conservatives, it&#39;s got to be more about, okay, let&#39;s make sure that the ethics commissioner has that&#39;s what they need. Let&#39;s make sure this seems very serious.

So if you are someone like, let&#39;s say, oh, I don&#39;t know, Christopher Freeland right now, who may have future ambitions within the Liberal Party. You, of course, have to play team ball right now, stick with Justin Trudeau. But how are you kind of observing this scandal? If you&#39;re advising her right now, if you&#39;re strategizing for her future run to be leader of the Liberal Party, how are you advising her to kind of play her cards right now? Is it strictly, hey, just go with the team, that&#39;s all that you can do right now? Or are you telling her to hold some back, maybe maneuver in certain ways? I&#39;m kind of curious to hear your advice if I&#39;ve got got future ambitions within this party?</span>

Everybody who&#39;s ever come after the king gets decapitated. There&#39;s a reason Jim Dinning never became the premier of Alberta. He was the guy who was maneuvering against Ralph Klein. You can&#39;t be seen to be maneuvering. Gary Marr was maneuvering against Ed Stelmack, didn&#39;t become premier of Alberta. If you want to become the next king, you can&#39;t be caught. So what you need to be doing is spending time with the caucus. You got to be everybody&#39;s friend. You&#39;ve got to make sure that you&#39;re on the team.</span>

And you and I will still be here long past when he&#39;s gone. That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to be doing.

            <span class="text">Carter, thank you for redeeming yourself, getting your Machiavellian teeth back at the end of that. Thank you so much. I feel like we&#39;re much more normalized. Heading into our next segment, our next segment, getting your way. Guys, I want to talk about advocacy campaigns. You know, we touched upon this during the Black Lives Matter movement. But I want to do a little bit of a not a deep dive, but a little bit of an introspection as to where we sit with the state of advocacy advocacy organizations. And using it to jump off is a campaign here in Alberta, our home province, of course, by the Alberta Federation of Labor, which is a union. And they&#39;re putting together this campaign called Defend Workers&#39; Rights. I think it just launched recently, if not today, if I&#39;m not wrong. And the campaign is an outright attack on Jason Kenney, saying Jason Kenney is tipping the scales against workers. He&#39;s wanting to protect himself and his rich donors, give them them more power. And it&#39;s really, you know, then a pretty standard suite of tools that visitors can engage in. So before we get into the tools of advocacy, which I also want to discuss, talk to me about this current message. Let&#39;s talk about the specifics of this campaign. And maybe give us some context, Carter, as to why the unions might be upset, and then what you make of the effectiveness of this message that you&#39;re hearing from the AFL.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Why are the unions upset? Well, because the Kenney government is absolutely targeting unions. they&#39;ve decided that unions are going to be the enemy and they are going to go after them they&#39;re going after them in terms of what they can say politically they&#39;re going after them about where they can say it they&#39;re going after them about how much money they can get from their members and how they can spend the money that they do get from their members it is maybe not an all-out attack we didn&#39;t become a right-to-work province so there is one more step that certainly could have been taken but the kenny government has decided to make an enemy of unions and now the unions are responding in kind by making jason kenny the enemy of all unions um which is interesting because you know the the sided</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">sided battle seems to be won by jason kenny like you have to ask yourself how do you wish to move the government you know a government that has a majority a state a strong stable stable majority isn&#39;t going anywhere and uh the strong stable majority that comes from you know the the phrasing that comes with the steven harper era yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they use that with intent uh that was to tell their adversaries we are here you cannot take us out um and jason kenney is there he cannot be taken out i mean john john horgan has a minority government next door in british Columbia, he could be taken out by a confidence vote. He&#39;s not going to be taken out by a confidence vote, but it could actually happen. Jason Kenney is, for all intents and purposes, a dictator for four years, and he&#39;s one year in, and so taking him on, making him the enemy, you have to have a pretty good strategy on how you&#39;re actually going to succeed, because right now, it looks like the battle could just be three years of yelling.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what do you make of this message? Before we get into the tactics, what do you make of the message that the AFL is proposing against the Kenney government?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, if I&#39;m remembering what the message is, it&#39;s essentially that, hey, you&#39;ve got to defend your workers&#39; rights. They&#39;re trying to move rights to your bosses. I think it&#39;s really tough for me to determine whether the message is right or the tactics are right until I really understand what the objectives of the campaign are. If it&#39;s a broadcast campaign, I&#39;ve got some doubts. right? I do worry about its ability to resonate with Albertans writ large, if it is a campaign that is designed to get your union enthusiasts mobilized, well, then maybe it&#39;s exactly where it needs to be. Certainly, the campaign uses language that you find in the labor movement, less or more than you would find in in the way people talk about these things more generally. But, but,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And I guess this would be a caution, I would say, and applying the principle of charity more generally, you never really know what people are trying to do with campaigns like this and who they&#39;re trying to mobilize. And they had a hashtag defend worker rights. And they tried to get people to tweet on it. And it&#39;s a couple hundred people, there&#39;s not a lot of engagement on it. But I suspect if you went through those people, they would be, they</span>

            <span class="text">and this is where i wanted to go to run goals because cory you&#39;ve We&#39;ve hit exactly where my next line of questioning is, which is, Carter, tease out in a campaign, in an advocacy campaign structure, what some of the goals could be. Corey mentioned a few, right? We talked about mobilizing and engaging your base. This is not about convincing government. It&#39;s just about getting your base active. You know you can&#39;t change shit, so why not just get them active? All the way to the other side of the spectrum, which I think is more like, hey, let&#39;s actually get something done. Let&#39;s change policy. So can you perhaps kind of give us the overview as to where, you know, the advocacy goals are and what you kind of see advocacy goals as being?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think we can use Black Lives Matter as a really good example of a movement or an advocacy group, perhaps it&#39;s a part of it&#39;s really well formed part of it&#39;s not, that&#39;s just really grassrootsy. That&#39;s actually trying to change the world. They want legislation to be brought in, they will change certain elements of today&#39;s society. And they will measure success and failure by whether or not they were able to get those pieces of legislation or the changes in tactics or the changes in society to actually occur. And they will be measuring that on a timeline that is relatively human, right? We would expect to see change in months or, worst case scenario, years, but a small number of years, right? You&#39;re going to actually make the change happen. We&#39;ve seen it happen before with LGBTQ issues. And in fact, when you look back at the marriage equality work that was done, it started relatively slow. But the measurement was state by state are gays and lesbians getting the right to marry in those states. And you could see them falling one by one. And once they started to get that momentum, then it was unstoppable. And the change was actually happening. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And so the other type of campaigns, and I put the AFL campaign into this, is this desire just to get people angry, just to get them angry, knowing that you&#39;re not going to actually have any real impact.</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. I mean, the last time this happened in Alberta. So Ralph Klein makes significant cuts and changes to in 1994 to people&#39;s salaries. And we lose five percent of nurses salaries and doctors salaries and teachers salaries and everybody loses five percent.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That all went through. The outrage was still there. People were angry, but no one was blinking. And Ralph Klein himself said, I&#39;m not going to blink. You know, he&#39;s not he wasn&#39;t walking away from those changes. It wasn&#39;t until we got to I think it was Bill 13 that was a, you know, an attack on health care or increased privatization on health care where general population saw that their lives were going to change, that they were actually able to move on it and stop that bill from being passed. When it was just the union movement, when it was just unions, it wasn&#39;t successful. When it became about everyone, it became successful. And this is where the objectives model looks at, right? Like if it&#39;s always about if it was just always about a small segment of society, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be successful. And arguably, the first Black Lives Matter, certainly no less important than today&#39;s Black Lives Matter, both of them equally important with the exact same type of messaging. This one&#39;s being far more successful because it is about all of us. Each one of us has to recognize the challenges in our society of racism. And when it</span>

They&#39;re just going to rattle their sabers, they&#39;re going to be loud, and they&#39;re going to piss away a bunch of money.</span>

But before we go there, can you perhaps, you know, talk to our listeners about what you see as the value of a advocacy campaign that may not necessarily have a pathway towards policy or legislative change, but its main purpose is riling up their members? Can you talk to us about where you kind of see some of that value coming in and what sub-goals there might be in a situation like that?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think foundationally, if you&#39;re an advocacy group, you are trying to change something. And it&#39;s really about time horizon. And perhaps what you need to do as a first step or an intermediate step is to mobilize your core supporters, arm your core supporters, train your core supporters. Get them finding a bigger universe that they can then go out and make your secondary level of supporters to allow you to down the road make the change that you want to make. And so that would be the main reason that you might want to do something like that. And perhaps it&#39;s as simple as changing the conversation or moving the weight of it. You know, the Overton window people talk about further</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think fundamentally, it&#39;s either about equipping yourself to take the next step or changing the conversation overall so that that next step will happen more organically. Somebody else will pick it up. The overall frame of reference has changed. Those are the two reasons you would do something now knowing that you cannot exact change now. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s talk about this model campaign for advocacy in the time we find ourselves in. And I want to start with the tactics. So let&#39;s reference back to this AFL campaign. They&#39;ve got some very specific suite of tactics. They&#39;ve got signing a petition, emailing your MLA, calling your MLA, tweeting your MLA. As the former chief of staff who met with only one advocacy group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, during your entire time, this question is not suited for you. But let&#39;s say you had more than one meeting while you were chief of staff. Do these tactics work, Stephen? Do these tactics of sending letters, sending tweets, phone calling, you know, they&#39;re advertised and promoted as the lever to getting change. But do they actually work from the decision-making capacity that you&#39;ve seen them in?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think we were proposing to log some area in Bragg Creek. and we were getting 3000 form emails a day at the peak of it. And each one of those form emails got the exact same response from me. I don&#39;t care. You know, a form email doesn&#39;t show me any real thought. When we got an actual email, like from someone who actually crafted what their reasoning and rationale was for opposing a policy, it got far more attention from us because it actually represented their thoughts rather than some organization that paid some money to advertise and got someone to fill in a form. The same kind of goes with these petitions because the petitions don&#39;t mean anything. They&#39;re really just a data gathering exercise and people gather the data. They put everybody onto a nation builder database and then they start segmenting them out. And this is no different than, you know, what Rob Anders was doing in 1997, 1998, you know, to 2001. The list work that was done by the right wing is now the list work that&#39;s being done by the left wing.</span>

Well, you don&#39;t build the database unless the audience wants to give you the data. So get the audience to give you the data. And that&#39;s where I think the AFL campaign falls completely short.</span>

And Carter, when you were chief of staff, did you guys keep stock of like what was going on? Like in the sense being like, hey, here&#39;s the advocacy campaigns moving up or down. Here&#39;s who might be throwing money into it. Like, give me a sense of like what your internal sort of tracking was on the inside.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think for us, the answer is obvious. I don&#39;t know if it is for our listeners, right? Which is like, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So when you email the premier, when you do any of that, it goes to what&#39;s called the premier&#39;s correspondence unit. There&#39;s an equivalent in every ministry in every province with the federal government, all of that.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">saying, okay, this is a trending up. This is an abating issue. These are things that we&#39;re watching right now. Here&#39;s some interesting correspondence. Correspondence teams will often also then give you a sampling of correspondence if it&#39;s a larger thing and it&#39;s more personal in nature. So you can get a sense of like the texture and the quality of it as well, which goes to the premier&#39;s office in many cases. So, yeah, I mean, these things matter and they are tracked. and um you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and then the other side of it is you know how much money is being spent to get that you know you can tell when a big campaign is being launched by a big organization to try and generate um you know to try and lobby if you will the government to change their their policies on something you also can tell when it&#39;s truly a grassroots piece um and the true grassroots piece is going to get far more attention than something that is that has uh tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars put behind it and to cory&#39;s point earlier if you see that something&#39;s got hundreds of thousands of dollars put into it and it&#39;s not generating sweet fuck all then you&#39;re like uh</span>

We already know the give a fuck factor for the general population because of our polling and the data and the research that&#39;s been put into things. So if you can&#39;t move the needle on the give a fuck factor, if you can&#39;t move the needle on the number of people that are caring, then I&#39;m basically walking into the victory because I already knew that it was a winning hand. I already knew it because I had more information than you. So you didn&#39;t bring anything to the table. You didn&#39;t change anybody&#39;s mind.

So talk to us about that in terms of what advocacy organizations should be doing in terms of that mix or that tension between ask, ask, ask. And by the way, you know, we want you to do this.

You have to give them a place where they can land and have victory. This is, for example, we are having a huge, every provincial government has a huge deficit.

And then perhaps if if you&#39;ve seen any good examples of what good celebrations for government have looked like in the past.</span>

            <span class="text">how does your narrative fit into their narrative? Your thing is not, it&#39;s the most important thing to you, but it&#39;s not likely the most important thing to them. And your ability to get your thing is to make it something that is about their thing and when you stand up and you celebrate with them what you&#39;re really doing is saying my success was part of your success and vice versa and we&#39;re all on the same team and we&#39;re all trying to do the same thing here and so in many ways um the most obvious version of this is when it&#39;s incremental towards what you want or it&#39;s what you want part of what you want you&#39;re going to go further but you can even stand up and celebrate with them when it&#39;s in the right direction when when you celebrate their priorities because you make it clear that it&#39;s your priorities as well so yeah uh we came to be a validator of the government um introducing this labor legislation because uh we also believe that uh we need to have more economic freedom in this province and while this is not our thing this is a thing worth celebrating and we&#39;re going to come and do it and it&#39;s basically your way of tying yourself to them at the hip and you&#39;re reminding them that your thing fits into their narrative as well so So it&#39;s a bit like, you know, to use that – remember the movie Dave? No one remembers the movie Dave. Everybody</span>

He says, like, why are we helping people advertise the car they already bought? Well, because you want people to feel good about the things that they already bought so that they go and they buy again. Actually, that was probably Dave&#39;s worst work as president, fake president, usurper. But go watch the movie, everybody. buddy. I&#39;m sure this made no sense to most of you. Great</span>

How bad is this situation with the Bloc Quebecois leader Blanchet denying sexual assault allegations? Of course, he came out with a press conference today, today being Sunday. His caucus stands behind him denying any allegations of of sexual assault uh is this is this a thing for him how bad is this well</span>

            <span class="text">well i&#39;m i&#39;m of two minds on this um one of them is i find it remarkable how as soon as it&#39;s a party leader who is under accusations like this everyone just says no no i mean obviously he&#39;s telling the truth here right like political expediency trumps those uh those principles it feels like every single time um and and we&#39;ve seen this with too many leaders even to count like here in the united states everywhere and so i&#39;m deeply cynical about uh everybody rallying to him at this point um but you know there&#39;s there&#39;s also there&#39;s an awkward thing that nobody really wants to talk about which is like you know we say believe her and you should believe victims</span>

            <span class="text">the expectation now that a leader has to step down under that cloud or whatnot? Because I do worry about it being weaponized at a certain point. So I don&#39;t know.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">less of two behinds than Corey because I think that an anonymous accusation on a Facebook page isn&#39;t an accusation. And Blanchett&#39;s response of, okay, take this to the police, file a report, is exactly the right one. If this is real, if this actually happened, then there is a process to deal with it. I&#39;m not aware of the legal implications of going on Facebook and just saying something. thing i will tell you that people have posted stuff to about me on twitter um that would make your hair fall out it has made my hair fall out it is um the accusations uh you know i don&#39;t want to repeat them because they&#39;re horrible um but anonymous accusations on on social media hold almost no weight for me because um anyone can make them um you know i&#39;ve had i&#39;ve called the The police have been involved in a number of these things to find out who&#39;s made these accusations because they&#39;re horrible.</span>

            <span class="text">well yeah look i mean there&#39;s a criminal bar which is is obvious it&#39;s It&#39;s much harder to prove something that&#39;s occurred 20 plus years. I don&#39;t believe there actually is a literal statute of limitations for the criminal charge here, but there is, there&#39;s kind of the next thing. It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t want to go through that. I don&#39;t have the evidence, but I want to say my piece and, and they are not necessarily the same thing.

            <span class="text">So I could see something like that happening, but I don&#39;t actually see that happening probably for another two years. It&#39;d be a break off like you&#39;ve lost us now before the election. You know, they&#39;re going to try and leverage it to get some significant payout of some sort. But Kenny is too good.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, Breakout Caucus led by Drew Barnes, by the way, great arthouse film title. Corey, what would you what would you give this this question in terms of a response? Is it possible? Is it viable?</span>

            <span class="text">Look, it&#39;s always been, I don&#39;t know about always, but for most of the history of the UCP, it&#39;s been true that Jason Kenney has been less popular than the political brand. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that surprising given Alberta sees itself, self-identifies as conservative. But here&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s always been true. And they got the most votes ever in the last election. So if I&#39;m Jason Kenney, A, I can point to that and say, yeah, I mean, so what? Big deal. This works for us. This whole thing we&#39;ve got going on is pretty nice. The other thing is, I&#39;m quite confident that it was always the plan to do the things that were – because it&#39;s the plan of every government, to do the unpopular things early, get them done, and then try to come back. And it&#39;s pretty easy for them to say, this</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is the plan. Political capital is meant to be spent. You can&#39;t put it under your mattress. You&#39;ve got to use it now or it becomes diminished with time. We&#39;ve talked about this in the past.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so we&#39;re doing it. We&#39;re spending it. Stick to the plan, everybody. buddy it only fails if we fall apart if we stop supporting each other and uh yeah the drew barns party is definitely possible i think in part because he&#39;s not in cabinet you know he probably expected to be in cabinet he&#39;s not in cabinet he&#39;s gone pretty rogue to begin with he&#39;s given a lot of indications there but they&#39;ve</span>

            <span class="text">they&#39;ve got a healthy majority they&#39;ll be able to survive a few and frankly it&#39;s it&#39;s usual in alberta to have a floor crossing every session we&#39;ve had had relatively few the past couple sessions. So, I mean, you&#39;ll see a couple, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be fatal to them.</span>
