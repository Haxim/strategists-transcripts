        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss updates to the WE Charity situation before diving deep into the issue of grassroots advocacy. Is Trudeau better off this week than last week? What kind of pressure on a government actually makes a difference? And did you know Kanye is running for President? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

You know, instead, you know, every press conference, he&#39;s able to just kind of sneak through it because he moves on to the next question, which he he lies about.

          <div class="said">It&#39;s probably not going to be a great ethics report, especially given that he has conceded this point. So the best he can do is say, yeah, I already acknowledged I was wrong on this. It&#39;s time to move on. Again, that doesn&#39;t really work with the rest of the world. You break the law. You don&#39;t just get to say, my bad, guys, and move on. So I&#39;ll be curious to see how this plays out from here. Carter,</div>

          <div class="said">I think it fits into the framework that I was talking about with trying to get this all done in the summer when people just don&#39;t seem to be paying attention and don&#39;t seem to care. You know, it is a it&#39;s an admission of guilt, to be sure. The ethics commissioner is going to come back and find that this was not proper. I would be willing to put a significant amount of money on. um but at the end of the day i mean the money didn&#39;t go out the door there you know there well some of the money went out the door but for the most part they pulled it back as quick as they could they&#39;ve been they ignored our usual double down strategy um and began the apology tour early tour early this was just one of the uh the final steps of the apology tour they want this over with quickly um that&#39;s a good strategy i think getting it over with quickly is probably your best call So, you know, an apology on a Monday, and hopefully you take a beating for a week or two. And then people forget what happens. Because as Trump has shown us, people tend to forget what happens.</div>

Corey, you talked about the testimony with the Finance Committee, the Ethics Committee also looking at trying to create their own investigation into this. But before I get into that, let&#39;s talk about we, because we also talked about them last week in terms of what their strategy should be. And like Clockwork, they came out on Monday with an entire Globe and Mail advertorial where they talked about their situation, how they&#39;re perhaps complicit in it, what what this meant for them, the internal reflection. What did you make of both the message but also the tactic of going to a full-page advertorial in the Globe and Mail? Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on this.</div>

          <div class="said">I hate the tactic. If you recall, we were saying put your head down, let the political people try and figure this out and reemphasize your good works by actually doing the good works. again this is a show don&#39;t tell type of model but they they try to talk about all the good things that they&#39;re doing um that doesn&#39;t really matter right and and how you&#39;re going to change isn&#39;t changing so i think that they were going to be given a relatively i mean they&#39;re going to be suffering on their donor base um but that suffering doesn&#39;t go away because they published a full page ad in the globe mail and on top of that who are you targeting with a full page ad in the globe mail mail. When was that a good strategy? I&#39;ve been in politics since 1997. I think that was a good strategy for the first four years of it. It&#39;s not a good strategy anymore. I don&#39;t understand what they were trying to achieve and what they hoped would be the outcome of it because it certainly wasn&#39;t going to be an immediate outcome. It was at the very best a first step towards something vaguely getting better for them. It&#39;s not going to get better. They&#39;ve wasted a bunch of money on an ad that&#39;s not going to do anything and they still need to put in place the the second half which of the the plan</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I&#39;m not going to change really my advice from last week. Go to the base of what it is that you do, right? So if you&#39;re a health organization, you go back to talking about how you&#39;re helping people stay healthier. You&#39;re doing health-related work. If you&#39;re an education organization, you go back to the students. If you are the Kielburgers, you go back to youth and making sure that you are showing and telling the story of youth and how you&#39;re making a difference through whatever your programs are, mentorship or work experience or whatever they may be, how you&#39;re actually making a difference in people&#39;s lives, because that&#39;s what charity is about, making a difference in people&#39;s lives. And all too often, we&#39;re not actually showing people how we make a difference when we&#39;re a charity because we become all about the charity, the donations, the money, the boards. that doesn&#39;t matter at all none of that really matters what matters is are you helping people and that&#39;s where kielburgers when they got their start you know they</div>

We didn&#39;t start a charity to keep you guys making money or living the high life. They didn&#39;t do it that way. They started to help people. So put them on a plane, send them to somewhere, get the pictures, do all the things that they did at the beginning. They got people excited about the work that they were doing because at the beginning, it was about the work. And if it can&#39;t be about the work anymore, then they should resign. So</div>

          <div class="said">that over leveraged on real real estate, the covenant stuff. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a big deal. Covenants are only a big deal if the banks think they&#39;re a big deal. They get written in. There&#39;s a lot of reasons why companies can be in violation of their covenants. COVID right now, I guarantee you, half of the major companies on Bay Street are violating bank covenants in one way, shape, or form.</div>

          <div class="said">But some people will think it&#39;s a big deal. And those people will make decisions about contributions. Some people will make decisions on contributions based on the interactions with the federal government some people will make contributions based on or not contributions i guess i should say based on the rumors about we being involved in you know extrajudicial killings i mean that was the most extreme one that we saw out of africa and i guess my point is this there&#39;s a lot of reasons why you might stop and not donate to we right now and um that does not help by you bringing the spotlight on you more like you can do no right at a moment like this and it might be time to go to the mattresses and uh part of that is getting back to your core mission carter is absolutely right uh the the stuff that the kielbergers did originally this idea of stopping child labor and helping african communities out of poverty and uh helping build communities that are self-sustaining even after the charity has left you know their five pillar approach that&#39;s all good stuff right uh me to we we day these were always kind of odd extensions and i think they&#39;re the extensions of restless executives and what they need to do is exactly what steven said which is do you actually want to be in this business stop trying to find ways to be in other businesses that sort of look like the charity business because those things are getting you into a lot of trouble and you need to stop okay</div>

          <div class="said">weather this storm of the Finance Committee. But they also did something else, which was they filibustered on the other committee, on the Ethics Committee, so as to delay that particular committee and their investigation. So what do you kind of make of the current sort of dance that the conservatives and liberals are doing on the committee level, back and forth? I just want to get your thoughts and see where you you think uh they&#39;re making the right or the wrong moves well</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, no, it does. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. It seems unusual, but maybe they think that there&#39;s more to come out. Maybe they think the sequencing of these committees will be helpful. You talked about Bardish-Chagger, and that&#39;s a minister that I think doesn&#39;t really have a ministry, at least not a department in the strong sense. And so I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s really where you&#39;re going to find the real, real answers, but you&#39;re right. Right. Like, actually, I will say that as the testimony came out, I sort of, as a recovering bureaucrat, said to myself, I guess that&#39;s possible. Like, it wasn&#39;t the most outrageous story that was woven by the government as to how this contract could be created and how people could think we was the right people to do it. By the way, that $44 million, that was on like $200 out the door because it&#39;s not like the original contract was apparently for $100 million. So those are some pretty rich ratios there. um it</div>

So I think that that puts people off and people don&#39;t hear what&#39;s being said as much because it&#39;s just it strikes us of the same old, same old.

And, and if other people feel the same, if media feels the same, then the conservatives didn&#39;t do themselves any favors last week.

If you&#39;re the conservatives, it&#39;s got to be more about, okay, let&#39;s make sure that the ethics commissioner has that&#39;s what they need. Let&#39;s make sure this seems very serious.

So if you are someone like, let&#39;s say, oh, I don&#39;t know, Christopher Freeland right now, who may have future ambitions within the Liberal Party. You, of course, have to play team ball right now, stick with Justin Trudeau. But how are you kind of observing this scandal? If you&#39;re advising her right now, if you&#39;re strategizing for her future run to be leader of the Liberal Party, how are you advising her to kind of play her cards right now? Is it strictly, hey, just go with the team, that&#39;s all that you can do right now? Or are you telling her to hold some back, maybe maneuver in certain ways? I&#39;m kind of curious to hear your advice if I&#39;ve got got future ambitions within this party?</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, thank you for redeeming yourself, getting your Machiavellian teeth back at the end of that. Thank you so much. I feel like we&#39;re much more normalized. Heading into our next segment, our next segment, getting your way. Guys, I want to talk about advocacy campaigns. You know, we touched upon this during the Black Lives Matter movement. But I want to do a little bit of a not a deep dive, but a little bit of an introspection as to where we sit with the state of advocacy advocacy organizations. And using it to jump off is a campaign here in Alberta, our home province, of course, by the Alberta Federation of Labor, which is a union. And they&#39;re putting together this campaign called Defend Workers&#39; Rights. I think it just launched recently, if not today, if I&#39;m not wrong. And the campaign is an outright attack on Jason Kenney, saying Jason Kenney is tipping the scales against workers. He&#39;s wanting to protect himself and his rich donors, give them them more power. And it&#39;s really, you know, then a pretty standard suite of tools that visitors can engage in. So before we get into the tools of advocacy, which I also want to discuss, talk to me about this current message. Let&#39;s talk about the specifics of this campaign. And maybe give us some context, Carter, as to why the unions might be upset, and then what you make of the effectiveness of this message that you&#39;re hearing from the AFL.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Why are the unions upset? Well, because the Kenney government is absolutely targeting unions. they&#39;ve decided that unions are going to be the enemy and they are going to go after them they&#39;re going after them in terms of what they can say politically they&#39;re going after them about where they can say it they&#39;re going after them about how much money they can get from their members and how they can spend the money that they do get from their members it is maybe not an all-out attack we didn&#39;t become a right-to-work province so there is one more step that certainly could have been taken but the kenny government has decided to make an enemy of unions and now the unions are responding in kind by making jason kenny the enemy of all unions um which is interesting because you know the the sided</div>

          <div class="said">they use that with intent uh that was to tell their adversaries we are here you cannot take us out um and jason kenney is there he cannot be taken out i mean john john horgan has a minority government next door in british Columbia, he could be taken out by a confidence vote. He&#39;s not going to be taken out by a confidence vote, but it could actually happen. Jason Kenney is, for all intents and purposes, a dictator for four years, and he&#39;s one year in, and so taking him on, making him the enemy, you have to have a pretty good strategy on how you&#39;re actually going to succeed, because right now, it looks like the battle could just be three years of yelling.</div>

I think it&#39;s really tough for me to determine whether the message is right or the tactics are right until I really understand what the objectives of the campaign are. If it&#39;s a broadcast campaign, I&#39;ve got some doubts. right? I do worry about its ability to resonate with Albertans writ large, if it is a campaign that is designed to get your union enthusiasts mobilized, well, then maybe it&#39;s exactly where it needs to be. Certainly, the campaign uses language that you find in the labor movement, less or more than you would find in in the way people talk about these things more generally. But, but,</div>

Corey mentioned a few, right? We talked about mobilizing and engaging your base. This is not about convincing government. It&#39;s just about getting your base active. You know you can&#39;t change shit, so why not just get them active? All the way to the other side of the spectrum, which I think is more like, hey, let&#39;s actually get something done. Let&#39;s change policy. So can you perhaps kind of give us the overview as to where, you know, the advocacy goals are and what you kind of see advocacy goals as being?</div>

That&#39;s actually trying to change the world. They want legislation to be brought in, they will change certain elements of today&#39;s society. And they will measure success and failure by whether or not they were able to get those pieces of legislation or the changes in tactics or the changes in society to actually occur. And they will be measuring that on a timeline that is relatively human, right? We would expect to see change in months or, worst case scenario, years, but a small number of years, right? You&#39;re going to actually make the change happen. We&#39;ve seen it happen before with LGBTQ issues. And in fact, when you look back at the marriage equality work that was done, it started relatively slow. But the measurement was state by state are gays and lesbians getting the right to marry in those states. And you could see them falling one by one. And once they started to get that momentum, then it was unstoppable. And the change was actually happening. And</div>

You know, he&#39;s not he wasn&#39;t walking away from those changes. It wasn&#39;t until we got to I think it was Bill 13 that was a, you know, an attack on health care or increased privatization on health care where general population saw that their lives were going to change, that they were actually able to move on it and stop that bill from being passed. When it was just the union movement, when it was just unions, it wasn&#39;t successful. When it became about everyone, it became successful. And this is where the objectives model looks at, right? Like if it&#39;s always about if it was just always about a small segment of society, then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be successful. And arguably, the first Black Lives Matter, certainly no less important than today&#39;s Black Lives Matter, both of them equally important with the exact same type of messaging. This one&#39;s being far more successful because it is about all of us. Each one of us has to recognize the challenges in our society of racism. And when it</div>

But before we go there, can you perhaps, you know, talk to our listeners about what you see as the value of a advocacy campaign that may not necessarily have a pathway towards policy or legislative change, but its main purpose is riling up their members? Can you talk to us about where you kind of see some of that value coming in and what sub-goals there might be in a situation like that?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think foundationally, if you&#39;re an advocacy group, you are trying to change something. And it&#39;s really about time horizon. And perhaps what you need to do as a first step or an intermediate step is to mobilize your core supporters, arm your core supporters, train your core supporters. Get them finding a bigger universe that they can then go out and make your secondary level of supporters to allow you to down the road make the change that you want to make. And so that would be the main reason that you might want to do something like that. And perhaps it&#39;s as simple as changing the conversation or moving the weight of it.

          <div class="said">Carter, let&#39;s talk about this model campaign for advocacy in the time we find ourselves in. And I want to start with the tactics. So let&#39;s reference back to this AFL campaign. They&#39;ve got some very specific suite of tactics. They&#39;ve got signing a petition, emailing your MLA, calling your MLA, tweeting your MLA. As the former chief of staff who met with only one advocacy group, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, during your entire time, this question is not suited for you. But let&#39;s say you had more than one meeting while you were chief of staff. Do these tactics work, Stephen? Do these tactics of sending letters, sending tweets, phone calling, you know, they&#39;re advertised and promoted as the lever to getting change. But do they actually work from the decision-making capacity that you&#39;ve seen them in?</div>

          <div class="said">I think we were proposing to log some area in Bragg Creek. and we were getting 3000 form emails a day at the peak of it. And each one of those form emails got the exact same response from me. I don&#39;t care. You know, a form email doesn&#39;t show me any real thought. When we got an actual email, like from someone who actually crafted what their reasoning and rationale was for opposing a policy, it got far more attention from us because it actually represented their thoughts rather than some organization that paid some money to advertise and got someone to fill in a form. The same kind of goes with these petitions because the petitions don&#39;t mean anything. They&#39;re really just a data gathering exercise and people gather the data. They put everybody onto a nation builder database and then they start segmenting them out. And this is no different than, you know, what Rob Anders was doing in 1997, 1998, you know, to 2001. The list work that was done by the right wing is now the list work that&#39;s being done by the left wing.</div>

You have to give them a place where they can land and have victory. This is, for example, we are having a huge, every provincial government has a huge deficit. The federal government has a huge deficit.

And your ability to get your thing is to make it something that is about their thing and when you stand up and you celebrate with them what you&#39;re really doing is saying my success was part of your success and vice versa and we&#39;re all on the same team and we&#39;re all trying to do the same thing here and so in many ways um the most obvious version of this is when it&#39;s incremental towards what you want or it&#39;s what you want part of what you want you&#39;re going to go further but you can even stand up and celebrate with them when it&#39;s in the right direction when when you celebrate their priorities because you make it clear that it&#39;s your priorities as well so yeah uh we came to be a validator of the government um introducing this labor legislation because uh we also believe that uh we need to have more economic freedom in this province and while this is not our thing this is a thing worth celebrating and we&#39;re going to come and do it and it&#39;s basically your way of tying yourself to them at the hip and you&#39;re reminding them that your thing fits into their narrative as well so So it&#39;s a bit like, you know, to use that – remember the movie Dave?

I&#39;m not aware of the legal implications of going on Facebook and just saying something. thing i will tell you that people have posted stuff to about me on twitter um that would make your hair fall out it has made my hair fall out it is um the accusations uh you know i don&#39;t want to repeat them because they&#39;re horrible um but anonymous accusations on on social media hold almost no weight for me because um anyone can make them um you know i&#39;ve had i&#39;ve called the The police have been involved in a number of these things to find out who&#39;s made these accusations because they&#39;re horrible.</div>

I want to go to you on this because we&#39;ve answered a version of this question in the past, but do you see anything changing in this moment in time?</div>

          <div class="said">Jason Kenney&#39;s a tremendously talented politician. He&#39;s throwing all kinds of scraps around to people and giving them lots of reasons to love him and lots of loyalty. I don&#39;t see any way that he is deposed.

          <div class="said">why not? I mean, the far right wing of lunatics, and let&#39;s be clear, Drew Barnes is the craziest of the group. You know, it is hard to keep a caucus together of Alberta conservatives because Alberta conservatism doesn&#39;t come in one flavor.</div>

          <div class="said">Look, it&#39;s always been, I don&#39;t know about always, but for most of the history of the UCP, it&#39;s been true that Jason Kenney has been less popular than the political brand. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that surprising given Alberta sees itself, self-identifies as conservative. But here&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s always been true. And they got the most votes ever in the last election. So if I&#39;m Jason Kenney, A, I can point to that and say, yeah, I mean, so what? Big deal. This works for us. This whole thing we&#39;ve got going on is pretty nice. The other thing is, I&#39;m quite confident that it was always the plan to do the things that were – because it&#39;s the plan of every government, to do the unpopular things early, get them done, and then try to come back.
