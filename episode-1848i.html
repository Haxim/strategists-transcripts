            <span class="text">people are making it out to be. Like, there&#39;s a thought in design that when you&#39;re doing a logo, particularly for a political party, and Hillary Clinton did this, right? Right. And that you&#39;re not creating so much a logo as you&#39;re creating a design system. And a lot of what we saw from the greens on the launch of their quote unquote logo, which is just a green circle, to your point, is how they were going to use it, how they were going to apply it on advertisements next to each other, where the dots become circles with pictures of nature in some cases or whatever, all next to each other, telling a story or the green dots surrounded by people in that Memphis corporate look like really pretty hackneyed and a few years old. But it&#39;s a way they tell a story. And so they were looking for a logo that allowed them both to meet the needs of a modern logo, which is simplicity, the ability to make it big, make it small, use an awful lot of context, but also serve as a bit of a foundation for other communications activity, other design activity. So, I mean, I guess I get it. I just think it&#39;s not as clever as they think it is. Carter,</span>

And and in Germany, there are there are constitutional protections well beyond what you&#39;d find here or in the United States to stop extremist parties. And just before the election, they were they were somewhat strengthened. So it would take a super majority to undo some of them. So in some ways, the mainstream parties almost tried to AFD proof some of the things that exist within Germany. Yeah. So it&#39;s not like everything&#39;s going to fall apart in a minute, like it did, even if the AFD ended up with the plurality of the seats.

You know, Tremblay is being replaced in the health ministry, but continues to be the interim head of Alberta Health Services. So she makes this minor concession with her deputy minister, doesn&#39;t let go of her actual health minister, despite one call from inside the House to do so, in her own ministry to do so, at least one call that we know of. The NDP continued to call for what they&#39;ve called for. Where is this story going, Carter?</span>

You can say the same thing different ways in the 30-second description over and over again. And the three minutes will change over time. Right. Like there&#39;s going to be multiple. Think of the three minutes as the Carrie Tate reporting. Right. Carrie has taken the 30 minute story and turned it into the three minute stories over and over again. And she&#39;s done an excellent job of making that very clear where the NDP are struggling. They don&#39;t need to necessarily define the three-minute piece. They can simply recirculate the media work there. They&#39;ll have to do some three-minute work when the media stop covering this. But for now, their greatest weakness is that they&#39;re not defining at all the 30-second definition. And that 30-second definition that Jarrett Wesley tweet is not in the wheelhouse of Nenshi.
