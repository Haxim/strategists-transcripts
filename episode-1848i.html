        <p>Corey returns to pass judgment on everything Stephen said last episode. Zain observes. Other topics are also discussed. Join us, on "Morgens mit den Strategen".</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Green Party of Canada's new logo, the German election, and Poilievre's new ad - before talking about what the UCP and NDP need to do to advance their narratives related to the turmoil at Alberta Health Services. Is the new Green Party absurd, a strong foundation for communications activity, or both? Are the NDP struggling to find a "30 second summary" of the AHS allegations? Und wie steht es mit Deutschland? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">people are making it out to be. Like, there&#39;s a thought in design that when you&#39;re doing a logo, particularly for a political party, and Hillary Clinton did this, right? Right. And that you&#39;re not creating so much a logo as you&#39;re creating a design system. And a lot of what we saw from the greens on the launch of their quote unquote logo, which is just a green circle, to your point, is how they were going to use it, how they were going to apply it on advertisements next to each other, where the dots become circles with pictures of nature in some cases or whatever, all next to each other, telling a story or the green dots surrounded by people in that Memphis corporate look like really pretty hackneyed and a few years old. But it&#39;s a way they tell a story. And so they were looking for a logo that allowed them both to meet the needs of a modern logo, which is simplicity, the ability to make it big, make it small, use an awful lot of context, but also serve as a bit of a foundation for other communications activity, other design activity. So, I mean, I guess I get it. I just think it&#39;s not as clever as they think it is. Carter,</div>

You know, Tremblay is being replaced in the health ministry, but continues to be the interim head of Alberta Health Services. So she makes this minor concession with her deputy minister, doesn&#39;t let go of her actual health minister, despite one call from inside the House to do so, in her own ministry to do so, at least one call that we know of.

Think of the three minutes as the Carrie Tate reporting. Right. Carrie has taken the 30 minute story and turned it into the three minute stories over and over again. And she&#39;s done an excellent job of making that very clear where the NDP are struggling. They don&#39;t need to necessarily define the three-minute piece. They can simply recirculate the media work there. They&#39;ll have to do some three-minute work when the media stop covering this. But for now, their greatest weakness is that they&#39;re not defining at all the 30-second definition. And that 30-second definition that Jarrett Wesley tweet is not in the wheelhouse of Nenshi.
