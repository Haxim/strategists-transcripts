          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay excellent well here&#39;s what we want to do um i&#39;ve promised this for a while uh i don&#39;t even know if i promised it on the show But I&#39;ve wanted to talk about O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership. And it&#39;s kind of come to a head, to be honest, over the last 10 days, when we&#39;re starting to see media columns by opinion columnists, when we&#39;re starting to see reporting with, quote unquote, key insiders within the conservative circles, grow frustrated about Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership. You know, they&#39;ve, as</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">as a party, not necessarily made the gains that many have expected during this pandemic period, especially when Trudeau was being slogged for a slow vaccine rollout. Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership numbers still remain, you know, lesser than Trudeau&#39;s. His inability to pick a lane, so to speak, has been a part of the discontent. Many conservatives saying he&#39;s being too centrist. Others say he&#39;s abandoning the right. So a myriad of issues, and we can get into a lot of them. But I think it sets the table for what we&#39;re going to see in the next week or so, which is a conservative policy convention. And that policy convention is now seemingly, at least according to some of the media reporting, being dominated at least by the metric of convention attendees and delegate slots by conservatives, social conservatives more specifically, far right, pro-life groups, anti-abortion groups coming together, taking a large swath of these delegate seats. So before we get into the leadership struggle that is Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership, what it means, should he pick a lane, is this all overblown, and then get into the strategic advice and kind of comparators of what you&#39;ve seen in the past, Stephen Carter, I want to start with this policy convention, because I think we&#39;ve mentioned it very briefly on the show. I asked both of you, if you guys recall, policy conventions, overrated and underrated. I think both of you said overrated. At the same time, they could be narrative defining. And with the metric of or kind of with the makeup of this policy convention being virtual, not necessarily having the read on the room as you would as a leader giving a speech. Stephen Carter, we&#39;re hearing the reports of the social conservative movement snagging some or grabbing a lot of these delegates slots.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Is this is this a big deal? Is this a concern given all the text I&#39;ve laid out for Aaron O&#39;Toole right now?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, it&#39;s a big deal. And I want to differentiate between the theater of the policy convention and the outward appearance and the actual policies that were being developed. I think that I&#39;ll speak for Corey here and he will correct me later. But I think when we were talking about our policy conventions, overrated or underrated, we&#39;re talking about the policy convention outcome. come right you guys are absolutely</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you guys both said that it&#39;s the leader who gets to unanimously decide whatever the fuck he or she wants so right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">right in terms of yeah theater theater matters a lot theater matters a tremendous amount um and so the theater of this particular uh event um this is not unusual i mean every policy convention ever has had um pits of groups of people who are pitted against one another uh trying to get different pieces of of policy Normally, what you have, though, is you have everybody in person. And it turns out that we&#39;re much nicer to one another in person. And we can talk sense into people and you can reach compromise and you can say to them, listen, you know, this really isn&#39;t the time to bring this up, but we&#39;ll bring it up at some other time. But every conservative party. You quite literally</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, because and you send out your big hitters and you send out, you know, Stockwell Day would go out and he would talk to the social conservatives because they like stock. They all listen to stock. And so you would have a convention plan that would have people being spoken to by people who they will listen to. And so you could actually work the room and you can you can have those rooms. assumes, you know, the MLAs or the MPs could</span>

The thing about any event can be a bad event when you&#39;re the leader of a political party, right? And this one obviously has some of the elements that can be particularly troublesome if you&#39;re a party leader, it has a chance to show disunity, it has the chance for a big blow up, it has the chance for some sort of embarrassing output that will make the make the people of Canada think less of you. And it has the chance to really cut you off at your knees with your strategy, which seems to be moved towards the center, right? And so we may be looking at this in two weeks and saying that was no big deal at all. We may be saying everything&#39;s different for Aaron O&#39;Toole after the convention. It&#39;s possible. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s probable that we are going to say everything&#39;s different for Aaron O&#39;Toole. I think ultimately the most likely outcome is a moderately embarrassing event that he can move past because that seems to be what conditions are there right now. Stephen&#39;s done an okay job of summing them up, and he&#39;s right about the fact that a Zoom meeting probably fails to provide a lot of those avenues to whip the party faithful that an in-person meeting has.</span>

You have many people hungry, thirsty for what&#39;s our brand positioning? What do we stand for, Mr. O&#39;Toole? Like, who are we? So you have those two things kind of hanging in the balance. Is there anything that a virtual policy convention perhaps gives an added advantage to for O&#39;Toole as he kind of tries to, quote unquote, pick a lane?

Which is, well, yeah, but it&#39;s not a real one of these. And I think that the ability of Aaron O&#39;Toole to downplay what occurred uh is significantly better in a situation where it&#39;s not the norm right you just say well look this is not a normal convention of ours it didn&#39;t have the normal ability for us to get together obviously we saw that there were some risks with having whatever he wants to say he&#39;s got a lot of things he can say that he wouldn&#39;t necessarily be able to say if this was we&#39;re going to meet in ottawa and we&#39;re going to do all of the shit we always do when these things come up so that&#39;s an advantage for him as well carter</span>

But Corey, let&#39;s just say there is a controversial, and we really don&#39;t have a good sense of kind of what this this delegate cohort, if we can call that is going to try to do. But you you hit on something last time that I&#39;ll spend maybe a few more seconds on, which was when we talked about this, you had mentioned that if there is a controversial policy on on the floor, you try to like put up another policy in parallel so that you split the votes.

But generally speaking, the leader has at least a few levers through which which they can control the</span>

You can, you can have not the, the plenary is the plenary, everybody&#39;s there, but you can have the breakout sessions compete with each other, which will force a division of these groups. There are ways that you can manage a conversation and make it either, you know, there&#39;s basically two tactics, Both of which can be used interchangeably depending on what the needs of the moment are. One is you have all</span>

            <span class="text">all eyes on an issue because you know the majority will be supporting it or you try to divide it as much as possible and sneak something through. And like the leader has many ways they can do this. The other thing that this virtual convention will allow in a higher degree is the leader can also set the stage, like what is actually happening on the stage, you know, the keynote speeches that are going on, the major, you know, framings</span>

So if you have a policy that leads in one way and the conversation&#39;s all in one flavor, and then you follow it up with another policy that you are then forcing them to think about it in the frame of that policy that was just before, these are all ways that you can manage a policy convention. And because you are not physically in a room, it will probably be harder for, well, maybe not, maybe opponents will coordinate on their second screen or they&#39;ll be texting each other, but you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">And Lougheed used to talk about the health and the strength of the constituency associations. And he wanted his MLAs to be constantly working to ensure that they reflected, number one, their overall constituency and also that their CA reflected reflected the entire constituency. It becomes very, very easy for a CA to be taken over by a relatively small group of people. This is not unusual in something that&#39;s just the politics either. If you ever go to a community association meeting in your local community, those aren&#39;t normal people. So</span>

            <span class="text">So they don&#39;t necessarily reflect us, right? So we&#39;re not normal either. We&#39;re political people. And so trying to get people who are involved that reflect the normal population is tough. But people who have an axe to grind, people who have a particular point of view about something they care deeply about, they will join political parties at a higher propensity in order to have something to say about those issues. So it&#39;s incumbent upon the MPs to try and manage who&#39;s a member of their constituency association, who are buying memberships. I&#39;m not going to sell to this group, but more along the lines of I&#39;m going to sell more more memberships in general in my constituency, and that will water out the impact of a specific group because now you&#39;ve got more people around.</span>

In fact, there&#39;s only one item on the COVID list that I want to discuss with O&#39;Toole, which is, let me just look it up here, vaccines. Vaccinations. Yeah, that&#39;s good. We&#39;re going to look up vaccines. Corey, you know, let&#39;s shift away from the policy convention. You guys gave some good strategic insights and advice regarding how to think about that if you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole. But let&#39;s talk about his leadership overall. And I want to start here, which is, I mentioned very briefly off the top of this segment that This was something I&#39;ve wanted to talk about for a while, but it seemed like almost in domino effect, columns, articles, think pieces about O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership popped up over the course of the last, I&#39;d say, seven to eight days. Andrew Coyne, Chantal Hébert, like, you know, prominent national columnists, a post-media piece that we can discuss that went deep to talk to insiders. What does the fact that you saw in the matter of six days, so many pieces, multiple, I think it&#39;s fair to say multiple pieces written about this subject mean? Do you feel like this is a sign that people are leaking, that there&#39;s outright discontent? You know, I don&#39;t want you to speculate as much as like read the tea leaves in terms of what could be happening from a political standpoint with your experience.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Ibbotson wrote something too, but it was paywalled, so I never read it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is a bit of uh there&#39;s two things i think that need to be acknowledged before we start looking for kind of my god is there a conspiracy in the conservative party or are things really falling apart one we have a policy convention coming right so there is a natural media hook through which you can build these stories and two um other people have started writing about these stories and it creates a bit of a snowball effect like hey there&#39;s a lot of of chatter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">chatter out there. Maybe work your context, maybe see what&#39;s going on right now with Aaron O&#39;Toole. All that said, it is also possible that there is another group of people out there, people in the conservative caucus in particular, who are not so enthused or maybe using those opportunities that are presented by number one and number two, the fact there&#39;s a policy convention and the fact that people are writing about it, to go make sure their opinions are heard too. So they&#39;re also working their context the other way. They&#39;re saying, hey, you see this story about O&#39;Toole by Hebert. Well, let me tell you another angle about this. And so you do see that this can create a bit of a vicious cycle for a leader. But one thing I really want to stress is that while it&#39;s never a good thing when these things are going on, basically every successful leader that we have seen in Canadian politics has gone through a wave of these kinds of stories. Chrétien, you bet.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You certainly had a couple of stories asking whether Stephen Harper could be the guy who could do it right whether he was just not what was needed in canada uh justin trudeau i mean we all remember that there was a year of my god the liberals really blew it by picking this guy he was in third place distant third for so long he looked like a dead man walking and then all of a sudden he&#39;s the prime minister so um i i also think that as we read and we process these stories we need to take them all with a bit of a grain of salt because this is the narrative that occurs when you try to change your party, right? There is growing frustration in the Conservative Party because he is trying to change the Conservative Party. We&#39;ve talked about the fact they were too conservative. We talked about the fact this held their party back. Well, guess what? There are a lot of Conservative MPs in the Conservative Party and his party desperately needs to move to the centre.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">They don&#39;t like that he is moving to the centre. There is going to be some grumbling about that. That is also a foundational reality, which is not to say that we want to then just immediately swing the other way and discount everything that we&#39;re hearing or put our fingers in our ears. And I think ultimately, and I hope we can unpack this, Aaron O&#39;Toole has – there&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s two things going on here. There&#39;s the concept and there&#39;s the execution. I would argue the concept of moving to the center for the conservatives is a good one electorally. The execution, how Aaron O&#39;Toole has attempted to move the conservatives to the center, that&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s leaving something to be desired. Going all the way back to his leadership contest where he said, well, I&#39;m just going to pretend to be the thing that they want us to be. Uh, and then he and his team become that they get elected and he&#39;s not that thing. And there&#39;s a bit of a, you know, I, I bought this, I bought this product and this product is nothing like it looks like on the box that&#39;s happening right now too. And that is a problem of his own creation. Was it necessary? Maybe, but you&#39;re going to have to deal with that for a long time. When you kind of do the bait and switch like that, if you are, for example, somebody who says they will never merge the PCs with, you know, with the Reform Party, and then you do, right? Or Canadian Alliance, I guess it was at the time.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But the, the other thing is, his execution has been a really, really kind of scattershot. And I suspect we&#39;ll talk a bit about that. Sometimes he&#39;s this crusading centrist. Sometimes he&#39;s not.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And Corey, you make a good point. I not only want to talk about the unevenness in his approach, but also the evolution versus revolution trigger happiness that&#39;s been deployed by Aaron O&#39;Toole in certain cases, just trying to say this is what it is now, not having any sort of bridge or come on board period. I want to discuss that. But Carter, I want to actually get your take on this media side of things. Do you agree with Corey&#39;s analysis, the two prongs that he put out there that, you know, that, of course, this is a lead up to a policy convention. So there is a natural sort of home, that part. And then in addition to the fact that, you know, there is perhaps an opportunity to talk about these issues more broadly, when you see one columnist or outlet talk about it kind of snowballs in that sense. Do you largely agree with that? And I&#39;ll add a second part to it for you, which is how concerned are you, Timo Thule, if you&#39;re Timo Thule, that this stuff is playing out in the media right now?</span>

            <span class="text">Guys, I want to unpack this a bit more. I keep teasing you with additional questions prior to getting to it. But there&#39;s one more, which is almost every single piece we&#39;re seeing right now about O&#39;Toole references polling. And one of them I thought was quite interesting, which said that every national poll published since February 1st has conservative support hovering around 30%, four points down from when they finished last time. Also, in addition to that, Aaron O&#39;Toole is the least favorable of the federal leaders. If you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole, Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you again, if that&#39;s okay. If you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole, I asked you about, you know, should you be concerned that there&#39;s gossip in the media about your leadership?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s talk about the quantifiable numbers. Should you be concerned at these numbers? Because it&#39;s not just qualitative, it&#39;s quantitative. We can put in Barry Bonds asterisks on that, too. Should you be concerned about the fact that there&#39;s numbers out there which are being constantly referenced and reinforced in this media product? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, polls, I think polls lead. I don&#39;t think necessarily polls follow sometimes. And so if O&#39;Toole is going to lose the next election, O&#39;Toole will lose the next election. So the polls that tell us that are, in fact, the outcome that is generated, especially when you start getting into these, you know, the 338s and everybody who&#39;s predicting which seats are going to swing which way. I mean, that becomes kind of like, oh, well, why am I even bothering? You know, 338 says it&#39;s all over, you know, so you get into this really negative cycle. And so if O&#39;Toole is seen to be losing, if O&#39;Toole is seen to be weaker than Shear, then</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">then it is just a very bad situation for O&#39;Toole. So, yes, the polls absolutely are part of the narrative. The polls are the cue to the media that they should start picking on him and ganging up on him. And the polls are the cue to the social conservatives as well, because he needs us now. He needs us. He has to listen to us. If he doesn&#39;t listen to us, then we can really bring him down. And there&#39;s a reason for this, I think.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">I think that the Conservative Party that people want to vote for is not the Conservative Party that was defined in the leadership by McCain, O&#39;Toole</span>

And it just baffles me why McCain O&#39;Toole didn&#39;t take it towards the center and just beat the shit out of Sloan and Lewis and say, see, we&#39;re not that party is beyond me. But that&#39;s why I&#39;m not a Conservative Party strategist anymore. The Conservative Party that I knew does not fit into this mold that they have developed for themselves. And they&#39;re handing back the keys to the Liberal Party of Canada.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, way overblown. There&#39;s a couple of things I want to say about polls that I think people need to keep in mind as foundations for the conversation to come. One is the Conservatives for the past couple of years have tended to outperform their average of polls. If you look at the polling leading up to the last election, yeah, it went back and forth. You had some late polls saying the Conservatives were going to lead in the national vote. You had some saying the Liberals. More said the Liberals than Conservatives. And none of them for like going back at least a week showed the Conservatives winning by as much as they did of the popular vote. So let&#39;s just sort of bake in that there may be an underappreciation there. And the second thing is, top-line polls are useless in this country. They are very misleading. And if you are the Conservatives and you are bleeding support in Alberta, and you are picking up support in the 905 because you are becoming more moderate, to give you an example here, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you are not going to move in the polls, but you are bettering your position. And a lot of what I have seen is that in that, you know, contestable area of the 905 in particular, Aaron O&#39;Toole is not doing so badly. So people</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people can&#39;t be seduced by those top line numbers. They need to look a little bit beyond that. It wasn&#39;t one of the points I was going to make, but the other is we&#39;re outside of an election. We are consumed with COVID. We have been consumed with the United States election. I know there are a lot of people saying, look, Aaron O&#39;Toole hasn&#39;t defined himself or he&#39;s defined himself negatively. I just fundamentally don&#39;t think people give a shit right now about most of this stuff. like when you look at the canadian population as a whole and he still has a strong opportunity to find himself out of the gate when an election actually happens so i</span>

Because there is one big factor that maybe we start with, which both of you brought up that the people who handed him the keys to victory are now the ones that feel the strongest against perhaps his leadership because they were sold false bill of goods in many ways. So that is an added dynamic, perhaps, to O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership. How does he, I love your framing, Corey, land in the second category and not the first with those clump of leaders that didn&#39;t become prime minister? Well,</span>

And what are they going to start caring about?

Erin O&#39;Toole&#39;s actions crash against some pretty fundamental advice I would give to any political leader, which is you dance with the one that brought you. You don&#39;t trade a coalition you have for a coalition you want. So many of the tragedies of leadership are built around this very simple axiom. I think about here in our home province, Alison Redford was elected by moderates and then sold them all out and did whatever she could to try to get the love of a right wing of her party that would never love her. and it ultimately destroyed her premiership i mean she had she gave it a bit of an assist i would suggest but a lot of the stories a lot of the things that came along with that really it was rooted in that right you pushed away all of your moderate friends in the hopes of getting right-wing friends and then you had no friends right you had no friends and so aaron o&#39;toole&#39;s doing something pretty interesting here which is he came in with a very clear strategy obviously it&#39;s pretty apparent at this point this was his strategy right run right in the leadership move move towards the center, treating it almost like a US primary election rather than a Canadian parliamentary election. And you wonder if that was too clever by half. Maybe it was. But you are now attempting to get the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the Peter McKay wing of the party, and you&#39;re burning your own. And that&#39;s really quite a delicate balancing act. So I&#39;ve mentioned in episodes past, I think it seems like he wanted to just hit that gas at the last moment and just start going towards this when he thought it was too late for his party to break with him. Well, maybe that was mistimed. Maybe that was never a great strategy. Maybe it was something that just seemed like a good idea. But when I talk about the execution and when I talk about that gas, he&#39;s had to feather the brakes a few times. So, yeah, he&#39;s kicked out Derek Sloan. Yeah, he&#39;s made statements about I&#39;m a moderate on these 12 different elements. But then he will stand by candidates at other moments, MPs at other moments when they make statements. We talked about Gallant the other day, right? Right. Yeah. This is this is just kind of the reality he finds himself in. And now, of course, he&#39;s got this policy convention where his party could, again, look a little bit more right wing than he&#39;s comfortable with looking. By the way, there is a universe where they come out of this way more moderate as a result of the policy convention. And it&#39;s actually a step along this whole journey that he&#39;s taking here. But, you know, he&#39;s just diving right in. Carter, you&#39;re you know, the say fuck it and win approach. Not only, I think, is that a strong candidate for episode title?</span>

Christy Clark, when she was elected leader of the BC Libs, became premier, there was just a huge swath of her party that would never get behind her, were convinced she was going to lose to Dix. She did not lose to Dix. But there was a lot of chatter, and there was this 801 Club, people who were going to be turning against her and getting that leadership review one minute after the polls closed in British Columbia.

You see that with Boris Johnson in the UK right now. Think about all of those Tories who were lining up against his Brexit plans, and he said, fuck it, I&#39;m going to win, and he drove through an election, and he recreated his party. It is possible. I think Johnson is likely an inspiration to what&#39;s going on here. I suspect strongly that Christie Clark is an inspiration. I suspect that the American political system is an inspiration.

            <span class="text">Good advice on the coalition. Dance with the one that brought you. Also reminds me of another example we&#39;ve seen on the national stage, Tom Mulcair. If you recall his leadership, very much about trying to pivot away from the folks that got him into that chair in 2015. Carter, you know, when we talk about what Corey has here, which is, you know, some of the fundamental challenges on his execution. execution um what do you kind of feel like Aaron O&#39;Toole needs to do around his brand promise because many people are advocating that the dude pick a lane like who are you are you going to be a bit of true blue here and then like the moderate version here uh you&#39;ve advocated that he can go straight down become the moderate version of O&#39;Toole that he is what&#39;s the risk if he does that and what&#39;s the risk in your mind like I know you&#39;ve got this very bullish attitude of saying just fuck it leave these people aside but there&#39;s political risk here we don&#39;t really know how big this coalition to the right is. Talk to me about, in a reasonable sense or practical sense, how you would do this by minimizing the risk and perhaps by minimizing the growth of this right-wing faction of his party more and more so that he&#39;s not chopping off a significant portion of his party when he just says, fuck it, I&#39;m going to do it.</span>

I usually like to leave you guys when we close the segment off with a more specific question, but I&#39;m going to perhaps ask the most general question I have thus far, the most high-level question. And Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. What does leadership look like for Aaron O&#39;Toole after this? And I don&#39;t mean his leadership, but what does he do to demonstrate leadership? Because there&#39;s a few lanes he can pick in the sense of, OK, moderate or not. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s picked moderate. Aggressive or not. Both of you are saying aggressive. aggressive there&#39;s also a third choice that he has to make which is statesman like or you know like pugilist fighter uh and and we&#39;re not really clear on either of those two so in your mind what is the the the triangulation of the Aaron O&#39;Toole leadership look like to you we&#39;ve already kind of selected a few things off of the choose your own menu of what it looks like what are a few other factors you&#39;d like to see now knowing the first couple of things run an aggressive moderate moderate strategy. Carter, what else do you want to see from this guy? Or what else do you think he needs to do, maybe more particularly, to be able to have a path to victory in that column of a Khrushchev or an Obama or a Trudeau and not that former column of some of the failed liberal leaders that Corey mentioned earlier?</span>

I think that that issue that he would stand up and say, we have to do the thing that is going to be hard work. We&#39;re going to lift the economy. We&#39;re going to focus on the economy. And that&#39;s why Canadians elect Conservatives, is when they feel like they need to focus on the economic output of our country, they elect Conservatives. I want to run on that and I want to win on that. And it bridges across social conservatism and centrism. So he could do that. But then he has to say, well, what do I have to do to get myself to focus on that?</span>

If you are on the right, how much do you love flying into JFK? Ultimately, it&#39;s just something that we all have to deal with. Political leaders from various stripes get these airports named after them and move on. Who cares? Who cares that it&#39;s called Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport?
