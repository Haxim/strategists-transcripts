Stephen and Shannon break down what all of this means for Alberta separatism, NATO, and the future of Canadian sovereignty. Can Canada expand trade without selling out workers and Ontario auto jobs? Are Chinese EVs actually &#34;spy cars,&#34; or is America now the bigger security risk? And if Carter is convinced he’ll need his bug-out plan, is that the strongest argument that we won’t? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;You can also watch our episodes on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

They break down the math behind the new 177,000-signature threshold, the organizational reality facing separatist groups, and why last summer&#39;s &#34;Forever Canadian&#34; petition may have been lightning in a bottle rather than a new normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What political price does the UCP pay for flirting with separatism? Do pro-Canada forces need to organize again, or is ignoring the petition the smartest strategy? And if this thing somehow makes it to a referendum, which of the three hosts is least emotionally prepared to live through the campaign without yelling at strangers on the internet?

They break down why &#34;Mayor Jeromy&#39;s&#34; response is actually working, and how tone and authenticity matter more than polish. What does good crisis communication look like when everyone is tuned out? How do you keep people conserving water without panic, spin, or scapegoating? And should Carter be allowed to name-and-shame entire neighbourhoods while creeping on his new neighbours&#39; dog-walking habits?

Is this actually a problem for Danielle Smith or just another data point in a noisy political moment? What should we actually take from the Alberta Next panel? Signal? Noise?
