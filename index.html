        <div class="meta">January 26</div>
      
      
        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss a federal stress test unfolding on two fronts: The killing of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents and open U.S. interference in Alberta's separatism debate. What happens when American political actors start shaping domestic politics? Why isn't there a more serious political pushback in the US after another fatal federal law enforcement shooting? And is anyone even pretending this is normal anymore?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p>Audio excerpt from "Unless You Are Free" by Ani DiFranco &amp; Utah Phillips (Fellow Workers, Righteous Babe Records)</p><p></p></div>

        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss Mark Carney’s Davos speech and why it cut through the global noise.

        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dive into Canada’s new world order as Mark Carney cuts a landmark trade deal with China and openly acknowledges that Washington is no longer a reliable partner. Stephen and Shannon break down what all of this means for Alberta separatism, NATO, and the future of Canadian sovereignty. Can Canada expand trade without selling out workers and Ontario auto jobs? Are Chinese EVs actually "spy cars," or is America now the bigger security risk? And if Carter is convinced he’ll need his bug-out plan, is that the strongest argument that we won’t? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p style="text-align: left;">You can also watch our episodes on YouTube.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod</a></p></div>

        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dig into Alberta's latest separatist referendum push and ask the two questions that actually matter: is it inevitable, and is it likely? They break down the math behind the new 177,000-signature threshold, the organizational reality facing separatist groups, and why last summer's "Forever Canadian" petition may have been lightning in a bottle rather than a new normal.</p><p>What political price does the UCP pay for flirting with separatism? Do pro-Canada forces need to organize again, or is ignoring the petition the smartest strategy? And if this thing somehow makes it to a referendum, which of the three hosts is least emotionally prepared to live through the campaign without yelling at strangers on the internet?

        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dive into Calgary's latest water main break and what it reveals about crisis communications, political leadership, and governing in an attention economy. They break down why "Mayor Jeromy's" response is actually working, and how tone and authenticity matter more than polish. What does good crisis communication look like when everyone is tuned out? How do you keep people conserving water without panic, spin, or scapegoating? And should Carter be allowed to name-and-shame entire neighbourhoods while creeping on his new neighbours' dog-walking habits?

        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips talk about Rebecca Schulz’s sudden resignation from cabinet and what it signals about unity inside the UCP, and the country. They dive into the subtext of the resignation letter, whether this is about an oncoming referendum or possibly even an early election. Is this actually a problem for Danielle Smith or just another data point in a noisy political moment? What should we actually take from the Alberta Next panel? Signal? Noise? Or a roadmap to bigger trouble? And will Carter’s MP return his calls about getting his toilet to flush?

        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dig into the Conservatives' pipeline motion, the Liberal response, and why Ottawa is spending its time debating make-believe infrastructure. What's the real strategy behind a motion about a pipeline that doesn't exist? How should the Liberals handle a fight built entirely on hypotheticals?
