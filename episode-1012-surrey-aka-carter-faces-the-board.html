So the February through till April 2022 section, where we hadn&#39;t launched, we were just in the pre-components. And this is where I think I made several of the more challenging mistakes. mistakes. So first mistake, and I&#39;ll start with that. I&#39;ll start with mistakes. The first mistake was, I believe that initially coming in, I thought we&#39;re going to do a strong incumbent model. Mayor McCallum was in place. He was going to run. He had name recognition, very similar to Justin Trudeau and John Horgan. So I thought, here we go. It&#39;s going to be a strong incumbent model, but he was polling below 10%. He had such high negatives. I thought for sure this was not going going to be a strong incumbent model. And I think that ultimately that was the first mistake because it ultimately was a strong incumbent model. People moved to the incumbent afterwards at the very, very end. And I probably should have beaten the car out of them in the beginning. The second mistake was to dismiss</span>

I think you guys will probably take me through that a little bit. It forced our hands on the RCMP issue, which ironically we&#39;re going through here in Alberta with the dismissing the RCMP for a provincial police force. Well, the good people of Surrey have gone through it and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it. so far. So, um, keeping the RCMP is, uh, not going to happen, but, uh, it was pretty interesting to see it. Uh, and finally, I think the last mistake was when we decided, um, to wait out, wait until June to announce, um, that was a significant mistake. Um, we should have launched in March. Uh, that&#39;s when I pressed to March to launch, but the candidate is sitting MLA and</span>

I think this country is very inept at talking about class issues, talking about class issues in particular between and within communities that they look at homogenous. There&#39;s a difference between a upper middle class Punjabi person and a Punjabi person in Surrey who&#39;s arrived here six months ago and is trying to get their foothold in the country. Those are two wildly different people, despite the fact that to the naked eye, they might look the same, to say crassly. And I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a mistake you made, because this is a bit of a soapbox-y sort of comment, but when you make that diversity comment, it once again sands down the diversity, ironically,</span>

And now I&#39;m starting, you know, now I&#39;m cutting things out of the spend right before I was moving them. I was saying, okay, we&#39;re not going to do a, we&#39;ll not, we&#39;re not going to do a big June out of home campaign. Instead we&#39;ll do a, we&#39;ll do a September out of home count.

Everybody&#39;s saying that they won&#39;t give until September. And then we hit September and then we hit the start of the RIT. And by the time you hit the start of the RIT, you&#39;ve now missed six months of fundraising totals. You You will not make it up in the four weeks that are left.

            <span class="text">Corey, round us out here. I&#39;m going to do a quick summary before we do. We talked about Carter&#39;s mistake on the incumbent. We talked about the one issue candidate, how he confused, Carter, you feel like one of the mistakes was confusing the brand promise with the key issue. Also talked about how maybe good on problem definition, maybe not so great on the proposition that your candidate was the solution to that problem by extension of the ballot box. We didn&#39;t talk too much about the slate, but you didn&#39;t necessarily think it was a weakness. We talked about the late launch, which kind of compressed things, deferred things, things, the budget compounded on those problems. You said the events generally went well outside of a few weaknesses. You talked about campaign staffing. Then we talked a bit about overall structure. And we talked about one of the things you started us out with, which is this concept of the three or four word key message. And then through there, we kind of through-lined a lot of conversation in regards to, were you lying to yourself? Was that a good thing? Was that a bad thing uh what happened there um which kind of brought us into to some lessons for the candidate the team the voter we rounded out with money cory you know finish us off we could spend four hours on this thing we haven&#39;t touched every nook and cranny of this document which is why we want to post it but cory final question run us out here yeah</span>
