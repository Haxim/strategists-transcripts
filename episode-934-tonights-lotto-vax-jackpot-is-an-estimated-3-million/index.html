        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Alberta government introducing $3 million of cash incentives for vaccination plus Justin Trudeau trying real hard to make being the dean of the G7 a thing. Is paying people to get vaccinated a good idea? Why would Trudeau want to be a leader of the G7 anyhow? And was the lightning round the longest segment? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

And since the majority of Albertans have had vaccinations, the majority of the audience looking at that video from the premier&#39;s office would be thinking, okay, what about us? And so it was a bit of a miss to have that lack of clarity and suggest that perhaps it was only available – honestly, maybe the plan originally was only for people within seven days, and there was such a sharp media backlash, they quickly revised. Or maybe it was the plan all along.

Many states are leaning towards lotteries outside of the few novel jabs for joints or burgers or whatever program. In terms of sizable action, it&#39;s become lotteries, even in the face of outright cash payments for getting a dose or 50 bucks or 100 bucks in certain areas. Talk to me about creativity.

But there&#39;s now been efforts to brand Justin Trudeau as the dean, quote unquote, of the the G7. He&#39;s been offering his services to help the U.K. and E.U. on trade dispute issues. He&#39;s been successfully assigned by Boris Johnson to lead high stakes discussions on China, a country that, let&#39;s just say, does not like him. I want to talk to you about the political strategy of this.

Now, it&#39;s interesting because six years to become an elder statesman, not even six years, right? We&#39;re at five and change. That&#39;s probably pushing the definition of elder statesman a bit. I think it would be a much different situation if he had been prime minister for 12 years, 13 years, people would actually look to him for what was going on around here. But the suggestion that the guy who&#39;s been there for six years is carrying all of the knowledge, especially the six years that they were, is a bit unlikely. And I was kind of a little embarrassed as a Canadian to hear that there was a bit of a push to, for example, intervene being in in kind of uk uh eu conversations it&#39;s like all right uh that&#39;s in theory something that we could be doing as a country but in in practice that&#39;s we&#39;re not the people you&#39;re going to be turning to right now and um it just also more than anything just tells you the turnover at the g7 lately how how quickly it&#39;s been it reminds me of how i don&#39;t know not even three years into to being the deputy of communications in Alberta, I was the dean of the deputies of communications across the country. It didn&#39;t mean anything. It just meant there was a lot of crazy turnover. And that&#39;s more how he&#39;s ended up in this position. So I certainly wouldn&#39;t be, I</div>

I think that it looked like a, you know, it looked weak, frankly. you know it doesn&#39;t look strong when you know you appear to be asking to lead leadership is something that is thrust upon you not something that you ask to do and if the other G7 nations wanted him to be the leader he&#39;d be the leader he wouldn&#39;t have to talk about it people would be writing articles of all the great things he&#39;s done how you know Boris Johnson invited him into these problems how the issue of Brexit could still be discussed and Justin Trudeau alone has the answers or you know what that little israel palestine issue that continues to dog uh the world you know justin trudeau would be invited in he&#39;s not being invited into anywhere he&#39;s not being invited in to you know to to uh discuss</div>

Like, there seemed to be at least a back channel or a media relations effort to be like, you&#39;re a new leader, right? Like, just nudging it along, being like, oh, just by the way, Angela&#39;s leaving, you know, Trudeau. And it seems to be rebuked, like, largely. Like, people off the record, senior officials to other leaders are saying, nope, that&#39;s not happening. That&#39;s not who we look to for moral or other types of leadership at this international stage. age.

          <div class="said">You know what? I think it actually could have been fine domestic positioning if he hadn&#39;t actually done anything at the G7. Now, that might sound a little counterintuitive, but the fact that he attempted it and he failed is what could potentially come and bite him. If it had just been a conversation that was more to the Canadian media when he was back in Canada, like, well, you know, Justin Trudeau is now the longest there. That actually is something that you can take as almost a bit of a soundbite. And it also reinforces the notion of stability and this can move forward, which is not so unhelpful for you as you start talking about a post-COVID world, really depending on what your election platform is. Strangely, I&#39;m not sure stability is really in line with this notion that it&#39;s the moment to change the future for the better, quote unquote, right? That said, the minute you kind of throw Throw that out there and somebody says, thanks, no thanks, you&#39;re done. It&#39;s toast. You can&#39;t, you know, it now becomes almost the other thing.

Overrated or underrated, the political strategy of Jagmeet Singh demanding Justin Trudeau drop the legal battle against First Nations children and survivors of residential schools. You know, he is seeming to have a a decent week, making some upticks in the polls, making that impassioned speech in London on the heels of the tragic death of four members of a Muslim family. So he&#39;s also kind of gaining some speed here and some traction on this. But on the political strategy, and I hate to kind of make it so crass, but that&#39;s what we talk about here, overrated, underrated, him asking the prime minister to drop the legal battle against First Nations children and survivors.</div>

But sometimes governments just need to act morally and let the chips fall where they may. So in addition to it being good, I think it also is a bit of a subtle reminder that Justin Trudeau came in in 2015 talking</div>

You&#39;re going to hopefully get to be propping up a minority government and therefore having a lot of power. So you can make demands like this. You know, you can make demands that the government of Canada stop fighting this. I&#39;m not sure that in the practicalities of governance, the government of Canada can just simply walk away from this lawsuit. So I think that I have to look at it from both sides. I think for him, it&#39;s probably a wise political play, because he doesn&#39;t have to worry about ever being the government. Corey&#39;s made this distinction a couple of times when we&#39;ve been talking about O&#39;Toole and his relationship with China, right? If you think you&#39;re going to be the prime minister, you have to be careful about what you&#39;re saying about China.

I know that&#39;s such an elementary question, but, you know, they say that you play a bit freer when you know that you&#39;re not necessarily going to reach a certain land, but you&#39;re in it for a very specific reason, which is, you know, to maintain the balance of power, to, you know, try to get the policy wins that you can and force the government to do. Do you feel like that there may have been a sense of acknowledgement, even on an internal basis? I know we can never know from Jagmeet Singh that he may not be playing for the top, but certainly could be playing for a very different prize?</div>

          <div class="said">think, sadly, it&#39;s overrated. I think that we have the collective attention span of Nats and remembering his votes in that particular era. I mean, of course, the media will dig them up. They&#39;ll make him say something to it. But I believe Michelle Rempel-Garner today apologized for some of their earlier positions vis-a-vis the cultural hotline and a couple of other hot-button issues that the Conservatives have taken to try and win over votes, primarily in Quebec, that never materialized. So apologizing for something that didn&#39;t work seems to make sense. But, you know, I just don&#39;t think that this is going to be the defining moment for O&#39;Toole that maybe Trudeau and team would want. I think that we&#39;re still getting to know O&#39;Toole and the past behaviors, the past votes aren&#39;t going to be as meaningful as his current behavior. And maybe I&#39;m misremembering, but I don&#39;t remember past votes ever being a thing that just absolutely haunted someone. You know, did Dion vote on something that really branded him? No, he was branded by his actions. And Ignatieff, you know, there were no votes to be branded on. He was branded on that returning to Calgary or returning to Canada.

It was also then collecting data about hate crimes and conducting needs assessments and impacted communities and a bunch of other things. And I think you can make a conservative case that, yes, absolutely, we condemn Islamophobia, but we weren&#39;t looking to – like, I&#39;d have to go through the motion again and understand it. But I&#39;ll bet you anything you can find a kind of a principled conservative reason that would say this is why we didn&#39;t support it, because I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t vote for it in the first place.
