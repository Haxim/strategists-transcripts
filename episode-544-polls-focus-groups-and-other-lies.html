        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the last week in federal politics. Did Tom Mulcair's decade old man-crush on Margaret Thatcher hurt him? Are the media on an anti-Conservative vendetta? And what does Stephen Carter REALLY think about the focus group that rated the Trudeau ad a winner? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

We could almost say verbatim, I do not accept the premise of the question, and then goes on with his two or three lines that he&#39;s been giving for months now. Now, what do you guys make of that as a response? And as strategists who construct media lines, how do you rank that particular media line for Harper, considering it&#39;s pretty definitive?

It&#39;s not your job to fill in the whole story for the media. And in fact, a lot of the time where spokespeople on campaigns, novice spokespeople get into trouble is they start to assume why people did certain things. Don&#39;t tell them things that you&#39;re assuming. Don&#39;t tell them more than the question asks. You</div>

It used to take 3,000 phone calls to fill 1,000 responses on a poll. Now it takes someone in the neighborhood of 27 to 30,000 phone calls to fill that same 1,000 people. So you&#39;re getting a sampling structure problem. The law of large numbers indicates that the 29,000 people who didn&#39;t answer the phone call or didn&#39;t have have time for it, have more commonality or more common traits than the thousand people who did.</div>
