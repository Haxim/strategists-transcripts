            <span class="text">mean, sort of. Elon Musk has wanted to create X.com since his PayPal days. In fact, it&#39;s part of why he was ousted from PayPal. And he actually created or he sold or I don&#39;t know, like it was restructured in a way that X has owned Twitter since the spring. This is not actually new at this point. But the idea is Elon wants to turn Twitter into the everything app, what essentially is WeChat for Chinese speaking populations, where you can send money, you can buy things, you can talk to people, you engage with the world, you can subscribe. It&#39;s this everything app that he&#39;s talked about for decades at this point. He would like to create it. But unfortunately, he can&#39;t even maintain the app that he has right now that does like one of those 12 things. So is this for real is an interesting question when you look at it through that. Is the concept for real? Yeah. Will the execution match his aspirations? 100% no.</span>

And I think what Twitter is going to face is not a moment where we all decide en masse, it&#39;s all threads and we&#39;re never going to use anything else. I think it&#39;s going to be the slow loss of our interest. We&#39;re just going to slip away from Twitter. And it&#39;s funny because I&#39;m not even doing what Stephen&#39;s doing. I&#39;m not taking like some time away. I&#39;m not stepping off to another primary platform or anything like that but i was talking to my wife today and she asked me something about some of thing and i said i don&#39;t know i haven&#39;t really been on twitter for the past few days and it&#39;s been a long time since i&#39;ve been able to say i don&#39;t know i haven&#39;t been on twitter for</span>

            <span class="text">the thing is he it will live as long as he wants it to live but it doesn&#39;t make money right now it didn&#39;t make money when he bought it and And now it has debt financing and it&#39;s advertising revenue by all accounts has gone down and Twitter Blue, his subscription service has not really worked. But when you&#39;re the world&#39;s richest man, you can keep digging that hole as long as you want to. You can create X, just to bring it back to your original question. You can try to create the app of everything. And you can do that as a fantasy where you&#39;re not really taking any serious steps towards it, or he could drop another $10 billion dollars into this bloody app if he wants to it&#39;s all available to him with that kind of money so when does twitter go down twitter goes down when he he loses interest or he just can&#39;t take another body blow on this particular one could be economic could be emotional the way that he keeps getting his ass kicked in the court of public opinion but you know twitter will live or die based on elon musk&#39;s whims um it and it will gradually be less relevant for the rest of us as you know will those two lines cross who knows carter</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;re gonna leave that segment there and move on to our next segment our next segment is called a tiny little shack um so i don&#39;t know if you guys saw this at a recent press conference about housing costs uh pierre polyev illustrated an argument about canada&#39;s high housing market he did this by giving out a physical address for a home on the canadian side of Niagara Falls. He said, you know, the house is a $550,000 house and it&#39;s a tiny little shack. And he invited reporters to check it out. So they did. Reporters went to this house, three bedroom, two bathroom, 1.5 story home. And the renter living there, she was not like super happy. She said it was pretty embarrassing that the leader called her home a shack. It was her house. She liked it. She said, it&#39;s not the greatest house on the street. It&#39;s definitely not a shack. And I think kind of in the circles I saw and where this came up is others who live in similar homes like hers were also pretty offended.</span>

            <span class="text">So soon, Polyev was apologizing to the renter. I want to bring you guys in because there&#39;s a few things to pick part here. I want to talk about this, like the housing, and we&#39;ve talked about that before, but the housing strategy, kind of the idea of comparing the Canadian side to the American side, and then also the strategy of like giving out an address and saying go check it out and then reporters do that so why don&#39;t we uh we&#39;ll jump in carter what are what are just kind of your your initial take on the situation before we really dive in well</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i think that it&#39;s really bad political instincts i&#39;m sure that the owner of the house gave them permission to do what they did but i&#39;m sure the thought never crossed their mind that there would be an occupant i&#39;m not even sure I like the word renter in this situation. I mean, houses aren&#39;t just occupied by people who own. And the only people who, you know, the people who matter in these equations aren&#39;t just the owners. The market is also, the way that conservatives have taken this thing on just confuses me altogether. I think this is a really important issue. And instead of trying to point They don&#39;t point out what the solutions are or what they would do. They just continually point out the problems. And I really struggle with that type of political instinct that says, look how bad this thing is. And there&#39;s no solution presented. And then, you know, the political instinct of calling something a shack where, frankly, a lot of Canadians live in a, you know, Corey and I live in the inner city. You live in the relative inner city. There&#39;d be lots of people who I think would point at our living situations, not Corey&#39;s because his mansion,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I don&#39;t feel the same way, Stephen. And I do think Pierre Polyev has explained what he thinks the solutions to this particular challenge are. I also believe this is a challenge and it is a existential one for an entire generation of Canadians who are entirely priced out of home ownership unless they happen to have really good lines of credit with the bank of mom and dad. Right. And that&#39;s really troubling for me because that&#39;s how wealth becomes entrenched in just a few people&#39;s hands and not a lot of people&#39;s hands. And that, you know, that&#39;s something that politicians need to wrestle with, because removing the dream of homeownership from a generation is not a good idea. And by the way,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I know people can say, yes, well, renting is an option. Yes, of course, renting is an option. But renting is also becoming increasingly unattainable, just because these things do tend to trickle down. and ultimately it becomes about the cost of literally living like where you&#39;re going to live and and how challenging this is so um you know he he did what politicians do he tried to make a point he tried to illustrate a point by using an example and it was it was pretty callous because of course there was a occupant there i think in general when you&#39;re casting dispersions on a house house that somebody has lived in, does live in, could live in a house like it, you&#39;re probably on some pretty shaky ground if you happen to be a politician. Because I&#39;m sure there were a lot of people who said, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But I think, you know, this is something that politicians struggle to do, to maintain relevance for a particular issue. They try to create hooks and they try to do that with stories. And I&#39;m sure this was just like on a list of summer things to do. Let&#39;s find an example of a house in Canada that seems overpriced in a competitive environment where we want to be politically relevant. And let&#39;s make the point. And Southwestern Ontario seems like a pretty good one because right across the border, very close, you do have much more affordable housing.</span>

            <span class="text">All of that said, I do want to point out something obvious here which is there is another way to read the fact that a house in canada is worth an awful lot more than a house in the united states and that&#39;s that it&#39;s a lot more desirable to live in these environments than it is to live in the united states i</span>

Let&#39;s compare Vancouver and the lower mainland to San Francisco. There&#39;s all kinds of places in the United States that have unbelievable housing markets that are pricing out its residents.

            <span class="text">It&#39;s not an insane comparison to say this country that is very like us in the same geography has much more affordable housing. That said, I think that the way the point actually gets made is by talking about things things that actually lead to your policy solutions, right? And the thing is, I don&#39;t know a thing about the housing market in upstate New York, but I am guessing because it&#39;s in New York, that it&#39;s not an incredibly affordable place on account of an incredible lack of red tape and, you know, just this ability to build without any consideration of regulations or, you know, know, any zoning or any controls like that. So I don&#39;t think it actually lends itself to his policy solutions. And the comparisons, I think, were probably more readily available with, you know, frankly, markets in Texas, markets in Canada, like Calgary, where it is easier to get things built, or has been historically, that seems to be something that we are struggling with more recently here. But he has a suite of solutions. Those solutions include, you know, red</span>

            <span class="text">red tape productions, making it easier to build, so fewer zoning restrictions, and then ultimately reducing taxes and business costs on people who want to build as well. And if he could have pointed to a jurisdiction that did those things, and managed to make housing affordable, that would have been much more meaningful to me. And it wouldn&#39;t have had this mean spiritedness of picking on a quote unquote shack too. I think that there were ways that you could have gotten there. But again, Again, I&#39;m answering the question mostly because it was posed. I think it was a gaffe. I think it was not very considerate.

Do a comparison of where they were before and where they are now. That&#39;s a far more interesting, that&#39;s a far more interesting job, I think, than going across, you know, going across the border and saying, look, they&#39;re doing a great job. Corey made a good point, which again, pains me, pains me. But Corey, if he had found a place that is building housing faster because of the lack of regulations, then he could have pointed to that and said, that&#39;s a part of our solution if he can&#39;t find that place then he can still make the case or you know like talk about jurisdictions where they are allowing that i don&#39;t know that there are a lot of jurisdictions because nimby is pretty engrossed and pretty um steadfast</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, look, he is going to use a country to country comparison because he&#39;s trying to lead a country and he&#39;s trying to say this country could be doing things differently. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s insane that he did that again. You know, he&#39;s not running to be premier of somewhere, so he&#39;s not going to compare to another province. It makes sense that you would take a reference for another country that Canadians will understand and they&#39;re going to understand upstate new york that none of that is problematic in my point of view and actually it&#39;s some pretty good questions to ask right like what is so fundamentally different here and why did things get so out of control here versus there is buffalo the same no of course not right but uh you know you have some opportunities to uh to at least tell a bit of a story about national policy which is what national leaders try to do nationwide. So like, not a big problem with that. I agree that it was a bit of a thoughtless, careless hit. And he should have considered how people might feel about a house like that being called a shack. And it is like an interesting tension in communications that I think is worth calling out.</span>

I mean, that&#39;s an interesting question, because I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever sat and developed a communication strategy that&#39;s been like, this is how I know journalists live, right? So I&#39;m going to put it in this way, because I feel like it will have more resonance with them. And maybe I should do that more, because frankly, they&#39;re people, and it&#39;s an interesting filter role that they serve, and they can&#39;t help but feel things. And you put something like that forward that&#39;s deeply relevant to them, they&#39;re going to kind of feel that deep relevance. Um, but yeah, I think that when you&#39;ve got an issue that people are just sort of feeling, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it is more likely that journalists are going to leap on it and stay on it because they&#39;re more likely to be having those feelings themselves, you know, whether that be, you know, concerns</span>

            <span class="text">concerns about the education system, if they happen to have children or, you know, crime in a neighborhood, they happen to live in that neighborhood. I can think of a ton of near autobiographical columns and stories where people have written about something that&#39;s of interest to them. And, you know, my sense is the minute a journalist feels like that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing, like you&#39;re doomed, like they&#39;re going to run the other way out of a sense of integrity. But certainly it can help propel the story a bit further.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we have, I mean, this is one of the things that I&#39;ve done in politics for a long time. I mean, I&#39;ve long, like, one of the strategies around media relations for Nenshi&#39;s campaign was the idea that there would be this movement to fairness, right? Right. We knew that journalists weren&#39;t just going to accept that there was only two leading candidates. They were going to have to bring in and upstart a challenger in order to fulfill their own sense of fairness. Right. They had to cover at least one more. And that&#39;s why we focus so much of our attention on becoming the third place candidate in in that race by September the 1st. I mean, really, our entire campaign was predicated on that versus trying to win at some later date.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So if you understand that journalists are, in fact, real people and they do live in the same situations and they are facing the same problems, I mean, one can look at the journalists who are covering COVID. I mean, there was a tremendous amount of semi-autobiographical kind of reporting that was going on there because there were pressures that all of us were feeling, that journalists were feeling as well. whether it was just something as simple as you know all of a sudden now they&#39;re working from home and that&#39;s a confusing environment or if it was more um you</span>

Now, if I had said, oh, but I know the neighborhood she lives in. And I know she likes to walk her dog to this park. And I said, oh, just to use like the extreme example, the other way, hey, this thing&#39;s going on with this park. And I know you like to take your dog there.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">find and i would say this now in my role where i do a lot of media relations like reporters especially in today&#39;s environment where in a market like calgary there&#39;s so few reporters it&#39;s just like cut after cut after cut and they&#39;re doing so many stories a day they really like you can get them more into stories about things that they&#39;re interested in and</span>

            <span class="text">and so pitching that way and And I found that when I was a reporter, too, like if someone was like, hey, I&#39;ve got this pitch about something outside and it means you get to leave the office for a day and like go on a field trip. I&#39;m like, hey, Tony, do I have a story idea for you? Right. And so I think I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s an interesting question. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s black and white. And like if someone was like, hey, I&#39;ve got this story for you and Che because it&#39;s a block from your house, I&#39;d be like, OK, we&#39;re not talking. That&#39;s creepy.

And it&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s not just inflationary affordability anymore. It&#39;s this crazy home market affordability that is everybody&#39;s real life. Everybody needs a place to stay. And it manifests itself in so many different ways. So you can cover, there&#39;s like a million different stories around housing, a million different avenues. And one of the least interesting is actually affordable housing, in my mind. I think that there&#39;s way more interesting questions about housing and what it should be looking like, especially when you&#39;re factoring in climate change.</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, yeah, sure. Absolutely. It is really funny. I mean, it&#39;s one of these classic things in politics where you can intellectually unpack it and say, like, we live in hell. Like, what the fuck is this? So just to unpack that story in a different way. government was going to run an ad campaign government doesn&#39;t run an ad campaign many years later goes out on surplus becomes a pop culture meme premier says i need some of that don&#39;t air shine get that costume out uh which used to say never worn i wonder if they&#39;ve updated it now uh you know let&#39;s go to a street festival and hold hands with the don&#39;t air costume and just have a bunch of pictures taken then a bunch of meta commentary about that particular thing Like, holy</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">holy fuck. Like, what is this? Where are we? And why do we live in a world where a politician can legitimately expect a popularity bounce for walking hand in hand with a donair down the middle of the street? Like, come on, like, what are we doing here? but we do live in that world and it costs absolutely nothing and it&#39;s what everybody&#39;s talking about and the government owns it so why the hell not i mean i thought it was kind of a no-brainer it would be insane if they weren&#39;t thinking about how they got in on that particular story and one of the things in government communications and this this is more on the political side i&#39;m sure that drove this but in government communications one</span>

            <span class="text">one of the things you you are always trying to do is have your head on a swivel and say, what are the natural media hooks that are out there? What is everybody talking about? And what&#39;s our angle into this story? And when what everybody is talking about is a piece of government property, you have an angle into the story. You always do. So to me, it was just smart, smart government communications. Something was going on. You saw your way into it. And yeah, Yeah, not even that hard. So maybe smart is overly generous, but really workmanlike government communications and a no-brainer.</span>

I think that politicians that can laugh at themselves have a leg up on politicians that can&#39;t. I remember, you know, the glory days of this hour has 22 minutes, you know, and, you know, Mark Delahunty going in and talking to the prime minister. And, you know, those were great. It doesn&#39;t matter which prime minister it is. It doesn&#39;t matter who the politician is. When a person is able to sit down with the comedian and be part of the bit instead of being the subject of the bit, you&#39;re going to be in the bit, right? The</span>

And I, you know, So what it is, is essentially the fleet group will look at what&#39;s fair market value of it. They don&#39;t give you a deal. They basically give you Blue Book value or whatever. And it was super low, the Blue Book value. And I think I&#39;m remembering it properly, but he decided not to buy it. And he&#39;s like, I&#39;ll just wait for it to show up on government surplus. Nobody else is going to buy it. Like this car with over 150,000 kilometers, nobody&#39;s going to buy it.

And it&#39;s not to say people have to be the same all of the time. But, you know, I think lightness is great, but I want kind of a more legitimate light. Like, I think it&#39;s not about the lightness with the odd donair thing. I think it&#39;s the lightness to not think that your opponent is fucking Hitler, which is what everybody seems to think these days all of the time. Yeah,</span>

I think that, you know, the ability to be light in your skin all the time and to present yourself as we, you know, we used to call it authentic, but I think that the word authentic has been drummed out of any meaning by this point.

Yeah. Stephen Harper couldn&#39;t, I mean, everybody remembers, of course, that video where he like an alien&#39;s talking about how he too likes to watch movies on Netflix, right? You know, like, he just couldn&#39;t do stuff like that. But there were other times where he would, you know, play the piano at an event, right?

I spend that time looking up on my craft, playing with the new tools, you know, seeing what kind of like, you know, AI is a big thing right now, of course, but it might also be, you know, project management tools that are out there or things that allow you to be a better writer. And, you know, if you want to get better perpetually, you&#39;ve got to find the time to actually put into it and not sort of drift. And so, yeah, I&#39;ve been leaning heavy into mid-journey.
