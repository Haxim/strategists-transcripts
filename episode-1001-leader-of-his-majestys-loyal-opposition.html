          <p>Zain Velji is back in the chair, leading Stephen and Corey through a discussion about the consequences and strategic considerations around the Poilievre victory, the Green Party implosion and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Pierre Poilievre's overwhelming victory in the Conservative Party of Canada leadership and what effect the new King will have on our body politic. Should the Liberals be concerned about Poilievre? Is now a time to reconsider our relationship with the crown? And is The Strategists' soundboard the only thing less reliable than the Green Party of Canada? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We&#39;ve had enemy Paul. Of course, they they build her as the the leader that would make a breakthrough. And then, of course, as soon as she didn&#39;t make that breakthrough, they will by starving her of any resources or any sort of campaign strategy. They they turn on her. Elizabeth May said, listen, I don&#39;t want anything to do with it. She now is proposed to be a co-leader of the party. And now we&#39;ve got some other drama happening in the Green Party, Stephen Carter. I&#39;ll save the Green Party stuff for our final sort of segment or over under in our lightning round. But just quickly, your hot take on the Green Party as it stands right now, a hot topic on this podcast and one that I don&#39;t want to just shelve simply till the end, although that is when we&#39;ll discuss most of it.</div>

Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, we can say this was never a particularly competitive race. And we talked a bit about this as it was going on. We thought that the membership as it existed supported Pierre Polyev. Pierre Polyev sold the most memberships. This is in some ways not shocking, but the scope of it is. The idea that Jean Charest, who was seen as a credible candidate by many, including myself, not that I thought he was going to win per se this weekend, only got 16% of the points and, as you mentioned, only got the majority or plurality of the points in eight of the 338 ridings is pretty shocking.</div>

Any talk of a moderate conservative alternative, I think, has to be perceived as deaf, not just because of how Charest has acted since and said, we&#39;re going to stay a conservative and we all got to stick together, but also because, like,</div>

I have reams of data. that shows us that somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% of voters will make up their mind in the last 24 hours. How are they making their mind up in that moment? Yeah, sure. It could be outrage. We saw that with Lake of Fire when Danielle Smith did Lake of Fire and didn&#39;t respond to it. It took a while, but we did get to outrage. More often than not though, and this is what drives I think progressives absolutely crazy. It&#39;s not about the outrage. It&#39;s not about the very clear to them contrast between someone who&#39;s horrible and someone who&#39;s fantastic. Instead, it&#39;s about what do I get? What&#39;s</div>

So my recommendation, start giving the cookie. It&#39;s way easier to get people to vote for you when they want what you&#39;re offering.

Case in point, let me give you an example. One of the comments that&#39;s been circulating the last couple of days is that why doesn&#39;t the left or the liberals or some third party group just say, Pierre Polyev&#39;s a white supremacist, that he hangs out with white supremacists?

So you say white supremacist, yeah, that should be disqualifying. And those words have a lot of charge. But you do that three years out from an election, by the time the election comes, people are going to be somewhat numb to that charge. So when we talk about defining him at this time, it&#39;s making people feel things about him, but not salacious, shocking things, just things about his record right there. It&#39;s almost Pavlovian. You say Pierre, I say restricting a woman&#39;s right to choose. You say Polyev, I say it would kill childcare, universal childcare. childcare and so a lot of what your definition needs to be now is really around that um there&#39;s also a stream of work that is really about just wrong footing him over the next bit arrange some votes in the house of commons about canadian</div>

So I think a lot of other places in the world are going to be saying, we&#39;ve got to change this, or at least contemplating it. I think in Canada, a lot of Canadians are going to say, this is fucking weird. And is this actually what we&#39;re all about? And is this what Canada is? But we just don&#39;t have the ability to change it. And I do think it&#39;s an opportunity for us to be maybe a little less sad and a little more contemplative. I mean, the woman was 96.
