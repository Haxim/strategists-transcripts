            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so much hope for the green party somebody even say that you You know, he left at the right time because he doesn&#39;t want to know what happened with the Green Party this week, Carter, because we&#39;ve talked about the Green Party a lot. We&#39;ve had enemy Paul. Of course, they they build her as the the leader that would make a breakthrough. And then, of course, as soon as she didn&#39;t make that breakthrough, they will by starving her of any resources or any sort of campaign strategy. They they turn on her. Elizabeth May said, listen, I don&#39;t want anything to do with it. She now is proposed to be a co-leader of the party. And now we&#39;ve got some other drama happening in the Green Party, Stephen Carter. I&#39;ll save the Green Party stuff for our final sort of segment or over under in our lightning round. But just quickly, your hot take on the Green Party as it stands right now, a hot topic on this podcast and one that I don&#39;t want to just shelve simply till the end, although that is when we&#39;ll discuss most of it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">steven carter pierre polly ever over the weekend at the shock convention center in in ottawa has taken the reins of the conservative party huge victory carter i think there&#39;s no other way to put it um And we have Pure Poly Ever obviously getting a certain percentage of the vote. We can discuss that in a second here. But the stat I want to focus on, Carter, may not be the one you want to focus on because you&#39;ll probably get back into your prediction game.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">of the 338 ridings going to Pure Poly Ever. Have we seen anything like this before? for? Start here for us in terms of perhaps a bit of campaign history or how to analyze</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">analyze the dominance that the Polyev campaign showed here. And then we&#39;ll get into some of the strategy questions going forward.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Off the top of my head, and I didn&#39;t do any research into this, but off the top of my head, I can think of only one person who had this kind of dominance. And that&#39;s Justin Trudeau in the Liberal Party and the dominance that he brought forward. I think that he would have won a similar number of seats against or uh of ridings against martha hall finley one would think given that i worked on martha&#39;s campaign that i would remember it better but i have compartmentalized that sucker away um so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so you know the i wonder why the truth is why</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know i mean pierre did it uh justin&#39;s done it they&#39;re both they&#39;re both juggernauts um Um, uh, the difference is that Pierre&#39;s, you know, ascension is happening now. And, uh, Justin&#39;s happened what,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">what, uh, eight years ago now, seven, eight years ago. Like it, it, it&#39;s a long time. So it&#39;s a very long time into, in the political environment.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what sticks out to you in the, in the Paglia victory? Is it the margin of victory? Is it, as I mentioned, the seats right now, uh, or the writings I should say, um, not the seats, the writings that he had shared dominance over. Is it the charade number? and how low it was, winning only eight out of the 330. What kind of sticks out to you when you see the results and now the data from Saturday&#39;s results?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s hard not to just be awed a bit by that top-line number. Carter&#39;s right. It&#39;s kind of not usually seen in a contest that is seen as competitive. Obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, we can say this was never a particularly competitive race. And we talked a bit about this as it was going on. We thought that the membership as it existed supported Pierre Polyev. Pierre Polyev sold the most memberships. This is in some ways not shocking, but the scope of it is. The idea that Jean Charest, who was seen as a credible candidate by many, including myself, not that I thought he was going to win per se this weekend, only got 16% of the points and, as you mentioned, only got the majority or plurality of the points in eight of the 338 ridings is pretty shocking.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">shocking. And so the overwhelming victory doesn&#39;t leave Pierre Polyev&#39;s critics a lot of places to go. There&#39;s not a lot of natural homes. Any talk of a moderate conservative alternative, I think, has to be perceived as deaf, not just because of how Charest has acted since and said, we&#39;re going to stay a conservative and we all got to stick together, but also because, like,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like, what would you do with that? You&#39;ve got the points that represent 15</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

But at the end of the day, Carter, this kind of seemed like a coronation disguised as a contest in the sense that the winner got a very large, strong mandate, but they also got to road test a lot of things and kind of make some headway to the gen pop. Do you agree with that? And do you kind of see that as kind of they had their cake and eat it too? How do you kind of see this as the frame of that question as a benefit or not so much for the Conservative Party and where they stand right now?

The soul searching was pretty modest and pretty canned at the end of the day. But I want to say that the size of this victory tells us exactly one thing, and it&#39;s an important thing, but it tells us exactly one thing, and that&#39;s the hold that Polyev has over the Conservative Party of Canada. It does not mean he will win a general election. However, that hold he has over the Conservative Party is something that his two predecessors did not have, and</span>

So, if you go in with a strong party, one that&#39;s not biting your back as you&#39;re moving into it, does that potentially offer you just that little bit extra you need to get to government? Well, you know, I would say even on its surface, maybe. You also have got a Trudeau government that&#39;s looking a little bit more tired by the day. Of</span>

And I think for a lot of people, they&#39;re seeing that as perhaps the soft spot, the soft tissue in pure polyeth. Would you agree, Carter, that this guy&#39;s got these two different wavelengths he&#39;s operating? Or do you see it the other way, saying that, no, this guy actually has the flexibility to operate in two different wavelengths and own both of them at the same time, and they&#39;re in his coalition?

We liked how it was. Remember that? How it was was pretty damn sweet.

It&#39;s got to be my change versus some other type of change because the status quo no longer exists. That&#39;s something that needs to be defined hard and fast by the prime minister. There is no going back to the world Pierre Polyev&#39;s trying to sell you here. Look at what&#39;s going on in Europe right now with Ukraine. Look at how solar and wind are about to take over all of these other energy sources in the United States. This world is changing. There&#39;s no going back. So which forward do you want? Do you want a forward that&#39;s inclusive and brings everybody along and is environmentally sustainable and leaves a future for our children? Or do you want this dystopian hellscape where everybody is on their own paying with cryptocurrency for the few things that they can afford in a world that&#39;s a total war with itself?

I have reams of data. that shows us that somewhere in the neighborhood of 80% of voters will make up their mind in the last 24 hours. How are they making their mind up in that moment? Yeah, sure. It could be outrage. We saw that with Lake of Fire when Danielle Smith did Lake of Fire and didn&#39;t respond to it. It took a while, but we did get to outrage. More often than not though, and this is what drives I think progressives absolutely crazy. It&#39;s not about the outrage. It&#39;s not about the very clear to them contrast between someone who&#39;s horrible and someone who&#39;s fantastic. Instead, it&#39;s about what do I get? What&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">What&#39;s the thing? Because the average voter oftentimes boils down to selfishness. And I think that progressives especially fall into the trap of trying to be holier than thou and not offering up the cookie, and instead only offering up the hard hard work that would enable them to get the cookie. So my recommendation, start giving the cookie. It&#39;s way easier to get people to vote for you when they want what you&#39;re offering. And I&#39;m not seeing a lot of that out of the progressive world.</span>

Case in point, let me give you an example. One of the comments that&#39;s been circulating the last couple of days is that why doesn&#39;t the left or the liberals or some third party group just say, Pierre Polyev&#39;s a white supremacist, that he hangs out with white supremacists? Shouldn&#39;t that be enough to just define this guy and get it over and done with?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think you need to be careful that when you&#39;re defining him, you&#39;re not doing it in a way that&#39;s just about shock value. Shock value diminishes over time. So you say white supremacist, yeah, that should be disqualifying. And those words have a lot of charge. But you do that three years out from an election, by the time the election comes, people are going to be somewhat numb to that charge. So when we talk about defining him at this time, it&#39;s making people feel things about him, but not salacious, shocking things, just things about his record right there. It&#39;s almost Pavlovian. You say Pierre, I say restricting a woman&#39;s right to choose. You say Polyev, I say it would kill childcare, universal childcare. childcare and so a lot of what your definition needs to be now is really around that um there&#39;s also a stream of work that is really about just wrong footing him over the next bit arrange some votes in the house of commons about canadian</span>
