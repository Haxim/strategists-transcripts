        <p>Part retrospective, part prediction episode, Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the campaign that was and the election day that will be. What do strategists do in the final days of a campaign? What do we make of the PC performance? And more importantly, will we stick by some of our earlier predictions? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
