Rachel Notley is back. She had a press conference this week. She said she&#39;s staying on as leader for now. I want to talk about what the strategy for the Alberta NDP is going forward. There&#39;s been a lot of speculation about leadership change and when and party policy and party name. But what I want to start is at a more fundamental level. I want to ask you guys, what are the right questions to be asking right now? Because the media environment is clearly focused on the questions that are big and existential. And you guys might lead me in that direction around party brand, party name, etc. But the questions I want to ask you to start with, Carter, are what are the questions the Alberta NDP should be asking themselves in this moment? Still off a loss, still trying to figure out who takes on certain critic roles, what their overall strategy is, heading into the summer, heading into the fall. So the question I want to ask you to start with, and maybe I&#39;ll give Stephen Carter the first shot at this and we can yes and it and build a list together, are what questions should the Alberta NDP be asking themselves right now, Carter?

            <span class="text">what a bonkers top of the list, like, how fucking crazy is that? But it&#39;s actually 100% correct, in a way, and I might have phrased it a bit differently. But, you know, I have said before, and I&#39;ll say again, one of the reasons why I think the NDP was successful in 2015, is because they didn&#39;t allow themselves to get distracted by the same things the Wild Rose got distracted by, the Liberals got distracted by, the Alberta Party got distracted by. And this was a time when all of those organizations were actually political parties with representation in the legislature and could conceivably have become something right but they were way into the existential stuff that i suspect we&#39;re going to get into in a minute and i suspect a lot of the ndp wants to get into and the ndp were pretty clear on who they were they were pretty clear on what they needed to do and they were fucking dressed and ready for the bus and one of the things that has been the ndp&#39;s great success in the past 10 years in my opinion is they know know when it&#39;s time to put their pants on. And so it would be a real shame if as part of thinking about what NDP 2.0 is or 3.0 or however you want to kind of number it, they lost that. So there is kind of a foundational readiness. We are an organization that exists to fight elections, and we need to maintain that readiness, particularly in times of, let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">let&#39;s call it political uncertainty being kind of the baseline in Alberta. They need to continue to maintain a a certain amount of readiness and so i actually agree with steven like i when he started talking i was about to jump down his throat but he&#39;s actually right the first thing they need to do as a foundation before they start thinking about everything else think about this as like maslow&#39;s hierarchy of political organization needs right they need to make sure that they maintain their viability as a political organization and they&#39;re ready no matter what comes so</span>

Do you have any sort of government in waiting for, exactly, but do you even need to play the government in waiting or like propositional element now that you&#39;re so so fresh off an election and you need to refill the bank?

And maybe I&#39;ll put one that&#39;s almost, fuck, you know, again, my hesitation on all of this is, I saw a lot of political parties for a long time in alberta sweat these things a lot when probably what mattered most of all is that they had a sense of mission and they were ready to go which is what the ndp had and so the ndp could very easily backslide here into kind of the classic opposition morass that i think defined this province&#39;s politics for a very very long time explain</span>

And it was all of these crazy schemes and all of these crazy things that ultimately didn&#39;t amount to a hill of beans, right? Because they weren&#39;t thinking about – they were thinking about electability in a way like you think of a game of risk. Like, well, if I just get this country and that country, then I can invade these other countries. But politics doesn&#39;t really work like that. Politics is really about stories. So I guess what I will say is, for me, it&#39;s actually less the philosophy and it&#39;s more the story that the NDP wants to tell. That&#39;s the important thing for me. And that, to me, is more important than brand. It&#39;s more important than leader at this point, assuming that leadership will just be a conversation that flows out of it. But if the NDP can resolve the question of the story that they want to tell about Alberta and Alberta&#39;s future, why they exist and why you want to vote for them, and that&#39;s not work that requires policy conventions. That&#39;s work that requires, you know, a strong hand at the till and like some directionality here. That, to me, that&#39;s</span>

Imagine a leadership contest right now with the NDP, where somebody is saying the problem is we didn&#39;t commit ourselves to our social democratic values. It says right in our constitution, our goal is democratic socialism. Did you even hear the word socialism during the conference? The reason we were successful in 2015 is because our job is to be there for the working person. And we lost sight of that. We came out of nowhere in 2015 because that was a platform that reflected a party committed to democratic socialism. And the last two elections, even though we faced these historically bad, historically unwelcoming to worker leaders, we instead went to the middle. That was a massive mistake. We betrayed who we were. And that&#39;s why we didn&#39;t see the success we saw in 2015. You&#39;re going to have people saying that. And</span>

            <span class="text">far other side, you&#39;re going to say the problem with the NDP right now is our commitment. You know, like we have not managed to get rid of the shackles of our previous commitments and our previous worldviews that were much narrower. Things like democratic socialism. We&#39;ve got to be a party that wants to be committed to the free market and the ideas of being almost like a PC-ish. That&#39;s not the words they would use. I was much more articulate on the other side, but they would find words like, we&#39;re going to be there and we&#39;re going to create prosperity for everybody. And the job of the NDP is prosperity through those market mechanisms that exist. And we get it. We don&#39;t deny economics. This is who we are as New Democrats. This is who we&#39;ve evolved to be. And it&#39;s our job, actually, if anything, to be more thoughtful and more reflective of that middle-of-the-road Alberta that is where the base of power in this province and this country sits, right?

Imagine that candidate on the right wins, and everybody on the left, you know, perhaps there&#39;s like 10 MLAs who agree with that position on the left. Maybe there&#39;s a standard bearer on the left. Well, now you&#39;ve created a very weird tension in your party. And the NDP have historically been a very solid party, right? Like without those tensions. And similarly, the other way around, and we haven&#39;t even layered on the public personas here, where let&#39;s just say you are that candidate in the center, which I&#39;m calling the candidate on the right of the NDP.

Talk to me about some of the hows. How do you do some of these things before you either, and I&#39;m speculating here, whether you kind of resign your post, whether you leave, whether you&#39;re kind of saying that, you know, it&#39;s time for a new leader.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">All right. Well, the first is George Washington&#39;s farewell address, where George Washington sort of defined his view as to what he thought were the concerns facing the United States. He wasn&#39;t running again after two terms as president. There was no rule in the U.S. Constitution. He</span>

            <span class="text">that everybody followed until FDR. And after that, they put in a constitutional amendment in the 50s, making it the law. But it used to just be a precedent. Somebody left after two terms as president. He talked about his concerns. You&#39;ll remember from the musical Hamilton, partisan infighting.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, exactly. Exactly. He was, you know, very leery of kind of foreign interference. He was, he was leery about a government that got too big. He spelled all these things out. He wrote this farewell address. And then he walked away. But because he was George Washington, the general who led the Continental Army, the guy who could have been a king, but decided to be a president of a republic and then step away. How remarkable that is, I think we forget, because it&#39;s now 2023. 23, but in, you know, the 1790s, how remarkable, or the 1780s, I guess, 1780s, 1790s, um,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so that&#39;s that in terms of anchoring effect, it&#39;s a psychological effect that the first thing put on the table tends to be the thing people react to. It&#39;s used a lot in bargaining, right? So the first offer, the second offer is going to be reacting to the first offer. And the whole conversation sort of revolves around that first to offer. The first thing people hear tends to be how they interpret everything else that comes after. And so by being the first to move, you&#39;ve got a very powerful way to anchor the conversation. And Rachel Notley could do that with her party.</span>

And then my follow-up question to both of you as we stay on story for a bit before I get to our list of adding to different things and different questions to ask. So Corey, you can think about this too. Is there anything else a leader can do to solidify directionality? So think about that question.

And you can do that through any number of means. One is kind of the open conversation model where you go around to each of the constituencies where you had a candidate and you meet with their executive and you talk to them about what were</span>

And if you want to have a more moderated one, where it&#39;s more about party loyalty and stalwarts, well, then delegates are your friend.

Again, Again, we&#39;ve been here already this episode, it needs to be said, your logo is not your brand, your name is not your brand. If you change the name now, and you are still the same organization, and I&#39;m going to continue on that same track, perhaps in the leadership contest, there is a big conversation about how the goal of the party is democratic socialism. And that&#39;s a big debate. And that&#39;s a debate now being held under the new name. That new name is tied to that conversation forever. But if that&#39;s a conversation that has had, and at the end of that leadership contest has decided to set aside that purpose in the party, well, isn&#39;t that rebrand the perfect way to kind of put the bow on that for the public and say, now we are a little bit different, right? If you even want to go there. And I&#39;m not convinced you need to go there. But my point is, you</span>

That is the last thing people should be thinking about right now. They need to be thinking about who they are, before they think about how they present themselves.

But that said, a lot of the time, optimal is not available to us, right? And you have to build in optionality.

And the first is to say, all right, all right, all right, all right. We got to, we got to clear some stuff off the table here. We got to, we got to un-muddy some waters. you might decide to leave, you might decide not to leave, right? But there are some things that will be common on both decision trees. Like you imagine if you decision tree them out and how they&#39;re going to act on caucus, how you&#39;re going to act on, you know, critic appointments, which I suppose could be part of caucus, how you&#39;re going to act in fundraising. And if you&#39;re going to act the same way on the leave and not leave paths in those areas, well, that&#39;s easy. Take it off the table. Then you know what you&#39;re doing there. That&#39;s super simple, right? And then you&#39;re left with a relatively small bucket of things that you have to decide what you&#39;re going to do with because you act differently depending on whether you&#39;re going to leave or not leave so things like your farewell address we were just talking about obviously</span>

That&#39;s the nature of strategy. You&#39;re working with constraints towards goals.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, and look what happened in the BC NDP, right? I mean, it was supposed to be a simple, easy handoff. You know, they&#39;re going to hand it off to David Eby. He gets himself all ready to go. Everybody else decides that they&#39;re going to stand down. They&#39;re not not going to challenge. And then out of the blue, out of the woodwork comes this candidate whose name escapes me, but she&#39;s from the environmental movement. The environmental movement has some strength. They&#39;re able to put forward a solid and compelling case as to why the BC NDP need to think about different priorities. And all of a sudden the BC NDP, in order to hold on to the party itself has to actually kill her candidacy, which make them look weak, made EB look weak, and it undermined the overall, you know, strength and direction of the party. It had the exact opposite effect that it should have had by having a strong leadership process with a strong party.</span>
