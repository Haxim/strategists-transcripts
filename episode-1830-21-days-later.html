We talked when this campaign just got started around things like COVID, what we call in Alberta bozo eruptions, where candidates have questionable activity, if not comments that they&#39;ve made in the past. This has become a pretty popular political refrain here in Alberta, where you bring back the war room material, you put it out, you try to make a story about it. It&#39;s been successful in elections past, Carter. You&#39;ve been the beneficiary of such a campaign, one would argue, in 2012.</span>

There&#39;s also the fact that government ease slips in and you start to think about things in almost overly nuanced ways and it creates a certain amount of paralysis for creating anything bold or interesting or exciting because you know all of the downsides and you know the stakeholder groups are going to complain. You just know too much, right? And it can lead to a feeling that it&#39;s a little out of gas, Like it&#39;s just giving you incremental change and there&#39;s not a lot going on. And sometimes incremental change is enough. Sometimes incremental change is absolutely not what the voter is looking for. And it&#39;s just, it&#39;s the reality of any long-lived government.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">In that, I think there&#39;s two dynamics at play. Number one, I think Corey&#39;s right. Either the skills of the propositional have atrophied or internally within a campaign, the war room doesn&#39;t necessarily have too much power, but because negative- I think it does. That&#39;s my thesis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I&#39;m going to give you an or, right? Or in certain cases, it might. It might The best staff might have the best people, the research, the time, the tradition of doing it. And frankly, you have to understand that a war room in many cases is not just searching up all that dirt within the span of the 30 days of an election. They&#39;ve housed it for many, many months, if not years, waiting for the right time to release it. And so in certain cases, they have all this ammunition and they really win the fight internally to say, we have to release it all. oh, what have we been doing the last three years building up this dossier, if not to actually put it out when it&#39;s at peak attention for folks. I think if it&#39;s not atrophied on the why, it&#39;s certainly the fact that why never wins the debate or the propositional never wins the debate as it comes to ad dollar spending. So the second thing that I think is true at the same time is that Carter&#39;s also right, that negative is the most effective or largely seems to be on advertising. We&#39;ve actually forgotten not necessarily how to tell the why, but how to tell the why through propositional storytelling in 30, 15, and six-second versions because you can&#39;t rely on the daily hit anymore because that&#39;s no longer a thing. I&#39;m almost taking your yes and ending an and, which is how do we tell compelling, interesting, positive, emotive, exciting stories when in the Canadian political culture, arena rallies are not a thing? We don&#39;t have these massive visuals. We don&#39;t have all these other ground game building activities or those skills have been lost because we&#39;ve become so digital focused in so many ways. But how do you tell compelling positive stories that make people want to do something? I think there&#39;s a couple of things happening at once.</span>

Every war room I have been, not a part of, but have observed always has some version of their hits. And I think they&#39;ve started to focus too much on outputs rather than what those outputs lead to the outcomes of an election or like potential opportunity or strategy. Often war rooms are designed simply in isolation. Quite literally, they&#39;re hived off in many cases, like physically hived off on a campaign. And I think there is potentially an issue there, even from a campaign culture perspective. To be discussed, that seems like like a special episode unless you disagree then cory and i will do it ourselves i</span>

And I say that with much love to many people I know in the BC NDP who are doing good work. But fundamentally, I think that we&#39;re always saying politicians and generals are fighting the last war.
