            <span class="text">Okay, horrible week. Can we agree on that for Donald Trump or Corey? Here we go. Rejecting the premise is Corey Hogan&#39;s thing. But let me just list a few of the things that have happened in the past week just to set the table in the context. So the Stephanopoulos interview, he goes after, he confuses the Ukraine and Russia issue, not endorsing Paul Ryan, asks why we have nuclear weapons if we&#39;re not using them, goes after the Khan family, re-invokes the incidents of the disabled reporter and Megyn Kelly on stage, and finally calls Hillary Clinton mentally unstable or potentially mentally ill. That&#39;s just a small selection of Donald Trump&#39;s last week. Stephen Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. Is this over for him? Like, that&#39;s a broad, big question, but is this over?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, no. Okay. Because the only way that you can accurately predict the future is to reflect back at the past, right? And say, how has this particular person behaved in the past?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And that past behavior indicates that he will continue to behave that way in the future. What</span>

This is effectively part of an intervention that Giuliani and Newt Gingrich have had with Donald Trump. These are two close supporters. They both spoke at the convention. They have now gone out in media. They&#39;ve effectively publicized the fact that the campaign is going into a reboot. Corey, I&#39;ll go to you. Just let&#39;s first broadly talk about this concept of a campaign reboot, what goes into it, and then we&#39;ll talk about the success factor and how it works. But give me your one-on-one on what a campaign reboot is.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Why do you reboot your computer? Because it&#39;s locked up, because it&#39;s not working, and something needs to change. And you hope just by going back to that fresh state and declaring to the world this is a fresh state moving forward. And that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that in this case it is, right? Because there&#39;s been so much talk. There is a more subtle reboot where you just shuffle things around behind the scenes. All of a sudden, the campaign manager is out of day-to-day operations,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe even still maintaining the role, but somebody else is doing the actual campaign managing. And that&#39;s more about organizationally rebooting. This is about a communications reboot, optically rebooting. and to reboot in that sense you really need to let people know what&#39;s happening and make a big show out of it which is exactly what the trump campaign is trying to do even donald trump had i mean as far as donald trump goes uh</span>

And then she listed a core reasons as to why she couldn&#39;t. Now, she also did not endorse Hillary Clinton. She said</span>

I think anybody familiar with the Canadian system, it&#39;s the first knife in the leader&#39;s back that&#39;s the hardest, and then everybody else who&#39;s been waiting to do it pulls it out. Now, that said, Collins is a pretty moderate Republican. She&#39;s from Maine, and she&#39;s often been fairly moderate. I&#39;m not necessarily sure that this is the—well, it&#39;s not the end. Let&#39;s put it that way. It would be a huge deal if we were talking about a more conservative Republican from, you know, I was going to say a state like Texas, but there is a senator from the state of Texas who has already not endorsed Donald Trump, and that&#39;s Ted Cruz. But, you know, if somebody just looked at it as an uninvested party, you know, maybe they&#39;re not even up for re-election this year, and they&#39;re like, no way, this is too much.

So during the primary, Trump&#39;s M.O. or his strategy was ultimately to try to get these low propensity voters to come out and vote for him. That was the strategy, quote unquote. Now, it didn&#39;t actually turn out as such because you probably had a lot of institutional Democrats or, you know, registered Democrats come out. But in a leaked memo that came out from the Trump campaign, I&#39;m going to quote this because I love a few of the words in here. Quote, based on internal analysis of our own modeling data and third party research, and considering the exceptionalism of our candidate, I advise that we put 100% of our organizational effort into enfranchising the conventionally low propensity voters that support our candidate.</span>

I don&#39;t really care about that, personally. I mean, it&#39;s the dead of August. I was going to ask you about that specifically, yeah. He&#39;s going around. He&#39;s meeting with the people he needs to meet with. He&#39;s putting the foundational pieces in place that you would want to put in place. This is what everybody who runs for leader does. And I think it would be disingenuous of me to have a great, like, angry reaction to it, frankly. He is still holding his federal seat, which I&#39;m sure is annoying to some people.
