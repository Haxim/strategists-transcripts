But let me just list a few of the things that have happened in the past week just to set the table in the context. So the Stephanopoulos interview, he goes after, he confuses the Ukraine and Russia issue, not endorsing Paul Ryan, asks why we have nuclear weapons if we&#39;re not using them, goes after the Khan family, re-invokes the incidents of the disabled reporter and Megyn Kelly on stage, and finally calls Hillary Clinton mentally unstable or potentially mentally ill. That&#39;s just a small selection of Donald Trump&#39;s last week. Stephen Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. Is this over for him? Like, that&#39;s a broad, big question, but is this over?</div>

This is effectively part of an intervention that Giuliani and Newt Gingrich have had with Donald Trump. These are two close supporters. They both spoke at the convention. They have now gone out in media. They&#39;ve effectively publicized the fact that the campaign is going into a reboot. Corey, I&#39;ll go to you. Just let&#39;s first broadly talk about this concept of a campaign reboot, what goes into it, and then we&#39;ll talk about the success factor and how it works.

Now, that said, Collins is a pretty moderate Republican. She&#39;s from Maine, and she&#39;s often been fairly moderate. I&#39;m not necessarily sure that this is the—well, it&#39;s not the end. Let&#39;s put it that way. It would be a huge deal if we were talking about a more conservative Republican from, you know, I was going to say a state like Texas, but there is a senator from the state of Texas who has already not endorsed Donald Trump, and that&#39;s Ted Cruz. But, you know, if somebody just looked at it as an uninvested party, you know, maybe they&#39;re not even up for re-election this year, and they&#39;re like, no way, this is too much.

I think that it&#39;s a pretty complicated situation that her organizers have to deal with, not least of which because of the Republican, or sorry, the Libertarian ticket having two Republican governors. There is not a likelihood, but a possibility if Trump completely collapses, if everybody runs away, the Republican or the Libertarians are on the ballot in all 50 states. They are. Right. I mean, what if she just replaces a very unpopular opponent in Donald Trump with a an unknown and potentially impactful candidate and gary johnson right i mean if people just make that flip and they&#39;re like okay this is the new republican ticket for this election as far as we&#39;re concerned now i don&#39;t know that that&#39;s practical or likely but i i</div>

First of all, what do you make of the current state of the Trump grassroots? This is layered on top of the fact that Donald Trump, for the last week and a half, has been saying, you know, I think this election might be rigged. He&#39;s really trying to inflame this base.

So during the primary, Trump&#39;s M.O. or his strategy was ultimately to try to get these low propensity voters to come out and vote for him. That was the strategy, quote unquote. Now, it didn&#39;t actually turn out as such because you probably had a lot of institutional Democrats or, you know, registered Democrats come out. But in a leaked memo that came out from the Trump campaign, I&#39;m going to quote this because I love a few of the words in here. Quote, based on internal analysis of our own modeling data and third party research, and considering the exceptionalism of our candidate, I advise that we put 100% of our organizational effort into enfranchising the conventionally low propensity voters that support our candidate.</div>
