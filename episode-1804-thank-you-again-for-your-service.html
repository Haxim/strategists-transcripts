Okay, well, with the Liberal Party in particular, and I guess also the PCs, and I don&#39;t know what the Conservatives do currently, but why co-chairs existed was because they were supposed to be responsible for election activities within a region, and that aligned with how those parties used to be structured. So, for a very long time, the Liberal Party was a federation, right? The provincial liberal parties were all part of the federal liberal party, and the provincial wing was that, you know, was that part of the federal party, and the president of the provincial wing was a member of the federal executive, and so on and so forth. And from the 60s on, the provincial parties started separating from the federal party, and they were kind of replaced with provincial</span>

And they kind of managed the federal activities that were done by provincial parties in areas where the provincial party was still federated. That&#39;s a lot of nonsense. That&#39;s a lot of background. But at the time, the idea was, every party is going to be a little bit different, you&#39;re going to need some people on the ground.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">He started when he was a child. And because of that, I will give it to him. Because I do, in fact, remember campaigning without a cell phone, campaigning without email, campaigning where the newspapers were still the number one thing that you worried about. You didn&#39;t really worry about did we drop brochures. so the campaign chair had to have relationships with the media right they had to know who the managing partner or who the managing editor was of all of the different uh newspapers and things like that like the the co-chair had those on the ground relationships and had done this a number of times so that they knew exactly</span>

CFCN is an affiliate of CTV, but it had like its own program and it had TV studios that created shows, you know, that were just for the Calgary area. The media market was so very different back then.

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">be the liaison between the campaign and the candidate sometimes when difficult things need to be discussed. That campaign chair is a high enough status person that it makes sense. And the other way to use them is if you&#39;ve got somebody who you want to put into the campaign chair or co-chair position that sends a message, that sends a signal to your voters you know this is someone who is worth us and if we have this person with us then maybe we&#39;re filling the progressive side of the ticket or if we have this person with us maybe we&#39;re filling the conservative side of the ticket right whatever you&#39;re looking for you can get by putting a co-chair into a specific market um you know that that&#39;s absolutely available would</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i kind of alluded to they still somebody to take the meetings there is actually a lot of work that a campaign co-chair does on the ground and it&#39;s a real job still it&#39;s maybe a different job and it&#39;s maybe not one that has sort of the same strategic authority that occurred in years past but it certainly is still a real job kathy moore here in alberta by the way has done it in the past i think she did it in 2015 if i&#39;m not mistaken um but one of the things she did as campaign chair in 2015 was go around and find candidates to run in every Alberta riding and make sure that there were capable campaigns and capable organizations where they&#39;re needed to be for the party. And that&#39;s something that a provincial co-chair can do, a provincial campaign chair can do a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">little more easily than a national apparatus, right? They&#39;re just not going to know the people on the ground. And if they do know them, they don&#39;t have the time or ability to to meet with them regularly. And one of the reasons why you want a leader-appointed chair rather than, say, the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you can actually trust them to be the competent political organizer you need them to be and go out and make the savvy political plays you need them to make. So there&#39;s local candidates, there&#39;s making sure that there&#39;s a campaign apparatus everywhere, everywhere and actually meeting with the people to make sure that it occurs. Historically, that job has also included chairing the Green Light Committee. So going through the candidate vetting process, meeting with those candidates that have come forward through the various mechanisms that are available. I don&#39;t know, even in my time, that was getting much more centralized. So I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s a huge part of the job now. But there&#39;s still work to be done. And there&#39;s still reason to to have somebody that you can trust on the ground to help make sure you&#39;ve got a campaign in your province when that writ gets dropped, or when those writs are dropped, if you want to get, you</span>

            <span class="text">I think that the answer has to be both, Zane. I think that I can find examples of really solid organizers who take the title of chair or co-chair. And I can think of many examples of people who&#39;ve taken the chair or co-chair title that are titular. and that is all they&#39;re expected to do is is the is just to be there and to attend the meetings just to add some gravitas or some heft to the overall meeting um you know we had i don&#39;t know if you know i&#39;m just thinking back to the 2012 campaign we had a lot of different people who were responsible for things i&#39;m not sure we called them co-chairs but we wound up having to have a you know a meeting of the co-chairs before we&#39;d have a meeting with the uh with the campaign teams because everybody wanted to go running off in 13 different directions and there were only seven of them so how do you how do you do that how do you manage them uh becomes quite a challenging</span>

Even if it was in the honorifics lane that Corey is outlining, you would, if you upstarted a campaign tomorrow, have campaign coaches, right? And I guess the question I have for you as a follow-up to both of you is, is there a better way to do that? If we&#39;re talking about the not the doer lane, but let&#39;s say leaning more to the honorific lane, Corey, is there a better way, a better position than campaign co-chair? Or is it actually a nice, convenient, even modernly right-sized spot to put people in?</span>

I think in general, you look at the arc of the last couple of years, the BC conservatives have done an incredibly good job of making themselves credible. what was it the 2013 bc election in the lead up to it the bc conservatives were polling very well as well you know 20 25 percent in some cases ahead of the bc liberals i believe or like within a couple of points in any case and um everybody sort of said this was their moment and the bc liberals were in a lot of trouble but as you found uh the election approaching a the bc liberals were in government that helps but b the</span>

So if I&#39;m EB, all I can control is to try to eliminate that uncertainty by basically almost acknowledging that it has happened, right? So for you, then you just run that strategy the whole time.

The entire show is for you. About time. Yeah, you&#39;re really fading here, so let me get the most important questions out of the way, Carter. Overrated or underrated, the political hurt EB is going to feel, you think, heading into this election on the recriminalization. So this is after weeks of troubling stories about the problematic street drug use in hospitals, parks, bus stops. B.C. asked the federal government to recriminalize the use of drugs in these public spaces. How much is this going to hurt? Is this an overrated political story or is this an underrated political story as it relates to EB&#39;s and the NDP&#39;s political future?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s underrated. I think that organizations that don&#39;t understand that addiction is not a criminal issue, it&#39;s not a mental health issue, it&#39;s an addiction issue. Addiction is troubling. It is impossible to manage for other people. It&#39;s hard enough to manage for yourself. And this idea that decriminalizing was going to solve an addiction issue hasn&#39;t done so. and it hasn&#39;t made the streets safer and it hasn&#39;t made uh crime go down it hasn&#39;t made everything work the way it should so my thinking is that uh you know eb is going to be dealing with this for quite some time because it was absolutely the wrong call in in the same thing with oregon i mean um or oregon oregon um you know this is it&#39;s not a question of whether it&#39;s legal or not not the addiction doesn&#39;t care. Addiction doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s legal or not. So, um, you better be able to find ways to manage the consumption, manage the addiction, manage the, the, the drugs. And I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s going to happen, uh, with this new set of drugs that have happened that are, that, that they&#39;re beset upon our population. I&#39;m tremendously</span>
