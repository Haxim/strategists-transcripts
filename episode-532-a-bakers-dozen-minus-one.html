            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">on top of that the tone that she struck I thought was really really telling and what was telling to me was not just that that calm steady let&#39;s not act too rashly speech that Rachel gave but the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the the audience was like okay okay through that and that was certainly targeted I think towards a broader Alberta the business community different interests perhaps who have been vested in the past and find themselves no longer vested interests but the applause lines what people actually cheered for were the environment for aboriginal for these issues that that I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think are near and dear to the hearts of a lot of people who are very truly passionately excited to have a government that they think represents something other than the government we had before so go</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">go ahead Carter yeah I mean, I think that that&#39;s going to scare the crap out of downtown Calgary because downtown Calgary has forgotten that the government doesn&#39;t just necessarily need to represent their interests. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">expectations and hopes. It&#39;s just they have a very different way of explaining it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So I want to talk about some of the words that we heard today. Corey, you and I were standing beside each other, and one of the words that came up multiple times in the premier&#39;s speech was the term stable. Stable. No, we&#39;ve heard stable before by a national politician when he talks about his stable majority. But not to make too much light of it, but that was a term, a stable majority, that she brought up quite a few times today. What do you make of that in terms of the dynamics that this past week has brought for the NDP? I think the NDP</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">NDP understand language perhaps better than an Alberta government has previously. And the phrase stable majority says</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">says two things to two different audiences. And both are positive messages with those audiences. It&#39;s stable majority to New Democrats means we ain&#39;t going anywhere. We can&#39;t be pushed out. And stable majority to those who did not vote for the New Democrats says we are going to be measured in our approach. And so I think it was obviously a phrase that they repeated because it had some currency.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Makes sense. And I do think that that&#39;s a message they want to be giving to both those groups right now. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that there&#39;s an intent question. I think when Stephen Harper uses his terminology, it is the intent to almost reinforce that this is his victory lap.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">When Rachel Notley uses it, I think that it is intended to</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to be less of a victory lap and more of a don&#39;t worry,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is not going to be necessarily</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So Corey you said this was a PR win I would agree with you on that but on a different scale where did this rank for both of you guys in terms of authenticity today that&#39;s something that&#39;s a lot of people may argue has been missing in our political atmosphere here in Alberta did that rank highly or did you were you still skeptical at certain moments? I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think it was beautifully structured quote-unquote authenticity they did all of the right moves i have a hard time</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">time i want to stop you there because i think that&#39;s an interesting phrase beautifully</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">beautifully structured authenticity yeah i don&#39;t think it was necessarily real authenticity i believe the intentions were authentic but come on i mean walking out amongst the crowd you can&#39;t tell me that was a spontaneous outpouring of like public goodwill i i think um authentic</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">authentic doesn&#39;t mean spontaneity right like it doesn&#39;t have to be spontaneous to be authentic you can play every time she stands up in front of the microphone right now her</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">do. Because, you know, this is fun. This will get me into nothing but trouble. Justin Trudeau&#39;s big problem right now is every time he opens his mouth, he doesn&#39;t sound authentic. He sounds like he&#39;s reading cue cards or he&#39;s in some sort of a dramatic production. And that bothers me, and I think as people get to know him, it&#39;ll bother him more. Jim Prentiss had not an authentic bone in his body when he was doing his interactions with the media or his interactions with video or his interactions with Albertans. And Rachel Notley, when she spoke today and when she spoke on election night and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I have a question there. And the question pretty much is that can authenticity as a structure</span>

            <span class="text">be a negative sometimes? times? Can she be too true to herself too quickly? And does that inflate her expectations? I mean, we&#39;ve seen it back to back speeches where she&#39;s had to the diversity of Alberta in many ways. Does that warm and fuzzy, which I think from my experiences where I&#39;m experiencing the NDP right now, can that actually inflate expectations too much? Well, let&#39;s talk authenticity</span>

            <span class="text">authenticity because we&#39;ve been banning the word about a lot. But yeah, I think she authentically cares.

I do want to move it on because I think one of the bigger things that people were looking forward to today, outside of the pageantry and the fun and the frozen treats, was who the 11 people that were getting named into Cabinet would be like.
