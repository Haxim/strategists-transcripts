Corey, you and I were standing beside each other, and one of the words that came up multiple times in the premier&#39;s speech was the term stable. Stable. No, we&#39;ve heard stable before by a national politician when he talks about his stable majority. But not to make too much light of it, but that was a term, a stable majority, that she brought up quite a few times today. What do you make of that in terms of the dynamics that this past week has brought for the NDP? I think the NDP</div>
