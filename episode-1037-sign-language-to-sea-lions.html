And speaking of sharing, Stephen Carter, speaking of perhaps even oversharing, the five-volume, 2,000-page report on the Emergencies Act is now out. Justice Paul Rouleau has released it.

Stephen Carter, there&#39;s many details in here, but I want to start with this top line. Is this fine? Is this fabulous? Or is this fucked for the liberal government, for the Trudeau government? And I don&#39;t want to color it a bit more than that, but maybe I will. Fine, because great, it puts it behind them. Fabulous, because it puts it behind them and the PM performed amazingly well. Or is it fucked because it now re-litigates the issue? You might have other narratives, other reasons, other rationales. But Stephen Carter, over to you first. Fine, fabulous, or fucked?

Listen, But listen, Carter actually hit the metaphor perfectly here because it does remind me of dinner with the family with that Uncle Phil who has that revisionist history, you know, where all of a sudden it&#39;s, well, see, people were just mad about affordability. Well, Uncle Phil, like we didn&#39;t actually have big inflation back then. This doesn&#39;t actually seem to have been the case. Well, they were just mad about, you know, the vaccines the government was forcing down our throat. Well, Uncle Phil, a year earlier, weren&#39;t you mad at the government for not getting the vaccines fast enough? you know and uncle phil will never admit where he was and what he was going to do i mean and so it does have that familial energy because we&#39;re still going to invite uncle phil back to the table because he&#39;s one of these two big personalities in our family our father and uncle phil right and so we always know at the end of the day someone&#39;s going to have to host christmas which is what government is it&#39;s hosting christmas just so you&#39;re following the metaphor yeah</div>

And certainly after we had a prime minister who ran an election in part on trying to polarize the population and say, I&#39;m going to ride with the 80 percent and burn the 20 percent when the 20 percent bit back.

But is that the right strategic move? If we think about it for a second, is there any remnants of what&#39;s happened where they&#39;re vindicated that they can now hold up as a victory banner in some ways? Or is it just minimize, to Corey&#39;s point, downside risk, not to quote Corey in saying that this is what he&#39;s saying, minimize downside risk and now move on? I&#39;m curious to get your thought here, because the smart money or the obvious sense is let&#39;s just move on. We&#39;re done with this. Put it to bed. Year to date. Fuck it.</div>

People will say, oh, no, I think it was other things. No, it was this. We talked about it at the time. It wasn&#39;t even clear what they were asking for. It was just a channel for frustrations more vaguely, just like the Tea Party became channel for frustrations more vaguely instead of, you know, being this low tax revolt that it originally began as. But it is just another proof point in the character and judgment argument that people will be making against Pierre Polyev. And it might be very potent with certain audiences. It might be very potent with Ottowans, for example. and uh the liberals should make sure that it&#39;s not the main story but it can certainly be part of the story about pierre polly of the person as they move forward but yeah like you can&#39;t sit there and be like we were right they were wrong okay</div>

So, like, because what&#39;s going to happen is the conservatives would bring in, with all of, like, kind of the righteous indignation possible, a no-confidence motion in the government the first moment they could get, you know, an opportunity. And what are you going to do as the NDP? You&#39;re going to say, no, we support them in that particular moment? I don&#39;t think so, unless there was a giant sacrifice from the Liberal Party. And I think that kind of giant sacrifice would probably have to be Trudeau. and so to me that does seem like the most obvious consequence if it was there and you know as the prime minister you could say i disagree uh but we have a system of laws and as the liberals we believe in a system of laws and the decision was mine that decision was called into question that that was uh you know an inquiry decided that that did not meet the bar and so i resign and i am sorry to canadians that i let them down in this particular moment i want you to know i I got lots of advice from other people that I should be walking a different line. I didn&#39;t do it. But ultimately, as prime minister, that was my choice to make or something to try to minimize the damage to your party. What</div>

But let&#39;s be clear, the inquiry was required to be called underneath the act, right? But you say, yes, it was a 60-40 decision. It was very tough. Canadians were confused. We were confused. We didn&#39;t know the right answer, but we knew we needed to do something and we did something. And I&#39;m not sorry that I did something. I wish that I had the perfect information that the inquiry was able to get when I made my decision. But this is a sign that the system works. We&#39;re a government of laws, and the system works. And so now, I&#39;m bringing in all of these new safeguards and all of this new legislation to protect Canadians, so that in the next time there&#39;s a moment of crisis, you know, the right thing happens. And we have better information, because if I&#39;d had better information at the time, I would have made better decisions. Carter,</div>

It was like a couple of weeks ago. Three weeks ago. Do you feel like something like this could have been presented by the staff to a cabinet retreat on scenario planning? Because if the scale of the defeat is what Corey&#39;s saying, that this could take down the government, do you feel like they present it to cabinet? We&#39;re now getting into speculation, but I&#39;m kind of curious. This goes back to our last episode on decision circles. Do you think they present it around how we navigate this thing, win, lose, et cetera? Corey&#39;s giving me a very strong no, but Carter, I want to go to you first. Definitely no. And then I want to hear why Corey&#39;s on a definite no camp. Because, Carter, you seem a little bit more ambivalent.</div>

            <div class="said">let&#39;s talk about that more than our fair share for a moment here uh because principal charity at all times he&#39;s not wrong that quebecers by far like on a per capita basis accept more asylum seekers than you know any other province here at least based on the statistics i was pulling up from stats canada for the year 2022 like it&#39;s not even close i and you know ontario would be the next highest one but yeah there quebec is in the thousands and alberta is in the the tens, just to give you a sense of the differential here. So it&#39;s certainly true that there are more asylum seekers showing up in Quebec than they are showing up in other parts of the country. Just as that&#39;s probably true, there&#39;s more in Florida and Texas than there are in other parts of the United States, right? Just part of its geography, part of its cultural, part of its history, you know, all of those things.</div>

            <div class="said">first of all, I just want to be clear. I agree with Carter. I think immigration is one of the great unalloyed goods in this world. It makes Canada so much stronger and so much more diverse and so much more interesting and connects us to the rest of the world. And it generates that economic growth. But Quebec is not maintaining their quote-unquote fair share of overall immigration you know ontario number one with a bullet but when you start you know bc number two in raw numbers quebec in raw numbers number three but alberta in per capita numbers it probably number two or three i haven&#39;t done the quick math here but the reality is quebec starts to fall down that list pretty quick when you start thinking about a per capita here quebec is not this big magnet of immigration overall now what they&#39;ve They&#39;ve identified as that a higher percent of their population of asylum seekers. I got a real problem with Quebec having problems with asylum seekers as a group and thinking there&#39;s something fundamentally worse about that group of</div>

            <div class="said">And I think that&#39;s what sort of grinds my gears. Now, obviously, they are higher needs because almost by definition, they are coming with some people that, you know, a lack of resources. But a lot of the supports come from the federal government in that case, not exclusively. And certainly it&#39;s a burden on the provinces. But I think a more humane, more sensible solution would have been to increase the number of supports and increase the demands for an equity of support rather than saying they can&#39;t come here, we&#39;re full, which seems like an utterly bullshit solution, especially given the nature and the diversity of the Quebec community and the fact that we know that these asylum seekers will be ultimately more successful if they are in communities that are supporting of them and not thrown all of a sudden to balls and have</div>

And they can say it&#39;s about their overabundance of asylum seekers. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s about Quebec wanting to control, and they do control to an extent, immigration to the province of Quebec.

Quebec. We know why the political federal elected leaders are not doing it. They fucking need Quebec. But like, when you compound Bill 21 with the asylum seeker conversation and the undertones of it, the pressure against the special representative against Islamophobia and putting her through the wringer over the last couple of weeks, there&#39;s a almost underlying message that multiculturalism is not welcome in this province, that it&#39;s a failure akin to perhaps what Germany He said a half decade ago or so. Are you surprised that there&#39;s no voice on the federal or national stage pushing back against this? Or does your strategy brain say, yeah, but it&#39;s not tenable? It&#39;s not tenable to have that voice because every political party, every stripe needs Quebec in its current state to kind of pick up a political victory whenever the next election happens. I&#39;m kind of curious to delve into that a bit as an offshoot from this conversation on asylum seekers in Legault.</div>

How dare you take money from our pockets to fight that which is wrong? wrong and so then they go out and try and raise the money and no one wants to donate to it either um because at the end of the day these voices that you&#39;re looking for they&#39;re not just going to appear out of thin air someone has to pay for even if it&#39;s just paying for you know digital ads or or someone&#39;s time to to make a facebook post these things don&#39;t just happen overnight um yeah some of them are groundswell some of them come from from big volunteer bases and things like like that but more often than not we need to have some money to pay for lawyers or some money to pay for the activities of the of protest and</div>

We needed more understanding of how multiculturalism actually matters. There&#39;s nobody standing up for it right now because there&#39;s not enough people who believe it, not enough people who understand it.

Well, because everybody looks at him and says, Jagmeet, you&#39;re not actually being authentic or true to yourself. So if you can be true to yourself, if you can be authentic in a leadership opportunity, you should take it. He should have taken it years ago. But for some reason, he thought that he could follow in Jack Layton&#39;s footsteps. Jack Layton was true and authentic to himself, and that worked in Quebec.</div>

But this is shakier ground because there&#39;s kind of a fundamental statistical truth underneath it, whereas Bill 21 was just picking on minorities. It was not cool in any way, shape, or form in my point of view. And again, understand the problems Quebec is facing. This is not an appropriate solution in a liberal democracy, in my opinion.

We want to make sure these asylum seekers are treated fairly and given the best chance for success going forward in their lives. In many cases, that will be in the province of Quebec, not in all cases, right? We do want to make sure it&#39;s more equitable. But you know what? That&#39;s what a federal government&#39;s for. That&#39;s where federal supports come into this matter. I think you could take positions like that and start working in firmer language and saying this can&#39;t continue.

And while Ontario gets one more seat itself, Toronto loses a seat, dropping from 25 to 24. Overrated or underrated, the magnitude of impact this might have in terms of benefiting the Conservatives?
