          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is an overshare. We&#39;re going to move it on. It is family day. Let&#39;s stick with the letter F. We have not done this in a while, guys. It is our first segment. Our first segment. Corey, Stephen, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fabulous. Or it is fucked. There are many things in the Canadian political zeitgeist going on right now. And speaking of sharing, Stephen Carter, speaking of perhaps even oversharing, the five-volume, 2,000-page report on the Emergencies Act is now out. Justice Paul Rouleau has released it. And the summary is, Stephen Carter, are you going to go with the drumroll? Please, the drumroll.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Thank you, Stephen Carter. that the liberal government has indeed met the bar to invoke the Emergencies Act. Stephen Carter, there&#39;s many details in here, but I want to start with this top line. Is this fine? Is this fabulous? Or is this fucked for the liberal government, for the Trudeau government? And I don&#39;t want to color it a bit more than that, but maybe I will. Fine, because great, it puts it behind them. Fabulous, because it puts it behind them and the PM performed amazingly well. Or is it fucked because it now re-litigates the issue? You might have other narratives, other reasons, other rationales. But Stephen Carter, over to you first. Fine, fabulous, or fucked? The Trudeau government meets the bar on the Emergencies Act inquiry.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that your earlier point about this being F for family is really what it&#39;s all about. This is clearly something that Trudeau kept in the family by appointing the right commissioner and getting the right outcome. So this is an F for family in my mind. Thank you,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is an F for family, because obviously, you know, he kept it in the family, the decision was made. I would like to point out, though, that months ago, months ago, Corey and I went asked the same type of question from you said that this would be the exact outcome, because it hadn&#39;t worked before. And it started to work when the Emergencies Act was invoked. So thank you. We were right. I don&#39;t think is there something that we could say that we were right that starts with F?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to come back to Carter for a real answer, but instead I&#39;m going to go to Corey to explain what Carter means by it&#39;s all in the family, or F is for family. Thank you, Carter, for that deviation that we did not need.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I assume that he is not talking about this conspiracy theory that Trudeau is related to the man in charge of that, Rouleau, the man in charge of the commission. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So that&#39;s been going around the internet. Not true. true yeah um but you know there was kind of a familial energy bringing canadians together with this report right you know f really is for family right now i think but also um maybe fine and fucked at the same time excellent so you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you put mostly family i don&#39;t want you to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">to thank you i&#39;m it&#39;s rooted in family which makes sense why it&#39;s fine and fucked at the same time i mean yeah i think that&#39;s very very self-explanatory so i&#39;d say a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a majority of the people listening yeah um yeah Yeah. So, look, this didn&#39;t change anybody&#39;s mind. This is exactly what you would think would happen. There was a lot of downside risk for the Liberals, but that, you know, while the consequences were high, the likelihood was low. So they ended up exactly where they were. You&#39;ve already seen, for example, Tyler Shandro, Minister of Justice here in Alberta, say, well, we disagree, basically, because of course, you know, that&#39;s exactly how the system is supposed to work. somebody gives a thoughtful inquiry and then you just say no i don&#39;t think so um you&#39;ve had people talk about this be the end of democracy and kind of the further fringes of um of uh the internet communism</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but i think that&#39;s yeah but that&#39;s also why it&#39;s fucked for all of us like it&#39;s a great example that we are we are not able to come together on these things i don&#39;t want to overstate the healing power of an inquiry in years past that&#39;s just nonsense that&#39;s not how it actually went down. But there&#39;s just, this was never going to heal the wounds, shall we say. And it didn&#39;t.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is it actually? Is it actually, is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is it this combination of fine and fucked? Or is it one of those things? What do you think it is for the liberal government? If you&#39;re in their orbit right now, how are you processing this? Like in its most objective fashion, not how are you spinning it to your leader or to your ministers, but how are you actually processing it as a competent, capable staffer within the government right now?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">People who agree with us will continue to agree with us. People who didn&#39;t agree with us will continue not to agree with us. That&#39;s why it&#39;s part of the F is for family. The family of people that are going to vote for the liberals will still vote for the liberals. The family of people that will not vote for the liberals will not vote for</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So this polarization, this being kind of created and pushed off into different directions has created families of voters and those families of voters aren&#39;t going to move. they&#39;re going to stay exactly where they were um the inquiry uh to cory&#39;s point you know that you know not to put too much of a of a spin on former inquiries it&#39;s not like people who you know the romano inquiry just all of a sudden comes out and everybody goes oh well then everything&#39;s okay um you</span>

So now that other family can point to it and say, see, look at that asshole, see? And that&#39;s a problem. That&#39;s, you know, I think that it&#39;s not the problem itself, but it certainly is identifying this divorce into two families that&#39;s occurred over time in Canadian politics.</span>

Listen, But listen, Carter actually hit the metaphor perfectly here because it does remind me of dinner with the family with that Uncle Phil who has that revisionist history, you know, where all of a sudden it&#39;s, well, see, people were just mad about affordability. Well, Uncle Phil, like we didn&#39;t actually have big inflation back then. This doesn&#39;t actually seem to have been the case. Well, they were just mad about, you know, the vaccines the government was forcing down our throat. Well, Uncle Phil, a year earlier, weren&#39;t you mad at the government for not getting the vaccines fast enough? you know and uncle phil will never admit where he was and what he was going to do i mean and so it does have that familial energy because we&#39;re still going to invite uncle phil back to the table because he&#39;s one of these two big personalities in our family our father and uncle phil right and so we always know at the end of the day someone&#39;s going to have to host christmas which is what government is it&#39;s hosting christmas just so you&#39;re following the metaphor yeah</span>

And certainly after we had a prime minister who ran an election in part on trying to polarize the population and say, I&#39;m going to ride with the 80 percent and burn the 20 percent when the 20 percent bit back. Yeah, I mean, he was in some ways the author of this, which is not to say he was the exclusive author. Great assist to Russia.

            <span class="text">don&#39;t think it&#39;s either no but i&#39;ll say this the liberals fought the 2021 election on this issue they can&#39;t fight the 2025 election on this And no, I don&#39;t mean Ottawa specifically, but I mean this idea of whether we were going to act in a certain fashion, put up with a certain amount of blowback from the population, or if we were going to push forward on public health standards, which is, you know, at the end of the day, when you strip everything else away, those frustrations were somewhat the root of Ottawa. People will say, oh, no, I think it was other things. No, it was this. We talked about it at the time. It wasn&#39;t even clear what they were asking for. It was just a channel for frustrations more vaguely, just like the Tea Party became channel for frustrations more vaguely instead of, you know, being this low tax revolt that it originally began as. But it is just another proof point in the character and judgment argument that people will be making against Pierre Polyev. And it might be very potent with certain audiences. It might be very potent with Ottowans, for example. and uh the liberals should make sure that it&#39;s not the main story but it can certainly be part of the story about pierre polly of the person as they move forward but yeah like you can&#39;t sit there and be like we were right they were wrong okay</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, if you were scenario planning for the liberals last week with a half a page memo of if Rouleau comes back with a, we&#39;re fucked, we didn&#39;t meet the bar, what were a couple of points on that memo would have been in terms of how to effectively move on from this story? What would you have done this week if on Friday you were scenario planning for that? I&#39;m just really curious in like your strategist mind, what are a couple of things you would have done for the opposite outcome sort of thing? And I know smart money wasn&#39;t on it, but you still have have to plan for those things, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So I think that there&#39;s a couple of options and I&#39;m not sure which one of these I would have chosen, Zane, because I haven&#39;t really thought that deeply on it. But in general, you get the option of blaming somebody. So you could blame one of your team members and have them take a fall. You could declare that, you know, we&#39;ve already learned from this and try and move on, right? We&#39;d already learned from this. That&#39;s why we called the the inquiry uh we knew just in calling it that there was a very reasonable chance that this would be the outcome um you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">or you&#39;re doing a minimization strategy uh the other would be to change the channel immediately um you know you&#39;re already working on a you know big health packages how do you kind of double down on those health packages to make them um more immediate uh more into people&#39;s hands like the dental thing is starting to starting finally to roll out um you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, of course I do. So, like, because what&#39;s going to happen is the conservatives would bring in, with all of, like, kind of the righteous indignation possible, a no-confidence motion in the government the first moment they could get, you know, an opportunity. And what are you going to do as the NDP? You&#39;re going to say, no, we support them in that particular moment? I don&#39;t think so, unless there was a giant sacrifice from the Liberal Party. And I think that kind of giant sacrifice would probably have to be Trudeau. and so to me that does seem like the most obvious consequence if it was there and you know as the prime minister you could say i disagree uh but we have a system of laws and as the liberals we believe in a system of laws and the decision was mine that decision was called into question that that was uh you know an inquiry decided that that did not meet the bar and so i resign and i am sorry to canadians that i let them down in this particular moment i want you to know i I got lots of advice from other people that I should be walking a different line. I didn&#39;t do it. But ultimately, as prime minister, that was my choice to make or something to try to minimize the damage to your party. What</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, then Carter is going down the right path. You can&#39;t really say it&#39;s why. I mean, you can say it&#39;s why we called the inquiry. But let&#39;s be clear, the inquiry was required to be called underneath the act, right? But you say, yes, it was a 60-40 decision. It was very tough. Canadians were confused. We were confused. We didn&#39;t know the right answer, but we knew we needed to do something and we did something. And I&#39;m not sorry that I did something. I wish that I had the perfect information that the inquiry was able to get when I made my decision. But this is a sign that the system works. We&#39;re a government of laws, and the system works. And so now, I&#39;m bringing in all of these new safeguards and all of this new legislation to protect Canadians, so that in the next time there&#39;s a moment of crisis, you know, the right thing happens. And we have better information, because if I&#39;d had better information at the time, I would have made better decisions. Carter,</span>

It was like a couple of weeks ago. Three weeks ago. Do you feel like something like this could have been presented by the staff to a cabinet retreat on scenario planning? Because if the scale of the defeat is what Corey&#39;s saying, that this could take down the government, do you feel like they present it to cabinet? We&#39;re now getting into speculation, but I&#39;m kind of curious. This goes back to our last episode on decision circles. Do you think they present it around how we navigate this thing, win, lose, et cetera? Corey&#39;s giving me a very strong no, but Carter, I want to go to you first. Definitely no. And then I want to hear why Corey&#39;s on a definite no camp. Because, Carter, you seem a little bit more ambivalent.</span>

He&#39;s facing a lot of pushback, a lot of commentary and criticism, a lot of it, I would say, outside of the province of Quebec, and I&#39;m sure some inside as well. Well, fine,</span>

            <span class="text">let&#39;s talk about that more than our fair share for a moment here uh because principal charity at all times he&#39;s not wrong that quebecers by far like on a per capita basis accept more asylum seekers than you know any other province here at least based on the statistics i was pulling up from stats canada for the year 2022 like it&#39;s not even close i and you know ontario would be the next highest one but yeah there quebec is in the thousands and alberta is in the the tens, just to give you a sense of the differential here. So it&#39;s certainly true that there are more asylum seekers showing up in Quebec than they are showing up in other parts of the country. Just as that&#39;s probably true, there&#39;s more in Florida and Texas than there are in other parts of the United States, right? Just part of its geography, part of its cultural, part of its history, you know, all of those things.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But you have to keep in mind that those seeking asylum asylum are just a small, small, small, small subsection of overall immigration in the country. And when you look at it through that lens, first</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">first of all, I just want to be clear. I agree with Carter. I think immigration is one of the great unalloyed goods in this world. It makes Canada so much stronger and so much more diverse and so much more interesting and connects us to the rest of the world. And it generates that economic growth. But Quebec is not maintaining their quote-unquote fair share of overall immigration you know ontario number one with a bullet but when you start you know bc number two in raw numbers quebec in raw numbers number three but alberta in per capita numbers it probably number two or three i haven&#39;t done the quick math here but the reality is quebec starts to fall down that list pretty quick when you start thinking about a per capita here quebec is not this big magnet of immigration overall now what they&#39;ve They&#39;ve identified as that a higher percent of their population of asylum seekers. I got a real problem with Quebec having problems with asylum seekers as a group and thinking there&#39;s something fundamentally worse about that group of</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And I think that&#39;s what sort of grinds my gears. Now, obviously, they are higher needs because almost by definition, they are coming with some people that, you know, a lack of resources. But a lot of the supports come from the federal government in that case, not exclusively. And certainly it&#39;s a burden on the provinces. But I think a more humane, more sensible solution would have been to increase the number of supports and increase the demands for an equity of support rather than saying they can&#39;t come here, we&#39;re full, which seems like an utterly bullshit solution, especially given the nature and the diversity of the Quebec community and the fact that we know that these asylum seekers will be ultimately more successful if they are in communities that are supporting of them and not thrown all of a sudden to balls and have</span>

You know, as much as we&#39;ve been using this as a joke, the reality is Quebec is trying to define for themselves the right to determine who their family is. And they can say it&#39;s about their overabundance of asylum seekers. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s about Quebec wanting to control, and they do control to an extent, immigration to the province of Quebec. And they want to maintain their</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">their ability to define what the Quebec family is. And I think that&#39;s a real shame because there is this growing divergence between viewpoints, between what English Canada sees as the value of immigration and what French Canada sees as the value of immigration. And there&#39;s reasons for that. Let me just be super clear.</span>

It&#39;s just different dynamics, but I&#39;m not giving Quebec a pass.

Quebec. We know why the political federal elected leaders are not doing it. They fucking need Quebec. But like, when you compound Bill 21 with the asylum seeker conversation and the undertones of it, the pressure against the special representative against Islamophobia and putting her through the wringer over the last couple of weeks, there&#39;s a almost underlying message that multiculturalism is not welcome in this province, that it&#39;s a failure akin to perhaps what Germany He said a half decade ago or so. Are you surprised that there&#39;s no voice on the federal or national stage pushing back against this? Or does your strategy brain say, yeah, but it&#39;s not tenable? It&#39;s not tenable to have that voice because every political party, every stripe needs Quebec in its current state to kind of pick up a political victory whenever the next election happens. I&#39;m kind of curious to delve into that a bit as an offshoot from this conversation on asylum seekers in Legault.</span>

How dare you take money from our pockets to fight that which is wrong? wrong and so then they go out and try and raise the money and no one wants to donate to it either um because at the end of the day these voices that you&#39;re looking for they&#39;re not just going to appear out of thin air someone has to pay for even if it&#39;s just paying for you know digital ads or or someone&#39;s time to to make a facebook post these things don&#39;t just happen overnight um yeah some of them are groundswell some of them come from from big volunteer bases and things like like that but more often than not we need to have some money to pay for lawyers or some money to pay for the activities of the of protest and</span>

You know, we were aware of what René Levesque was up to, and we were talking about the thrust between, you know, the Quebec liberals and the PQ back in the 80s and the 90s.

So what are we going to do? We can&#39;t just look at Quebec and say, shame on them, shame on them the reality is they are a minority group in the north american context and we need to be thinking about how we support the quebec culture and identity in a broader sense in this country or else it&#39;s just going to keep happening right</span>

And in my experience, leading and being authentic is the pathway to success. So why the hell isn&#39;t he being successful? successful? Well, because everybody looks at him and says, Jagmeet, you&#39;re not actually being authentic or true to yourself. So if you can be true to yourself, if you can be authentic in a leadership opportunity, you should take it. He should have taken it years ago. But for some reason, he thought that he could follow in Jack Layton&#39;s footsteps. Jack Layton was true and authentic to himself, and that worked in Quebec.</span>

But this is shakier ground because there&#39;s kind of a fundamental statistical truth underneath it, whereas Bill 21 was just picking on minorities. It was not cool in any way, shape, or form in my point of view. And again, understand the problems Quebec is facing. This is not an appropriate solution in a liberal democracy, in my opinion.

So let&#39;s start talking about how you can kind of create, you know, firmer positions on this matter. I do think, to go back to my last answer, it can&#39;t just be shame on Quebec, right?</span>

Here is what we&#39;re going to do. Obviously, we want to be, first and foremost, human beings. We want to make sure these asylum seekers are treated fairly and given the best chance for success going forward in their lives. In many cases, that will be in the province of Quebec, not in all cases, right? We do want to make sure it&#39;s more equitable. But you know what? That&#39;s what a federal government&#39;s for. That&#39;s where federal supports come into this matter. I think you could take positions like that and start working in firmer language and saying this can&#39;t continue. We can&#39;t continue to go down this road. We&#39;ve got to treat people as people, and everybody&#39;s got to have the same rights and advantages afforded to them.</span>

Why we&#39;re trying to curtail people&#39;s economic opportunities just because they chose to be involved in politics. And what we get now is is all of these people who have political interests who say, oh, no, I can&#39;t do that. My job won&#39;t let me be involved in politics. Listen to what we&#39;re saying. We&#39;re saying, no, you can&#39;t be involved in politics because, you know, your job is so sensitive that you can&#39;t be a part of this. Well, no one should be told. No one should be told that they shouldn&#39;t be a part of the political process. It&#39;s too fucking important. We need more people involved in politics, not less people involved in politics. and ethics commissioners and lobbying commissioners. And all these fucking people don&#39;t have a clue what it&#39;s like actually to volunteer in a campaign and why people are actually involved. Do they want a huge handout? Maybe some of them do. Others just want to fucking reference or with the ability to have friends that they can call and chat with in the future. And that is called networking. That&#39;s what we encourage people to fucking do. It&#39;s bullshit. Bullshit. Absolute bullshit.</span>
