Okay, let&#39;s latch on to this. Let&#39;s call into question that statement. Let&#39;s accept that statement unreservedly. You know, it was fascinating. It</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It was fascinating to watch. But, you know, I mean, fundamentally, I think that it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it wasn&#39;t very important.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Wait, fascinating to watch, but fundamentally not very important is pretty much the sub-headline of our podcast. So it fits very nicely into that frame. I thought it&#39;d be a great segue for us to talk about fast food joints and their issues. I&#39;ve actually pulled up this extremely long article on McDonald&#39;s and their McFamily feud, as they call it. I mean, if you guys are game, we can dedicate an entire episode to that right now. What do you say, Carter?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I&#39;m totally not in. I&#39;m not touching any more fast food issues from</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">from the get-go. I mean, this is too much now.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">There we go. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, the budget victory lap. Guys, we&#39;re not done with victory laps. You&#39;ve just taken one. But worry not, because I know Corey Hogan wants to take one on our federal budget. But let&#39;s set some context, of course. This past week, it seems like eons ago, the federal budget was tabled. The biggest budget since the Second World War. The centerpiece of it, national child care, of course. We&#39;ll talk about that in some detail. We also have this greening of the economy, the green transition, as it&#39;s been called by the Trudeau government in the past. We also have $100 billion of new spending, no real pathway to balance, and a deficit that sits at a grand total of just north of $350 billion. That is correct. You heard that right, $350 billion. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you first, like I always do on these big meaty topics, which is where do you want to take us? Where do you want to go? And what was your top line feeling? I want to say thoughts, but feeling when you heard this come out on, I don&#39;t even know, was it Monday? Last Monday.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So I think that there were two competing narratives that were trying to come out of the budget deliberations. One competing narrative was this is the end of the country. We are outspending ourselves into oblivion, and it is all over. And that narrative was, of course, championed by O&#39;Toole, and that was supposed to be his narrative coming out of it. And the other was kind of a narrative of what do I get? And what do I get was probably headlined by the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the child care discussions, which I think is a significant issue. Maybe we&#39;ve been here before. Maybe we&#39;ve had talk about child care in the past, but we haven&#39;t actually seen it implemented. implemented so now</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">now is the chance to get it implemented this is the conversation that is being had uh by many people those two diet dialogues were kind of at each at each other&#39;s at</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">at odds with one another and so i wanted</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">wanted to watch and i&#39;ve been watching for the last week to see which one seems to have won and and from my view the one that won is the stuff we&#39;re going to get and and what&#39;s interesting is we didn&#39;t even talk about the stuff that we need uh all this all of of the recovery from the pandemic stuff is included in that $400 billion spent or protected projected deficit. I&#39;ve rounded up you&#39;ve kept it you&#39;ve rounded down. What&#39;s 50? What&#39;s $50 billion between friends? But clearly nothing, nothing. Clearly nothing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So, so I think that overall, you know, if you&#39;re talking about narratives, the narrative that seems to have won the day uh is the narrative of what we get not what it&#39;s going to cost us so uh that&#39;s my takeaway that&#39;s the way that i&#39;ve boiled it down into into uh simplicity for my understanding of the of the budget um but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but but i think that that is is also reflecting how can how canadians are walking away from the budget presentation and the lead up potentially to an election</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">carter give me cory i&#39;m coming to you in a second carter give me your take on the The spectrum of strictly recovery budget all the way to let&#39;s remake Canada in the legacy of Justin Trudeau&#39;s, you know, grand new deal reset, whatever you want to call it, budget. Where does this fit? Is it closer to the latter? Closer to the former? Is it its own thing? What do you think?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think this is an absolute class in political opportunism. You only get the chance to do these, you know, remaking Canadian society initiatives, remaking Alberta society, remaking British Columbia, Ontario, doesn&#39;t matter. You only get to take those chances when you are in the midst of something horrible. So when, for example, when you&#39;re in the midst of an economic downturn in Alberta, based on the elimination of oil and gas, this is the time when you get to do something. So you have to do something. If you wanted to remake something, you do it now. Now, you already have an enormous deficit. There&#39;s nothing you&#39;re going to be able to do about it. What&#39;s spending an extra, I can&#39;t remember the specific amount, was it $400 billion over $300 billion over how many years? $30 billion? I mean, really, the numbers all start to get very meaningless</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">meaningless because it pales in comparison to the cost of the pandemic. So because you have the pandemic totally distorting the numbers, totally throwing the numbers out the window, you now have the opportunity to do something very, very meaningful. And that meaningfulness is going to be felt, but it&#39;s not going to be measured in the same fashion.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Over the seven minutes that Carter has filled time here, I&#39;ve seen Corey smirk. I&#39;ve seen him smile. I&#39;ve seen him shake his head. I&#39;ve seen him nod his head. Corey, triangulate all those feelings into your thoughts for what... That</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That is every time I speak, by the way. Every time. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I feel like Corey is the proxy of the of the listener at home. Corey, initial thoughts. We&#39;ll jump into questions there after.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">My initial thought was that the budget was shockingly good. So we talked about, for example, the risk being on the economic side. But when you&#39;re able to provide a deficit that is reduced from your your fall projections by so much, even that kind of made this is a big deficit. But Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s accusations that this is running up the red ink and is jeopardizing, you know, Canadian future really rang a little bit hollow because we had all kind of had our expectations set by that fall update. So Carter says it&#39;s a master class in political opportunism. I also think it&#39;s a master class in political framing, because in what other world do you get to spend so much money, go so much into debt and have people say, oh, pretty good, pretty good job, guys. Great work. I mean, this is an interesting budget. It&#39;s like Christmas in more ways than one. Not only do they get to give out an awful lot of things, but it&#39;s a green and red budget. You&#39;ve got this rethinking of the economy around environmental lines, and you&#39;ve got enough</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">enough red ink, I think, to drown an elephant. But we&#39;re all feeling okay with it, to Carter&#39;s point. The messaging that has come out has really been more about the childcare. It&#39;s been a remaking of the economy, all of those environmental sweeteners that were within it. And that&#39;s, you</span>

            <span class="text">And there&#39;s many things to talk about. So I got both of your takes on the table. I want to talk about the framing by the Liberals. I want to talk about the response by O&#39;Toole. You guys both mentioned it in abstractions, but I want to talk about his framing on a response. sponsor, at least the headline that it&#39;s been circulating on the O&#39;Toole framing. But I want to talk to you guys about the centerpiece first. And let&#39;s talk about child care. So the number that was floating around was at $2 billion prior to being like, they&#39;re going to invest $2 billion in child care. And a lot of us were head scratching, like, how the heck does that work? Turns out it&#39;s $30. So we&#39;re off all of our speculators and leaks are off by a factor of, I don&#39;t know, fucking 10, plus maybe 11, maybe 12. Who knows, Corey? Who knows math? is it 15 i think it&#39;s 15 uh we were off by a factor of 15 um but at the same time cory is that the right centerpiece here because there&#39;s also this recovery element which surprisingly and weirdly kind of gets lost like that we&#39;re extending the sues we&#39;re extending you know these supports that were all</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that sort of stuff it almost gets lost for the centerpiece on childcare, a bit on housing, you know, some other initiatives. But was that the right framing? It seems like from your perspective, yes, but tell me why.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it was the right framing, because it was both something that the Sue stuff is not new, right? You&#39;re extending things. It&#39;s also a reminder of the economic malaise that we&#39;re in. And I&#39;m sure the government would much more like to talk about what&#39;s coming and it&#39;s positive rather than here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to help mop up still the economic turmoil that has been wrought by COVID-19, which, by the way, is still going on, lest anybody forget.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The child care program, however, is it&#39;s not just, I think, going to be really popular and the fact that you can sell it as social infrastructure, the fact that you can sell it as part of an economic reimagining of this nation. But the politics almost province by province become fascinating. And it creates all sorts of different dynamics and i think not just on net but but very much in almost all cases if not all cases they favor the liberal government they put the conservatives into awkward positions so let&#39;s just use this as an example uh you have jason kenney now here in alberta saying well just give me the check i don&#39;t want your child care program i want the money and i want alberta to be able to run its own child care program from a point of view rooted in constitutionalism, not a crazy notion. Like, in what universe is the federal government responsible for childcare? That is so far outside of their lane.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">However, I think most Canadians are a little less worried about the watertight compartments of the Constitution, and they&#39;re more thinking, childcare sounds great. And now what does Aaron O&#39;Toole do? His conservative supporters, if they&#39;re parroting the line of the right-wing premier in Alberta, they</span>

            <span class="text">they might be saying, well, well, would you be willing to do this? Do you want to kill this? It creates weird pressures on Aaron O&#39;Toole, and it makes Aaron O&#39;Toole have to stand up in weird ways against something that&#39;s going to be pretty popular. So as much as I said there wasn&#39;t any real wedge in the budget, I guess I should say there was no unexpected wedge, and certainly not one where the Conservatives could stand up on Budget Day and say, yes, I&#39;m damn opposed to child care. But it creates weird tensions. And Alberta&#39;s an example, but it&#39;s not the only example, and the dynamics are different in each province, but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that there&#39;s a couple of things. First of all, going back to your initial framing, sure, the recovery is probably a bigger component of the spending, but that&#39;s old news. That&#39;s old news. It&#39;s over a year old. And old news, it doesn&#39;t work. You can&#39;t release the same thing indefinitely. Now, I will note that Trudeau and every government ever announces things multiple times, but But you don&#39;t get the same impact. The impact that he got from bringing in a new program that was, as Corey has articulated, it has wins across the country in different ways and in different fashions, both political as well as the pragmatic benefit for the people who are actually impacted. This is a good news story that he gets to own and control. It was brought in by the first female finance minister to bring in the budget. Um, these, these were meaningful words at a meaningful time with symbolism all worked in. Uh, so from my point of view, that, that was a, that was a slam dunk and it was also the right emphasis. You, you, you have to put the emphasis on what people want to hear. Um, and this was a good piece that people wanted to hear. It&#39;s a very easy story because I, you know, we, we talked a lot about this in the last episode. What is the story and can I see myself in that story? story. Yes, it&#39;s an easy to understand story and virtually every Canadian can see themselves in that story. The impact of $10 a day daycare would be felt by every family across</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">across the country. I know it would have made a significant difference for our family. We didn&#39;t have it because we had Harper or we didn&#39;t have it because we had Kretchen. We didn&#39;t have it because we didn&#39;t have Trudeau. And if you can see yourself in that story, then the story becomes instantly more more powerful.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what&#39;s the risk of the child care announcement? Is there one in your mind? They clearly have to play ball with or the provinces have to play ball in some ways. But is there a risk inherently in here around this is a really long runway to actually get to $10 a day child care across the country? Or is there any other risk that you feel like could be politically damaging for the Trudeau government?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, the risk, you&#39;ve identified them there. The big risk is really this is not done yet and if you&#39;re going to be negotiating with the provinces bit by bit things can get a little weird in a hundred different ways part of again why i think this would have been a great budget to go straight to an election on rather than having six months of awkward negotiations and people pointing out challenges with this problem perhaps even constitutional challenges from the provinces depending on how these things line up although obviously you&#39;ve got some precedent there with the with health and social transfers um the uh The other thing is, there are going to be people who do not necessarily benefit. But again, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the rubber hits the road. And all of a sudden, it becomes, okay, actually, my childcare is not aligned that way. I use a day home. This isn&#39;t going to help me. I just have a relative watch my kids overnight. This isn&#39;t going to help me. Maybe there should be some way it helps me. and that that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s going to be difficult for people as well because right now it&#39;s all in the land of pure possibility but this is going to be a big program and and it&#39;s kind of like again i&#39;ll point to health care when you think about the marvel of the fact that we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we collectively pool all of that risk we can have a kid in the NICU for two weeks and walk out without even signing a piece of paper it&#39;s like okay see you thanks for enjoying the health care system doesn&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t complain about it because the things that go wrong start to really get in our craw and we take for granted the things that go right. And the longer the program exists, I think the more you&#39;re going to have to deal with the things that go wrong. So that&#39;s one of the risks there. But because of the long lead times, I don&#39;t think that in practical terms, that&#39;s going to be too unmanageable because it&#39;s not as though these programs are going to be up and running coast to coast to coast before the next election comes along.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">discussion has been made. The impact on the individuals has been made. In fact, child care has been a discussion that we&#39;ve been talking about for years and years and years, decades, really. And this is the first opportunity or not the first, but this is the second, I think, to my recollection, big push by a federal government to try and bring in a national daycare program. This one, by being diffused amongst the provinces, gives it a much larger chance of success, provided the premiers themselves approach it seriously.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, over to you. Well, to Carter&#39;s jujitsu point, O&#39;Toole is accusing Trudeau of trying to reimagine the Canadian economy. Well, he can&#39;t do it without the premiers. And so it becomes a lot harder to suggest that this is some sort of wild, outrageous policy if all of a sudden you&#39;ve got all of the provinces lining up to say, yeah, that sounds pretty good to me. It makes it seem an awful lot more in the mainstream. stream it&#39;s not as though there&#39;s an awful lot of liberal governments across this country right now in the provinces so so it really does kind of create this um this kind of band of brothers and uh unfortunately it&#39;s all brothers right now i don&#39;t think we have any female premiers right now but uh it uh it makes it less likely to be something that you can point to and say is just totally outrageous out there policy because it&#39;s rooted in requiring consensus to move forward So it also seems to – I don&#39;t think the intention was directly to rebut this charge by Aaron O&#39;Toole, but we talked about this a few weeks ago. It&#39;s pretty clear what Aaron O&#39;Toole is trying to frame this election out as. And the way Justin Trudeau brought in child care here or proposes to bring in child care makes that charge harder to stick, right? And that&#39;s not worth nothing either.</span>

            <span class="text">risks overall in this budget. What are the risks that the Trudeau government has? I&#39;ll get to Corey&#39;s point about should they have run an election on this? What do they need to do in the interim? But we talked about risk on the childcare side, the big sort of centerpiece. Risks overall, the deficit number, the spending, you know, what could go wrong for them as they introduce this with that six-month lag that if you&#39;re on Team Trudeau right now, you&#39;re trying to either de-risk or or try to ensure, frankly, doesn&#39;t happen to begin with? If you&#39;re in that room, helping the Prime Minister and Katie Telford and that team to say, here&#39;s the priorities of things, great job this week. Here&#39;s a priority of things that could go wrong that we need to have a real pulse on. What are they? Start us on that list, Carter, and then I&#39;ll go to Corey to add to that list.</span>

Six months from now, oh, child care? Yeah, we&#39;ve been talking about child care forever. It&#39;s not that big a deal anymore.</span>

            <span class="text">is that people become very, very quickly accustomed to that which they didn&#39;t have before. I think the second risk is actually the more dangerous risk, and that is that we are creating an opportunity for a structural deficit to appear at the federal level, where the expenditures, the planned expenditures for the federal government just simply far and away outstrip the federal revenues. We&#39;ve been in a structural deficit in Alberta basically since 2007, because that&#39;s when we lost natural gas royalties. And once Once you&#39;re in a structural deficit, it is incredibly hard to get out of it without imagining some sort of a revenue change or significant expenditure change. And governments generally don&#39;t do very well with either of those things. Increasing expenses, super easy. Decreasing revenue, also super easy. But balancing the two just</span>

            <span class="text">just doesn&#39;t work. And so I think that there is a risk that this budget just sets us up for a structural deficit moving forward. Now, we could have an intellectual discussion about whether or not that matters or not. And that&#39;s always an interesting conversation. But I think that let&#39;s play the game as though it will matter to the Canadian population at some point. And I think that if that is the case, then this could very easily lead to a much more significant structural deficit than one that we&#39;ve seen at the federal level for a long time.</span>

And so it&#39;s kind of easy to accept and embrace. And in fact, it&#39;s like the liberal version of a wealth tax, isn&#39;t it? I mean, it doesn&#39;t go quite as – I&#39;m blown away by how much money it apparently raises. It&#39;s really quite a popular little tax, and you don&#39;t normally see taxes being popular.

            <span class="text">it was 700 and some pages. It gave a lot of detail. It was very prescriptive about how this money is being spent. One of the things that this budget had, and I don&#39;t know if it was the first time or just the first time I noticed, but pages for each of these spending programs that gave a GBA plus analysis, or it wasn&#39;t called that, but that was a component of it as well, that effectively said these are the people who are going to benefit from the spending. These provinces, these demographics, women more than men in this case, men more than women in this case. And as a result of all of these sheets that kind of gave us that summary of who it benefits, you could basically learn a lot. Like there&#39;s not a lot of mysteries still to come in the budget as a result. I&#39;m sure there are some. I&#39;m sure there will be – there is money that&#39;s been identified as just like almost like not – Like plush fundy almost. Well, yeah. I mean that&#39;s kind of the negative way to look at it. Sure. It&#39;s probably the accurate way to look at it. But there&#39;s, I</span>

But what if we did something where, what if Trudeau did something where he called the election in the middle of August for early September? It really doesn&#39;t give you that much time to kind of move past what has come in, right? Realistically, the summer is going to be lost. We&#39;re not going to be talking a lot about politics during the summer. So why not call it a little bit earlier, get it out of the way instead of having to wait longer? I think that he</span>

But he certainly can think about different and creative ways to get himself to that election. I do feel like this is an election budget. And I do think that there&#39;s still I don&#39;t want to call it slush funds, but there are still funds to be allocated, especially around the recovery. In the back of my little head, it was about $100 billion that&#39;s in the budget, but less articulated. And I think, you know, it</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I was going to say one of the things that&#39;s not in the budget, at least in any kind of large amount, and it was one of those things people thought might be, is infrastructure spending. spending there&#39;s there&#39;s not a lot of mention of infrastructure spending now there&#39;s two ways to read that one is the message that the government has largely bled out there which is well you know this is actually not a great time for infrastructure spending the cost of inputs is very high um this is not a</span>

            <span class="text">recession that has hit those sectors particularly badly that&#39;s some of the activity that&#39;s continued the other idea is maybe there&#39;s more to come on that front maybe maybe there are some big splashy spends that can come down the road because it&#39;s not as though governments are are always so wise with their infrastructure spending. They&#39;re always spending counter-cyclically. Like, often they will hold it back because it&#39;s of benefit during an election as well. So who knows? But, yeah, Carter&#39;s right. I mean, $100 billion is a lot. You start getting kind of this notion of, I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, here&#39;s where I want to play strategist mode for a second then, because this will sound a little stupid, maybe a little crazy, but could the $100 billion of spending been a weird trial balloon to see how people react? And if they&#39;re like, whatever, that&#39;s cool. That&#39;s a useful program. Could that give you the justification to perhaps spend more? Another $100 heading into, I&#39;m just making that number up, but another big program that maybe you&#39;ve held back and now you you feel like, damn it, the political will might be there to announce that on the run-up to the election. So, Carter, from strategist perspective, what would you perhaps advise the Trudeau government? And let&#39;s just assume a fall election. We don&#39;t know more than that. Let&#39;s assume the fall speculation is correct, or to your point, that announced in summer to fall. What do they need to have to ready themselves for that election as it relates to further promises?</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m such a big fan of small ball. Small ball is, is where things go, right? Like, uh, 2 million to $2 billion, uh, to improve recreation facilities. But instead of making it $2 billion to improve recreational facilities, You take that across the country, and you put $100 million into the province of Alberta for recreational facilities, but now it&#39;s not even the province of Alberta. It&#39;s going to be $20 million for Calgary, and you actually can point to the fields that they&#39;re going to change, or you&#39;re going to point to the arenas that they&#39;re going to build. That stuff matters to people. $100 billion is meaningless. It&#39;s just a big, big number that people can&#39;t understand. Pointing to projects that can be done for less, that kind of small money, small ball in my community is actually very, very valuable. So that would be my strategy is take that $100 billion, call it the local recovery fund, and put money into local recovery one step at a time.</span>

I&#39;m not as big a fan of small investments as Stephen, but I do like small investments that tell a bigger story and start to roll up. And it&#39;s not so much that you spent money in my neighborhood, but you spent it on child care, because you&#39;re investing in social infrastructure. Oh, yeah, this is the government that invests in social infrastructure. I think that has more value than just kind of, you know, putting putting a new parking lot in the curling rink, because I think the expectation over time has become, well, the next government&#39;s going to do stuff like that, too, who gives a shit, right? So it&#39;s investments that you think the other guys wouldn&#39;t necessarily make, is my belief is probably money that&#39;s better spent. in the purely crassly political context, not in the context of what&#39;s</span>

And you go and you say, not good enough. You know, you&#39;re making a mockery of the House of Commons. It&#39;s about the confidence of the House. It&#39;s not about votes. It&#39;s about the feeling that you have or you don&#39;t have. And this is coming up to works. Look at how committees are working right now. We want a mandate.

            <span class="text">Doug Ford. I mean, this seems like once again, also eons ago, but just this past Thursday, Doug Ford apologized to Ontarians. He apologized on Thursday morning in a press conference days after his government faced intense backlash for introducing a number of additional COVID-19 restrictions that were not recommended by health experts. And then, of course, nixed that same weekend. Ford was isolating, another factor around this, around paid sick leave. So Ford himself was isolating at his late mother&#39;s house in Etobicoke after a staff member tested positive, said that he was very sorry. Simply put, we got it wrong. We made a mistake. These decisions, they left a lot of people really concerned. For that, I&#39;m really sorry and apologize. apologized and then also added, I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and we moved too fast. Stephen Carter, what did you make of the Doug Ford teary</span>

Why are you apologizing? Why are you backtracking? So both of those things, Initial thoughts, and then also, how do you reconcile the conventional political wisdom that we often talk about on this show relating to doubling down?</span>

            <span class="text">everything was contradictory, and people didn&#39;t know what to expect. You want to be clear, right? When you&#39;re making a decision, when you&#39;re doubling down, you want clarity to be the order of the day. And Doug Ford didn&#39;t have clarity. Doug Ford instead had confusion and chaos, and people were responding exceptionally negatively. I like the apology. I think that apologies work in general. I came up during the Ralph Klein—he didn&#39;t cry. Ralph Klein never cried when he apologized. But he would often reverse course and say, I&#39;ve listened to Martha and Henry. and this is what they&#39;re saying. And now we&#39;re going to go a different direction because that&#39;s the type of fellow that I am.</span>

I&#39;m going to be, you know, he is a populist as, as a populist, uh, you were supposed to do what the general population is, thinks is popular. Uh, that, that type of, of leadership, uh, strikes me as very much in the, in the wheelhouse of Doug Ford.</span>

But I want to talk about one thing which might actually encompass all of that, which is that first quarter fundraising numbers are out and the Alberta NDP have more than doubled the UCP and Q1 fundraising according to elections Alberta numbers that were released. released late last week. Corey Hogan, how big of a deal is this?</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">conventional wisdom has always been for many, many years, and it&#39;s changing in a hurry. And when you look at the United States, you can see it sort of seesaws back and forth, who&#39;s the money leader. But the conventional wisdom for a long time has been that right-wing political parties have a natural fundraising edge, You know, their economic message appeals to wealthier Albertans or the types of people who get riled up by these situations are more likely to be in the conservative camp. And so the idea that the NDP could not just out-fundraise the conservatives, the UCP, but double them, but lap them, I mean, that&#39;s really significant. And it&#39;s really significant for a number of different reasons. First of all, obviously money helps you win elections. Let&#39;s just call the obvious one right there. Second, and that&#39;s part of why we&#39;re talking about it right now, the optics of it are – they&#39;re dramatic. It doesn&#39;t look like, yeah, they&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they&#39;re kind of close. Let&#39;s put it this way. The UCP is closer to raising as much money as the Alberta party, a third party with no seats in our legislature, than they are to raising the amount of money that the NDP had, right? I mean, that&#39;s really pretty damning when you&#39;re the governing party. And the other thing, and let&#39;s call this 2A, the last time this happened last year, the UCP sort of brushed it off as, well, we&#39;re the government. We weren&#39;t fundraising during COVID. We were focused on different things. So no big deal, the NDP.</span>

            <span class="text">buying it anymore, right? Like at this point, that&#39;s pretty difficult to continue to use those lines. So the kind of the excuses for it are like they&#39;re not going to land as well with the party, which leads me into kind of point three, which is if you are a political party as large as the UCP, if you have a caucus as large as the UCP and you&#39;ve got as much discontent kind of bubbling out there as the UCP does, according to reporting, this</span>

            <span class="text">this is really not going to help, right? This is going to reinforce a lot of the narratives of Albertans are turning against us. We&#39;ve got to turn this around. What the hell is happening? They&#39;re voting with their wallets right now, which is something the UCP was always happy to say when they were the fundraising leaders against the NDP. But now the shoe is on the other foot.</span>

Corey talks about this voting with the wallets. There&#39;s also several other items going on here. If we talk about indicators paralleling this with the UCP, there&#39;s obviously these letters within constituency associations trying to collect signatures to get Jason Kenney to resign. How troubling is this if you&#39;re Jason Kenney? Is this just another proof point or is this a particularly bad proof point when you&#39;re the UCP? This</span>

One is that third parties were basically non-existent.</span>

            <span class="text">mean, we&#39;re talking just in a totally different ballpark here and um and so this is also a bit of a proof point that we really are landing into a heads-up election here maybe there will be people who are pulling a vote one way or the other maybe on the quote-unquote left you&#39;ll have a liberal party take a few percent of the vote from the ndp maybe on the quote-unquote right you&#39;ll have the western independence party take a few votes from the ucp but by and large it looks like there&#39;s two battleships that are going to be out there just just knocking each other around and that that&#39;s an interesting thing to consider as we move into an election historically people have said that&#39;s not great for the ndp i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s the case anymore i i&#39;ve not really been sure that&#39;s the case for a while um because in 2015 the number of people who voted left and voted right if you want to aggregate we&#39;re about even and of course the ndp have been leading in the polls for seven months at this point but to sort of see that like that that has a consideration for the election to come and then the other thing is this is the party money but we do need to sort of note that there is a fair bit of dark money floating out there in third party advertising which could still affect these things in interesting ways that we&#39;ve yet to see cory</span>

            <span class="text">Our leader is working day in, day out in the legislature, in the halls of government to keep Albertans safe. And it&#39;s not surprising that in an environment like that, where the opposition leader can go around to fundraisers, can work phone calls, can try to work Albertans up and scare them, you know, a threat to public health, but to the benefit of their coffers. It&#39;s not surprising in that environment that the NDP would be successful in fundraising. But at the end of the day, Albertans know the UCP have their back, which is why we expect these fundraising numbers will turn around once we&#39;re out of this moment. And we can have an honest conversation about these things. And our leader can be out there talking to Albertans in a way that we know resonates with them.</span>

That&#39;s going to be very appealing to a certain section of Albertans. That said, you don&#39;t want to give the sense that you have so much money. You&#39;re like, you know, that Brandon Stevens, the NDP provincial secretary is like Scrooge McDuck, just swimming around and it just happened. old time uh so it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s good it&#39;s money uh it tells us an awful lot about the fact that albertans are frustrated with this government they are they&#39;re letting us know that through their spending here but don&#39;t kid yourself they control the government that gives them a huge communications advantage don&#39;t kid yourself they have all of their friends with with dark money that&#39;s going to be flooding into this election just look at last election when all of the used used car dealerships pooled together to push against the NDP, they&#39;re in the lead, even if it looks like they&#39;re halfway behind us, because they have access to all of this money. Perhaps you go so far as even to say somewhat unscrupulous money. And we&#39;ve got to be three times as good as them to be in the game with them. And you&#39;ve got to create that sense of, you know, sweat on the back of people&#39;s necks. Like, that&#39;s great. We&#39;re at 1.2 million. It&#39;s great that only 600,000 came came in, you know, relatively, we&#39;re doing fine in that sense. But this isn&#39;t just about Albertans. This is about all of the levers they feel totally comfortable pulling that they shouldn&#39;t pull. Corey, would you characterize that as embracing an underdog status?</span>

Yes, we have this money, but it&#39;s not enough. So you are trying to give two messages at the same time. One is kind of the, there&#39;s really only one game in town message, but the other one is, but it&#39;s still not enough. We need more.

So with another eight quarters to go before there&#39;s another election, you have to gather as much money as possible. And I would maybe stop fighting the UCP and start fighting special interests. There are 32 political third-party advertisers in Alberta. Those have unlimited amounts of money that can be flowed into them them from corporations and other interests that are against the NDP.</span>
