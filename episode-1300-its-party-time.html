It also has a creation of political parties at the municipal level, but Carter, it&#39;s a pilot project. It&#39;s a pilot project only taking place in Edmonton and Calgary. That latter part is what I want to spend spend the bulk of the time on, which is the municipal political parties. It has been telegraphed for a while. It is here. But I&#39;d be remiss to say that there isn&#39;t a whole ton of other stuff in here.

Are they now just taking the ability to take all the shit that a councillor or a mayor or council and mayor would get together and just wear that themselves?

You can imagine and you can pretend it&#39;s because local governance is really important and you want to have that local responsive government that&#39;s right there and it&#39;s it&#39;s ready to deal with the challenges that people have on a local level and</span>

A cabinet meets regularly, you know, at least once a week, more than that during session, maybe slightly less than that during the summer, but basically perpetually is my point. And anytime something comes up, they&#39;ll have this temptation to maybe intervene because, let&#39;s face it, when you&#39;ve got dozens and dozens of municipalities, there are dozens and dozens of opportunities for somebody to do something that seems wrong or dumb. And you&#39;re just going to have these examples come and you&#39;re going to have people say, well, if it wasn&#39;t built for this, what was it built for?

Like, you&#39;re going to see people hesitant at first and a little less hesitant, a little less, a little less, a little less, and then bam, they&#39;re in a lot of fucking trouble. I just think it&#39;s going to happen a lot faster than 40 years because of kind of the cadence of all of this.

But that doesn&#39;t change the conversation I want to have here, which is this is kind of rare for political operatives like us to have the opportunity to build something net new. The closest thing I&#39;m reminded of, and this is not a perfect comparison, is the hype that people had around cannabis when there was a net new industry that came online and people were like, well, we want to get on the ground floor of this. Whatever it takes to invest it, it&#39;s going to last for the next hundred years. Whoever the incumbent players become, they&#39;re going to be the incumbent players for the next hundred years in cannabis, a net new industry. That was the hype. That was the talk. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">This is the rest of the conversation I want to have, Carter, is how should us wide-eyed operatives, strategists, practitioners of the political craft, who&#39;ve always wanted to brand a party from scratch, name a party from scratch, house a party infrastructure, recruit candidates, things that we&#39;ve been doing for other mastheads, which we have values alignment, but they&#39;re not our own. Oh, my goodness. Maybe if you create this, maybe you you lead this. Maybe you&#39;re the perpetual leader of this. Maybe you tell the mayor what to do. Maybe you tell 15 council candidates what to do. Again? Again.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So what I want is a clear-eyed, strategic point of view in this episode where we spit out to say, how should we think about creating political parties here if the end outcome is we want to create a political party? The Strategist podcast, how are we thinking about this? How are we taking the lessons from previous political creations upstarting, from cannabis, from other startups, from the political dynamics right now between province and city, from the council dynamics of unpopular councils in the two cities we&#39;re talking about, to mayors that are struggling with their popularity as well? well, let&#39;s have a clear-eyed, one-page memo that comes out of this conversation that gives us a sense of how we should think about this, because we&#39;re not like the rest, Carter. We&#39;re better than the rest, and we&#39;re going to have better thinking than the rest, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And the money side changed significantly in this bill. If Bill 20 is passed and becomes law, TPAs are all but finished. And TPAs were super important in the last number number of elections. Third-party advertisers is what a TPA stands for.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They used to be able to get donations worth $30,000. It was going to be $35,000 this time around from corporations and unions to use in election advertising. Now, that donation limit&#39;s been dropped to $5,000.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">At the same time that each individual candidate is able to raise $5,000 from corporations and unions. So why would you set up a TPA? You can already raise $5,000 from each corporation. This is going to be a major cash inflow for candidates.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">should I form a party? And one of the reasons why would be to balance off revenue opportunities. the revenue i mean i would assume didn&#39;t like most political parties and we don&#39;t know this because it&#39;s going to be done by regulation um yeah but</span>

And they&#39;re not going to cover everybody&#39;s policy releases unless they&#39;re like supremely bad, right? It&#39;s super hard to get media attention.

I appreciate the analysis on the candidate side, but let&#39;s keep our hats on as strategists. How are we creating the most attractive political vehicle, Carter? I&#39;m going to go back to you. So first, your analysis was on the money. Then it was the binary question on, should we start a party or not? I&#39;m leaning towards the answer is yes, both from an academic exercise of this podcast, but also to Corey&#39;s point, very astutely put, for the counselors that are going to need a home, how do we build the nicest, most welcome, open door, best furnished home for them? What else do we need to think about, Carter? I&#39;m turning it over to you. And Corey, I&#39;ll get you to yes and and add some pieces to what Carter&#39;s about to say to pick</span>

Or are the strategists, in this case, to be very specific, the three of us in this hypothetical scenario, still running the party? That, you know, if we don&#39;t like that mayoral candidate, they don&#39;t succeed, Veldra United still keeps going. Our party is still strong, strong, so to speak, you know, that we&#39;ve got an infrastructure that, you know, yes, the mayoral candidate is the leader, but we&#39;re like, we&#39;ve started this thing, we leave this thing.

One of the interesting things that we are going to have to contend with as cities as we start thinking about how these things come together is that there are existing candidates known as sitting councillors. they have existing positions uh there will be insane opportunity for conflict if you try to put multiple people in the same boat together there they all have volunteers they all have infrastructure they might be able to sign in on principle on something and then really come apart on specifics down the road an issue comes up it could fracture the coalition before the coalition ever runs together and that&#39;s a real interesting challenge and that&#39;s a challenge that&#39;s unique to this time because you could easily imagine if we also didn&#39;t have councils until 2024 right</span>

We&#39;ve got the six people that have raised money historically. You know, we already have this. So give to me, like, what your lessons and your model would look like for recruitment. Would speed be part of it? And how would you court existing folks? Or are you of the mind saying, fuck the existing folks? This is unpopular counsel. It&#39;s unpopular. I don&#39;t care.

Would you go a little bit slower? Would you see how other things play out? Would you let others be on the bleeding edge so you can be on the cutting edge sort of thing in this sense? I&#39;m almost kind of bringing back cannabis as an example, right? Would you let others fail so, you know, you can kind of, you know, see what&#39;s true, Through who&#39;s who, not necessarily rush it, so to speak. How are you thinking about it? I&#39;m not imposing my view on that. I&#39;m just kind of throwing alternative options on the table.</span>

Or else you are going to get something like the cannabis situation where, despite there being four other cannabis streets or shops on the street, you&#39;re going to open the fifth and you think it&#39;s all going to work out great for you. No, that&#39;s going to fuck everything up for everybody, right? So I do think that before you even get to like that, the how can you, you should think, should I? And I do want to make sure that that&#39;s somewhat underlined there, because otherwise it&#39;s going to be chaos over the next bit. it, but I think that&#39;s going to be a big problem. In terms of if I was trying to build a party and I was trying to make it the most appealing party possible, especially, so here&#39;s what I believe is going to happen.</span>

And the first time that they lose a vote, they being the winning coalition, because somebody broke with them because there&#39;s a weak whip, they&#39;ll say, well, that didn&#39;t work. And next time, let&#39;s make it more clear. And let&#39;s, let&#39;s get a little bit more to the party. And let&#39;s just keep going on this particular front.

We&#39;ve talked at length about Calgary And Edmonton, in a sense, we&#39;ve talked at length about, you know, the type of swing and control. So we&#39;ll add those to the list. Talk to me specifically about branding. How would you think about it here? Any lessons? Because we could easily overcomplicate branding, but we could also underthink it in certain ways. You know, one of the ways we could potentially underthink is kind of the example I threw out there, which I also wouldn&#39;t advocate for, which is, you know, create a vehicle, slap Edmonton in front of one another, one Calgary in front of another one, call it a day, right? Like, make it that obvious. How would you start thinking about branding if you were starting a political party as a strategist? Well,</span>

And I do ultimately worry that this becomes the departmentalization of municipal government. And it&#39;s just, it&#39;s going to have effects. So probably I would say that&#39;s the worst.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">broaden my point. Nothing is more important in an election than trust. You have to trust that the system has worked. So anything we add in that erodes that trust has to be done very, very carefully. And the benefit has to exceed the potential consequence there. And so we do things like special ballots, because we think it&#39;s very important people have the ability to vote, right? That&#39;s a benefit that we really feel way outweighs the fact that it erodes the trust a little bit. People say, I don&#39;t really know how these special ballots work. People are just getting them. I&#39;m never seeing these people. They&#39;re not showing up. But we weigh that that special ballot&#39;s more important. Similarly with advanced polls. Now it&#39;s not all on the same day. You&#39;ve got to put boxes in a certain area. They&#39;re not being watched around the clock by all of the scrutineers, as used to be the case in elections in our lifetime, right? But we say it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s worth it because you don&#39;t have to be available at a certain time. We&#39;re making it so that everybody can vote. That&#39;s a central tenet of democracy. So again, we&#39;re weighing these things and we&#39;re saying it&#39;s worth it. The challenge is, with tabulators in my mind, the upside&#39;s just not there. There&#39;s no fucking upside besides our own amusement on election night. And so you can say, yeah, it&#39;s a tinfoil hypergrade. Yeah, they&#39;re a bunch of idiots. Yeah, it&#39;s crazy.</span>
