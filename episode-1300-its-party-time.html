        <p>The gang dive into Alberta's Bill 20 - specifically, upcoming creation of political parties in Calgary and Edmonton. Zain asks: what does Bill 20 mean? How do you build a political party? What needs to be considered? And is Justin Trudeau available to do this next week?</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the impending creation of municipal political parties in Calgary and Edmonton - the strategic considerations in setting them up, the tactics to position them for success and more. How do you create a new political party from scratch? What level of coordination can we expect to see between politicians - within cities and between cities? And when it comes to podcast hosting, do we think Justin Trudeau is more of an Annalise or a Zain? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

That latter part is what I want to spend spend the bulk of the time on, which is the municipal political parties. It has been telegraphed for a while. It is here.

Are they now just taking the ability to take all the shit that a councillor or a mayor or council and mayor would get together and just wear that themselves? To me, that seems like the most intriguing and perhaps most problematic strategic part of Bill 20, even if I was a supporter of the UCP.</div>

You have effectively, by saying cabinet now has the ability to rewrite bylaws, you know, rescind bylaws, get rid of councillors that people don&#39;t like, you have effectively made every municipal problem your problem.

You can imagine and you can pretend it&#39;s because local governance is really important and you want to have that local responsive government that&#39;s right there and it&#39;s it&#39;s ready to deal with the challenges that people have on a local level and</div>

A cabinet meets regularly, you know, at least once a week, more than that during session, maybe slightly less than that during the summer, but basically perpetually is my point. And anytime something comes up, they&#39;ll have this temptation to maybe intervene because, let&#39;s face it, when you&#39;ve got dozens and dozens of municipalities, there are dozens and dozens of opportunities for somebody to do something that seems wrong or dumb.

The closest thing I&#39;m reminded of, and this is not a perfect comparison, is the hype that people had around cannabis when there was a net new industry that came online and people were like, well, we want to get on the ground floor of this. Whatever it takes to invest it, it&#39;s going to last for the next hundred years. Whoever the incumbent players become, they&#39;re going to be the incumbent players for the next hundred years in cannabis, a net new industry. That was the hype. That was the talk. Yeah.</div>

Oh, my goodness. Maybe if you create this, maybe you you lead this. Maybe you&#39;re the perpetual leader of this. Maybe you tell the mayor what to do.

The Strategist podcast, how are we thinking about this? How are we taking the lessons from previous political creations upstarting, from cannabis, from other startups, from the political dynamics right now between province and city, from the council dynamics of unpopular councils in the two cities we&#39;re talking about, to mayors that are struggling with their popularity as well? well, let&#39;s have a clear-eyed, one-page memo that comes out of this conversation that gives us a sense of how we should think about this, because we&#39;re not like the rest, Carter.

Would you let others fail so, you know, you can kind of, you know, see what&#39;s true, Through who&#39;s who, not necessarily rush it, so to speak. How are you thinking about it? I&#39;m not imposing my view on that. I&#39;m just kind of throwing alternative options on the table.</div>

No, that&#39;s going to fuck everything up for everybody, right? So I do think that before you even get to like that, the how can you, you should think, should I?

          <div class="said">Talk to me about branding for a second, Corey. Carter&#39;s kind of said, you know, like pick a lane was one of his items on the list, he also says, pick a headline or discuss the structure. We&#39;ve talked at length about Calgary And Edmonton, in a sense, we&#39;ve talked at length about, you know, the type of swing and control. So we&#39;ll add those to the list. Talk to me specifically about branding. How would you think about it here? Any lessons? Because we could easily overcomplicate branding, but we could also underthink it in certain ways. You know, one of the ways we could potentially underthink is kind of the example I threw out there, which I also wouldn&#39;t advocate for, which is, you know, create a vehicle, slap Edmonton in front of one another, one Calgary in front of another one, call it a day, right? Like, make it that obvious. How would you start thinking about branding if you were starting a political party as a strategist? Well,</div>

          <div class="said">broaden my point. Nothing is more important in an election than trust. You have to trust that the system has worked. So anything we add in that erodes that trust has to be done very, very carefully. And the benefit has to exceed the potential consequence there. And so we do things like special ballots, because we think it&#39;s very important people have the ability to vote, right? That&#39;s a benefit that we really feel way outweighs the fact that it erodes the trust a little bit. People say, I don&#39;t really know how these special ballots work. People are just getting them. I&#39;m never seeing these people. They&#39;re not showing up. But we weigh that that special ballot&#39;s more important. Similarly with advanced polls. Now it&#39;s not all on the same day. You&#39;ve got to put boxes in a certain area. They&#39;re not being watched around the clock by all of the scrutineers, as used to be the case in elections in our lifetime, right? But we say it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s worth it because you don&#39;t have to be available at a certain time. We&#39;re making it so that everybody can vote. That&#39;s a central tenet of democracy. So again, we&#39;re weighing these things and we&#39;re saying it&#39;s worth it. The challenge is, with tabulators in my mind, the upside&#39;s just not there. There&#39;s no fucking upside besides our own amusement on election night. And so you can say, yeah, it&#39;s a tinfoil hypergrade. Yeah, they&#39;re a bunch of idiots. Yeah, it&#39;s crazy.</div>
