            <span class="text">But we have shit to talk about in the Patreon segment, I will say. Not much planning goes in the show, but we have done a bit of planning, which is I&#39;m going to get Shannon&#39;s take on the NDP leadership, federal NDP leadership. She&#39;s got shit to share. And Carter is going to explain to me the theory of the race race for 28 races municipally in calgary and edmonton how he thinks this thing is going to go how he thinks he has a chance to win let&#39;s say more than half of them i&#39;m</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i think you&#39;re i think you&#39;re in trouble for more than that reason uh carter thank you we&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get to the theory of the race municipally we&#39;ll get to shannon uh and her thoughts on the federal ndp leadership race now that we officially have two two candidates, Anavi Lewis and Heather McPherson. But before we get into all of that, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, not all labor is created equal. Guys, I want to talk about two strikes.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We talked at length about the CUPE strike with flight attendants, but we&#39;ve got this potential strike with the Alberta Teachers Association here in Alberta. And then the postal workers, in their response to the government, have now gone on strike.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I want to start with a very top-line question. We can get into the details of both of these. For example, as we record today on Monday, teachers are voting right now. Shannon, correct me if I&#39;m wrong. Carter, correct me if I&#39;m wrong. I believe we should have a sense of that by today, tomorrow, in terms of what the results of the teachers&#39; vote on their potential strike looks like, which is scheduled for later on, first week of October, i.e. next week. and we can talk about the details of the government and their plans on the COPW strike that is now active with postal workers. However, I want to start with a very top-line question. And let me start with you, Shannon.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And it&#39;s more of an observation than a question that I get you to respond on.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">For neither of these groups, the teachers in Alberta or the postal workers federally, this doesn&#39;t feel like the same level of sympathy and energy that flight attendants had.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Uh, and, uh, you know, flight attendants hit, uh, just a moment in time and a certain, uh, uh, issue set that, that, uh, allowed them tremendous public sympathy and that everybody understands the concept of sitting on the tarmac, twiddling your thumbs and the idea that the people sitting in the aircraft with you, uh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">uh, aren&#39;t being paid for that time struck people, I think, uh, uh, as, uh, being a little off. and um and i think also people learning how little uh flight attendants actually make where they were like what because you know back in the day it used to be a fancy job uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">uh and i think people were shocked to learn like they have learned with pilots as well that it&#39;s not that fancy anymore and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">think with teachers you&#39;re gonna see it start with about you You know, it&#39;ll fall on partisan lines, let&#39;s say 50-50, with public sympathy, and it&#39;ll go down over time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Because that&#39;s just what it is, right? I mean, the government will take a hit, too, for sure.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">But it will essentially probably bounce out on the lines of partisanship here in Alberta.</span>

            <span class="text">I want to break down both of these. And let&#39;s start with the provincial one because we haven&#39;t spent a lot of time on this pod recently talking about the province. So let&#39;s dig in deeper into the teachers and their conditions because both of you mentioned this, which is the concept of bringing an agreement to membership and having not recommending it and having them turn that down. What is the public opinion sort of world there? But before we get there, let me just kind of lay out some of the facts, right? Right. So teachers voted over across the weekend. They&#39;re voting as we speak right now. By the time we record, I don&#39;t know when results will come out, but you should expect to hear them relatively soon. So they&#39;re they&#39;re voting right now. This is a vote on a 12 percent pay rise over four years. Three thousand additional teachers and coverage for the covid-19 vaccine. Those three things seem to be the headline, which you can get the whole back stuff in a moment in a different segment. If they just if they if they turn this deal down, Carter, their strike begins on the sixth. This affects 50,000 plus teachers, 51,000, oddly, nearly 750,000 students. And there is no, materially, I think this is important, they do not receive strike pay and time spent during the strike would affect pensionable income as well, which I think is just worthy of mentioning as factors. But I want to get to the core of this, which is as strategists, as folks who kind of run and understand the political situation. Stephen, let me start with you.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Actually having an agreement that you turn down, does that change the PR game? Does that change the public opinion game versus trying to reach a deal and having a participant in government not not budging at all? In this case, you could argue government has budged, even though this deal is virtually identical to what was initially offered that they&#39;ve turned down before. But the government&#39;s playing ball, which is slightly different than at least from a public opinion perspective, in my mind. Am I right? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think this is mostly an internal exercise, right? Before you go on strike, go back to your membership and just say, hey, I just wanted to clarify, this is what we&#39;re being offered and we&#39;re all against this, right? So when they get a, what one would expect would be a fairly significant rejection, then they get to walk back into the negotiating room prior to the strike date and say, listen, our membership knows what&#39;s at stake here. that&#39;s this or strike they&#39;ve chosen strike so you best get yourself ready for it um that to me uh strengthens the bargaining position uh i&#39;m still you know not a great big fan of recommending something to the or of not recommending something to be signed but i got it i understand what&#39;s going on so um it&#39;s it&#39;s about pulling together everybody and making sure that uh everybody&#39;s on on the same team and i suspect um 80 plus percentage will be on the same team what</span>

They&#39;ve got an ad campaign right now. I&#39;ve seen it, I believe, on television, a 30-second spot that they&#39;re running. Horner&#39;s mentioned that they&#39;re putting money behind it. Their campaign focuses on classroom investment, teacher pay raise, and the commitment to labor stability. They haven&#39;t gone down the... I mean, there&#39;s obviously a subtext to what Shannon is saying around lazy teachers, public sector workers. They haven&#39;t explicitly gone there, but they&#39;re starting to shape public opinion. So what is the scope of the challenge for the ATA here? And how would you kind of anticipate the government&#39;s next move as a strategist? And like, what would you start thinking about in terms of message on your end?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think that when you&#39;re dealing with the government, you do have to win the public relations war. You know, it&#39;s not a private corporation that you can just keep your workers solidarity together and hope for the best. This is a PR war as much as it&#39;s anything else. And the ATA needs to come equipped, recognizing that most of the families that you are impacting are going to be pretty steamed. There are not many families that can accommodate a teacher strike with ease. Especially families of lesser means are really going to be struggling with this teacher strike. And there&#39;s going to be some bitterness towards teachers. So you must make sure that there is a very solid communication strategy. And I&#39;m waiting to see it from the ATA. I haven&#39;t yet seen the ATA&#39;s communications work. Before</span>

            <span class="text">goes back, I want to jump in on this. This goes back to some of the research that we&#39;ve done on voice, you know, what the more effective voices are. And Shannon&#39;s completely right. The peer-to-peer voices are way more efficient and effective than any government voice or corporation voice. Even formalized voices like teachers don&#39;t perform as well as parents do. So if the ATA is able to put together some super strong communications featuring parents, I think that they&#39;ll be in a really strong position, more like my 70-30 than Shannon&#39;s 50-50.</span>

And what could that and should that look like? because there is a timing thing here, which is like if you go in and even though we&#39;re different unions, if you go at it like this will affect us, like, you know, this push, we want to help you be successful so that eventually when we come to the strike, you know, position that we could be successful. How do you kind of see labor solidarity playing out here in the province with the teachers should and all of our conversation today is presuming that by five o&#39;clock today, this teacher&#39;s vote to go on strike, right? But like, how do you think labor solidarity plays out?</span>

            <span class="text">i don&#39;t know if it matters too much beyond what is the usual thing which is you know the other unions show up to the big rallies and they wave their flags and they are you know quote unquote in solidarity what does that mean well sometimes it can mean helping out shoring up strike funds or other legal defense funds this kind of stuff because sometimes things can get spicy either in the courtroom or on the picket line uh and you need lawyers and that&#39;s what the house of labor is for and that&#39;s what labor solidarity is for now eta are not uh formally affiliated to the federation of labor or</span>

            <span class="text">final sort of strain of thinking here, which is help me develop the government&#39;s escalation plan here from a comms perspective, right? From a labor negotiation perspective, we can leave that aside for a moment. But from a comms perspective, I mentioned earlier, they&#39;ve gone with this investment in classrooms, teacher pay raise, commitment to labor stability, a strong classroom investment as like their broader sort of theme. they&#39;ve got 50,000 teachers in some ways you know you could look at the teachers that shannon mentioned in two ways that&#39;s 50,000 incredible spokespeople for the teacher&#39;s cause but you only need to peel off a few of them after they don&#39;t get you know there&#39;s no strike pay here there&#39;s no there&#39;s no sort of like this can impact pensionable income does the government try to poach teachers on the other side of this argument does the government not do that how does the government escalate this meaningfully in their public opinion war that we anticipate that they probably will in some way?</span>

And then, you know, actively the liberal government actively campaigned on that will end the Harper era community mailboxes.

Many of our listeners have probably put no flyers, please, on their mailbox, which actually reduces Canada Post&#39;s ability to make a profit.

It&#39;s not seeking a profit. It&#39;s just seeking not to lose handfuls of money every single day. Right? It is losing a fortune every year, and it is not sustainable. So even the changes that are coming down the pipe are minuscule compared to the size of the overall deficit that has been created by Canada Post&#39;s operations.

And this, of course, maps on to a time, you know, in that previous quarter where WTI had fallen to $28 a barrel and we had rapidly escalating unemployment. And the last thing that any Albertan needed to hear from their government was that they thought that they were elected to hand out pink slips. And so it made for conflict.

You&#39;ve got a a couple of candidates. So like that&#39;s good in some ways, right? Like this is, let&#39;s be clear, this is the NDP, but this is also a party that doesn&#39;t have official status right now. So this is two things at the same time. What do you need to see if you&#39;re the party and what would be successful for you? At least let&#39;s give it a time frame of the next couple of months.</span>

It&#39;s hard to do during a leadership race, which is why this six month timeline is bananas. And, you know, know the kind of the far left got what they wanted out of the structure of it and it&#39;s too bad because it will hamstring the party but you want to see some some energy and some excitement and some of these you know uh membership</span>
