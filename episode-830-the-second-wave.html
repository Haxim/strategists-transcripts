            <span class="text">the goal is to catch them very slowly and say, you know what, this isn&#39;t half bad. This banter, I&#39;m here for it. There&#39;s one guy who talks about the outside. There&#39;s the other two guys who talk about anything. They&#39;re fluent in everything. Like they can talk about literally anything and everything. They choose not to. They choose to just entertain the other guy who wants to talk about the outside. But people are used to this. It&#39;s their warm milk that they come for.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let me tell you something, Zane. Raccoons are these little animals. They look like cats a bit, but they&#39;ve got these kind of like human claws, and they have little burglar masks. They&#39;re adorable. And you can find them outdoors. Apparently not around here, but apparently outdoors is where you would normally find them.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey and I are better than that. We&#39;re talking about the prime minister. Recently in a press conference this week, guys, the prime minister said that the resources that the federal government has at its disposal to battle COVID are not infinite, reminding the provinces of just that. And I want to double down on and double click in, I should say, into what&#39;s happening on the federal scene with the COVID-19 response slash lack thereof. If you recall our last podcast, we left it with a lightning round question where I asked you, hey, what do you guys think of the COVID-19 response federally? And you&#39;re like, what response? And that has not really changed over the past week. week. So Stephen, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. What do you make of Trudeau and his strategy to maybe bark a little bit and chirp a little bit from the sidelines, be a little passive-aggressive with the provinces, go around them and talk to the mayors as he has, and big city mayors, including our mayor here, Nahed Nenshi, but not imposing a national program, not really trying to throw any sharp elbows. Talk to me about what you make of it, and then talk to me maybe about where you think the strategy here is coming from?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I have two thoughts. The first thought is that he&#39;s simply not pleased with how the provinces are managing it, especially the provinces that are being led by, you know, Brian Pallister and Jason Kenney and Doug Ford, you know, and Quebec. I mean, we&#39;re seeing significant increases across the country. This second wave is real. It appears to be happening, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, in the vast in in the most populated areas of the country and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and that&#39;s real and and the prime minister is is bringing attention to it but i also think that the second the second side of his coin in this particular case is that they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they went through a lot of money very very quickly they spent they pulled the trigger on virtually everything in the first first wave um and now they&#39;re hitting the second wave the second wave is is significantly worse and they&#39;re trying to figure out now what what to do. Because you can&#39;t throw all the money all the time. There are limits, I suppose. One could argue that there aren&#39;t true limits. I mean, we can do a lot of different things. But I think that Trudeau is looking at this and saying, Jesus, somebody better get this under control because our spending doesn&#39;t get anything under control. And we can&#39;t just allow that spending to continue ad infinitum.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, do you agree with that? Do you feel like this is Is this is about the money and perhaps the public&#39;s political appetite for the spending? That&#39;s why he&#39;s trying to hold off on perhaps some national programs or national incentives to get the provinces going?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we have spent a lot of money as a country to deal with COVID-19 more than basically anywhere else in the world and not necessarily getting better outcomes. We talked about this a few months ago. ago, there was sort of this idea that the chickens may have to come home to roost at some point, and maybe they are. Maybe now when we are hitting this second wave, we find ourselves a little bit constrained in our ability to deal with it. The reality as well is that I think everybody&#39;s anxiety is at a different place now. Even though things are unquestionably worse as far as the number of cases, we&#39;re still not seeing the fatality rates we were earlier. The disease is better understood. People have also, you know, like frogs in boiling water, we&#39;ve gotten a bit used to the situation that we&#39;re in. And I&#39;m not sure that the public&#39;s tolerance for big grand federal actions is the same as it was in March or April of this year. So as the Prime Minister, he&#39;s got to sort of keep that in mind.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We live in Alberta, we are well aware that federal intervention is not always the most favored option. But let&#39;s also be really clear, that&#39;s also true of Quebec. And that&#39;s also true to a lesser extent of the other provinces as well. They don&#39;t tend to love when the federal government gets involved in areas of provincial jurisdiction, and health care is an area of provincial jurisdiction. Look, I mean, unless Trudeau is going to activate a bunch of marine hospitals, this is not an area of federal jurisdiction. This is where the federal government uses the power of the purse to get what they want, but as we&#39;ve talked about, the power of the purse is a bit limited. So what has he got besides the bully pulpit? Unless he wants to do this big swing and say, you know, this is – and you can absolutely make the case. This is so material federally to the existence of the country. We&#39;ve got to step into provincial jurisdiction.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s not a ton he can do besides frown and hector and offer the resources of PHAC, the Public Health Agency of Canada. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s all he&#39;s got. I guess he could also quarantine. I think quarantine is also a federal authority. He could literally quarantine provinces. But besides that, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, is the strategy of round one or wave one politically open to him right now? Or do you think that&#39;s off the table?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything new that&#39;s on the table. I think that I would be looking at round one and saying, okay, how can I make this more efficient? How can I make this better? Round one costs a tremendous amount of money. There is no bottomless pit. I I think that the biggest issues facing Canadians right now are about business closures, you know, because businesses, you know, there is a light at the end of the tunnel coming through vaccination that may be available to us that the federal government is prepared for. So</span>

So I don&#39;t think a one-program approach is necessarily the right approach. I get what Stephen is saying. I understand why he might want to re-bundle some of these economic supports.

Part two, we have this massive political agenda that we&#39;ve put in front of the window from the speech from the throne. Help us preserve both of those. Yes, we&#39;re working on the policy of COVID. Yes, we&#39;re going to do whatever needs to be done.

I&#39;ll tell you why, because they had that social safety net that we now need to build. And so it&#39;s putting that thread that connects those two pieces that Stephen was talking about. It&#39;s not that you want to build back better or whatever you want to use in this country to describe that for the sake of, but you&#39;re drawing a clear line actually, frankly, even between your own failures and why you need to take the action that you&#39;re taking. thinking, because then it almost becomes self-reinforcing.

Your buddies are kind of blowing it, right?

So the way this works is I&#39;ll run through a half a dozen things that are happening in our home province, some with the UCP, some with organizations outside of politics, some with the NDP opposition party. And I&#39;ll ask you guys on a strategic level, if between 1 and 10, you know, we&#39;re not a rule bound podcast, except on this particular segment, you will answer me.</span>

And Carter, let&#39;s start with you. The first thing I have on the agenda is 1 to 10 on political strategy here. Jason Kenney, non-imposing new COVID restrictions despite record level cases that we&#39;re seeing in the province. Give me your score between 1 to 10 on what you make of this political strategy or this political decision by Jason Kenney.

It&#39;s more along the lines of good luck, let us know how it works out. And we&#39;re relying on school boards, much maligned school boards to try and make the best possible decisions. I think that the simplest things for him to do would be to implement some sort of a maximum cohort in schools, constraining the number of of people that are in any class at any given time um and then also to try and figure out how to do a mask mandate we must be wearing masks period end of sentence and i do not understand why he&#39;s not taking that low-hanging fruit so i&#39;m giving him a three zane on your random</span>

That&#39;s polling information, as he alluded to. That&#39;s health information. He&#39;s seen statistics presented to him in different ways that might be making him think about the problem differently. He&#39;s got a lot of experts, that expertise is right there. And those experts may have come to different calculations and different conclusions on everything from the fatality to the likelihood of people going to ICUs to where the demos are actually being hit. So we&#39;ve got to understand that. But he&#39;s also got economic information, and he might be downright terrified about the economic impacts on all of this here. I think that I would probably say what many have said to him, which is your economic problem is not the lockdown it&#39;s the disease i can tell you even my own behavior and not to kind of fall into this false consensus but this or this focus group of one but even</span>

We&#39;re now going to the NDP. You know, a couple of weeks ago, the NDP have launched a new sort of leaf in their political strategy. They&#39;ve started a new website called Alberta&#39;s Future, a platform to engage Albertans on the economy, building the future together. Quite simply, it&#39;s a platform that has proposals on a couple of things that the NDP care about, child care, the energy future, post-secondary, and are hosting a bunch of webinars to talk with their respective critics for each of those domains to kind of help the NDP construct policy positions for this future. So the question I have for you, we go back to the same 1 to 10 scale on strict political strategy, 1 being not so great, 10 being masterful. Where do you kind of place this in that spectrum for what the NDP have produced as their next sort of rallying cry for focusing some of their campaign and political attention to?</span>

It&#39;s work you can do through the caucus, no less. So that sounds super. The thing is, we, again, don&#39;t have information on where the NDP are perceived as weak or strong, but hopefully this is well aligned to polling that says, for example, Albertans need you to have an economic strategy, and they wouldn&#39;t mind if it looked like this, or Albertans need to know what your actual plan is. Like, I just hope there&#39;s a through line, I guess, is my thing. And if there&#39;s a through line, I&#39;d moderate my score up. If there&#39;s not, I would definitely moderate it down.

            <span class="text">Yeah, map it in that way is what I&#39;m hearing. That&#39;s a good segment. From one campaign to the next. Moving on to our next Alberta issue. Earlier this week, a new group called the Next 30 launched here in Alberta, a group that is filled with 30 individuals from across Alberta, at least from their initial headline statement that&#39;s putting together a possibility panel. Full disclosure, I&#39;m sure between the three of us, we know most of the folks that are on this panel, And they&#39;ve come out with a thesis that says, are you sick of polarization in Alberta? And if you&#39;re sick of polarization and partisanship, we want to, you know, encourage a dialogue. So the question I have is less about this group and more about the strategy of using polarization as a mechanism for dialogue for things that polarization and partisanship for mechanism of dialogues for things that might eventually need political</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think this strategy is better than the launch. I don&#39;t know how many of our listeners are going to be familiar with this particular thing. But long story short, this group announced with great fanfare. You can almost hear the fanfare, frankly, of we have come from the mountaintop to save you from partisanship. And, and I think that that&#39;s unfortunate, because I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what they were going for. But I certainly think that&#39;s how it came off to a lot of people here.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s such a fascinating question because I was discussing via Twitter with one of the organizers there and they were saying, well, it&#39;s possible to do this change outside of politics. Yeah. But like you&#39;re talking about second order effects in the sense that you are creating pressure on politics, which then decides they&#39;ve got to go do something right. Like politicians are still ultimately going to determine the course of reconciliation, for example, to use the actual example that was in their press release here. so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so can you take this approach well i think the answer is no because your audience is either people who are unengaged to begin with so great fucking luck getting them engaged or it is people who are already engaged and you&#39;ve just insulted them by saying they are all overreacting they are wrong to be partisan so why don&#39;t they stop being wrong and come work with uh work with them in the center i mean like like</span>

They started looking for motives, because it just seems weird, like, like a group of exactly 30 people who have deigned themselves to be the leaders of all of this and now through an op-ed they are going to announce to the world with their splashy website and and their spokespeople and their media tour and it just it looks anything but grassroots it looks like the exact same thing we all hated about the pc party this sense that there&#39;s this elite class who just get to decide what we can get worked up about and what we don&#39;t carter</span>

            <span class="text">one you can also add so you don&#39;t and prefer not to say, but he did give the least polarized number, which I think there is a sweet irony to that. Carter, same question to you, you know, and maybe I kind of pose an additive to what Corey said, which is, do you agree with this thesis, too, that either you are offended as being someone who&#39;s singled out for overreacting because of your partisan proclivities, or you&#39;re disengaged? Is there a third group that is perhaps looking for a, let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">let&#39;s just call it a better on-ramp or an easier on-ramp, a different on-ramp that might lead to partisan politics eventually? Is there perhaps that third group that exists? So, Corey, I&#39;ll give you fair share to answer that question on the back end of Carter. But, Carter, I want to get your take on the 1 to 10 with maybe not this group itself, but this thesis, which I think is fascinating, this thesis of can we use highlighting partisanship and polarization to eventually onboard people to help with tasks that may require, in some point, partisanship?</span>

And instead of focusing on the question of partisanship, which is what everybody grabbed onto, how dare they say that neither political party has the answer to the questions. They also spent quite a bit of time asking the questions. And the questions are, how can we reduce the economy and provincial exposure to the volatility in oil and gas. No one really has that answer. It&#39;s a good question. Second question, how can we build an inclusive social fabric so that every Albertan feels like they belong? I don&#39;t know, shit down everybody&#39;s throat?

Let&#39;s move it on to our next one. In fact, I&#39;m making this the final one because it might be a doozy. A couple weeks ago, was it a couple weeks ago? the Auditor General Report here in Alberta was released, which made a staggering $1.6 billion in accounting errors in its annual financial statements for the UCP government. It included everything from some of these accounting errors to our favorite energy war room to other elements of the fiscal record for the Kenney government. Corey, I&#39;m going to you first on this. Before I ask you the 1 to 10 in terms of the political impact, because that&#39;s what I want to measure here, the political impact this will have on the Kenney government. One, no, 10, you know, a lot of political impact might be nightmarish for them and a cloud that hangs over them. Before I ask you that, give our listeners a bit of context in terms of the scale of $1.6 billion of accounting errors. Is this big deal, small deal? Does it really matter? And then maybe that might inform your answer around the political cloud that might hang over the Kenney government.</span>

And so that&#39;s the problem that the UCP has. Now, listen, I came from government land. I understand that there&#39;s a lot of ambiguity in these things. There&#39;s a lot of frustration when the AG comes in and just says, we think it should be done this way. because as much as everybody out there thinks accounting is black and white, accounting is not black and white. You do not hire a CPA because things are clear. You hire a bookkeeper if all you&#39;re doing is ledger in, ledger out. But there are a ton of things that you need to make strategic decisions about when you&#39;re putting together any kind of financial statements.

The Sturgeon refinery one, that one doesn&#39;t bother me at all. There was a provision set at December 31st, which was the refinery&#39;s fiscal year end, and they didn&#39;t update the provision before the government&#39;s year end, March 31, despite the fact that there was a big change in the oil and gas sector. I think we all appreciate that, but but they&#39;d never done the provision before. It was a new thing for them. It&#39;s not the craziest thing that a mistake like this would happen, right? KXL one doesn&#39;t bother me. Something didn&#39;t show up as a liability and offsetting asset, but that doesn&#39;t actually change very much when you get down to the bottom line.</span>

The political upside for the Trudeau government, as we had discussed earlier, for having the most per capita vaccines in line for them, is this all political upside or is there a risk here? Over, under on seven for the Trudeau government on this particular item.</span>

            <span class="text">i mean they did sprinkle bets around and you could make the argument down the road if only one of these pays off it would be an absurd argument to make this was the smart prudent play but somebody could say why didn&#39;t you get more of that pfizer vaccine you know you you went around but you only got this many pfizer and now we actually have fewer doses than these other other countries there is a scenario where that&#39;s possible it&#39;s unlikely because most of these vaccines are targeting the same uh you know the virus in the same way as my understanding</span>

            <span class="text">I like that smart commentary. Corey, I&#39;m sticking with you for the final one. Alberta&#39;s Justice Minister Casey Medu is picking to fight with Calgary Mayor Nahid Nenshi. This is on the heels of the Calgary City Council taking $20 million from the police budget and reallocating it for social agencies. So he&#39;s taking this fight to the city on defunding the police, so to speak, the terminology we&#39;ve heard in the zeitgeist over the past half year. Smart political strategy, not so smart political strategy on the part of the Justice Minister. What are you giving this on 1 to 10? 1 being not so smart, 10 being pretty smart.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t think it&#39;s as smart as they think it is, but it&#39;s not so bad. There is something to be said for going on the offensive on these things. And, you know, the problem that they have is that I think people will be disinclined to believe that they are playing this one straight. The benefit they have is that conservatives tend to get better scores on law and order by default. So they may just be perceived naturally by a lot of the constituents of Calgary as just being spot on on this one. And certainly it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re doing nothing. Carter, what do you think?</span>
