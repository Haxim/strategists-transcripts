          <div class="said">Yeah, like, there&#39;s a school of thought on that regard that says, they&#39;re a distraction, they don&#39;t help. There&#39;s another school of thought that says they humanize, they have an ability to effectively make a political staffer a known quantity. And once they&#39;re a known quantity, they actually make them a trading chip, which is not necessarily bad for an office. So I think there&#39;s a school of thought there we can discuss. As it relates to the politician, it depends who&#39;s the politician, what&#39;s the outlet, what&#39;s the relationship with the reporter. I&#39;d almost turn this back to you, Annalise, with your expertise in media relations, right? But there are some key questions that you you have to ask around what&#39;s their objective, what&#39;s their story, what&#39;s your story, is it worth it if their story gets told over your story, or can you find other outlets for it? And so when you mostly see political profiles these days of politicians, you have a good sense of who the writer is, what their objective is, they&#39;re pretty upfront with it. And frankly, one of the rules that you&#39;d probably want to have in place is understand who, understand how long, understand when and then think about um when as in when the publication date is and then when you talk about the actual interview itself my lesson has always been shorter rather than longer right it&#39;s key messages over and over this goes back to the heart of media training for for anyone which is is the longer you speak the more uh raw material you give them to mold into a piece that uh allows to to shape it in their own direction of course barring stephen carter&#39;s carter jump</div>
