        <p>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the termination of Alberta Health Services CEO Verna Yiu's contract and what it might mean for the future of health care in Alberta. Does this foreshadow a privatization push in Alberta health care? What should opponents of private delivery do? And can you believe our luck that we have somebody so experienced in terminations as Stephen Carter? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">I think it was eight, might have been seven. And then Ron Leipert, who many may know as an MP from Calgary West, was the health minister when he was in MLA. And he squished them all together into one health region that was designed to make things more efficient. And I&#39;m not sure that it has made things more efficient. But nonetheless, instead of having multiple health regions, We have but one. And so when we when we&#39;re talking about, you know, the CEO, the president of Alberta Health Services being fired, we are talking about literally the person who is responsible for delivering all health services, all publicly delivered health services across the entire province. So it&#39;s a big deal. It&#39;s a big deal. This person is really second only to the deputy minister of health and in many ways, much more powerful than the deputy minister of health, because they are actually delivering the frontline health services that, you know, everybody across Canada has come to expect from the services. services.</div>

There&#39;s nothing casual about letting go of the CEO of AHS. It&#39;s probably probably the most impactful public sector job in the entire province. I say that without a sense of hyperbole. AHS, because of the way it was constructed, and because it is the one health authority for Alberta, it is one of the biggest employers in the country. It has hundreds of thousands of employees. It is deeply involved in the operation of our healthcare system. I disagree with Carter. I think, by and large, it is very efficiently run, and it has proven It&#39;s proven its efficiencies time and time again. And I think a lot of where Alberta had fewer stumbles at the start of COVID have to do with the fact that we were able to marshal resources like ventilators more readily through a central health authority. So, you know, it&#39;s done the thing it&#39;s supposed to do. Now, the thing it&#39;s supposed to do, however, is drive efficiencies in the system, and we are seeing in COVID times that running in a system incredibly lean under like Six Sigma-style protocols</div>

You know, I&#39;m a big believer in primary care, right? The more primary, the easier primary care is to deliver, the better off the healthcare system is. But then, you know, you get hit by a car and you don&#39;t need primary care. So you think differently about the system, depending what it is, the thing that you&#39;re looking for, and how you&#39;re experiencing the system. So it is hard. And it&#39;s not just us as consumers of the system that are thinking that way. It&#39;s also the people inside the system so if you ask because it is such a diverse thing right you will run into people who talk only about the long-term um you know long-term housing issues around home around around uh you</div>

The CEO of AHS has an important job. You can imagine that being deeply tied to the idea of contracting out Alberta Health Services activities, and more to come. And by the way, like the government has not been shy about wanting to have more private delivery of healthcare. This is in some ways something that was in train in 2020. And then COVID hit and sensible views prevailed that said this is not the time to dramatically overhaul healthcare. But there&#39;s been contracting out of services such as laundry.

          <div class="said">do you want an election that&#39;s going to be combated over health care and health care delivery and everything that that means? So the public-private debate, I think, has been a total disaster in Canada, right? Because we fight over the idea of public delivery or private delivery. And the truth of the matter is that so much of the system is already private. I think it&#39;s the wrong question. I think the question really should be, do we have the access that we desire, right? Do we have the access and do we have the fullness of the coverage? You know what the Trudeau liberals are talking about with with pharma care and dental care? Do we have something that is comprehensive enough to actually matter? So comprehensiveness and access, I think, are far two better questions to be asking. But I don&#39;t get to set the questions. The people of Alberta, the people of Canada have taken it upon themselves to argue that private care is in some fashion a lesser form of care. And it is one of those signals to different groups within the political system. If you signal that you are moving towards private care, then one side of the spectrum moves towards you and another side of the spectrum moves away from you. And which side of the spectrum is larger? larger i</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, well, your first question was, is this a bad time to try to do this? And I&#39;m not sure it is a bad time. And this leads into the answer of the question you just asked me. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily a bad time because COVID has given us a bit of health care fatigue and also identified a number of challenges in terms of we&#39;ve had months of reporting of being at capacity for ICUs, beyond capacity for ICUs, at capacity for hospitals, beyond capacity for hospitals. And that will fundamentally get people asking questions. So if you&#39;re the UCP, and you want to go in and make some big changes, you can frame it as Yeah, we want to create additional capacity still publicly funded, but we&#39;re looking for other ways we can deliver it novel forms of delivery that will allow us to have slack for challenges like this. Now, is it all a lot of bullshit, by and large, but you know, it becomes a healthcare challenge, it becomes the problem that you&#39;re going to try to solve. One of the things that right-wing crusaders on privatization of health care have often run into is people are, by and large, pretty happy with their health care. They&#39;re happy with their individual, you know, they might gripe about components, but they like their health care providers. And so when people start to rock the boat, when they try to do it through contract negotiations, through outsourcing, any of those things, people say, whoa, slow the fuck down. I&#39;ve got health care access right now. Yes, I understand there are problems getting my knee surgery, but I generally like my primary care. if you have it, all of those things. But now the UCP has been presented with a problem to solve based on the last 12 months. And that is an opportunity if you&#39;re on a bit of a crusade to change the healthcare system. I agree with everything Stephen said about the real questions are about, you know, access and coverage. But I also think we have to acknowledge that arguments about access and coverage have often been the thin edge of the wedge to bigger changes that that actually damage access and coverage. So people will say, yeah, no, I mean, really, this is just about giving more access and filling it open. But it&#39;s a bit Orwellian because that additional access is access for some, you know, and then the access suffers for others. And that&#39;s the anxiety about two-tier health care. If the rich can just pay for better health care, then everybody else is sort of in a system that may be bled out by people who are less interested in funding it properly. And so the suggestion that we all have the same health care, doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a billionaire or a pauper, is one of those fundamental things that might not be in the Canada Health Act in those words, but is a feeling that Canadians carry very heavily. And so it&#39;s going to be interesting to see where this goes. Carter,</div>

And so they are, in some ways, troops that people will be fighting over. And their mobilization will matter a lot for this issue. And, of course, one of the interesting things about changes to the healthcare system more generally, I can tell you, is government tends to win round one because they can come out in a big way and they can communicate and frame it using the bully pulpit that exists but then people interact with their doctors and their nurses and other health care professionals and rounds two three four and five go to the other guys uh so if you are the government what you want to do is be trying to change that dynamic by bringing first of all the government will try to do this very quickly because that&#39;s the way you&#39;re you&#39;re most likely to be able to do it you&#39;re not going to drag this out over six months i assume uh if there&#39;s dramatic changes coming uh or certainly that wouldn&#39;t be a recommended course of action but uh on the flip side playing</div>
