          <p>From Washington D.C., Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk the latest trends in campaigning with Campaigns &amp; Elections Co-Publisher Shane Greer before turning their attention to the U.S. political scene. What are the emerging campaign technologies to watch? Should the Trump candidacy be taken seriously? And who does a better job of being the smug Canadian - Corey or Stephen? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

            <div class="said">I mean the easy thing to say would be it&#39;s all about digital development because that&#39;s always the buzz. But the truth is it&#39;s a big part of it, right? Because what you&#39;ve seen, just look at digital spend. It was something like a quarter of a billion last cycle. It&#39;s looking to be about a billion this cycle. Still pales in comparison to the spend on TV. And you do get a lot of them and us in campaigning. Meaning like, oh, you&#39;re wasting your money if you&#39;re doing this or that. And that&#39;s not true. It&#39;s a mix, right? It&#39;s about the appropriate mix. But what we&#39;re seeing on the digital side, which is interesting obviously, is the targetability, the ability to get very, very tight, very specific. At the same time, you start to see these problems cropping up for that side of the industry, ad fraud, things like that. And then, of course, the people on the broadcast are like, well, it&#39;s not necessarily as targeted as you thought. But</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">point being, I think long-term trajectory, we&#39;re looking at obviously the increasing spend around digital spend overall is obviously going to go up. I mean campaign spending does not know what a recession is. It&#39;s never felt that way.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">It&#39;s up and up and up every single cycle. But I think we&#39;re going to see a lot more in the way – personally, I think we&#39;re going to see a lot more in the way of integration where you&#39;ve seen siloization and people looking at different aspects of campaigning as kind of distinct things. Well, I mean, you guys, right, you&#39;re watching, say you&#39;re watching TV in the evening, you&#39;re Netflixing me. I&#39;m assuming you have like your phone in front of you or generally.</div>

Well, if people are behaving like that, you&#39;ve got to be able to think intelligently about how you access them across a range of devices. So it&#39;s not just about, hey, let&#39;s deliver a TV ad or let&#39;s deliver this direct mail shot. Let&#39;s deliver something into their Twitter stream. It&#39;s about how do you put all of that, all of that together? Yeah,</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Yeah, that&#39;s one of those things that I always I think is the next big challenge for campaign organizers. and that&#39;s setting the mix so there are these turf wars that are developing between tv and digital and all that and the campaign managers are being asked to settle them not necessarily with the best information as to how they should be settled and not really knowing whether they should be trusting the digital guy when they say that because of course there is a vested interest there what do you what&#39;s your advice to people out there about setting the mix and how you should be determining that you have any any blinding insights i think ultimately and</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">it&#39;s the truth, is it depends fundamentally on where you are. I mean, if you&#39;re running in a major metropolitan area, I would expect that your digital spend and your ability to target and so on is going to be quite different. Indeed, the demographics are going to be quite different than if you&#39;re running in a small town in rural America. You&#39;ve got to go, you&#39;ve got to fish where the fish are. You&#39;ve got to go where the voters are. And depending on who your voters are, depending on their profile, depending on where you are, you&#39;re going to be doing different things. In some places, for example, just to take the, you know, there&#39;s this sort of drive for fundraising on Twitter. That&#39;s going to be very important in some places. Some places it is not going to be very important. You&#39;re going to have places where TV remains much more important than it does in others. So the mix depends entirely on where you are.

            <div class="said">it&#39;s about recognizing that the mix is important. It&#39;s not enough to just say we need to buy more ads or need to do more mail.

But you&#39;ve got to remember that it&#39;s not – I think you&#39;re not in a position now that you were even 10 years ago where people couldn&#39;t as easily fact-check. And not just the other campaign, not just the other campaign. campaign, supporters of other campaigns. So if you&#39;re putting something out there that you can&#39;t back up, not only can people find out and come back, they can come back immediately. They can come back very quickly. They can produce stuff to counter it very quickly. So negative works. But I think that the emphasis on being able to back up your negative is more important than ever. And not only does negative work, it&#39;s right that negative happens because at the end of the day, you&#39;re fighting a fundamental battle in which you are saying that your candidate is better than the other person that your candidate should be leading that your candidate should be elected by the people and if you&#39;re saying that you&#39;re saying that the other people shouldn&#39;t be elected i</div>

But specifically – and more of it – where do you see it going else from here? Is there anything cool that you&#39;ve seen in the American context? I know you layered on your British context as well.

So if you look at kind of say focus – and this is not widespread. They&#39;re doing some of it down in Mexico. I&#39;m not – I&#39;m sure they probably have done some in the US.

You&#39;re seeing it being pioneered more on the consumer side at the moment. So again, in this piece we shared, great example of a billboard down in Mexico, which is reading facial expressions and then trying to adjust the ad based on the reaction of people to it. That&#39;s very powerful, and you&#39;ve got to imagine that the impact for that in politics is – in the long term. It&#39;s not going to happen this cycle or next cycle in a big way.

If you put those people in front of a speaker, their feelings of positivity are higher for that speaker than they would be en masse if they were holding a cold beverage. Now, that&#39;s – you&#39;re talking like it&#39;s statistically relevant, statistically meaningful. Things like that I think are really interesting. Now, the question is at what point do you sort of reductive ad absurdum and you&#39;re just kind of – you&#39;re micromanaging to the extreme.

They&#39;re two other DC area, mid-Atlantic publishers, and they focus on the marketing, PR, consumer-facing world and the consumer-facing and government-facing tech world. We happened to be at a conference of theirs in Baltimore last year, and we were really struck that we talk about a lot of similar things to very different audiences. So generally the campaign world doesn&#39;t come together with the consumer world in a huge way. And we thought, well, let&#39;s bring these audiences together and see what they can learn from one another because for sure some are going to be ahead in some areas than others and others will be ahead in other areas. But there are going to be lessons that can be applied from that. So we wanted to do that and kind of talk about trajectory because the trajectory when it comes to – whether you&#39;re selling soap or you&#39;re trying to get votes, you&#39;re doing a lot of the same stuff.

It&#39;s just the numbers are too difficult. They can&#39;t do the math. If you&#39;re trying to build an economic model without homo economicus, you simply cannot do the math because you can&#39;t build in those other factors. The one point on this kind of moving away from rational thought, I mean it&#39;s not like it&#39;s necessarily even that new in politics. I mean you think of one of my favorite books, Drew West in The Political Brain, where he spoke precisely to this pre-2008, was speaking precisely to this point, which is when you&#39;re dealing, whether it&#39;s with a swing voter or a floating voter or indeed with your party rank and file base, they are making decisions emotionally. Emotionally, they will look at an argument. They will look at a policy position, and they will not make that decision rationally. They could see the same policy position from two different parties, and they&#39;ll agree with it in one case and disagree with it in the other because of partisan bias. And in both cases, in both cases, they will believe that they&#39;re being completely rational. Well,</div>

            <div class="said">Reeds grew out of that later and initially was awarding the U.S. consultants. And the reality is there&#39;s a lot of incredible work across the world. We wanted to open that up. So we went to having international categories and now we started to break out some different places. So there we&#39;ve got Canada&#39;s one, Latin America. Latin America is one and we&#39;ve got sort of general international categories as well. Because we tend to see that – we see the areas where international entries come from. Obviously, Canada just had a big election. We would love to see Canadian consultants and vendors, notwithstanding some of the NDAs that seem to be in place with the parties out there. But anyone who&#39;s prepared to put their head above the parapet and get their work to recognition, it should. In the same way that happens in the US, we&#39;d love to see that happen. Because at the end of the day, good work is good work. I mean one of the ads that – an ad from the Canadian election TV ad that I think is absolutely phenomenal, one of the best I&#39;ve seen in the last year, is the escalator ad.</div>

Keep that in mind, because just when you when you&#39;re creating that pure, you know, research space for that homo economicus and all that. But don&#39;t forget, when you&#39;re testing something, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s going to be received the same way once you release it to the public as a whole. Consider lifting the veil at a certain point in the survey and saying, like, now if the conservatives introduce it, figure out a bit about how they might react.</div>

            <div class="said">Shane, I want to respect your time, and we&#39;ve only got a few minutes left in this case. But I wanted to ask you about this. You know, when we look at what you&#39;re talking about here, you know, the difference between trying to get votes and sell soap, right? It&#39;s just really about engaging the customer or the voter. What do you feel like the future of engagement looks like right now? You know, Stephen and I over dinner yesterday were talking to a friend of ours and saying, you know, how many calls do you have to make to get someone on the phone on a live call? And that number astounded me, frankly, because that number used to be a lot lower. You&#39;d have to make a lot less calls to get people on the phone. So what do you think of consumer or voter engagement going forward? Like are we just going to start bombarding people or do you feel like there&#39;s – and how does this end effectively? I&#39;m</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;m not surprised by the phone numbers, and I think it&#39;s just about changes, right? I mean if we tried to phone people 200 years ago, we wouldn&#39;t have got anyone because they didn&#39;t have them. But we probably would have got them with letters, and I think it reflects the changing patterns of behavior, right? So if I get a call on my cell phone and I don&#39;t recognize your number, for sure I&#39;m not going to answer. And if you give me a voice message, I will delete it because I don&#39;t care. If it&#39;s important, email me. So you go where the voters are. So we&#39;re going to see – whether that means we&#39;re going to see the rise of kind of online polling in some way as, for example, with the YouGov example in the UK. There&#39;s still a lot of problems with online polling. It is far from perfect or I guess from Stephen&#39;s perspective completely imperfect in any kind</div>

            <div class="said">think to your engagement thing, fish where the fish are. You go where people are and you gauge with them on their terms. I think it&#39;s going to get a lot more intelligent in some ways because you&#39;re able to tell a lot more about people. You know, whether it&#39;s about geo-targeting, where they&#39;ve been. Hey, you know, if you&#39;re driving in the HOV lane to a school every day, odds are you&#39;ve got kids. So you&#39;re going to be targeted differently. You&#39;re going to be receiving messages based on that. So I think that obviously helps the engagement. I&#39;m not sort of a pessimist about, you know, turnout and stuff like that. I think, yeah, it&#39;s not as good as it should be. But I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s going to change hugely over time. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re ever going to see a catastrophic drop-off. I think there&#39;s still a level of civic engagement that&#39;s going to be maintained.

Personally, and I&#39;m by no means an expert in this, there&#39;s no way Trump gets really that far. You look at his polling. You look at who&#39;s actually being put – the numbers behind the numbers. It just doesn&#39;t stack. It&#39;s great for the media. It&#39;s great to have a horse race and yada, yada.

There was a group widely known as the Know-Nothings who essentially tried to take over government back in the 19th century. This is not new. In fact, I think – No, no. I don&#39;t think anyone is saying it&#39;s new. I think people are saying it&#39;s relevant. Hold on. Let me finish the thought here. This is not new. Nerds are having their moment right now too. I mean when you start looking at how people are reacting to science and technology relative to how they&#39;ve had those opinions in the past, which have been a little more colored by the fact that we can create weapons and nuclear bombs and all of that stuff. There is nothing to suggest that Americans or anybody else are less educated or more anti-intellectual than they have been in the past. That is utter trash.

This is one of our great challenges is – so let&#39;s just make this into a social policy problem. One of our great challenges is that poverty dictates educational outcomes and health outcomes. This is our reality. And in the United States, it is exacerbated because they do not have the social safety net that we see in Canada to the same degree. And it continues to be furthered. I mean being in the US is fascinating. fascinating there&#39;s a whole different dialect down here there&#39;s different conversations and it&#39;s not so much of it is colored as black white uh racial relations or black white latino and there&#39;s obviously overlays on that but the poverty poverty it&#39;s this poverty impoverished group that is that is that i find fascinating because it is currently and i guess it always has been i will concede that it always has been but i think it&#39;s just getting bigger and bigger This impoverished group that almost clings to their poverty and clings to their separateness, their togetherness.

We talk about GDP growth. What&#39;s in it for me? I don&#39;t care. The economy has become two questions, right? Right. Nobody cares about the national economy. They want to know how it&#39;s helping them. Right. And you&#39;re seeing this reflected in American confidence, the economy by GDP per cent.
