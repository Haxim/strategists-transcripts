We&#39;ve got a few options, and ultimately, we&#39;ve got only one option. But I need to... Let&#39;s start with where they shouldn&#39;t go. Okay, so this is true. We can make a big list. Now, thestrategists.ca is our main website. You could go there, and you&#39;d expect that there&#39;d be links to the live show. There won&#39;t be. No, thanks. So don&#39;t go there. Now, you might be thinking, wait, thestrategistslive.ca.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Unfortunately, as much as that makes sense, and we do own that site, it is forwarded to Flair Airlines. So that is actually a Flair Airlines formal forward that we&#39;ve had to do. Formal forward is, of course, the contractual term that they have stipulated. Now, you&#39;d say, okay, drop the the. duh, strategistlive.ca, strategistlive.com. Doesn&#39;t it sound easy? It&#39;s easy. It was easy because that was the URL for our previous live show at the Grand. Now, those tickets are not on sale, but you can still go to those websites. So as it relates for you to be going somewhere that you can go and get to, strategistlive.ca and .com, Carter, those are good websites.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">solution have you come up with? I assume you&#39;ve ported one of these sites to the new URL. No. Or have you not done that? No, you have not done that. Okay. Okay.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

And to summarize, hopefully charitably, they said, okay, we met, we got together, this is on the heels of that legislation, and we are now going to begin the work to plan and prepare for a eventual potential general strike. um and reaffirmed their sort of desire to have recall votes and to</span>

If the fightback does not include a general strike, okay, it doesn&#39;t include a general strike. What else does it include? And one reason it doesn&#39;t include it is because we&#39;re working towards it. Okay, what else should it include at this point? And kind of taking Shannon&#39;s question, extending it a bit and trying to make it a bit more strategic in the sense of Carter, you had the ability to put into the bucket what it needs to look like. What does this look like if this is the existential threat right now?

And Shannon and I have kind of scratched the surface in a previous episode around the ATA and their union side and their professional association side to get started on that.
