Now, thestrategists.ca is our main website. You could go there, and you&#39;d expect that there&#39;d be links to the live show. There won&#39;t be. No, thanks. So don&#39;t go there.

Now, you&#39;d say, okay, drop the the. duh, strategistlive.ca, strategistlive.com. Doesn&#39;t it sound easy? It&#39;s easy. It was easy because that was the URL for our previous live show at the Grand. Now, those tickets are not on sale, but you can still go to those websites.

I do nothing other than pitch it to you, which is to say I have the same question in some ways, which is we know that this could be considered and probably is an existential moment in Alberta labor history. If the fightback does not include a general strike, okay, it doesn&#39;t include a general strike. What else does it include? And one reason it doesn&#39;t include it is because we&#39;re working towards it. Okay, what else should it include at this point? And kind of taking Shannon&#39;s question, extending it a bit and trying to make it a bit more strategic in the sense of Carter, you had the ability to put into the bucket what it needs to look like. What does this look like if this is the existential threat right now? And you could make this about ATA as a as an association labor union or you can make this about broader labor your choice well</div>
