        <div class="meta">November 15, 2021</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Erin O'Toole going on the coalition offensive before diving into the UCP annual general meeting. What purpose does a political convention serve? Should Kenney opponents go on the offensive? And what's the difference between underrated and overrated, anyhow? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

We talked about our real estate on O&#39;Toole Island. What needs to happen for him to get out of the rut that he&#39;s in, both, I guess, literally and metaphorically, considering O&#39;Toole Island as a reference point. But, Corey, he&#39;s now taken vaccination and turned it into coalition. That seems to be the word that he&#39;s using a lot this week.

It is not a – it&#39;s funny because when you&#39;re using the coalition word, I very easily could have seen O&#39;Toole talking about his coalition, his coalition of conservatism, right?</div>

I could very easily see him talking that way. But pegging the other guys as having the coalition, the unholy alliance between the NDP and the liberals that the conservatives rail against and see as the worst possible form of government because the liberals just lurch to the left. And then it takes, you know, a decade of conservative rule just to bring them back to the middle, to the middle. That&#39;s a story that conservatives will believe. And I think that that story is pretty wise of O&#39;Toole to be trying to tell it because it gives them a dedicated enemy.

They&#39;re not letting me achieve the agenda for Canadians. And the problem with the first two years is there was never anybody to rail against because everything that they put forward was basically supported by the other parties in some fashion, right? There was never a moment where we were going, oh, I wonder if this is going to pass. I wonder if this budget is going to get through. I wonder if this confidence motion is going to go. There was never any of those moments because everybody knew that they could never afford to have the government fall, never was going to be a situation where the NDP wanted another election. By putting this in place and giving a two-year deal, for example, that really just gives the NDP two years to establish what their brand would be. I don&#39;t know why the Liberals would do it because if there was to be a confidence motion in two years or in two weeks, two months, the speech from the throne is rejected by all the other opposition parties. The group most likely to come out on top is the Liberal Party. They may have only got a plurality of seats this time, but they&#39;re much closer to majority seats, especially if they can peg the other parties as being unreasonable. Imagine what would happen.

So you got Jagmeet Singh, roughly same seat count as last election, holding the balance of power, sticking on as leaders. The early talks of saying this guy needs to go, those are fizzled out. Like, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a real sort of question here about his leadership, at least not in the short term. You then had political commentators in the pundit class after that election result a couple of months ago saying, you know, this gives Jagmeet Singh more leverage, more leverage, more leverage. With this proposition or this line of attack that O&#39;Toole&#39;s put on the table, with everything that you see from your sort of perspective, game it out for me. Where is the NDP leverage right now? Is it greater than, less than it used to be? Is it roughly about the same? Or at least give me your sense of the terrain for them in terms of passing their agenda, which is continuing the march to the left for the liberals.</div>

          <div class="said">to your point, do they have more ability to pull the liberals to the left than they did before the election? Well, I think not really, simply because elections are expensive, and nobody believes that they want to go right back into the polls. And of course, the liberals do have a couple more seats, and that gives them a little bit more breathing room. although it fundamentally hasn&#39;t changed the math or the connection between all of the parties here. One of the things, though, that I think we just sort of need to call out here is everybody&#39;s talking about a coalition as though the NDP have to vote yes on a confidence measure. That&#39;s not true. Because of the seat counts where they are, if I&#39;m not mistaken, now I better make sure I&#39;m right about this. I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m right. If the NDP all just abstained en masse for every confidence vote, that would still give the Liberals 51% of the votes left over. And so there you go, right? You don&#39;t even necessarily need them to vote yes. So I do wonder, you know, there&#39;s just so many variations of Liberals getting the majority vote in these situations. That makes me think that the NDP probably has slightly less power than they did before. But maybe more flexibility, and maybe that sounds a bit counterintuitive.

Let&#39;s make this a more – let&#39;s afford each other both those things that we want. We want a freer hand to govern. And you want to free your hand to be in opposition and not worry about bringing this whole place down every two months? Because as much as Stephen said, there were never those moments in the last parliament. He&#39;s wrong. Last fall, we talked about the throne speech being potentially something where the government might have to drop.

          <div class="said">So here in Alberta, you&#39;re welcome. I still bring it once every five episodes, and I mail it in for the other four. Guys, UCP AGM is happening this weekend, the 19th to the 21st here in Calgary. It is notably one of the two AGMs that we are going to see in the next six months. We have one here in November, then, of course, with the leadership review for Jason Kenney, at least scheduled right now in April of 2022. They&#39;ll have their 2022 AGM. It&#39;s going to be held in Calgary. There&#39;s a lot of conversation going on about what this means for Jason Kenney&#39;s fortunes. I want to get to all of that. But before that, for our listeners who may not be familiar with the dynamics of an AGM, and I recognize that they&#39;re different for every party. Carter, do you want to give us a 101 of what an AGM actually functions to do in a healthy party, what an AGM is supposed to do, what its objectives are said and unsaid on a particular weekend? I know all of us have been to a few of them, but give me a sense of it, and Corey, then I&#39;ll get you to add on to what Carter said in terms of the foundational points here. Well,</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I&#39;m going to pick on kind of the one that&#39;s unspoken because I always think it&#39;s the most important, And that is the bringing together of the team and reminding them all why they&#39;re on the team. So you have a number of functional pieces. Maybe there&#39;s a leadership review or policies, conferences or policy initiatives, or just even the election of the key</div>

          <div class="said">That part might have been made up. But the point is that you bring everybody together and you remind them of why they&#39;re working so hard. Because these volunteer positions are a lot of work. They&#39;re not a lot of glory. And in fact, underneath the election law, there&#39;s a lot of possible negative outcomes for the people who are actually doing this work. So you bring them all together. they pay for the opportunity to get together and hang out together and</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, political parties are corporations too. And so there is some just nuts and bolts business that has to occur there. there. And depending on how the political party is structured, it can take all sorts of different forms. And I think maybe I&#39;ll just start off by saying all sorts of parties do this in all sorts of different ways. And they stack their agendas depending on what&#39;s going on. But generally speaking, you&#39;re going to see the election of officers, you&#39;re going to see the accepting of various reports, finance report, auditors report, different committee reports, usually happens very quickly. You&#39;re going to pass policies, we&#39;ll get back to that, because that&#39;s grown in importance In my time in politics, that used to be just sort of a yeah, whatever, but has now become a bit of a flashpoint at different moments. And those policies may be the party asks the government or the party asks if we should become government that we do X, or it could even be a policy that the party has, such as its constitutional, you know, structure. I&#39;m putting it all in that bucket, I guess. there&#39;s election readiness training which becomes more important in the years before an election and there is that rallying the base that carter was talking about firing them up the big speech everybody talks about the keynote speeches right so you&#39;ll usually have one big keynote from somebody who&#39;s not the leader at least one and you&#39;ll have one from the leader and that&#39;s when the leader will make any major pronouncements that were within several months otherwise going to be planned you know if they&#39;re base focused and of course carter&#39;s 100 right networking is a huge part of it.</div>

          <div class="said">I don&#39;t know how much time I actually spend in the halls dealing with the policy, the reports, the election of officers, all of that. A lot of it happens outside in the corridors, in the lounges, in the bars near the place, because that&#39;s where you connect with the the people and that&#39;s where you actually make these lifelong friendships and of course a signature moment in canadian politics i think all politics is the hospitality suite so it&#39;s the after hours at the convention when that final speech is wrapped up anybody who&#39;s running for one of those party offices anybody who wants to be the leader down the road uh and you know the host groups like if if it&#39;s happening in a certain city we&#39;ll put on these hospitality suites where you&#39;ll just fill Fill in these smaller hotel ballrooms or, as the name comes from, suites within the hotel. Bathtubs full of beer. You&#39;re just drinking. You&#39;re talking. And that&#39;s really, you know, the real convention goes until about 2 in the morning. It starts again quite early.

Usually they&#39;re going for a reason. The media, of course, has stories to file. Certain media who write maybe Maybe more long form, more on like a magazine style schedule might go and start making the connections that they&#39;re going to use for their stories down the road. But primarily, they&#39;re probably taking notes of the speeches and getting ready to write their pieces. Other political parties send observers.

People walk around a little lubricated from all of those hospitality suites saying things they shouldn&#39;t be saying as opposition MLAs are credentialed and walking around, MPs, as the case may be. I can tell you, at the liberal conventions, Olivia Chow wasn&#39;t always there, but quite often was there as an observer, right? Because she was a bit of a celebrity. People just wanted to sort of be around Olivia Chow, and then they would probably say dumb things, and that would provide intelligence to them, right? Similarly,</div>

I&#39;m sure that the UCP heading into this weekend has all of those goals on the list, right? Camaraderie, coming togetherness, passing policy, electing those that are going to lead the volunteer positions at an executive level, having the one-on-ones with the MLAs, there&#39;s still government. But there seems to be a cloud hanging over it. Carter, that cloud is Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership. Give me a breakdown of, not even a breakdown, a thumbnail of what you expect, maybe a tone and tenor of a more contentious AGM. Because we&#39;ve, if I can say, like, I&#39;ve seen what that looks like, too, where the hallway chatter isn&#39;t just, hey, it&#39;s amazing, we&#39;re government, we&#39;re high in the polls. There&#39;s a very different vibe. There&#39;s a very different, hey, these people are lying this way. Give me a sense of what you might expect tone and tenor wise in the lobbies of the Gray Eagle, I believe it&#39;s where it being held here in Calgary, the casino for the UCP AGM coming up this weekend.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, let&#39;s talk about the specifics here in terms of what you feel like. Of course, we are doing a bit of like tea leaf reading, right? Like in terms of what we feel like tone and tenor might look like. But we&#39;ve seen and witnessed this in the past that parties heading getting into AGMs or conventions without the most sort of healthiest sense of camaraderie or spirit. What are some of the things you expect? Carter&#39;s mentioned a few that there&#39;s going to be an ongoing campaign that the leaders community and the leaders circle will be talking, you know, talking up the leader, plying people with with alcohol and giving them the rub when one shows up to to their suites. What else do you kind of expect in these contentious times for the UCP?</div>

          <div class="said">yeah that that kind of whispering and that jockeying is something that occurs but you&#39;ve also got to keep in mind at a convention everybody can see what you&#39;re doing and who you&#39;re hanging out with so i often think people overblow what it&#39;s going to feel like a bad convention like it has to be really bad to start feeling that malice on the floor because there&#39;s a certain uh you know decorum that comes from everybody being in the room and seeing each other in fact i think one of the things that jason kenney really has going for him is that this is an an in-person convention. We&#39;ve seen some conventions lately that have been online, and I think that the tenor has been bad as a result. And we talked about this after Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s convention, and I think maybe even in the lead-up to it, and we talked about this about Jagmeet Singh&#39;s most recent convention. It&#39;s hard to control a room that you&#39;re not actually in when all of these chats are happening on WhatsApp as you&#39;re listening in the convention thing. And yeah, everyone&#39;s texting in a convention back and forth, But you&#39;re in the room with people and there&#39;s a different feeling when you&#39;re all in the room and there&#39;s different levers that the leader can pull when you&#39;re all in the room where you can control the tone. And of course, the one that&#39;s making a lot of headlines in Alberta right now is that resolutions</div>

But because everything on a convention floor is by nature in public and overt, the thing is often much tamer, even when a party is falling apart, then people are licking their lips and waiting for it.

But I want to actually leave this bracket open and go to something Corey mentioned, which is the two substantive threads of discussion that are happening right now. The first one is the one about only the leader can introduce new resolutions to the floor. And the second one, Carter, is the conversation around will 22 constituency associations sign on to expedite Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership review that is being held in April? Those are the two like live wire threads that one might say are the most practical and tactical ways that Kenney&#39;s leadership could be could be usurped. Corey, you&#39;re shaking your head.

          <div class="said">What&#39;s going to happen is there&#39;s going to be this weird dance that goes on from this time the convention opens with all of those social cues we&#39;ve talked about, where you are going to see people who oppose Jason Kenney trying to ratchet up and get people to telegraph their displeasure with the leader in increasingly large ways. it will start with sitting on hands it&#39;ll start with applause that is a little applause that&#39;s a little bit lagged behind and after a while people get the sense oh we&#39;re not with this man right</div>

          <div class="said">right and then the room gets a little bit chillier it gets a little bit frostier all of a sudden after the speech there&#39;s conversations at those hospitality suites saying boy not a great speech by the leader boy and he really needed a good one now and hmm you know if it&#39;s not going to be him who&#39;s it going to be and what what they&#39;re going to be looking for are those small things that erode confidence that jason kenney has control over this they&#39;re not going to be trying to create if they&#39;re smart these big moments uh that all of a sudden force a backlash effect where people say no to defend the party and to make this not look like a clown car we need to vote against this resolution right that happens too quickly and uh they&#39;re screwed now if they immediately read the room if they immediately get a sense that those kinds of resolutions like you know this one about about more constituency associations are needed to sort of pull the rug out from underneath Jason Kenney, then yeah, maybe you go for those things now. But I would call those high risk, low reward. And so if Jason Kenney&#39;s opponents are smart, and I&#39;m not saying necessarily that they&#39;ve acted in the smartest fashion lately, they&#39;re not going to try to push those things too hard or too fast. They&#39;re going to downplay them. They&#39;re going to say, they&#39;re not really important. We know that that this is a convention that has more loyalists of Jason Kenney, you know, they&#39;re really going to try to minimize the likelihood that that&#39;s going to pass. Because what&#39;s your best outcome there? You get this leadership review a month early? I don&#39;t know about that. I&#39;m just not sure it&#39;s worth the risk of you losing that vote after clearly going for it, which will strengthen Jason Kenney. Carter,</div>

I care too much about the party. I have to see that he&#39;s listening to us, that his grassroots guarantee was worth the paper it was written on. I haven&#39;t seen that in today&#39;s convention, but it doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t pull it out between now and March 31st. I have to see that because I believe in the grassroots. I believe in this party. And the third thing I need to see, I need to see how the rest of us feel. I need us to feel like a team again because it&#39;s the team that brought us here and it&#39;s the team that&#39;s going to take us forward.

Many people freaking out about it, including Blaise Bomer, former Kenney staffer, seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s hard to read into this, saying here lies the grassroots guarantee 2017 to 2021. rest in peace almost implying that this is a affront to the aforementioned grassroots guarantee cory why is this you you briefly mentioned it not as ridiculous as as some people are making it online in your opinion yeah</div>

So don&#39;t, you know, don&#39;t read too much into that world. It&#39;s not saying the sky is falling any more than it already was for Jason Kenney, and he was already in a bad state. The other thing is the rule says no resolutions other than the special resolutions and resolutions approved by the board will be considered with the exception of those proposed by the leader.</div>

That&#39;s a real feeling that any political party under siege like that is going to be feeling. And so what&#39;s your narrative? Sell me sell me on why we&#39;re here, and make it a hero narrative that gets us back to where we&#39;ve got to be. So it&#39;s Jason Kenney made the tough decision decisions, unpopular, you know, a good compromise leaves everybody dissatisfied, whatever it is, whatever you&#39;re going to be spinning out there, it&#39;s got to be a consistent story.

Carter, let&#39;s talk about their goals for Saturday or the weekend overall. What are their goals? Because if Team Kenney&#39;s goal is to survive the weekend, is this group&#39;s goal to make sure he&#39;s gone by the weekend? It can&#39;t be that, right? So what does their goal look like for the weekend? Let&#39;s start there, and then let&#39;s reframe some of the tactics we&#39;ve already thrown out on the table.</div>

It&#39;s not about Kenny. It&#39;s about our party. It&#39;s about retaining government. We can&#39;t hand things back to the NDP. If we hand this government back to the NDP, let&#39;s not forget what a disaster it was four years ago. We have only been taken down by a natural disaster that&#39;s worldwide. No one has managed this well. No one has got themselves in a perfect position. Jason Kenney has suffered, but we need to we need to remember that it was the NDP fucking things up before we even got into into into the office that really made this tough.

The iterative ratcheting up of the volume, the seeding of certain conversations being like, you know, he needs to deliver a killer speech. He didn&#39;t do that. Those sort of things, almost like predetermined lines. Yes. And this from for me, Corey, what else are you adding to the mix? If you&#39;re on this this group of of supporters that, you know, are anti Kenny, what are you trying to tell them to do? do?

And this person tells you in confidence, I need this guy gone. I have ambitions for leadership. Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan, you are in that room. Corey, you&#39;ve already told us a bit about what your strategy might be for a person that is in this position. It&#39;s probably not the Brian Jean strategy. And this person, to be totally clear, is not Brian Jean. It is someone else other than Brian Jean. He&#39;s already carved out his lane, and we&#39;ve addressed it tangentially in the past and in this episode. But Carter, this is someone else, someone who has visions for the party, someone currently maybe holds a position in the party. Let&#39;s say they&#39;re a cabinet minister within the party. They have an agenda. They&#39;ve laid it out to you. What does their one sheet start with in terms of their goals for success this weekend?

Their whole concept of swapping the leader in April, May, June, whenever they do it, I think is too shallow, that there&#39;s a fundamental change needed, that I&#39;m someone who may have held political office in the past, maybe a household name, or maybe wanting to make a name for myself by running for leadership of this party.

So you have to imagine that private operators are probably a bigger part of the Alberta deal than other deals. But it&#39;s interesting and it&#39;s risky because if this is seen as a big government program that is aligned with the Trudeau liberals, it could hurt him at his convention. But if he can legitimately say we have really held the feet to the fire of the Trudeau liberals, We&#39;ve gotten back a program that is materially different, that is appropriate for Alberta, that respects our diversity of options that are available here, including private operators, including the fact that not everybody has two parents who are working. Sometimes it&#39;s the grandmother who&#39;s watching. Sometimes it&#39;s a day home, whatever it is, right?
