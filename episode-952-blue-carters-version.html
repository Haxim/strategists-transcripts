            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, Aaron O&#39;Toole is now facing persistent questions about vaccinations, of course. We talked about O&#39;Toole Island last week. We talked about our real estate on O&#39;Toole Island. What needs to happen for him to get out of the rut that he&#39;s in, both, I guess, literally and metaphorically, considering O&#39;Toole Island as a reference point. But, Corey, he&#39;s now taken vaccination and turned it into coalition. That seems to be the word that he&#39;s using a lot this week. He used it 19 times during his six and a half minute media statement on Monday, then another seven times on Tuesday when he announced his shadow cabinet, all to refer disparagingly to purported talks that he&#39;s trying to add fire to between the liberals and the NDP to form a, quote unquote, coalition. Chuck Meade saying the NDP is saying this bullshit is not happening. It&#39;s not a real thing. But the coalition government is kind of hearkening back to the Harper era years as a very specific sort of milestone in people&#39;s minds. I want to talk about the strategy behind this. And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you on this. Aaron O&#39;Toole, gone for a bit, reappears. What do you think of the strategy of him now showing up trying</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">trying to defend vaccinations with talks of a coalition?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that that&#39;s an interesting strategy to try and remind people what they&#39;re fighting against, right? It&#39;s all too easy in the Conservative Party movements to have Conservatives fighting Conservatives, because when we say the word Conservative, it is not a single thing. It is not a – it&#39;s funny because when you&#39;re using the coalition word, I very easily could have seen O&#39;Toole talking about his coalition, his coalition of conservatism, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? This coalition of conservatism is actually the powerhouse, right, that will ultimately be able to retake the government. But we can&#39;t do it without a coalition. I could very easily see him talking that way. But pegging the other guys as having the coalition, the unholy alliance between the NDP and the liberals that the conservatives rail against and see as the worst possible form of government because the liberals just lurch to the left. And then it takes, you know, a decade of conservative rule just to bring them back to the middle, to the middle. That&#39;s a story that conservatives will believe. And I think that that story is pretty wise of O&#39;Toole to be trying to tell it because it gives them a dedicated enemy. And watching Singh run away from it seems to be proving the point that it actually has some teeth.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, good strategy here. Coalition means a very specific thing, but O&#39;Toole seems to really be hitting on something.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think what Carter said is interesting, and I hadn&#39;t actually thought about it in that sense. But there&#39;s a reason why the NDP runs away from it, too, which is that it&#39;s very unpopular with the NDP base as well. And this is not actually unique to the liberal NDP conservative dynamic we have right now. Now, the reality is every time that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that you have a government, you have an anti-government sentiment out there and parties try to latch on to that or not. And we&#39;ve seen parties, especially, well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, you know, notoriously in the United Kingdom when the Lib Dems supported the Tories and just went down in flames as a result of that. You know, their support just plummeted over time because they were tied to the government, but they were also not the government. And that was a real coalition, right? That was a different situation altogether. together so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so uh yeah i mean it&#39;s always good to keep your eyes on an external enemy to rally the team around an external threat that is that&#39;s kind of just very cynically</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">cynically it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like leadership 101 right it&#39;s there&#39;s this us and there&#39;s this them and we&#39;re gonna fight we&#39;re gonna win and whether that is we&#39;re gonna sell more soft drinks than the other guys or you name it that&#39;s a very common approach that people have when they&#39;re rallying the base what i think is a a little bit curious</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">curious for me here and maybe it&#39;s not a concern for like the public messaging point of view but let&#39;s just sort of call it out is there&#39;s a big difference between that old classic stephen harper brought up of the coalition of the losers in that he was the the fellow who got the plurality of the seats at the time justin</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">justin trudeau got the plurality of the seats of the sun this is a coalition of the winners that aaron o&#39;toole is accusing uh of occurring here so it&#39;s not Not remotely the same situation. I do think that the fact that it makes Singh squirm and even the liberals are not too wild about it and don&#39;t want to look too enthused with it because they worry that they will be perceived as too far left says it&#39;s not a loser for Aaron O&#39;Toole. But I mean, it&#39;s kind of dumb if we&#39;re just going to get right down to it. You</span>

Does this really surprise anyone that the liberals and the NDs, even prior to this election where we were generating the same sort of seat counts roughly, are going to continue to work together? Like, what I think the mileage on this is perhaps short, if not, you know, may not maybe a smart strategy, but do you feel like it&#39;s one that flames out very quickly based on what Corey just mentioned here?

It&#39;s not the same as it was when the party of, you know, the coalition of the losers, but the coalition itself, the idea that people create a actual framework to govern, that is almost always unpopular within the bases of the party. And what&#39;s really confusing to me is Justin Trudeau didn&#39;t need a coalition to govern effectively the first two years of his minority mandate? Why does he need a coalition to govern effectively in the second two, you know, the next two years? I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a, I</span>

Or do you have like some particular ideas as to why he might you know even lean on this this more strengthened informal partnership which i think the main sort of ticket that folks are looking at is is the longevity of of keeping it up for a couple years uh you know do you feel like there&#39;s a actual reason for trudeau to get more guarantees from the ndp than than in the past there&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">in fact not having their guarantee not having them support them on stuff so not say the ndp was was deciding not to support them on this child care stuff, right? See, the NDP said, you know what, it&#39;s not going far enough. Are you going to have final, you know, Trudeau has something to rail against. Trudeau has an enemy in the NDP. They&#39;re not letting me achieve the agenda for Canadians. And the problem with the first two years is there was never anybody to rail against because everything that they put forward was basically supported by the other parties in some fashion, right? There was never a moment where we were going, oh, I wonder if this is going to pass. I wonder if this budget is going to get through. I wonder if this confidence motion is going to go. There was never any of those moments because everybody knew that they could never afford to have the government fall, never was going to be a situation where the NDP wanted another election. By putting this in place and giving a two-year deal, for example, that really just gives the NDP two years to establish what their brand would be. I don&#39;t know why the Liberals would do it because if there was to be a confidence motion in two years or in two weeks, two months, the speech from the throne is rejected by all the other opposition parties. The group most likely to come out on top is the Liberal Party. They may have only got a plurality of seats this time, but they&#39;re much closer to majority seats, especially if they can peg the other parties as being unreasonable. Imagine what would happen. Imagine what would happen if they voted against the speech from the throne.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s talk about the cousin of power, leverage. Can I set the table for a second on the NDs and can we talk about them? So you got Jagmeet Singh, roughly same seat count as last election, holding the balance of power, sticking on as leaders. The early talks of saying this guy needs to go, those are fizzled out. Like, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a real sort of question here about his leadership, at least not in the short term. You then had political commentators in the pundit class after that election result a couple of months ago saying, you know, this gives Jagmeet Singh more leverage, more leverage, more leverage. With this proposition or this line of attack that O&#39;Toole&#39;s put on the table, with everything that you see from your sort of perspective, game it out for me. Where is the NDP leverage right now? Is it greater than, less than it used to be? Is it roughly about the same? Or at least give me your sense of the terrain for them in terms of passing their agenda, which is continuing the march to the left for the liberals.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">to your point, do they have more ability to pull the liberals to the left than they did before the election? Well, I think not really, simply because elections are expensive, and nobody believes that they want to go right back into the polls. And of course, the liberals do have a couple more seats, and that gives them a little bit more breathing room. although it fundamentally hasn&#39;t changed the math or the connection between all of the parties here. One of the things, though, that I think we just sort of need to call out here is everybody&#39;s talking about a coalition as though the NDP have to vote yes on a confidence measure. That&#39;s not true. Because of the seat counts where they are, if I&#39;m not mistaken, now I better make sure I&#39;m right about this. I&#39;m fairly certain I&#39;m right. If the NDP all just abstained en masse for every confidence vote, that would still give the Liberals 51% of the votes left over. And so there you go, right? You don&#39;t even necessarily need them to vote yes. So I do wonder, you know, there&#39;s just so many variations of Liberals getting the majority vote in these situations. That makes me think that the NDP probably has slightly less power than they did before. But maybe more flexibility, and maybe that sounds a bit counterintuitive. But if you&#39;re talking about about ability to do agenda, maybe</span>

Let&#39;s make this a more – let&#39;s afford each other both those things that we want. We want a freer hand to govern. And you want to free your hand to be in opposition and not worry about bringing this whole place down every two months? Because as much as Stephen said, there were never those moments in the last parliament. He&#39;s wrong. Last fall, we talked about the throne speech being potentially something where the government might have to drop. And then we talked about Jagmeet Singh having to fold on it effectively, allowing the government to continue. And he did.</span>

            <span class="text">So here in Alberta, you&#39;re welcome. I still bring it once every five episodes, and I mail it in for the other four. Guys, UCP AGM is happening this weekend, the 19th to the 21st here in Calgary. It is notably one of the two AGMs that we are going to see in the next six months. We have one here in November, then, of course, with the leadership review for Jason Kenney, at least scheduled right now in April of 2022. They&#39;ll have their 2022 AGM. It&#39;s going to be held in Calgary. There&#39;s a lot of conversation going on about what this means for Jason Kenney&#39;s fortunes. I want to get to all of that. But before that, for our listeners who may not be familiar with the dynamics of an AGM, and I recognize that they&#39;re different for every party. Carter, do you want to give us a 101 of what an AGM actually functions to do in a healthy party, what an AGM is supposed to do, what its objectives are said and unsaid on a particular weekend? I know all of us have been to a few of them, but give me a sense of it, and Corey, then I&#39;ll get you to add on to what Carter said in terms of the foundational points here. Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m going to pick on kind of the one that&#39;s unspoken because I always think it&#39;s the most important, And that is the bringing together of the team and reminding them all why they&#39;re on the team. So you have a number of functional pieces. Maybe there&#39;s a leadership review or policies, conferences or policy initiatives, or just even the election of the key</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">key personnel of the party, whether it&#39;s the officers or directors or others. others um that is the function of it but the the big over overlying thing is to bring together all the true believers right the 1500 people who care the most about the party and they&#39;re all going to be in one place and they&#39;re all off for old friends and they drink together and they play together and they they talk about the good old times together they sleep together um you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That part might have been made up. But the point is that you bring everybody together and you remind them of why they&#39;re working so hard. Because these volunteer positions are a lot of work. They&#39;re not a lot of glory. And in fact, underneath the election law, there&#39;s a lot of possible negative outcomes for the people who are actually doing this work. So you bring them all together. they pay for the opportunity to get together and hang out together and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">be told uh how great they are by the the party leaderships this is the opportunity to hang out with the mlas that you don&#39;t get every day you&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re reminded how important you are the mlas come around and they all know your name and they slap you on the back um they say how great it is to see you again and and you feel great and that&#39;s the real reason i think that you hold a party agm the functional outcomes the The leadership review, the policy piece, the election of the officers, all part of it as well. But the we love you, we couldn&#39;t do it without you is probably the most important part.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, do some yes ending for me. Add to what Carter said here. What other objectives, goals, outcomes are you looking for as part of an AGM in a political party?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, political parties are corporations too. And so there is some just nuts and bolts business that has to occur there. there. And depending on how the political party is structured, it can take all sorts of different forms. And I think maybe I&#39;ll just start off by saying all sorts of parties do this in all sorts of different ways. And they stack their agendas depending on what&#39;s going on. But generally speaking, you&#39;re going to see the election of officers, you&#39;re going to see the accepting of various reports, finance report, auditors report, different committee reports, usually happens very quickly. You&#39;re going to pass policies, we&#39;ll get back to that, because that&#39;s grown in importance In my time in politics, that used to be just sort of a yeah, whatever, but has now become a bit of a flashpoint at different moments. And those policies may be the party asks the government or the party asks if we should become government that we do X, or it could even be a policy that the party has, such as its constitutional, you know, structure. I&#39;m putting it all in that bucket, I guess. there&#39;s election readiness training which becomes more important in the years before an election and there is that rallying the base that carter was talking about firing them up the big speech everybody talks about the keynote speeches right so you&#39;ll usually have one big keynote from somebody who&#39;s not the leader at least one and you&#39;ll have one from the leader and that&#39;s when the leader will make any major pronouncements that were within several months otherwise going to be planned you know if they&#39;re base focused and of course carter&#39;s 100 right networking is a huge part of it.</span>

            <span class="text">When I went to conventions back in the day, it&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve been a delegate, mostly because delegated conventions are also changing. I&#39;ve been an observer to them more recently.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know how much time I actually spend in the halls dealing with the policy, the reports, the election of officers, all of that. A lot of it happens outside in the corridors, in the lounges, in the bars near the place, because that&#39;s where you connect with the the people and that&#39;s where you actually make these lifelong friendships and of course a signature moment in canadian politics i think all politics is the hospitality suite so it&#39;s the after hours at the convention when that final speech is wrapped up anybody who&#39;s running for one of those party offices anybody who wants to be the leader down the road uh and you know the host groups like if if it&#39;s happening in a certain city we&#39;ll put on these hospitality suites where you&#39;ll just fill Fill in these smaller hotel ballrooms or, as the name comes from, suites within the hotel. Bathtubs full of beer. You&#39;re just drinking. You&#39;re talking. And that&#39;s really, you know, the real convention goes until about 2 in the morning. It starts again quite early. Let&#39;s put it that way. Carter,</span>

Those are there being like, I want to fucking just eat my popcorn and see this thing implode, or I just want to see what&#39;s up, or try to get some insight or knowledge. Talk to me a bit more about that class of folk that kind of show up alongside what Carter&#39;s mentioned, which are like the diehards who, you know, sweat it out every single day with the identity piece that is this political party.

            <span class="text">Well, look, I mean, it&#39;s a spectacle and spectacles are fun. Although I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of people who go as tourists to political conventions. Usually they&#39;re going for a reason. The media, of course, has stories to file. Certain media who write maybe Maybe more long form, more on like a magazine style schedule might go and start making the connections that they&#39;re going to use for their stories down the road. But primarily, they&#39;re probably taking notes of the speeches and getting ready to write their pieces. Other political parties send observers. So you can imagine at this UCPA GM, there will be one NDP MLA who spent</span>

Like that shit doesn&#39;t happen to convention. The diehards go to conventions. But it gives you a sense of the texture. And, you know, there are loose lips at conventions. People walk around a little lubricated from all of those hospitality suites saying things they shouldn&#39;t be saying as opposition MLAs are credentialed and walking around, MPs, as the case may be. I can tell you, at the liberal conventions, Olivia Chow wasn&#39;t always there, but quite often was there as an observer, right? Because she was a bit of a celebrity. People just wanted to sort of be around Olivia Chow, and then they would probably say dumb things, and that would provide intelligence to them, right? Similarly,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ve gone as an observer to conventions. Now, often I do it because of this stupid podcast and our desire to spend money and make no money, but be able to provide you the finest of analysis. And so sometimes if your interest is more on that periphery, just to sort of lead into kind of, I&#39;m not a GR type, but the next order out would be those GR types who just want to go and hear the buzz and the chatter and make those connections that might be useful to them down the road.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, okay, Corey, you guys have set the table what a convention is and a healthy party. I&#39;m sure that the UCP heading into this weekend has all of those goals on the list, right? Camaraderie, coming togetherness, passing policy, electing those that are going to lead the volunteer positions at an executive level, having the one-on-ones with the MLAs, there&#39;s still government. But there seems to be a cloud hanging over it. Carter, that cloud is Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership. Give me a breakdown of, not even a breakdown, a thumbnail of what you expect, maybe a tone and tenor of a more contentious AGM. Because we&#39;ve, if I can say, like, I&#39;ve seen what that looks like, too, where the hallway chatter isn&#39;t just, hey, it&#39;s amazing, we&#39;re government, we&#39;re high in the polls. There&#39;s a very different vibe. There&#39;s a very different, hey, these people are lying this way. Give me a sense of what you might expect tone and tenor wise in the lobbies of the Gray Eagle, I believe it&#39;s where it being held here in Calgary, the casino for the UCP AGM coming up this weekend.</span>

Give him till March. March, he is the most talented political operative we&#39;ve ever had, in part because he&#39;s the only political operative we&#39;ve ever had. But let&#39;s give him the chance to earn his way out of this. And if he&#39;s not out in March or April, then he&#39;s already said that he&#39;ll step aside. Let him do that. But for now, let&#39;s not prejudge it. If he had a series of loyalists, that&#39;s what they should be doing, going around the hall, hall buying people drinks making sure that there&#39;s lots and lots and lots of hospitality suites that are essentially</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s talk about the specifics here in terms of what you feel like. Of course, we are doing a bit of like tea leaf reading, right? Like in terms of what we feel like tone and tenor might look like. But we&#39;ve seen and witnessed this in the past that parties heading getting into AGMs or conventions without the most sort of healthiest sense of camaraderie or spirit. What are some of the things you expect? Carter&#39;s mentioned a few that there&#39;s going to be an ongoing campaign that the leaders community and the leaders circle will be talking, you know, talking up the leader, plying people with with alcohol and giving them the rub when one shows up to to their suites. What else do you kind of expect in these contentious times for the UCP?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah that that kind of whispering and that jockeying is something that occurs but you&#39;ve also got to keep in mind at a convention everybody can see what you&#39;re doing and who you&#39;re hanging out with so i often think people overblow what it&#39;s going to feel like a bad convention like it has to be really bad to start feeling that malice on the floor because there&#39;s a certain uh you know decorum that comes from everybody being in the room and seeing each other in fact i think one of the things that jason kenney really has going for him is that this is an an in-person convention. We&#39;ve seen some conventions lately that have been online, and I think that the tenor has been bad as a result. And we talked about this after Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s convention, and I think maybe even in the lead-up to it, and we talked about this about Jagmeet Singh&#39;s most recent convention. It&#39;s hard to control a room that you&#39;re not actually in when all of these chats are happening on WhatsApp as you&#39;re listening in the convention thing. And yeah, everyone&#39;s texting in a convention back and forth, But you&#39;re in the room with people and there&#39;s a different feeling when you&#39;re all in the room and there&#39;s different levers that the leader can pull when you&#39;re all in the room where you can control the tone. And of course, the one that&#39;s making a lot of headlines in Alberta right now is that resolutions</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">resolutions can&#39;t come to the floor unless the leader proposes them, which I actually don&#39;t think is as nuts as everybody is acting. But, you know,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know, I guess what I&#39;m saying is there are signs, you know, there is the whispering, there&#39;s the rumors, there&#39;s the who&#39;s hanging out with these people. All of a sudden, people are hanging around Brian Jean. That would be interesting, because you can all see who&#39;s hanging around Brian Jean. And so it&#39;s a bit of an overt signal at that point. But because everything on a convention floor is by nature in public and overt, the thing is often much tamer, even when a party is falling apart, then people are licking their lips and waiting for it.

Okay, let&#39;s leave this bracket open for a second, because I want to actually blank sheet this with you guys in terms of Team Kenny strategy and Team Let&#39;s Accelerate the Leadership review for this guy strategy. But I want to actually leave this bracket open and go to something Corey mentioned, which is the two substantive threads of discussion that are happening right now. The first one is the one about only the leader can introduce new resolutions to the floor. And the second one, Carter, is the conversation around will 22 constituency associations sign on to expedite Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership review that is being held in April? Those are the two like live wire threads that one might say are the most practical and tactical ways that Kenney&#39;s leadership could be could be usurped. Corey, you&#39;re shaking your head. So I&#39;ll let you jump in first before I go to Carter. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, no, that&#39;s not the most practical way his leadership gets usurped at all.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">What&#39;s going to happen is there&#39;s going to be this weird dance that goes on from this time the convention opens with all of those social cues we&#39;ve talked about, where you are going to see people who oppose Jason Kenney trying to ratchet up and get people to telegraph their displeasure with the leader in increasingly large ways. it will start with sitting on hands it&#39;ll start with applause that is a little applause that&#39;s a little bit lagged behind and after a while people get the sense oh we&#39;re not with this man right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right and then the room gets a little bit chillier it gets a little bit frostier all of a sudden after the speech there&#39;s conversations at those hospitality suites saying boy not a great speech by the leader boy and he really needed a good one now and hmm you know if it&#39;s not going to be him who&#39;s it going to be and what what they&#39;re going to be looking for are those small things that erode confidence that jason kenney has control over this they&#39;re not going to be trying to create if they&#39;re smart these big moments uh that all of a sudden force a backlash effect where people say no to defend the party and to make this not look like a clown car we need to vote against this resolution right that happens too quickly and uh they&#39;re screwed now if they immediately read the room if they immediately get a sense that those kinds of resolutions like you know this one about about more constituency associations are needed to sort of pull the rug out from underneath Jason Kenney, then yeah, maybe you go for those things now. But I would call those high risk, low reward. And so if Jason Kenney&#39;s opponents are smart, and I&#39;m not saying necessarily that they&#39;ve acted in the smartest fashion lately, they&#39;re not going to try to push those things too hard or too fast. They&#39;re going to downplay them. They&#39;re going to say, they&#39;re not really important. We know that that this is a convention that has more loyalists of Jason Kenney, you know, they&#39;re really going to try to minimize the likelihood that that&#39;s going to pass. Because what&#39;s your best outcome there? You get this leadership review a month early? I don&#39;t know about that. I&#39;m just not sure it&#39;s worth the risk of you losing that vote after clearly going for it, which will strengthen Jason Kenney. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, jump in on the strategy. And I do want to get into Team Kenney, Team Not Kenney, and then Team X, which is X denotes a person in that room who may want to seek the leadership and what their strategies need to be this weekend. Before we&#39;re doing that, address this point about the 22 CAs. Do you feel like they&#39;re going to reach that threshold prior to this convention? And what would be the smart thing for someone to do if they wanted Jason Kenney gone at this moment in time, building off on what Corey said?</span>

Or I have no choice but to vote no. I expect to see a rebound in the polls. I mean, I have to see it. I can&#39;t vote for him if there&#39;s not a rebound in the polls. I care too much about the party. I have to see that he&#39;s listening to us, that his grassroots guarantee was worth the paper it was written on. I haven&#39;t seen that in today&#39;s convention, but it doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t pull it out between now and March 31st. I have to see that because I believe in the grassroots. I believe in this party. And the third thing I need to see, I need to see how the rest of us feel. I need us to feel like a team again because it&#39;s the team that brought us here and it&#39;s the team that&#39;s going to take us forward.

            <span class="text">Corey, I want to give you a moment on this question, which is the only person that can propose new resolutions is Jason Kenney, the party leader. Many people freaking out about it, including Blaise Bomer, former Kenney staffer, seems like he&#39;s saying it&#39;s hard to read into this, saying here lies the grassroots guarantee 2017 to 2021. rest in peace almost implying that this is a affront to the aforementioned grassroots guarantee cory why is this you you briefly mentioned it not as ridiculous as as some people are making it online in your opinion yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s just say um blaze bomer former kenny staffer anytime anybody&#39;s a former staffer you have to ask and i don&#39;t have any sense of this i don&#39;t know how their parts or paths stopped but are we 100 sure that there&#39;s not some sort of some some personal angle on here, I think you can just entirely discount that. So don&#39;t, you know, don&#39;t read too much into that world. It&#39;s not saying the sky is falling any more than it already was for Jason Kenney, and he was already in a bad state. The other thing is the rule says no resolutions other than the special resolutions and resolutions approved by the board will be considered with the exception of those proposed by the leader.</span>

You know, the first point that Stephen said is, if we&#39;re still at 20% in the polls, then I got I mean, I don&#39;t really have a choice. That&#39;s a real feeling that any political party under siege like that is going to be feeling. And so what&#39;s your narrative? Sell me sell me on why we&#39;re here, and make it a hero narrative that gets us back to where we&#39;ve got to be. So it&#39;s Jason Kenney made the tough decision decisions, unpopular, you know, a good compromise leaves everybody dissatisfied, whatever it is, whatever you&#39;re going to be spinning out there, it&#39;s got to be a consistent story. And it&#39;s got to be one that reinforces a narrative that will ultimately help you both in the day and then down the road, because you&#39;ve got to keep your eyes on that April deadline. And frankly, you got to keep your eyes on the election too. And to get there, you&#39;ve got to create a sense of unity and energy. So</span>

And then you start working those connections to see who they They know that you didn&#39;t have on your list and you build out and you build these coalitions on a person-by-person basis to make sure that you control the room and that the people who are ornery that you need to talk to, you&#39;re talking to, the people who are ornery that you can&#39;t help, you&#39;re isolating, you&#39;ve got to build plans specific to them. So I&#39;m imagining that in that room, Zane, there are people who have, you know, cross-cutting responsibilities, geographic responsibilities.

Carter, let&#39;s talk about their goals for Saturday or the weekend overall. What are their goals? Because if Team Kenney&#39;s goal is to survive the weekend, is this group&#39;s goal to make sure he&#39;s gone by the weekend? It can&#39;t be that, right? So what does their goal look like for the weekend? Let&#39;s start there, and then let&#39;s reframe some of the tactics we&#39;ve already thrown out on the table.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, I think that if you&#39;re in this position, what you want to be doing is you actually want to establish relationships and you don&#39;t know who&#39;s for kenny and who&#39;s against kenny i mean it&#39;s relatively easy to assume that everybody&#39;s against kenny but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but this is the party that put them there and the 20 percent of people who actually support kenny in the province of alberta are the most likely to attend this event right so let&#39;s say that half the room are people that actually support kenny you do not want to be talking to 50 of the delegates and saying it&#39;s time for that fucker to go and then trying to organize them in march and april to support your your leadership candidate, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? What you want to be able to do is kind of put things into what I had couched it in, those three different things, those three different things. It&#39;s not about Kenny. It&#39;s about our party. It&#39;s about retaining government. We can&#39;t hand things back to the NDP. If we hand this government back to the NDP, let&#39;s not forget what a disaster it was four years ago. We have only been taken down by a natural disaster that&#39;s worldwide. No one has managed this well. No one has got themselves in a perfect position. Jason Kenney has suffered, but we need to we need to remember that it was the NDP fucking things up before we even got into into into the office that really made this tough. So we got to survive till March. Let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s give him the opportunity. And then in March, if he&#39;s not doing well, I think he&#39;s going to step down anyways. He won&#39;t put himself through the indignity of the leadership review and we can launch a leadership under the proper circumstances. circumstances that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">so carter&#39;s saying success looks like make it till march uh the strategy here is kill them with kindness right ultimately talk about the party cory you&#39;ve mentioned a bit of this as well right Right. The iterative ratcheting up of the volume, the seeding of certain conversations being like, you know, he needs to deliver a killer speech. He didn&#39;t do that. Those sort of things, almost like predetermined lines. Yes. And this from for me, Corey, what else are you adding to the mix? If you&#39;re on this this group of of supporters that, you know, are anti Kenny, what are you trying to tell them to do? do? And what are you trying to get them to do on the floor heading into the critical period of the speech and then into Saturday night?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">cory and carter to you for either of you to jump in is there any overarching tactics that you feel like you you would um suggest or recommend to this group carter you threw out the one of not showing up to speech that one keeps coming back to my mind is that something you would do is that a bridge too far is there any other tactical things that you do do you try to compete fire with fire to say we&#39;re going to also host um united hospitality suites or something like that i&#39;m kind of throwing out tactical ideas for what could go on on the weekend are you handing out flyers or posters to try to course correct the direction of the conversation, just throwing out random things. But curious to hear your thoughts on this. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s just say that you&#39;ve now hired me to be the most aggressive, biggest asshole that I possibly can be. And let me just say, that&#39;s pretty big. Okay, so that&#39;s big time. The way I would do it is I would say, okay, we&#39;re not attending anything that&#39;s vaguely associated with the leader&#39;s hospitality suites. Okay.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So we need to make sure that our hospitality hospitality suites are bigger and more engaging. We need to have more of them. I don&#39;t want a single person going to the leader&#39;s lunch. Instead, what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to host our own lunch across the street or wherever, you know, somewhere else in the in the Gray Eagle. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, listen, can I jump in on that? Yeah. It&#39;s not the Brian Jean lunch. It&#39;s the grassroots lunch. It&#39;s the grassroots hospitality</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And it&#39;s it&#39;s all all about grassroots and there is no leadership contenders there because it&#39;s you who matters. Right. And, you know, ironically it&#39;s really quite communist because it feels like a commune. Everybody gets the exact same food, the same number of beers and everything else. But it&#39;s just, that&#39;s ironic the way that unfolded. But you, you, if you want to organize this to be the worst thing that you can do, then you&#39;re handing out like you&#39;re, you&#39;re, you&#39;re, you&#39;re doing the flash pad, you know what did, what did Christy Clark have? the eight o&#39;clock club that 801 club or whatever it was but 801 after she lost the election they&#39;d force her out and everybody had a uh a pin underneath her lapel</span>

          <div class="turn">

So what&#39;d you gain? Two months? And now you got to launch a leadership in the middle of the fucking winter? Who wants that? No one wants a leadership in the winter. Wait until April. Have a nice little leadership when you can go outside and have a barbecue, especially at the risk of more COVID problems. This is the way to go.</span>

So clearly media is part of this. For either the Team Kenny supporters or for the Team Anti-Kenny supporters, is there any sort of back-channeling media relations that you two would be doing if those were your tribes or campaigns that you were running on the floor for Saturday and parts of Sunday?

Do we think it&#39;s going to be 11? No. We think it&#39;s going to be the first step towards rebuilding that trust with the grassroots, which is something we&#39;re committed to be doing. uh on the other hand if you are the if you&#39;re the opponents i&#39;m just going to use brian jean as a proxy here and you&#39;re whispering to your media contacts what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re managing expectations the other way you&#39;re saying come on this is a party convention in a party that jason kenny himself created</span>

No, this room has five people in it. You walk in. There is one existing minister of the UCP, and there are four of his or her closest aides. And this person tells you in confidence, I need this guy gone. I have ambitions for leadership. Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan, you are in that room. Corey, you&#39;ve already told us a bit about what your strategy might be for a person that is in this position. It&#39;s probably not the Brian Jean strategy. And this person, to be totally clear, is not Brian Jean. It is someone else other than Brian Jean. He&#39;s already carved out his lane, and we&#39;ve addressed it tangentially in the past and in this episode. But Carter, this is someone else, someone who has visions for the party, someone currently maybe holds a position in the party. Let&#39;s say they&#39;re a cabinet minister within the party. They have an agenda. They&#39;ve laid it out to you. What does their one sheet start with in terms of their goals for success this weekend? And then let&#39;s walk through their strategy and tactics of what they do as a person, knowing that the that the the brain trust and the membership and the hyper engaged with the party are here this weekend.

Their whole concept of swapping the leader in April, May, June, whenever they do it, I think is too shallow, that there&#39;s a fundamental change needed, that I&#39;m someone who may have held political office in the past, maybe a household name, or maybe wanting to make a name for myself by running for leadership of this party.

We don&#39;t know the details of the child care deal, although we do know that there&#39;s a private operator who is going to be joining up there. So you have to imagine that private operators are probably a bigger part of the Alberta deal than other deals. But it&#39;s interesting and it&#39;s risky because if this is seen as a big government program that is aligned with the Trudeau liberals, it could hurt him at his convention. But if he can legitimately say we have really held the feet to the fire of the Trudeau liberals, We&#39;ve gotten back a program that is materially different, that is appropriate for Alberta, that respects our diversity of options that are available here, including private operators, including the fact that not everybody has two parents who are working. Sometimes it&#39;s the grandmother who&#39;s watching. Sometimes it&#39;s a day home, whatever it is, right? If it truly looks a little bit different than everywhere else and a little bit more small government than everywhere else, it could be a real win for him.
