And I think that his challenge going into a leadership review is he will find a number of New Brunswickers even who agree with him on the general parents should be informed when big things are happening in their children&#39;s life kind of point of view, right?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, I suspect at this point the people around him are telling him exactly what he wants to hear. And we got a little bit of reporting in the last week about resignation from caucus, which basically said you&#39;re a tyrant and you run roughshod over things and you turn successes into failures. Paraphrasing pretty heavily at this particular moment, but that&#39;s the saying. And my suspicion is that a year later, it&#39;s not better. And so if there are people who used to stand up to Higgs, they haven&#39;t been in government for some time, I suspect. And instead, what you have is, I would wager a bunch of people who are saying in isolation, this polls pretty well. Right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the challenge Higgs has long-term is there&#39;s a lot of hairs on this. And the minute the conversation gets unspooled a bit, and you start talking about the reasons why you might want to have exemptions from this policy, the reasons you might not want to make it mandatory, you&#39;re going to have a lot of people going, oh yeah, well, not in that case,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? But this very firm position that Higgs has drawn, I think is superficially popular. But as if he wants to run a leadership review or an election on it, it will not be popular. That would be my guess.</span>

But the principal may say, this is something I truly believe. And it&#39;s something that we have to do, for any number of reasons why they may take that position. Now, if we remove this particular issue and say it&#39;s just something that the leader feels very strongly about, then you as a staffer have to, at some point, recognize that&#39;s what they&#39;re calling for. They&#39;re calling for this particular issue. They wish to spend their political capital on this. And it&#39;s not my job to talk them out of that. It is my job to make sure that they survive it.

            <span class="text">Well, I think that&#39;s a good point. As strategists, and this is in some ways a build on from something we were saying earlier this week but i think one of the fun things about being a strategist is getting the constraints and saying like well you can do this but you can&#39;t do that and you&#39;ve got to try to figure it out and so there&#39;s that puzzle element to it all here and it feels a bit weird using this as explanation for this particular issue because one of the things steven didn&#39;t talk about is if you find it truly objectionable your job is just to leave yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right but if you uh if you&#39;re sticking around and you&#39;re doing the particular thing your job is just to play the hand as best as you can and sometimes you&#39;re going to lose sometimes you&#39;re going to lose because they played their hand better and sometimes you&#39;re going to lose because their hand is better and even if they played it worse they just had a better hand and so the situation you often find yourself in these situations is a losing one but that doesn&#39;t mean as a strategist you have failed right and i can think of a number of situations both in you know in my job and then when i&#39;ve observed other people in their roles and whatnot where it&#39;s like Like, well, I beat them, but man, they played their hand really well. And I think we can all sort of think of that, right? Where you say like, well, I won at the end of that, but you made me sweat a little bit. And you certainly were pretty clever in how you approach this particular issue. And as a strategist, you kind of live for those moments. And sometimes, even in defeat, you&#39;ve kind of shown cleverness. And that&#39;s okay.</span>

And now you get to focus. It&#39;s very interesting timing. Generally speaking, this isn&#39;t the time when you would see a leadership review. You don&#39;t see a leadership review heading into the summer. This could be a very difficult time for them to be facing a leadership review.</span>

Some we don&#39;t know simply because we&#39;re not New Brunswickers and we&#39;re not necessarily deeply immersed in their party constitution. But let&#39;s talk about what we do know. The majority of riding presidents have now said that they are calling for a review. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not to vote, yes, we support the fellow, it&#39;s because they oppose him.

            <span class="text">there is already organization that&#39;s occurring against the sitting premier. And so that&#39;s interesting to me, particularly because that does suggest to me that if there is a membership cell component, if there is the the whipping of the votes component, then people are going to be able to marshal against the premier in ways that he might find more challenging than he believes going into it. And I have no doubt he believes he has the rank and file. But the thing he&#39;s got to keep in mind is,</span>

            <span class="text">nobody is obliged to see the issue in terms of the issue right and we i talked at the start about this could call into question judgment this could call into question character i&#39;m quite sure i&#39;m quite sure that those writing presidents know exactly how they&#39;re going to talk to conservatives about this in a way that actually skirts around that issue right if that issue is in fact not particularly popular with the rank and file It&#39;ll be things like he&#39;s distracted people. He&#39;s made the province look bad. You know, he&#39;s proven he can&#39;t work with people. This is nuts. There were compromises available. There were sensible alternatives. I&#39;m not saying parents shouldn&#39;t know, but the way that Higgs has worked with the caucus and the cabinet and the party has made it clear that he is lighting more fires than he&#39;s putting out. And we just can&#39;t have this right now. and the issue that he runs his leadership on may end up being very different than the one</span>

            <span class="text">media here love a good anniversary story. And then in addition, across Canada, there&#39;s, as you guys know, a lot of forest fires right now. Canada is burning. We&#39;re experiencing our worst wildfire season in recent years. And people outside of Canada have taken note when the smoke recently drifted there. so</span>

            <span class="text">let&#39;s uh let&#39;s kind of chat about these like natural disaster-esque climate change things in this broader um this broader policy lens um i know we&#39;ve talked on a previous episode about how smith fared um relatively well i would say during the wildfires that hit during the election cory you had kind of talked about how that was like a key piece of the election during the flood we We obviously saw the big bump for Nenshi. From like a strategy point of view, what should leaders do when natural disaster strikes?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And I guess what should they not do? I&#39;ll start off. I think that the most important thing for a leader to do in a natural disaster is to be only the spokesperson, right? Like there is a trained public service that is their job to manage emergencies. And they will come to the premier or the mayor for decisions and input when required. But they do not need another manager. They need a leader, right? They need a spokesperson. They need a decision maker. They</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They need someone who is keeping the rest of the council informed or the rest of the cabinet informed.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and the other thing that they don&#39;t need is leadership that puts the same disaster back up on the table again and i think that that&#39;s where the problem is with climate change we are seeing significant disasters that are repeating in nature and some some politicians some some people are working really hard to make sure that those don&#39;t happen again and other leaders are ignoring it and saying this is just business as usual. And I think that those are two very different responses. And right after the floods, right after the floods in Calgary, and I think in the floods in Winnipeg and the floods that we&#39;ve seen across the country, whether it&#39;s the lower mainland, the natural reaction of most politicians has been this is a result of change. We must make sure that we are prepared for that scenario. scenario and in this fire situation in alberta the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the reaction is different than that the reaction is this is just business as normal we don&#39;t have to worry about the fact that we cut our rapid attack teams which rapid attack is rapid attack of the helicopters coming in and putting out the fire we don&#39;t have to worry about cutting those teams because you know what this is just an abnormal year it&#39;s not just an abnormal year this is the new normal and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and so making sure that we have plans Plans in place for the future. That&#39;s the politician&#39;s job. It&#39;s not just to, you know, get in there and roll their sleeves up and pretend like they&#39;re, in fact, in charge. They need to respect the public service and then do their jobs, which is prepare us for real change in the future.</span>

            <span class="text">Is there an ideal time? And I mean, you referenced in Alberta that we&#39;re not using those words climate change. In fact, the Premier is talking about arson, not climate change. But when you&#39;re dealing with natural disaster, is there an ideal time when you, and I&#39;m talking about this in the 2023 context, not the flood 10 years ago, but when you do talk about climate change, like when you use those words, when you&#39;re speaking to media, when you&#39;re speaking to the public?</span>

            <span class="text">you know, it&#39;s really interesting. It&#39;s not actually that dissimilar from the conversations and the discourse you see with shootings in the United States, right? During the actual disaster, during the actual emergency, people</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people don&#39;t seem to have a lot of interest in people bringing up the why and how it can be stopped. It&#39;s like, that&#39;s insensitive. We have to talk about the moment. We have to talk about the people who are hurting. We got to keep politics out of it, right? Right. And it&#39;s a really interesting thing we do. To Stephen&#39;s point, we actually don&#39;t need our politicians to be politicians in many contexts during an emergency. And in fact, we don&#39;t really want them to be. We want them to make some of the decisions that trickle their way up to cabinet or to the mayor and council, as it may be. And we want them to be a communicator. Right. We want them to take the messages that are given and clearly communicate them to the public in a way that, frankly, the public service is not super at. And I will talk about 2013 for a minute. Nahid Nenshi famously goes on a bit of a rant about people who are rafting down a flooding river. And he&#39;s like, I got a lot of nouns I want to describe these people as. I&#39;m not allowed to call them that, right? Nenshi,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Nenshi, no. Well, the incident commander is not going to say that, right? And so it was punchy, it was memorable, it was captured, and you bet your ass people stayed off the river a little bit more after that. So politicians do have kind of that value as a communicator. And I think that&#39;s one of the weird tensions, because there is sort of an understanding in the moment, we don&#39;t need the politics, but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but the policy is actually kind of important if you don&#39;t want to get there again. And so what&#39;s the right moment to then have the policy discussion to say, here&#39;s how we we don&#39;t get it into this situation again. And I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever figured that out. I&#39;m not sure there is kind of a right moment because sensibly you would think, well, this is the moment, you know, we are dealing with the consequences. Well, they&#39;re fresh in our mind. Let&#39;s, let&#39;s manage it. But that&#39;s often seen as insensitive. And so politicians sort of struggle with when the right moment to kind of feather in behind and have this conversation is. But as you&#39;re seeing with the shootings in the United States, people are losing patience with the the thoughts and prayers approaches and let&#39;s just wait and let&#39;s talk about this later. And increasingly people are saying, no, let&#39;s talk about it now. We don&#39;t have time for this nonsense. Let&#39;s talk about it now. And so I think the conversation is also shifting on this one. And there is more of an expectation that in the moment or immediately after</span>

            <span class="text">Well, look, I would say if that&#39;s happening, I mean, if Edmonton, Edmonton&#39;s a big city, and that would be a tragedy, probably a pretty epic proportions and the scale of the the tragedy does tend to push off those conversations. And so I&#39;m not really sure that you could make a hard and fast rule on that particular one. I definitely think that if you are challenging people&#39;s existing beliefs, it&#39;s harder to have that conversation, which is why it&#39;s harder in the United States to have the conversation about guns. There are other jurisdictions such as Australia, where there&#39;s a shooting, you know, decades ago, and that&#39;s enough for the entire population to say, well, I think we&#39;re done with these guns, then like</span>

            <span class="text">these automatic weapons have got to go because the population was a little closer to that position to begin with. America has a lot of weird things going on, including like a bunch of lobbying in the NRA, but that made it seem a little bit more charged, a little bit more political, a little more avoidable. Here in Alberta, the fire conversation, when you start saying, well, this kind of feels like it&#39;s the inevitable consequence of climate change. I&#39;m kind of, you can look at charts and see how many months or not months, but hours, the city of Calgary has choked in forest fire smoke smoke over the past 30, 40 years, it&#39;s a shocking change.

They&#39;ve cultivated that belief, that value system. And here in Alberta, you know, especially within the UCP, there is a value set that says if we tackle climate change, we are only cutting our own throats. I&#39;ll tell you something, if this was radiation coming in from Russia after a nuclear incident or radiation coming in from Japan, we&#39;d be telling them to get their shit together because, you know, this is all really bad. But it&#39;s our smoke and it&#39;s coming from our province. And it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s so much harder to point the finger at ourselves. And because of that, we&#39;re not actually doing it.

This is not, I wouldn&#39;t want to be misunderstood by our audience outside this province, but certainly it&#39;s an issue where you&#39;re going to get a lot of bite back compared to some other jurisdictions, even in Canada. But yeah, I like the idea of saying, look, Albertans have never been afraid of a challenge. We&#39;ve never shied away from dealing with tough things. We were dealing with these problems before a lot of other people. and we&#39;ve got to get back to that forward-looking view that actually Albertans really carried forward in years past. Like, we&#39;re not afraid of this. We&#39;re not afraid of this because we are people who deal with the things that need to be dealt with. And look, you can sit there in another jurisdiction or you can sit there across the aisle if you&#39;re Danielle Smith and you can say, climate change is hard. I want to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. Well, it does exist. It&#39;s incontrovertible. Nobody&#39;s disputing this. The world is changing. Let&#39;s be on top of that change. Let&#39;s save this world. let&#39;s be fucking legends because we&#39;re albertans and that&#39;s what we do and i think that there is an attitude that you can pull into this that almost kind of like dismisses as like make make them seem like they&#39;re the ones who are small or scared or whatnot right and and you are the ones who are like no sweat on my back like i know we can deal with this thing this is not a hard thing to deal with if we just do it we just need a government that&#39;s willing to do it and</span>

You know, we&#39;ve got to act. I think we&#39;ve got to have, you know, the highest environmental standards, the highest social standards, the highest governance standards. And yeah, this is a reality. Alberta&#39;s on top of this reality. We were the first to have a price on large emitters, as Stephen mentioned. uh the first oil producing jurisdiction to to tax those emitters period i believe i at least that&#39;s something i know we used to say an awful lot and um and there were all sorts of things that alberta was doing relatively early to address these things in terms of investments in uh you know reducing carbon emissions on an intensity basis which a lot of people will light their hair on fire but it&#39;s ultimately saying like a barrel of oil is creating fewer You know, fewer emissions than a barrel of oil 20 years ago. Now, when you&#39;re doing four times as many barrels of oil, that&#39;s going to kind of more than offset it. But there</span>

Yes, so there is some logic to the fact that if we&#39;re not paying the gas tax and if the gas tax is supposed to pay for roads because we have electric vehicles, so then that money has to come from somewhere and maybe there should be money on registration. All right, I&#39;ll concede that but then i want to come i see it paid for registration for every vehicle right like i don&#39;t want it to be something that&#39;s specific to electric vehicles and penalizing somebody purchasing an electric vehicle that seems to be very clearly you know for a government that&#39;s supposed to be free market putting your thumbs on things in ways that are not particularly helpful the</span>
