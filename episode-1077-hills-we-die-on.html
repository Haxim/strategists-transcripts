And I think that those are two very different responses. And right after the floods, right after the floods in Calgary, and I think in the floods in Winnipeg and the floods that we&#39;ve seen across the country, whether it&#39;s the lower mainland, the natural reaction of most politicians has been this is a result of change.

To Stephen&#39;s point, we actually don&#39;t need our politicians to be politicians in many contexts during an emergency. And in fact, we don&#39;t really want them to be. We want them to make some of the decisions that trickle their way up to cabinet or to the mayor and council, as it may be. And we want them to be a communicator. Right. We want them to take the messages that are given and clearly communicate them to the public in a way that, frankly, the public service is not super at. And I will talk about 2013 for a minute. Nahid Nenshi famously goes on a bit of a rant about people who are rafting down a flooding river. And he&#39;s like, I got a lot of nouns I want to describe these people as.

And so it was punchy, it was memorable, it was captured, and you bet your ass people stayed off the river a little bit more after that. So politicians do have kind of that value as a communicator. And I think that&#39;s one of the weird tensions, because there is sort of an understanding in the moment, we don&#39;t need the politics, but</div>

            <div class="said">but the policy is actually kind of important if you don&#39;t want to get there again. And so what&#39;s the right moment to then have the policy discussion to say, here&#39;s how we we don&#39;t get it into this situation again. And I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever figured that out. I&#39;m not sure there is kind of a right moment because sensibly you would think, well, this is the moment, you know, we are dealing with the consequences. Well, they&#39;re fresh in our mind. Let&#39;s, let&#39;s manage it. But that&#39;s often seen as insensitive. And so politicians sort of struggle with when the right moment to kind of feather in behind and have this conversation is. But as you&#39;re seeing with the shootings in the United States, people are losing patience with the the thoughts and prayers approaches and let&#39;s just wait and let&#39;s talk about this later. And increasingly people are saying, no, let&#39;s talk about it now. We don&#39;t have time for this nonsense. Let&#39;s talk about it now. And so I think the conversation is also shifting on this one. And there is more of an expectation that in the moment or immediately after</div>

And so I&#39;m not really sure that you could make a hard and fast rule on that particular one. I definitely think that if you are challenging people&#39;s existing beliefs, it&#39;s harder to have that conversation, which is why it&#39;s harder in the United States to have the conversation about guns. There are other jurisdictions such as Australia, where there&#39;s a shooting, you know, decades ago, and that&#39;s enough for the entire population to say, well, I think we&#39;re done with these guns, then like</div>

America has a lot of weird things going on, including like a bunch of lobbying in the NRA, but that made it seem a little bit more charged, a little bit more political, a little more avoidable. Here in Alberta, the fire conversation, when you start saying, well, this kind of feels like it&#39;s the inevitable consequence of climate change. I&#39;m kind of, you can look at charts and see how many months or not months, but hours, the city of Calgary has choked in forest fire smoke smoke over the past 30, 40 years, it&#39;s a shocking change.

            <div class="said">most Albertans know climate change is a real thing. Like, polling shows that. This is not, I wouldn&#39;t want to be misunderstood by our audience outside this province, but certainly it&#39;s an issue where you&#39;re going to get a lot of bite back compared to some other jurisdictions, even in Canada. But yeah, I like the idea of saying, look, Albertans have never been afraid of a challenge. We&#39;ve never shied away from dealing with tough things. We were dealing with these problems before a lot of other people. and we&#39;ve got to get back to that forward-looking view that actually Albertans really carried forward in years past. Like, we&#39;re not afraid of this. We&#39;re not afraid of this because we are people who deal with the things that need to be dealt with. And look, you can sit there in another jurisdiction or you can sit there across the aisle if you&#39;re Danielle Smith and you can say, climate change is hard. I want to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist. Well, it does exist. It&#39;s incontrovertible. Nobody&#39;s disputing this. The world is changing. Let&#39;s be on top of that change. Let&#39;s save this world. let&#39;s be fucking legends because we&#39;re albertans and that&#39;s what we do and i think that there is an attitude that you can pull into this that almost kind of like dismisses as like make make them seem like they&#39;re the ones who are small or scared or whatnot right and and you are the ones who are like no sweat on my back like i know we can deal with this thing this is not a hard thing to deal with if we just do it we just need a government that&#39;s willing to do it and</div>

You know, we&#39;ve got to act. I think we&#39;ve got to have, you know, the highest environmental standards, the highest social standards, the highest governance standards. And yeah, this is a reality. Alberta&#39;s on top of this reality. We were the first to have a price on large emitters, as Stephen mentioned. uh the first oil producing jurisdiction to to tax those emitters period i believe i at least that&#39;s something i know we used to say an awful lot and um and there were all sorts of things that alberta was doing relatively early to address these things in terms of investments in uh you know reducing carbon emissions on an intensity basis which a lot of people will light their hair on fire but it&#39;s ultimately saying like a barrel of oil is creating fewer You know, fewer emissions than a barrel of oil 20 years ago. Now, when you&#39;re doing four times as many barrels of oil, that&#39;s going to kind of more than offset it. But there</div>

Yes, so there is some logic to the fact that if we&#39;re not paying the gas tax and if the gas tax is supposed to pay for roads because we have electric vehicles, so then that money has to come from somewhere and maybe there should be money on registration. All right, I&#39;ll concede that but then i want to come i see it paid for registration for every vehicle right like i don&#39;t want it to be something that&#39;s specific to electric vehicles and penalizing somebody purchasing an electric vehicle that seems to be very clearly you know for a government that&#39;s supposed to be free market putting your thumbs on things in ways that are not particularly helpful the</div>
