Stephen Carter, many people are praising your performance on that episode as being some of the most insightful commentary they&#39;ve heard from you in a very, very long time, especially in that middle portion.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to go to you first. I don&#39;t want to talk about Julie Payette. I don&#39;t want to talk about her leaving. We can talk about that in the confines of vice regal politics, which is our other podcast, by the way. We do exclusively vice regal politics. But the question I have is, is the hurt on the Trudeau government? And is there any political angle here that you feel like elongates beyond the news cycle of the report that&#39;s going to come out this week? And is there any political hay to make? That&#39;s my main question on this, because let&#39;s talk about that in the confines of electoral politics. What do you think? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that there are the narrowest of pathways through which this matters, which is to say there&#39;s not really at all. One is we actually find ourselves in a full-fledged constitutional crisis in the next couple of days. Although let me just say, I actually think that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is better situated to be able to answer constitutional constitutional questions than a random government appointee anyhow. So we may find out this is a better system. Are</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Are you telling me someone with legal training who&#39;s the Chief Justice of Canada is better than an astronaut in that role? Yes, maybe. Okay, okay. Now, if I was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was sending someone to space, probably not our Chief Justice. Right. But</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the other one is that if you can somehow, I mean, if there is a common thread here, it is kind of the Justin Trudeau style over substance You know, somebody who looked great on paper, but when you get past the veneer, you realize there&#39;s absolutely nothing there. And in that sense, it&#39;s a bit reinforcing. I&#39;m sure it will be kind of shouted out in shitty ways by all sorts of people. But I can&#39;t imagine most Canadians are going to care beyond sports team caring. You know, they don&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t like the Liberals,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Liberals, so they&#39;ll say shame on him. They do like the Liberals, so they&#39;ll say he</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he was great for giving it a shot. It doesn&#39;t matter. The governor general doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s an archaic position that pops up every time we have one of these weird moments where Michelle Jeanne has to decide whether to prorogue parliament or not. And again, in those situations, probably,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">probably, you know, they&#39;re not actually even that qualified for the job. It&#39;s a stupid fucking job. It&#39;s an artifact of a different era. And if we could get rid of it, we should. But we can&#39;t because in the Constitution, it would take 10 out of 10 provinces to agree. So we&#39;re stuck with it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. More on that from Corey in our vice regal podcast. Regal on regal. Carter, anything else to add to Corey&#39;s comments? My question is the same. The pathway for this to be politically damaging for Trudeau, and there&#39;s a few that I see, but you have to tell me how likely they are to be damaging. The first one is Corey&#39;s, the style over substance argument. The second one is around Trudeau not necessarily owning this particular incident with the governor general on workplace harassment. What does that say about a guy who touts his brand as being feminist and progressive? And then the third one is, if the report is scathing and further reaching, is there any sort of upside there? But maybe I&#39;ll ask you the same question in a different way. If you&#39;re the conservatives right now, are you just letting this one stick and focusing on other things? Or are you trying to look for an angle here on the governor general story? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think if you&#39;re a conservative, you&#39;re going to just try and throw everything you&#39;ve got at this because it does seem to be something that people can make</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">make some hay out of. First of all, it&#39;s something that is a size that matters. So I think the thing that probably has the most resonance is the $100,000 plus annuity every year that she&#39;s going to be paid. You know, that has a lot of weight. But unfortunately, I think if you go back to every conservative governor general who was appointed, they&#39;re also collecting the exact same amount of money. So it probably won&#39;t stick. It doesn&#39;t have much in the way of legs. And in terms of what I&#39;m seeing that&#39;s troubling me is this kind of, you know, Justin Trudeau chose this governor</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">governor general to put up in the window, right? That this, you know, we had a STEM educated woman who&#39;s been to space, who&#39;s highly decorated, highly intelligent, and it failed. So let&#39;s go back to appointing white guys because we&#39;ve never had white guys take us in the wrong spot. I think this was an aspirational choice. I think that choosing Julie Payette was the right thing to do. And I don&#39;t recall a huge amount of criticism at the beginning until like, I guess, maybe a week or two in, we found out that she was a Looney Tune. But that&#39;s okay. You know, like these things happen. And it&#39;s unfortunate because it&#39;s one of those appointments that goes for a while. But in general, I don&#39;t think that we should move away from putting forward those in our society that we wish to celebrate, right? And I&#39;d love to see a First Nations governor general. I&#39;d love to see someone from B.C. Call me crazy. But, you know, the province out there apparently has people. So let&#39;s give it a whirl. Like, let&#39;s give it a whirl. And I don&#39;t think you should be terrified of this because at the end of the day, to Corey&#39;s point, it is a giant nothing burger. Who the fuck cares who the governor general is?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Both of you had nothing to say, but now Carter is on a soapbox about, you know, Canadian values.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">reflecting on your earlier comment that podcasts are better when I speak less, and I came to a different conclusion.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="text">But you yourself said on this podcast that liberals have had a proclivity in the past to appoint big symbolic centerpieces. Like it&#39;s like a centerpiece of the moment or it&#39;s a centerpiece of ambition or of Canadian values, whatever it might be. You also kind of mentioned, you know, maybe not directly that conservatives had an opposite approach where they maybe didn&#39;t go for the profile, so to speak, but they tried to go for perhaps a different angle. Do you feel like that still applies? And maybe I&#39;ll kind of ask my question that I was going to to you in terms of what Trudeau needs to think about going forward as he appoints the next individual in this role. Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it turns out Justin Trudeau is still a liberal. So he&#39;s still going to pick a governor general based on the symbolism of it all rather than a boring old white man administrator. And that&#39;s fine. And, you know, it&#39;s his nature and it&#39;s not even something that I disagree with. Of all of the many things that go on in politics, I find that one one of the least onerous, that we would try to elevate and profile people and show that this country is this big diverse melting pot that we always claim it is.</span>

And away you go. You&#39;re like nine tenths of the way through the business. So appoint someone symbolically because it&#39;s a symbolic position. Like literally that&#39;s all it is. So you don&#39;t need to hit some sort of higher level with it. Choosing David Johnson type because because you&#39;re afraid to go forward and choose someone else who&#39;s going to let you down, is just as likely to let you down. There is no correlation between Julie Payette and her symbolism and her underperformance. That just happens to be the weaknesses of human beings.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to our next segment. Our next segment, Keystone, Sloan, a vaccine milestone, and mining zones. We&#39;ve got so many things to cover. And I&#39;ve just laid them out here. We&#39;re going to start with Keystone XL. We&#39;re going to talk about Jason Kenney and Justin Trudeau. We&#39;re also going to talk about, I guess we have to, America as related to that. But we&#39;ll mainly dig into the Jason Kenney strategy on Keystone XL. Then we&#39;ll talk about Derek Sloan now being kicked out of the Conservative Party caucus by Aaron O&#39;Toole. We&#39;re going to talk about Justin Trudeau and the vaccine milestones that he has promised, especially from, I guess, as an extension to our last episode when we talked about political danger of milestones being missed by a bit and Canada not, you know, taking on the extra Moderna vaccines thinking we already had what we need. Well, now we know that there&#39;s going to be delays and no vaccine deliveries in the next week. So what the political impact of that is. And then the last thing I want to talk about is back to Alberta. We&#39;re going to talk about coal mining here in Alberta. Since we last recorded an episode on that topic, there&#39;s been some changes. So I want to discuss that. So we start at home. We end at home for us Albertans. But we&#39;ll start here with Keystone XL. And Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you on this. Very simply, we&#39;ve covered this in previous episodes. Give us an understanding as to why you think Jason Kenney invested, if it is indeed invested, $1.5 billion in Keystone XL when it had been so clearly telegraphed that the Biden administration was going to cancel the permit for the project. What do you think both the political and even policy calculus was for the Kenney government? Let&#39;s start here. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, for the past several years, Alberta has had a bit of a fever</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fever that hasn&#39;t fully broken here, where we&#39;ve absolutely confused our economy with the notion of market access and pipelines. Now, pipelines are very important to our economy, and I&#39;m not saying otherwise. We could spend an awful lot of time on this podcast explaining the notion of the marginal barrel of oil setting the price for all barrels of oil. I will shorthand it like this. If there aren&#39;t enough pipes going out of this province, everybody pays the price that you are able to get for a barrel that&#39;s going on rail, which is much more expensive. Essentially, it just plummets the price of all of the oil in the province, which is why Albertans seem to be in histrionics. I&#39;m talking to the rest of Canada right now when this matter comes up because there are literally billions of dollars that are being left on the table, billions of dollars that are not there for Alberta communities, for the road schools and hospitals that we rely on in this province. I am not discounting any of this. That said, we seem to have confused the notion of pipelines and economy to such a point that the matter has no nuance anymore. more and the suggestion that you would do anything but give full-throated even stubborn even idiotic support of a pipeline project would be political suicide so all any pipeline company has had to do for the last bit is essentially threatened well maybe i&#39;m not going to proceed with this and maybe it&#39;s going to be the government&#39;s fault or maybe i&#39;m just not going to proceed with this and your government it doesn&#39;t even need to be a threat uh and the governments of alberta say okay well what are we going to do we got to keep this pipeline project on course and um hey look kxl has been a pipeline that&#39;s been somewhat on life support for a while even going back before that fever moment</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">really hit its peak that i&#39;m talking about when energy east was pulled off the table by trans canada then now tc energy and um you know the province of alberta had a commitment for barrels of oil because we take you know bitumen in kind for payment for some royalties we had a commitment to move barrels east we agreed to move it south um in no small part part because KXL needed that in order to – this pipeline project to be viable potentially needed these barrels as well and that was a way to sort of secure that. So this is not a pipeline that&#39;s been sort of looking awesome and part of the reason it hasn&#39;t been looking awesome is because it&#39;s become the world&#39;s greatest political football in the United States. It&#39;s become a symbol of climate change and you had Barack Obama refuse its permits. You had Donald Trump when he became president. I almost said prime minister, came in and wrote a presidential permit allowing KXL to be constructed. And, hey, lo and behold, here we are. Joe Biden&#39;s come in and he has said, no, no permit. This thing&#39;s going out. And that&#39;s the problem with presidential permits. They can be revoked by presidents.</span>

And, you know, Jason Kenney was really big and he would say, yeah, yeah, OK, Trans Mountain, but we need multiple pipelines. And he would specifically call out KXL. And if KXL was going to die on his watch, that was going to be a political problem for him. So I suspect there was a certain amount of denial, but ultimately what happened was a $1.5 billion investment by the government of Alberta went in so that TransCanada</span>

It&#39;s very hard to get elected here, especially at the provincial level, with that being your, especially for leadership at a provincial level, let me put it that way. um without having that stance did jason kenney have another choice rather than to invest 1.5 billion while still demonstrating his uh unbridled uh enthusiastic support for for kxl and pipelines and if so what could that have been well</span>

            <span class="text">automakers, right? So the automakers were in real trouble during the financial crisis. And the government helped out and asked for some shares, because it turns out shares are valuable at the end of the project. So TC Energy shares actually went up the other day when KXL was cancelled. You&#39;ll be happy to know. If we had just for shits and giggles, instead of taking equity in the KXL pipeline, pipeline taken equity in tc energy we could have sold those shares on that day and possibly made some money had something of value that we could have actually exchanged for other value but instead what we did is we took shares in the fucking pipeline because we&#39;re fucking morons and we don&#39;t seem to have anything because it&#39;s a then it&#39;s a straight up bet then it&#39;s red or black there is no nuance you&#39;re either putting the money on red we&#39;re putting the money on black this ball ball spins, you&#39;re winning or you&#39;re losing.

And when it doesn&#39;t come up, you&#39;re fucked. And Jason Kenney didn&#39;t do any hedging. He didn&#39;t do anything to protect our $1.5 billion. But instead he just kind of fucked it off. And in the meantime, what he&#39;s doing is He&#39;s slowing down payments to people on AISH. He&#39;s cutting funding for people with developmental disabilities. Camps. He saved $678,000 on a camp, but</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, you had a very interesting idea. Corey, I want to get your reaction to that. Rather than buying shares in the pipeline, buying shares in the company, what do you kind of think of that strategy if you were in Jason Kenney&#39;s shoes when he made this investment? And I&#39;ll ask you the same question. Would there have been an alternative way in this province to demonstrate your unbridled enthusiastic support for this pipeline without, as I think the three of us agree, burning $1.5 billion?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so what carter the the contrast is so lethal what he talked about the cuts are going on in the province as this investment is being made and this investment is being lost and that is uh just to sort of foreshadow what i suspect is coming in this conversation that is part of why jason kenney is in such like a panic blitz right now to try to change the conversation around this it&#39;s it&#39;s coming at the end of a bad january and this is bad you know this is 1.5 billion That looks like it was lit on fire here in the good province of Alberta. And that&#39;s at a time when, you know, the government is fighting with doctors, with nurses, with teachers, with, you know, recipients of supports for, you know, disabilities, you name it. And it just seems like one of those really crystallizing, these are your priorities. Oh, and you blew it like that. That&#39;s a very challenging moment here.

But before I go there, Corey, very quickly to you. Before, without the investment, any other way you would have advised him if you were in that room saying, saying, Mr. Premier, here&#39;s how you can show your support for this pipeline without burning this money?</span>

He would have taken a hit for a while, but he should have gone back to that classic Jason Kenney playbook. He should have blamed Justin Trudeau for not fighting hard enough for it, allowing Joe Biden to move against it. That would have been a billion and a half dollars cheaper, and it ended up with the exact same place. And that&#39;s the point. Like, this was always predestined. And</span>

He&#39;s talking about suing. And then he&#39;s talking about screaming a lot on MSNBC, on Fox News, blaming the U.S. president. I want to talk to you about the suite of strategies. Give me your take on what Kenny&#39;s strategy is right now. First, let&#39;s go analyst mode. then we&#39;ll go strategist mode in terms of trying to figure out what he should have done or what he should be doing in this moment in time. But analyze the basket of strategies he&#39;s using right now, what I&#39;ve called the three S&#39;s, right? You&#39;re doing your PR push on American media networks. You&#39;re talking about sanctions, encouraging our government to place sanctions on our largest trading partner. And then you&#39;re talking about suing within the confines of the USMCA to try to get some recourse. What do you think of Kenny&#39;s strategy right now? Yeah.</span>

But I think any of us who&#39;ve been in government or anybody who&#39;s looked at this, looks at what he&#39;s doing and just saying, this is a temper tantrum designed to protect him from the wrath of his own voters.

Biden&#39;s the villain here. He&#39;s not respecting Canada. And then he&#39;s also got an element in there where he&#39;s saying like, no, it wasn&#39;t crazy for me to think this thing would get built. Well, let&#39;s take these one by one, right? Right. Trudeau not fighting hard enough, fell apart a bit for him when it was clear that Trudeau brought this up in conversations with Biden. It was on the agenda, you know, in both of their conversations that they&#39;ve had to date, that there&#39;s been conversations behind the scenes as well. Although that will still not be enough. And you see a lot of apologists and, you know, essentially the Sun media chain simping for him saying, yeah, look at Justin Trudeau letting down poor Jason Kenney. So he&#39;s moved on to Biden&#39;s the villain, you know, this idea that this is not a way that you would treat your friends and allies. And that language is getting dialed up as this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that is pretty tough to reconcile with the notion that Biden was the vice president under Obama when this decision was originally made. Biden had said during the campaign, this will not be built, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And it was assumed that that would be his position even before he said this. So that&#39;s a weird one to me. But that ties into the third one, which is that Jason Kenney is trying to spin this yarn. He wasn&#39;t crazy to think this thing would get built even in that environment, right? And the line I saw him using is like, well, look, when Trump came in on a campaign promise to get rid of NAFTA, we didn&#39;t take that as a given. and we fought for our interests, right? Well, okay, sure, right?</span>

And I think one of us said his strategy should be to walk away, to just leave. Like, that&#39;s the best calculus here. With Corey&#39;s insight that this may not cost Kenny regionally here in Alberta, do you still think the right strategy is walking away? What do you think he should be doing at this moment?</span>

            <span class="text">I still think the right strategy is to be walking away. I mean, I look at it the way I look at the investment. The investment was bad, but you lost, right? Right. So you don&#39;t you know, you&#39;re sitting at the gambling table. You don&#39;t throw more money on the table and hope that you&#39;re going to be able to win it all back. You&#39;ve got to you&#39;ve got to move away. You&#39;ve got to stop chasing lost money. And, you know, he should he should just move away from this. And he should start focusing on something that he can win our approval on or can cast Trudeau in a negative light. And you brought it up a little bit earlier when you talked about the pandemic and and vaccination rates. I mean, if</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I hear you. Last question on this particular topic of Keystone to both of you very quickly. Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. Did Trudeau play this pitch perfect? Say that he&#39;s going to fight for it, make it part of the agenda for the call earlier this week with President Biden, but outright just kind of sail above it. Do you feel like that was the right tone strategy for Trudeau&#39;s or something else he should or should not be doing from your perspective?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think Albertans have been fed an absolute load of horseshit about Trudeau and pipelines. Every time Trudeau&#39;s had to make the call to the United States, he&#39;s made the call, even when he was calling Donald Trump and asking him to make sure that this thing was a priority, because you may remember Donald Trump was an infant who never did anything to help anybody else. Anyways, we still got that that that piece signed and it was under Trudeau&#39;s watch that that was that that happened. He also bought TMX and is making sure that actually gets built. And that&#39;s going to cost him electorally that costs him real votes. That&#39;s not something that&#39;s super popular in the mainland of British Columbia. So Trudeau has invested in in Alberta oil and gas far more than Jason Kenney would have us believe, because Jason Kenney is a big baby. And everything every Every time he fights with Trudeau, part of me just wants Trudeau just to say, you know what?</span>

It&#39;s only $4.5 billion to me. I can let it go, right? If you can let go $1.5 billion, I can let go $4.5 billion because I actually have financial resources and I&#39;m not sitting $20 billion in the hole on a $45 billion budget. So whatever.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s go from Keystone to Derek Sloan. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start right at the heart of the story. Earlier this week, Corey sent us a message saying, I don&#39;t know what I make about Aaron O&#39;Toole, but could he be a genius for putting this? I&#39;m paraphrasing here, Corey, and you could correct me if I&#39;m wrong for some of his political moves around Derek Sloan. So let&#39;s start here. Carter, should we be congratulating Aaron O&#39;Toole for this wise political strategy for booting Derek Sloan out of caucus, or is he just doing his job? And we&#39;re applying the political lens here, of course, right, in terms of should we be congratulating him for savvy political strategy leading up to a potential election, spring or fall, who knows? Or is this just something he had to do to just make himself barely palatable in the grand scheme of things? Where do you kind of stand with that? But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Sloan has to be step one. If Sloan is step, you know, the final step in the moving to the center, I don&#39;t think that he moves to the center enough. And I&#39;ve spoken a lot about Lesley Lewis, who continues to stand way outside and to the right. Now, she&#39;s not in caucus, but she&#39;s still a dominant force. And then you&#39;ve got Michelle Rempel-Garner and Pierre Polyev, who continue to be primary mouthpieces, who are defining the government as they defined Harper&#39;s opposition or as they defined Scheer&#39;s party as well. I mean, these people, if they continue to define the conservative party, then it will be the far right conservative party. And O&#39;Toole will have only done part of the work that he needs to do. And he needs to move fast because it sounds like the election, well, I mean, Trudeau&#39;s told us it&#39;s coming this year. So he</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, should we be congratulating O&#39;Toole for what he&#39;s done here? Or is this simply just part of his job? And, you know, do you want a cookie for doing your job, Chris Rock style? You know, sort of vibe. Where do you kind of stand?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So he&#39;s did his job, but it&#39;s the timing of it that made me trigger the question to you two. So when I said, is it possible he&#39;s a genius? Maybe, maybe his strategy all along has been to give in to the right while nobody in Canada is paying attention and just sort of keep the peace within his party, consolidate his power. And then just before the election, when it&#39;s too late for his party to organize against him, and when that rally to the leader sentiment is the strongest, then he tacks hard to the center. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">perhaps this slow move is part of a package of those things. Perhaps all of a sudden you&#39;re going to hear a lot less from Pierre Polyev and Michelle Rempel. And maybe, just maybe, and I&#39;m not saying this is a for sure thing, but maybe this is all part of the strategy. uh certainly when you see things like his his messaging about how uh you know he is much more of a centrist which we were talking about last week right uh you know how he he supports abortion rights and and and uh you know name eight other kind of you know right-wing flash issues that he basically took the opposite side on and then later that week he kicks derek sloan out of his caucus And maybe this is all just being done at the last moment because he knows if he does this and he has to wait six months while his party grumbles about it, he&#39;s a dead man walking. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">during an election, they have no choice but to stay with him. And maybe this is how he remakes the party.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I&#39;m throwing the question out there. Is it possible O&#39;Toole is a genius? Because that&#39;s not such a bad strategy. When I think about that, that&#39;s a pretty clever way to remake the party in your own image if you think it&#39;s too right wing. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">Trudeau continues to move further to the left, you know, which we saw with his most recent speech from the throne, there is that opportunity. OK, I&#39;m moving it from Sloan to the vaccine milestone. It&#39;s a four part segment. So we&#39;ve hit the first two. We&#39;re on vaccines. And guys, we&#39;re on the federal level where we&#39;re talking about the Trudeau government. Canada won&#39;t receive any Pfizer shots this coming week. And our order will be dropped by 50 percent of the next four weeks. This coming on the heels of, as I mentioned when I introduced the segment, Anita Anand saying that Canada declined to purchase additional doses of the Moderna vaccine because we were more than well equipped. And also the additional sort of complicating context here is that while this, yes, is a reduction in supply for Canada, as well as the EU and the UK, not all countries will be equally affected. Canada will be one of the few countries, if only, that will receive zero doses this coming week. So, Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on this. You know, last week we said this could become a problem if Trudeau can&#39;t meet some of the milestone goals. The goals that the government has kind of communicated is that you&#39;ll ensure that we hit our thresholds for March and the September threshold still remains the same. But knowing we&#39;re getting a 50% reduction and we&#39;re not getting anything this coming week, starting tomorrow, how worried should the Trudeau government be? Let&#39;s start here. hear</span>

But if the United States can do over a million vaccinations a day, shouldn&#39;t we be doing over 100,000 vaccinations a day? Shouldn&#39;t we be doing, you know, better than the United States because we should have a more coordinated health care system? Shouldn&#39;t we be driving these things much faster? And we&#39;re not there. And, you know, the federal government pointing the finger at the provincial governments and the provincial government pointing it at the federal government.

            <span class="text">know, the talk of a spring election, I&#39;ve been steadfast. If we are if people aren&#39;t if the vast majority of Canadians aren&#39;t vaccinated by the time they call a spring election, I would expect to see punishment for the Trudeau government, because that&#39;s a very simple issue to wrap your head around. Was it good enough? Now, it could be done during the election and maybe it&#39;ll be good. But if it&#39;s not done, there&#39;s going to be a question to be answered by Trudeau and his government.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you the same question I did Carter. How worried should the Trudeau government be with no vaccines next week, 50% reduction over the next four?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I don&#39;t have much to add. I agree. I think we are now getting into the territory where I would be pretty alarmed if I was them.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That gap that Carter has talked about, 5.6% of the U.S. population has now had a dose of this vaccine. And also so many of them have had it, right, as well, more than in our country. In Canada, that number is 2.1%. That&#39;s a gap that is growing and is going to grow if we don&#39;t get any of this vaccine over the next four weeks or reduce numbers, I guess I should say. So that&#39;s deeply problematic. And when you start hitting some milestone numbers, say the United States is at 50% and say we&#39;re at 20%, I don&#39;t know, like pick them, whatever. But that that is not going to be something that Canadians are going to digest well, because the other thing is, as Canadians, we have this very, very high minded view of our health care system. We believe it is a better health care system than the United States, I would agree with that assertion. But the United States looks like they&#39;re going to have far more vaccines out the door in the short term. And there are other countries in Western Europe that we would consider comps, you know, in Asia, that are equally affluent to us, and they&#39;re doing a better job.</span>

That&#39;s a box that was open, people talked about, there&#39;s criticism, but the Trudeau government quickly closed it, said, you know, we&#39;re fine. And then as our first doses arrived, people said, look, it was overblown. We got our vaccines pretty early. So that box now is fodder. It could be reopened by O&#39;Toole saying the actual, look at this, we need to go back to procurement. We could also talk about distribution, right? We could talk about our distribution strategy. Why are we lagging behind? But then we could also talk about, you know, the Trudeau government&#39;s most recent element of denying additional vaccines, this overconfidence that we were going to be fine. fine.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s going to be availability, I think. And you can do some of that through distribution and some of that through acquisition. And you can also hit him on it for production. You know, one of the very first things that Biden did, and I&#39;m not gonna remember the exact act that he invoked. But essentially, he was able to invoke the military, I think it&#39;s Military Production Act, something like that. Corey will look it up and confirm whether I&#39;m correct or wrong, to produce more vaccine to enable the entire federal government to focus on a singular issue. Every resource of the American federal government is focused now on COVID vaccination and COVID relief. Justin Trudeau hasn&#39;t done that. He hasn&#39;t done that. And it could be evidenced in anything from the vaccine production, availability, distribution, or it could also be, you know, you could also look at it through federal responsibility for seniors. Nothing been done. Long-term care, massive holes. I mean, there&#39;s all kinds of different places that you can point to and say, Justin Trudeau failed Canadians. And the best part for O&#39;Toole is he never has to explain what he would have done differently. He can just simply point to these failures. Biden&#39;s invoke, you know, invoking of that particular act shows what a leader who cares would have done. And I just think that Trudeau has been very I think he&#39;s been good. I think Trudeau has been good on this, but he&#39;s never for the last few months. It doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s been as engaged as he was in the first few months.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, one thing O&#39;Toole has done, at least we know because they put out a comms piece about it, which I think you sent to Stephen and I, if I&#39;m not mistaken, was a comms piece on his Twitter account where he&#39;s sitting at his work from home desk and picks up his cell phone saying, you know, recently I just talked to the CEO of Pfizer. And, you know, I laid down the law, you know, as to why it matters, you know. But for now, let&#39;s just go back to working. But like, you know, had, you know, the classic political, I&#39;ve got a phone, hence I made a phone call move.</span>

So let&#39;s do some proactive advice to the Trudeau government, rather than reacting to things like we and blackface, brownface. Let&#39;s give them some proactive advice. What would you suggest if there is, we know now, right, the reduction of four weeks, let&#39;s say there&#39;s gonna be further reductions, let&#39;s say that this is going to to be a trajectory C change. What are some of the things they need to be doing right now? Because Corey made a really good point that they may have been coming in a little too hot and increasing expectations for their future selves, and may have to pay the political price for it.

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you&#39;re going to have to give them, them being the media and the public, as much information as you have on these things. Keep the doors open. Don&#39;t create a sense of panic or that there&#39;s worse information out there or shoot a drop. You also want to do your best to manage expectations going forward. And you&#39;ve got to hone in on a message. It would be very helpful, and I&#39;m not sure if this is the case, the government should probably find a way to key message this more aggressively. But the reason why we&#39;re getting a dose reduction is they&#39;re shutting down a production line. And the reason why they&#39;re shutting down a production line is to increase the overall ability to produce. So if the government has the ability to say, yes, we are seeing fewer in the short term, but we&#39;re seeing that ramp up benefit us more, you know, in a month, two months time, whatever the case may be, that becomes a bit more of a compelling storyline there. But, you know, Pfizer has been really clear, our government&#39;s been really clear Pfizer will make up the doses. So again, when we talk about a spring election, if we&#39;re talking about May, June, this may all be resolved and in the rearview mirror. And in fact, having a big bulge of doses in three months and making it look like there&#39;s rapid progress might actually even be politically advantageous right before an election. But to your point about what should the liberals be doing, they&#39;ve got to get their story straight. They&#39;ve got to create confidence in Canadians that this is just a blip, and they&#39;ve got to talk about why this is not a bad thing for Canada, that we got cut more than others. You&#39;re going to have to find the story in there that it&#39;s actually fine that we were cut the most.</span>

            <span class="text">I want to move on from vaccine milestones to mining zones, our last elements in this segment, and we&#39;re moving back here to Alberta. So to add a little bit of context, the UCP governing party here in Alberta, Jason Kenney and the UCP, had a plan that would allow more coal mining on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains. This was done as a result of a policy that had been standing since 1976 by the Lougheed government, premier back in Alberta, Peter Lougheed. And they canceled this policy in May that had largely restricted coal development in western Alberta. After some backlash, we discussed this a bit, I believe, near the end of our last segment. But after some backlash, the UCP canceled some of these leases. But the government still is now trying to argue that coal mining is safe and can create jobs, etc. etc. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you on this one, because you had mentioned in our last episode that coal kind of made oil and gas kind of look like the most environmentally friendly thing to come out of our province. There&#39;s clearly some risk around coal itself. But what do you kind of make of where the government landed between when we recorded last time and their move to cancel some of those developments, but certainly not all, and now has moved into a calm strategy to defend, which I want to get to as well. But first, your kind of top line is political assessment on where this is landing and its political damage for this government. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, we drew parallels when we talked about this last to the Defend Alberta Parks campaign here in Alberta, where there was a lot of uproar in our province about the government potentially delisting and then selling parkland. A lot of parks sell some of them to private interests, sell some of them to even privater interests, frankly. Exactly.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">And that the government largely had to back down from that. It appears they&#39;ve effectively fully backed down. We&#39;ll see whether there&#39;s, you know, there&#39;s any kind of movement on that in the spring. Now, this coal issue seems to be following a similar trajectory in that the first back down is saying, is there a way we can back down? Well, that will just turn off the volume and then we can move on with our lives. And so the government tried that this week when they essentially canceled the leases on a few. Like if you look at a map, it&#39;s a small percent of them, right, in the area.</span>

And if you can make a loud enough noise, you can stop things. And that teaches a lesson to civil society that the government doesn&#39;t love them to know, frankly, that if you fight for things, if you write letters, if you get together, you put up signs, if we were in non-COVID times, march and rally, I mean, you can change things. government majorities be damned and we&#39;ve seen this in alberta where you know large privatization efforts in the 90s have been pushed off the</span>

The opposition NDP feel like there is, you know, blood in the water, that they can go even further on this issue, use it as a wedge.

The signs are going up throughout neighborhoods where these people need to win re-election. People love our mountains. And these are mountains that are close to us that we can see that are going to be devastated by mining. mining on top of that this is not an economic revitalization plan let us let us move past that the number of people employed by coal in Alberta is inconsequential frankly compared to the overall employment numbers and overall challenges that we&#39;re facing we&#39;d be far better to take the 1.5 billion dollars that Jason Kenney bet on KXL and build the green line here in Calgary because we&#39;d to actually get some fucking jobs and in terms of royalties which is the other thing that the province relies on when we access our oil or our gas or our coal we get royalties and that&#39;s the price that albertans get back for the devastation that we reap upon our own lands coal generates less than 15 million dollars a year in royalties it is inconsequential to our overall budget it um and we are we are going to open up our lands and and rick have a devastation upon them for 15 million dollars a year i&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve got a couple of billionaires in calgary that could choose just to fund the government for 15 billion a year at or 15 million a year 15 million not billion 15 million a year uh ad infinitum i mean it&#39;s just utterly ridiculous</span>

CPE, sorry, in the government. So let&#39;s start with what do you make of it? Why do you like it or don&#39;t like it? And then let&#39;s talk about its authorship and sponsorship from the question that we got from one of our listeners as well. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So let me talk about it as a communications product and not necessarily about – well, maybe I&#39;ll back into the strategy and then I&#39;ll back into why in your next round of questions here, why it would be done by a caucus and not by the government proper.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">What can I say? So this is not a particularly compelling communications product in my point of view. And the main reason is, as you mentioned, is this myth fact setup. And I have a lot of critiques of the individual myths facts. The very first one is myth. The world is moving away from coal. Fact, the world uses coal. Well, those two are not even mutually exclusive. And I think that the author would know that, right? And I think that even a casual reader would kind of catch that. And that&#39;s true of a lot of the myths, facts. Like the fact does not rebut the quote-unquote myth and the quote-unquote myth is often very true. The world is moving away from coal. That&#39;s undeniable, for example. example uh so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t like the uh you know kind of the the way that it is so not necessarily you know aligned like you have not actually done a good myth fact job here the second thing i will say is that it tends to use a bunch of language that is not even remotely approachable to the average albertan like it&#39;s talking about alberta&#39;s government has paused future coal lease sales on former category two lands what the fuck does that mean what is a category two land you know what&#39;s what&#39;s a category three land? What&#39;s a category one land? None of this is defined anywhere in this document. And the fact that you qualify your lands by saying you can&#39;t sell coal leases on category two lands actually just makes it sound like you&#39;re hiding something. It makes it sound like you, okay, but you are on other categories of land. What does that mean? It does not actually reduce my concern on that particular matter. You know, I could go on and on. I could literally go through each of these and I almost want to because some of them make me so very mad. Carter pointed it out one i do want to mention which is myth the 1976 coal policy protects water from selenium fact selenium is not mentioned in the 1976 coal policy well great that&#39;s a great critique of that coal policy that&#39;s not a great defense of what you&#39;re doing right</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but but this is a the reason i mentioned this one is it&#39;s a great example of the hazard of the kitchen sink approach to communications which is what ultimately every single myth fact website is and it&#39;s why they are generally not a very good idea and i hope our listeners who are involved in communications can take this to heart a lot of academic research has happened surrounding communication psychology and the battle of facts and successes and failures of both sides and debunking the other side in battles of facts in particular think about the climate change debate and so a pair of australian researchers uh lewandowski and cook i think carter we used to quote them all the time when we worked at hill and norton um anyhow they they looked at the back and forth on here and you know of climate change and how somebody would bring up a defense and someone would bring up an attack and so on and so forth and what they found is very simple and it makes sense when you think about it if</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">if you bring up a defense for a concern people do not have you are introducing that concern to people if you had no idea selenium was a concern with open pit coal mining if you just didn&#39;t like what it looked like and then you&#39;re like what what selenium and water what is this a thing that could happen with coal mine you&#39;ve just created a communications challenge you have just moved people away from your concern uh this kind of untargeted kitchen sink approach is often very destructive and on controversial issues it can be downright lethal so as a communications product i give it an f it is not a well-constructed communications piece uh it fails an awful lot of these fundamentals fundamentals and you know it&#39;s got all of these social share components i would love to see how many people are sharing them not just to take a piss out of it yeah</span>

I need to see some communications about it. But it&#39;s bad communications because it&#39;s not actually going to address the audience&#39;s concerns in a way that doesn&#39;t concern the audience.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Let&#39;s talk about authorship. And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll get your take first. Authored by the UCP government caucus, not by the party, right, for one, not by the government of Alberta. What do you suspect the authorship has to do with this content, as asked by our listener, Carlin? And why do you think this resides with the caucus and not some of the other options that are available to the UCP? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think the caucus because they have a budget to do this type of communications. And it is, to Corey&#39;s point, MLAs who are pissed off, who want to have a communication piece. So they go to their caucus comms and they say, you guys got to put something out. And frankly, if you went to the government of Alberta and said, let&#39;s put out something pro-coal. I just, you know, been looking at all the pro-coal websites in the government of Alberta. You know, they actually just put forward facts. They don&#39;t have, you know, they&#39;re not in the business of selling government policy like this. Yes, they&#39;re in the business of selling government policy, but they&#39;re not in the business of basically</span>

It&#39;s bullshit. bullshit and uh so my view is yeah i mean some could point to government communications being a little bit you know maybe offside but generally speaking government communications even when cory was running it i was pretty good um so thank</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, why caucus? There&#39;s a few reasons you might go through that. And just so our listeners who might not be aware, when you consider communications from the quote-unquote government, often there are three different sources, more than that really, but I&#39;ll talk about three big ones. One is literally the government, right? The Alberta Public Service run communications apparatus of the government. That&#39;s what I ran for the province of Alberta for many years. Another is the government caucus, which is what created this, which is the MLAs of the government getting together and pooling their resources to create communications, just as there&#39;s an NDP caucus right now as well. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And in past years when there&#39;s been other political parties represented in the legislature, they get together. They get a little extra money to do things as a group. right and uh and then there is the uh you know the ministers and and like the premier&#39;s office which is a more political communication than is possible with you know government resources but you&#39;re you&#39;re still you&#39;re talking about the ministers and the and the premier or the prime minister as the case may be if you&#39;re talking about the federal scene of</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">of course there&#39;s the party too but i think people know the party is not government</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">government communications so uh why caucus why would you pick caucus over the government well let&#39;s start with the principle of charity It&#39;s always good to say maybe there&#39;s reasons that are not particularly nefarious. One is that caucus moves a lot faster than government. Government has a lot of checks in it, and those checks serve a very valuable purpose. But it means you don&#39;t get to come up with an idea on Monday at 9 a.m. and put something up by Monday at 5 p.m. That just doesn&#39;t happen that way. You&#39;ve got to have the idea. You&#39;ve got to go to the department. You&#39;ve got to get all of the experts in the department to weigh in. You&#39;ve got to run it by legal. You have a lot of gates that you&#39;ve got to get through. And those there for many reasons, to protect the people of Alberta, to protect the crown from lawsuits, just you name it. There&#39;s no end of reasons, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But then we can go on there and we can say there&#39;s a few other less reasonable reasons, right? One of them is that the lines between government and party are clear, but caucus and party are murky. It&#39;s easier to share information and to – even if you&#39;re sending something that&#39;s more of a political view to your – from your caucus, that has a way of bleeding back to the party even if it&#39;s just in like how they act and the nature of being able to cut data different ways and whatnot, even if we&#39;re not talking like a pure data transfer, which</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">would likely violate a lot of rules. rules. You can&#39;t FOIP a caucus. A caucus is not a public body under the FOIP Act. So you don&#39;t actually get any of the statistical data, right? That&#39;s protected by the caucus. You also can&#39;t see how it was made, you know, who was consulted on it, any of those things that would be available if you FOIPed the government. And government will not let you do a lot of these things without a lot of pushback. Like this here, you would have people threatening to quit an environment if you put some some of these things out the way it&#39;s torquing fact so if you want to get it out at all if it&#39;s something more of this nature you&#39;re going to have to move it through the caucus or the party</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and um you know then finally i&#39;ll just say caucus has got to do something i guess you know when you are in government you have a number of ministers and they get to be the political communicators and they get to do these things but you&#39;ve got dozens of other mlas who are part of a government government caucus, they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they got to do something. Sometimes it&#39;s also just an outlet for their energy. So when they&#39;re coming to the premier&#39;s office and saying, I&#39;m getting so many goddamn questions about coal, Jason, what the hell are we going to do about this? He says, well, you know what? That&#39;s a great thing for the caucus communications team to take up and deal with this. They&#39;ll solve your problem for you, which is like premier for fuck off, I&#39;m dealing with something else. But these are all reasons why you might go through caucus instead of through the government nicely</span>

When we decided to do the oil sands, we chose to do that because there was a significant benefit available to us there is virtually no benefit available to us through these coal mines they&#39;re useless i mean the people who are employed from them um will be i guess somewhat benefit but the primary mine the big mine that&#39;s coming in this is owned by an australian firm we&#39;re making australians richer i</span>

            <span class="text">Look, I&#39;ll give it a three because I think they&#39;re at least trying to manage the issue as we saw earlier this week with at least an attempted backing down, which tells me it&#39;s being actively managed in some way, shape or form. But it&#39;s bad. And I share a lot of Stephen&#39;s fury. It&#39;s something that I think is really quite abhorrent. And for me, it&#39;s less about the actual physical space. Great example of how different people are going to be driven by different things here. It&#39;s less about the physical spaces, although that&#39;s very important to many people in my life, not me personally. as you know, Zane, not a big outdoorsman, but it&#39;s coal. It&#39;s fucking coal, and it&#39;s 2021, and we&#39;ve got a real problem with the fact that we&#39;re choking this planet to death. And even if you want to set aside the CO2, emissions from coal are very damaging. They reduce life expectancy. They make us a worse place to live. Like if you burn it here, it&#39;s bad. If we&#39;re selling it elsewhere, that&#39;s bad. I just can&#39;t broker any kind of support for this. and and so you know i wouldn&#39;t want anyone to think me giving them a three was in any way giving them a pass and you know when whenever we go through a segment like that i have a moment like five seconds after it&#39;s over where i go i don&#39;t want to help them sell this so people opposed to this nonsense civic groups environmental groups ndp remember how i talked about that keyword approach go buy all those keywords right now would you please they will not be able to move fast enough would everybody just get mad about this write their mlas make some noise because because this is nonsense.</span>

Over under on five, the political danger to Justin Trudeau with Joe Biden&#39;s buy America promise. So this was a vague, sort of vague, but not so vague nationalist, economic nationalist sort of policy by Biden to support local but support America that he wants to kind of continue on in the heritage of the Trump administration.

The political wisdom on a scale of 1 to 10 to invoke the Emergencies Act to limit pandemic travel. We&#39;ve talked about the vaccine supply being reduced, so the government does seem to be trying to create more sort of policies in place that reduce the flow of people.
