It was in many ways the story of this election, that there was no story for this election and that the prime minister could never figure out how to articulate a reason that we were all going through 36 days of pure fucking torture as we&#39;ve been doing. And so, you know, that&#39;s my pick. I&#39;m curious to see if there&#39;s a conflict here with Carter. carter stephen</span>

But I really, I don&#39;t know.

It was very cold in Ottawa during the middle of winter. This is the only hotel room that they have left.

            <span class="text">Yeah, but what they&#39;re doing, though, is they&#39;re taking three days of data, and they&#39;re adding those three days of data. None of those days of data would on their own be statistically significant, right? They would not have enough sample size to offer a single day. So what you&#39;re really doing is you&#39;re looking at three days of cumulative data. And therefore, the most important thing in that set of data isn&#39;t the end point of the data, but in fact, the trend line. So the trend line itself becomes the important part. And so the media should be pointing themselves to, well, this is an interesting trend. We are seeing a trend downwards for the liberals or upwards for the conservatives. We&#39;ve seen fascinating trends through this. We&#39;ve seen a trend with the PPC. We&#39;ve seen a trend with the CPC. We&#39;ve seen a trend with the liberals. liberals, all</span>

And when I&#39;m looking at polling, I&#39;m not necessarily just looking at the end number, because the election, I think you guys will be shocked to find out was not held today. Sure, advanced polling was done. And there was mail in ballots and all of those things. But the election is held tomorrow. Tomorrow is the day that actually matters. The trend to tomorrow is what matters. And the trend lines are fascinating.</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s just data. And I mean that not in the sense that look at the numbers and that&#39;s what they are, but it&#39;s just one of your inputs and you&#39;ve got to look at all of these polls and you&#39;ve got to follow the trend lines and you&#39;ve got to be mindful of the methodology that&#39;s being used and all of those things we talked about along the way. And if you were to follow exclusively one pollster or another, you would get such shockingly different versions of what this election is. ECOS right now has the Liberals up by six, right? That nobody else has the liberals up that much, but maybe ECOS is right. But if you&#39;ve been only following ECOS, it&#39;s been a wild ride. Because at one point, Frank Graves was saying, it&#39;s going to be conservative, just question is how big and now it&#39;s liberal majority is on the table. Oh, boy, talk about a bit of a rush. Abacus has been, you know, shows a conservative lead, Ipso shows a conservative lead. And, and that&#39;s a different story. Altogether, that&#39;s a seven point difference in terms of who&#39;s on top relative to the ECOS one. And when you look at them at aggregate, it largely looks like a big mess, largely looks like it&#39;s, it&#39;s an even race. And I think that&#39;s the thing that people should take going into the election, not faith in one poll over the other, but appreciating</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think that there&#39;s been a little bit of convergence down to a tie with most of the pollsters. And, you know, one point here, one point there. Let&#39;s try and keep in mind that most of these polls are plus or minus three points. You know, there&#39;s a margin of error on these things for a reason. The margin of error is the get out of jail free card. And we&#39;ll see how close people actually were.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it&#39;s the get out of jail free card. But that&#39;s one of my biggest pet peeves when people say, oh, there&#39;s a three point margin of error, ergo, oh, we could have a result that&#39;s just as likely on the edges. It doesn&#39;t work that way. When we talk about margin of error, we talk about it being within X number of points 19 times out of 20. It&#39;s following a standard curve. You are much more likely that the poll is accurate or within a point of being accurate than being three points off, even if you&#39;re purporting a three-point margin of error. Think more about violin graphs or waves, right? And the thing that they&#39;ve represented is most likely to be correct, and it bleeds off from there towards the edges. So, like, that&#39;s a cop out that pollsters will use once everything is sort of settled. But it&#39;s, that&#39;s not how you should be thinking about margin of error, as just as equally likely to be here or three points from here.</span>

            <span class="text">in a sense i mean it&#39;s defined it in that it&#39;s driving his tactics so you have to say it&#39;s defined it now has it defined it to his detriment unclear there is the reality that in a lot of the polls that i&#39;m looking at in this mad cavalcade of polls we have the conservatives are either tightening it back up or they&#39;re giving themselves a bit of a small lead you know research company they went uh last week the liberals were up four now it&#39;s even we&#39;ve got ipsos with the the Conservatives up one. We&#39;ve got Abacus with the Conservatives up one. We&#39;ve got a bunch of people with ties. So it seems to be working right now. And there is some logic to if you don&#39;t give it oxygen, the fire can&#39;t burn. Now, I did agree with Stephen. I&#39;m not going to pretend that I was sitting there thinking that this was a great strategy to not talk to the media, because then I thought we&#39;d lead to a meta story where it was, why is he avoiding the media? But that story is coming really late. It&#39;s basically too late to affect the election. So maybe it works just fine. Maybe the calculation was made and the calculation was 100% correct, that media conversations just were not going to help them, at least not ones fueled by new media interviews. And given that it&#39;s the day before the election, they&#39;re going to write about them anyways, even if they can&#39;t talk about it.</span>

So this is like saying we&#39;re going to take, you know, we&#39;ve been running television ads all the way through, but we&#39;re going to take our television ads the last three days off. I mean, you don&#39;t get to control 100 percent what the media say about you, but you can control your message. You can control how you&#39;re perceived and you can be perceived to have strength or you can be perceived to have weakness. And O&#39;Toole has chosen to go with weakness.</span>

Remember, we referred to this earlier, the shallow decision makers, those shallow decision makers are making their decisions right now. And what they&#39;re getting back to them is Aaron O&#39;Toole won&#39;t even talk to the media. and most people don&#39;t watch the media news they don&#39;t watch you know they they absorb it almost through osmosis it&#39;s kind of like the way i absorbed the fact that the emmys were tonight almost by osmosis it&#39;s like oh yeah there&#39;s an emmy show of course there is i don&#39;t pay attention because i don&#39;t care i give zero fucks that&#39;s most people when it comes to voting so the fact that during the last 24 48 72 hours i say that most low information voters are making their Their mind&#39;s up 72 hours to 72 seconds before they cast their ballot.

And look, there are people who have kind of figured out how to run these debates better. We have seen more functioning debates in Canada&#39;s past. In fact, I would argue that 2015 was probably in some ways, despite not having a consortium debate, a high watermark for debate formats in recent years because we allow different outlets to kind of hold on to them and drive a vision on them. the</span>

Because one of the things we have not seen, I was going to say seen, but maybe I&#39;ll say not seen since, is her in a position of pit bull or attack dog again, or really in any position of, you know, delivering a key message on behalf of the campaign. Like if Trudeau&#39;s entire argument has been, this is the person that runs my government, this is my COO, you know, the Deputy Prime Minister, the first female finance minister, we haven&#39;t really seen her as COO material in the 36 days of this campaign. Anything to And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s not a knock against her. I&#39;m just trying to make an observation. But Carter, any thoughts on, you know, has this perhaps, did this moment perhaps change the trajectory of Freeland&#39;s involvement in the campaign going forward, do you think? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">That was a defining moment. It launched them up into the lead for quite some time. Granted, it was undone in the days after, but I think that when the polling began at the start of this campaign, the idea that the Conservatives could win was a figment of people&#39;s imagination. The release of their platform and their launch compared to the Liberal launch defined them as ready to govern and ready to take over from Justin Trudeau. And that was a big moment in this campaign.</span>

And there were a lot of signs of that, right? And there were a lot of skeptics that this would work. At this point, regardless of what happens tomorrow, you have to say that worked, right? This was supposed to be an election where the liberals were going to come in, and they were supposed to get a majority government as their reward for all of this against a totally feckless Aaron O&#39;Toole. But they came out very hard. That platform on day one was a big part of that strategy to say, this is who we are. You can talk about the hidden conservative agenda. This is our very unhidden agenda.

Which one of the two emerges as the narrative for O&#39;Toole heading into tomorrow? And I also want to say, isn&#39;t Corey a huge dick for just trying to tease out what a strategy is and what it isn&#39;t? We get it, Corey. You know more than us. Yeah. Carter, jump in. Jump in on the O&#39;Toole question, because I think that&#39;s interesting, because it will be a defining moment of how he&#39;s Is he handled with conservative kid gloves? Because we&#39;re also simultaneously hearing of some form of mutiny in the conservative caucus around O&#39;Toole picking the PC lane versus the more Harper-style conservative lane.

It could be voter turnout. It could be the vote percentage for the PPC, the NDP. It could be certain regions and how they go early on. Atlantic Canada will come in early. Are you going to see if there&#39;s a strong liberal hold there? What is the one or two things that will be kind of the Corey Hogan I will be on tomorrow night as you consume and absorb election night 2021?</span>

            <span class="text">One of them will be turnout. I think higher turnout will help the liberals. Lower turnout will be maybe an indication that people didn&#39;t see a lot of need for this election. And maybe there&#39;s not a motivated government base. I guarantee you the conservatives are going to show up. I guarantee you they&#39;re somewhat motivated. The other two you also mentioned, Atlantic Canada is a battleground this election and should give us a good indication as to whether the Conservatives are going to outperform expectations. Now, you can&#39;t call it at that point because the Conservatives outperformed expectations in the provincial election that happened during it too. And so maybe there&#39;s just something weird going on in Atlantic Canada with polling. But then the third one really is the PPC vote. And</span>

And we&#39;re going to have to talk about what this means going forward. But that is the big difference in the polls right now. We mentioned that ECOS is showing the liberals with a lead of six points. That&#39;s not because they see the liberals in a different place. Everyone sees them at 32, 33, 31, around there. It&#39;s because they see the PPC in a different place. They&#39;re seeing 10 points in the PPC, and that&#39;s at the detriment of the conservatives. If that&#39;s</span>
