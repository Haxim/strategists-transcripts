            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, hold on. Oh my God, we&#39;re already going down rabbit holes. It is possible that it&#39;s done and they just treat it like an election outside of the election period, which means that they have fewer restrictions and can even, frankly, do things like run government advertising as they effectively run a campaign, almost try to do a variant of what Stephen Harper did in 2015, which</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, that&#39;s interesting because there are no spending limits for the parties or the individual candidates during the pre-RIT period up until they drop the RIT. And then they have a four-week period. And if you&#39;re in a riding, I think it&#39;s $53,000 and it&#39;s a few million dollars. I can&#39;t remember how many millions it is if you&#39;re the party during the four weeks. But you&#39;d be shocked to find out. I don&#39;t know that because I&#39;m not running a campaign for one of the parties. So there you go. Didn&#39;t need to know it. Don&#39;t know it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But yeah, that&#39;d be interesting because they&#39;ve all got lots of money. I mean, they raised how much money in the last quarter? Like, they&#39;ve got all the money in the world. They can run this election four times over and still have enough cash to do it. So why</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">why not burn some cash in the non-capped period?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And Daniel Smith is the type of leader that learns from the negative experiences of others. So when Stephen Harper does something stupid, I can see her doing that same thing.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it wouldn&#39;t be the same thing. Because what he did there was he extended the writ period to like 60 plus days, a long time ago now. This would be essentially just treating the pre-writ period as the de facto election.</span>

The majority of those seats will have to come from Calgary, a city that the NDP won three in last time. So we&#39;re not talking about like marginal gains in Calgary.

            <span class="text">Well, and I&#39;d also like to just change one other thing, just one more setup piece, Corey, before we even go to that. and that is that 2015 isn&#39;t the model that we can look at so you can&#39;t look at the 2015 results and say oh here&#39;s how the ndp get to their their successful victory because they were facing off against a wild rose party and a pc party alberta liberal party in alberta and the alberta party each one of those parties had some skin in the game um now if you were to look even at the 2015 results with a merged wild rose and pc recognizing that of course not all of those votes are going to go there but the results would have been staggering uh staggeringly different basically it looks almost exactly what the same as</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">2019 so so even if they did the same number because keep in mind in 2019 the ndp actually got more votes so i think in order to set this thing up properly, we need to reset the table that the winning margin and people get, you know, we talk about splitting. It&#39;s not about splitting the vote. It&#39;s about what number you have to achieve in order to win the riding. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So the number in Calgary could be 35, 40% to win in 2015. And now in 2023, the number needs to be 50%. And that foundationally changes the NDP&#39;s chances in 2023 over 2015. So I wanted to preset that before I start going into the regional breakdown of how this all needs to break in.</span>

They won 54 seats, 44 to govern, so you&#39;ve got a 10-seat padding there. But you&#39;re totally right.

What I&#39;ve looked at is, you know, what is actually relatively attainable? And 34 seats is relatively attainable. When you look at the percentage change in the polls and how far the NDP has come up, Calgary Elbow, Calgary Northeast, Calgary East, Banff, Kananaskis, Klein, Sherwood Park, Southwest, Edmonton Southwest, Varsity, Curry, and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and Falcon Ridge all look viable. So the 34 seats are pretty much locked. Those 34, you know, if you&#39;re sitting in Calgary Elbow, that&#39;s the hardest of those 34 to win. and and likely uh you are going to win but as you know cory i mean 34 gets you nothing um 34 is just a more annoying uh opposition level um</span>

And those are actually going to be pretty similar to a lot of the ridings that you&#39;re going to need to pick up in Calgary. So if you&#39;re the NDP, you&#39;ve</span>

Oh, but I really want to get my hands on, you know, Stony Plain. That leads to strategy chaos. You want to find like kind of these cohesive things that allow you to say the same thing consistently rather than being distracted.

Sure, Carrie Cundall in Calgary Elbow is going to pick up a few significant votes because she&#39;s the Alberta Party candidate in Calgary Elbow and they&#39;ve had an MLA there before. But those are going to be wasted votes. The same I used to vote for the Green Party because I couldn&#39;t vote for Deepak Oberoi or whoever the liberal candidate was. You know, you vote for the Greens because they knew they weren&#39;t going to win and you felt like you were still participating. I</span>

I just don&#39;t think the Alberta party is going to be viable enough provincially for her to be in the game.

One is all of the political parties in Ottawa are deeply unpopular with Albertans except for the conservatives, right? And so the liberals and in the ndp tend to get people&#39;s ire the the general idea of a federal government tends to offend a certain subset of albertans there is the risk of course she could be pulled to the crazy fringes</span>

            <span class="text">um so for the ndp that means making sure that they are maximizing every single vote that they can get in calgary that that is the end all and be all for with them. Um, keeping home some voters is going to be important as well. Um, so that, that&#39;s my first piece. The second is to slow down and really build out your story. Um, both Danielle and, uh, Rachel need to figure that out. What is their story? What is the thing that they are telling people? Um, that is the core or the crux of their, of their issues to this point. Um, and then And number three is what is their characters? How are they fitting the population into their stories? Right now, Danielle has a priority set for her populations. She goes through the extreme right first. And I would argue that Rachel has the same problem, but instead of it being the far right, it&#39;s Edmonton. She speaks very well to Edmonton. She does not speak as well to Calgary. If she can&#39;t change that, she doesn&#39;t win.</span>
