        <p>Zain Velji is at home with a newborn so the rest of the gang takes the opportunity to preview the 2023 Alberta General Election: the ridings and people each party will focus, the ballot questions they'll be putting forward and what we can expect between now and when Albertans cast their ballots.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter preview the 2023 Alberta General Election and answer listener questions on the same. Through what ridings does the NDP's path to victory run? What ballot questions do we expect each party to present? What would the optimal ones be? And were you even aware that a question could be asked in fewer than 300 words? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here because his wife had a baby.</em></p></blockquote>

One is all of the political parties in Ottawa are deeply unpopular with Albertans except for the conservatives, right? And so the liberals and in the ndp tend to get people&#39;s ire the the general idea of a federal government tends to offend a certain subset of albertans there is the risk of course she could be pulled to the crazy fringes</div>

Right now, Danielle has a priority set for her populations. She goes through the extreme right first. And I would argue that Rachel has the same problem, but instead of it being the far right, it&#39;s Edmonton. She speaks very well to Edmonton. She does not speak as well to Calgary.
