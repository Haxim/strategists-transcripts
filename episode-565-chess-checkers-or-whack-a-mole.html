          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the lessons we learned in New Hampshire. Is the establishment dead? Are there take-aways that apply to politics in Canada? And will a magical cricket ever turn Marco Rubio into a real boy? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

What I think is noteworthy about that is not that he won, everybody expected him to win, but the margin. And there was some hope in the Clinton campaign that they would tighten it up and they would do better than the polls expected, but quite the opposite happened. And this makes after the Iowa caucus, two contests in a row where Bernie Sanders outperformed the average of polls so in iowa sanders was trailing by four in the average of polls he ended up tying in new hampshire he was expected to win by 13 or 14 he ended up winning by like 21 i mean this was a this wasn&#39;t just a victory this was a beat down yeah</div>

Should we get a Volvo? That&#39;s the type of – it is kind of keeping up with the Joneses and we are interested in what our peers are interested in. So when our social network starts to move towards a Nenshi or a Redford or a Rubio or a Kasich, that is part of what defines momentum. Why did Bernie Sanders outperform Poles? Because there was a momentum behind him. That momentum is the surge in the social networks. And if you can capture that, you win.</div>

What&#39;s the low-hanging fruit? How do you figure out who&#39;s first tier, second tier? How do you start speaking to those networks if that&#39;s the new reality we live in politically?</div>

But let&#39;s keep doing it. Let&#39;s be clear about a couple of things here. One is exactly what Stephen was talking about with this notion of there was a sense in the Clinton campaign that women would vote for Hillary Clinton. And I do think that is because there is a bit of their mindset stuck in 1992. As we get further away from, you know, we have not gotten to a point of equality between the sexes yet. But some of the bigger battles are now in the rearview mirror. mirror and as that is the case it becomes a little harder to make that argument and suggest that to all women that just having a woman in the white house is what will be most beneficial to you it&#39;s also a bit of a facile argument uh you know bernie sanders is very strong on uh you know income equality bernie sanders is very strong on women&#39;s rights as well i don&#39;t know that it necessarily follows that only a woman can support women&#39;s rights i think if that were the case we&#39;d be in a lot of trouble as a society because we get this 50 50 polarization on every damn issue yeah</div>

So if you&#39;re going to say the sky is falling, the sky is falling. Oh, the sky didn&#39;t fall. You might run into trouble if you&#39;re the conservatives.

Alberta is hurting, and that&#39;s because we&#39;re dependent on resources, and resources are in the toilet. We totally get it. We elected a new government last year. We&#39;ve been talking about it forever. The government&#39;s brought out a number of diversification programs. But let&#39;s pump the brakes a bit, BC. You&#39;re sitting there giving us some lecture about how we lost our way. And by the way, they said Alberta is a similar-sized province, so this is a comparison that is fair. And that&#39;s not actually the way they phrased it, but they said Alberta is a similar-sized province. Well, guess what?</div>

This has been a pretty unprecedented run for any province, what Alberta&#39;s gone through here. We are, like, you know, we&#39;re one more boom away from actually being a larger province than BC.
