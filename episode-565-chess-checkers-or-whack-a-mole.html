            <span class="text">yes yes we do yeah bernie sanders wins last night that&#39;s the big thing he wins by a fair margin donald trump also wins last night so off the top let&#39;s just get your thoughts before we get deeper into what i think are the two two overlying sentiments on this. Corey, what do we make of what happened last night in New Hampshire? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the Democrat side first. And Bernie Sanders obviously won by a lot over 20 points. What I think is noteworthy about that is not that he won, everybody expected him to win, but the margin. And there was some hope in the Clinton campaign that they would tighten it up and they would do better than the polls expected, but quite the opposite happened. And this makes after the Iowa caucus, two contests in a row where Bernie Sanders outperformed the average of polls so in iowa sanders was trailing by four in the average of polls he ended up tying in new hampshire he was expected to win by 13 or 14 he ended up winning by like 21 i mean this was a this wasn&#39;t just a victory this was a beat down yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there hasn&#39;t been any polling in nevada since december and it&#39;s a caucus state now Now, Iowa as a caucus state gets a lot of activity and participation because it&#39;s first in the nation and every Iowan knows this and there&#39;s a higher subscription to that level of civic engagement. But the fact is most caucus states see fewer people show up. And if Bernie Sanders owns the enthusiasm as he appears to, that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that 20-point gap that the poll in December showed with Hillary could A, be non-existent and B, even if it does exist, overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of Sanders supporters. Oh,</span>

            <span class="text">the enthusiasm of the Sanders supporters. When you say that, do you mean the young white people? Because that&#39;s essentially what you&#39;re describing. And when you move from state to state, you change your visible minority population. You change the the number of recent immigrants. Sure. And</span>

But the point of the matter is that each state is different. And Bernie Sanders, his performance in Iowa, I agree, was pretty impressive. His performance in New Hampshire was entirely expected. You&#39;re the senator of Vermont to move to New Hampshire and do well. If you can&#39;t do that, you&#39;re out of the race as of yesterday. He had to win in New Hampshire. He knew that. He put a lot of resources and effort there. He&#39;s going to be done. Write it down. He&#39;s going to be done by Super Tuesday, the day after Super Tuesday. Yeah,</span>

So when our social network starts to move towards a Nenshi or a Redford or a Rubio or a Kasich, that is part of what defines momentum. Why did Bernie Sanders outperform Poles?

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything that I can conceive of more obnoxious than three guys sitting around talking about why women vote the way they vote. But let&#39;s keep doing it. Let&#39;s be clear about a couple of things here. One is exactly what Stephen was talking about with this notion of there was a sense in the Clinton campaign that women would vote for Hillary Clinton. And I do think that is because there is a bit of their mindset stuck in 1992. As we get further away from, you know, we have not gotten to a point of equality between the sexes yet. But some of the bigger battles are now in the rearview mirror. mirror and as that is the case it becomes a little harder to make that argument and suggest that to all women that just having a woman in the white house is what will be most beneficial to you it&#39;s also a bit of a facile argument uh you know bernie sanders is very strong on uh you know income equality bernie sanders is very strong on women&#39;s rights as well i don&#39;t know that it necessarily follows that only a woman can support women&#39;s rights i think if that were the case we&#39;d be in a lot of trouble as a society because we get this 50 50 polarization on every damn issue yeah</span>

Scale of 1 to 10, what do you think of the liberal parties or the governments, I should say, federal governments, new line as it relates to the NEB and supporting pipelines? What is your take right now on the line that they&#39;re taking where they&#39;re not being cheerleaders? They say that they want access to Tidewater, but that&#39;s as far as they&#39;re going.

            <span class="text">It&#39;s exactly what they have to do. it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s interesting because originally of course the neb process was set up because of a pipeline scandal in the 50s they said we&#39;re going to remove politics from pipelines and now over the course of you know half a century politics slid back in and now we have to say we&#39;re going to remove politics from pipelines again and sort of reboot the neb process the neb is supposed to look at these things in kind of a measured even-handed approach considering the variables the government wishes to consider and then present to the cabinet what they&#39;re supposed to do what the liberals have realized and i think the conservatives should have realized much sooner is that if you&#39;re sitting there cheerleading this thing while it&#39;s going through the neb process it looks a little insincere it looks like you&#39;re just going to prove it no matter what when it comes out of it so what the liberals are now going to do is they&#39;re going to say nothing about it uh their opponents are going to light their hair on fire i think that&#39;s a mistake by the way because Because ultimately, this thing will be settled by cabinet before the next election. So if you&#39;re going to say the sky is falling, the sky is falling. Oh, the sky didn&#39;t fall. You might run into trouble if you&#39;re the conservatives. But then they&#39;re going to deal with it as a cabinet. And I&#39;ll tell you something.</span>

Listen to me now when I say this. You&#39;re playing this completely incorrectly. correctly you need to focus on the one pipeline that has actually been approved and and say to the government of canada are you going to make this national priority is this going to be something that matters to you or are you going to shit down the throats of the people of alberta</span>

Alberta is hurting, and that&#39;s because we&#39;re dependent on resources, and resources are in the toilet. We totally get it. We elected a new government last year. We&#39;ve been talking about it forever. The government&#39;s brought out a number of diversification programs. But let&#39;s pump the brakes a bit, BC. You&#39;re sitting there giving us some lecture about how we lost our way. And by the way, they said Alberta is a similar-sized province, so this is a comparison that is fair. And that&#39;s not actually the way they phrased it, but they said Alberta is a similar-sized province. Well, guess what?</span>

But we have been on such a tear, population, GDP, any metric you can count, that, yeah, now we are similarly sized. So to sit there and be like, oh, man, did they ever fuck up, does not carry water. This has been a pretty unprecedented run for any province, what Alberta&#39;s gone through here. We are, like, you know, we&#39;re one more boom away from actually being a larger province than BC.
