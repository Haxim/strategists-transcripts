            <span class="text">You would bring the senior staff together, right? The directors in the premier&#39;s office, the political staff, any of the support you need from the public service. It would potentially include bringing somebody together like my old role, overseeing communications for the government. Maybe it would involve the deputy ministers who are affected, maybe some ADMs. The clerk would probably be involved in some way, shape or form, the chief deputy. Here&#39;s what&#39;s different about this one. And I think we need to kind of dwell on it for a minute here.</span>

That&#39;s not the first conversation. The first conversation will be Danielle Smith and her most trusted advisors. You know, the ones she went up with, it would be, you know, her and Rob Anderson, and I don&#39;t know who else in that office who she would, you know, die in the trenches with.

And so what is going to be interesting about the next couple of hours from that 4 p.m. there is you&#39;re not just trying to figure out what happened. You&#39;re trying to figure out who told the media what happened. And that complicates absolutely everything that goes on in the next two hours. Okay,</span>

Right. They would have, most likely, Megan and Elise had reached out for some sort of comment. We are going to be putting this out. This is what we have. We&#39;re going to be putting this out.

You got a pretty good sense of it. See if there&#39;s another shoe to drop. See what happens on Friday, but likely Friday afternoon is where somebody says some version of this email was taken out of context. It was done for these reasons. It wasn&#39;t illegitimate, but I&#39;ve become a distraction to a premier&#39;s office that is committed to fighting with Justin Trudeau and not fighting with Justin Trudeau, fighting Justin Trudeau to stand up for Alberta&#39;s interests.

Ideally, all of your us leaks are orchestrated and controlled. We are putting our leaks out in a predetermined fashion, which makes sense for us. this is definitely a them link so them could be one of those staffers who&#39;s got mixed loyalties to another minister them could be um some people in the in the prosecutor&#39;s office who watched her back away and said fuck that i&#39;ve got the email let&#39;s send it over right them but whoever them is you&#39;re never going to find them you never get to figure that out that&#39;s not the way the world works You don&#39;t, you know, to Corey&#39;s point, the world ain&#39;t the West Wing where you just you get to put, you know, Sam</span>

            <span class="text">The feds, they&#39;re in reaction mode. They clarify the memo was taken out of context. It&#39;s not policy. The numbers have been misinterpreted. They referred to the overall size of the workforce of these industries, not just job losses. So all of that happens. Then, and this is just where I want to dig in on the strategy side, Rachel Notley comes out swinging to Don Braid. So in a Braid column the the next day she says she wants Trudeau to totally put the brakes on the just transition plan and the emission cap so and Carter we&#39;ll start with you this is a change of course from what the NDP has been saying on this issue was it an overreaction yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">again it&#39;s one of those situations where the NDP seemed to think that being in the cycle is better than not being in the cycle or something like the fight was between trudeau and um and the ucp and for some reason the ndp bought into the argument that trudeau equals the ndp and they jumped in and and they they they now have clarified they&#39;re not for the just transition they&#39;re not for the they fell into the misinformation they allowed the fact that three post column post media columnists got the numbers completely wrong, got completely spun. I mean, the fact that Staples and Bell get spun is nothing. I mean, you just wave a sausage in front of Bell and all of a sudden he&#39;ll write whatever you want. But,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But, you know, the idea that Don Braid got spun on this, the kind of the grandfather, the great-grandfather, the great-great-grandfather of the Canadian media, I mean, that&#39;s unbelievable. When you read the report, and believe me, a minister minister in the, in the UCB government sent me the report because they&#39;re like, this is what the report says. And they were indignant. There was indignant. What do you think of this? I read the report.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">what the fuck don&#39;t you agree with? Like, what, what am I supposed to, first of all, it&#39;s not a prescription. It&#39;s a start. It&#39;s a discussion. It&#39;s a starting point. It&#39;s a starting point for the discussion. The prescription is how do we put workers that they&#39;re going to be facing a transition into some sort of a protection. And the only way to read this that I think it was actually 2 million jobs, Annalise, that were going to be lost, over 2 million jobs are going to be lost through this program. The only way to interpret it is to put the exact same framework as what we&#39;ve got going on in the coal industry. The coal industry is collapsing. And because the coal industry is collapsing, people are trying to help out the workers. But it&#39;s not going to be the exact same collapse of the oil and gas industry. It doesn&#39;t go from 100 to 20 or 100 to zero in just a couple of years. It&#39;s just absolutely bananas. And the fact that the NDP chose to buy into this weakens their position, doesn&#39;t gain them any votes. They acted 10 days too late. They look like they&#39;re whiny, snivelly little children, and they are making a huge error that just shows me that their decision-making structures are have broken forget about the decision is this going to be the election issue no it&#39;s not the fact that they still haven&#39;t figured out how to make these decisions that&#39;s the problem monologue</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that the reality is that they don&#39;t get to choose what the election issue is. You don&#39;t get to say, oh, I don&#39;t want this to be an issue, so I&#39;m going to agree. That&#39;s not the way the world works. The way the world works is if the other guys choose to make it an issue and you fight on their land, if you fight on their issues, you have made that an issue. If you move on from it and turn the issue to something else, if you are able to control what the issues are, instead of acquiescing and just folding like some sort of cheap pup tent, then you actually are in control. But the NDP have never been able to own an issue because they&#39;re always flailing. They flail from one story to the next story, to the next story, to the next story. And that has been our critique of them from the beginning of this escapade. They feel like the best way to be opposition is to oppose everything that is being done and being being said. And that might be fine in the first two or three years of a mandate. It is not fine in an election. It does not win you government. See the Conservative Party of Canada.</span>

Do you still believe this? Or do you stand with me and Rachel Notley against this just transition? And just trying to make things awkward for everybody there. So that&#39;s a problem. I mean, it&#39;s a communications problem. You&#39;ve kind of exposed yourself in unflattering ways as a bit of a movement, because it&#39;s not just about the leader. It&#39;s about the candidates. It&#39;s about the partisans more generally. But it&#39;s also an internal problem because you&#39;ve managed to make those people feel bad and feel frustrated. And frankly, a lot of them see it as Rachel Notley backing away from environmental protections, despite Rachel Notley&#39;s words really being more about what were the feds doing putting this in an election right now. And let me just say, I don&#39;t doubt for a minute that Rachel is opposed to the emissions caps. She has been for a long time. I don&#39;t doubt for a minute that she is furious that the federal liberals decided they were going to do something that would intervene in the Alberta election at a time when she&#39;s trying to manage her own narratives here. i don&#39;t doubt that i</span>
