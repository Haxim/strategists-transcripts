          <p>The gang talk about the breaking interference-in-justice accusations in Alberta and walk through how premier's offices react to crises, staff scandals and leaks - and what we might expect in the coming days. Also: Rachel Notley's opposition to Trudeau's "just transition" legislation draw's Stephen's ire.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about reports that an Alberta UCP political staffer interfered in the administration of justice, how Premier's offices react to crises and leaks and Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley's gambit to oppose "Just Transition" legislation. Is somebody about to be let go from the Premier's office? Should Justin Trudeau ruin Smith's day by giving her a pile of no-strings-attached money? And when did the answers in the lightning round actually get short? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

You got a pretty good sense of it. See if there&#39;s another shoe to drop. See what happens on Friday, but likely Friday afternoon is where somebody says some version of this email was taken out of context. It was done for these reasons. It wasn&#39;t illegitimate, but I&#39;ve become a distraction to a premier&#39;s office that is committed to fighting with Justin Trudeau and not fighting with Justin Trudeau, fighting Justin Trudeau to stand up for Alberta&#39;s interests.

Then, and this is just where I want to dig in on the strategy side, Rachel Notley comes out swinging to Don Braid. So in a Braid column the the next day she says she wants Trudeau to totally put the brakes on the just transition plan and the emission cap so and Carter we&#39;ll start with you this is a change of course from what the NDP has been saying on this issue was it an overreaction yeah</div>

It&#39;s a starting point. It&#39;s a starting point for the discussion. The prescription is how do we put workers that they&#39;re going to be facing a transition into some sort of a protection. And the only way to read this that I think it was actually 2 million jobs, Annalise, that were going to be lost, over 2 million jobs are going to be lost through this program. The only way to interpret it is to put the exact same framework as what we&#39;ve got going on in the coal industry. The coal industry is collapsing. And because the coal industry is collapsing, people are trying to help out the workers. But it&#39;s not going to be the exact same collapse of the oil and gas industry. It doesn&#39;t go from 100 to 20 or 100 to zero in just a couple of years. It&#39;s just absolutely bananas. And the fact that the NDP chose to buy into this weakens their position, doesn&#39;t gain them any votes. They acted 10 days too late. They look like they&#39;re whiny, snivelly little children, and they are making a huge error that just shows me that their decision-making structures are have broken forget about the decision is this going to be the election issue no it&#39;s not the fact that they still haven&#39;t figured out how to make these decisions that&#39;s the problem monologue</div>

            <div class="said">I think that the reality is that they don&#39;t get to choose what the election issue is. You don&#39;t get to say, oh, I don&#39;t want this to be an issue, so I&#39;m going to agree. That&#39;s not the way the world works. The way the world works is if the other guys choose to make it an issue and you fight on their land, if you fight on their issues, you have made that an issue. If you move on from it and turn the issue to something else, if you are able to control what the issues are, instead of acquiescing and just folding like some sort of cheap pup tent, then you actually are in control. But the NDP have never been able to own an issue because they&#39;re always flailing. They flail from one story to the next story, to the next story, to the next story. And that has been our critique of them from the beginning of this escapade. They feel like the best way to be opposition is to oppose everything that is being done and being being said. And that might be fine in the first two or three years of a mandate. It is not fine in an election. It does not win you government. See the Conservative Party of Canada.</div>

Do you still believe this? Or do you stand with me and Rachel Notley against this just transition? And just trying to make things awkward for everybody there. So that&#39;s a problem. I mean, it&#39;s a communications problem. You&#39;ve kind of exposed yourself in unflattering ways as a bit of a movement, because it&#39;s not just about the leader. It&#39;s about the candidates. It&#39;s about the partisans more generally. But it&#39;s also an internal problem because you&#39;ve managed to make those people feel bad and feel frustrated. And frankly, a lot of them see it as Rachel Notley backing away from environmental protections, despite Rachel Notley&#39;s words really being more about what were the feds doing putting this in an election right now. And let me just say, I don&#39;t doubt for a minute that Rachel is opposed to the emissions caps. She has been for a long time. I don&#39;t doubt for a minute that she is furious that the federal liberals decided they were going to do something that would intervene in the Alberta election at a time when she&#39;s trying to manage her own narratives here. i don&#39;t doubt that i</div>
