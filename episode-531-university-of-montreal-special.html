This is Zain Velji here, and I just wanted to give you a quick note. This is a special episode, episode 531. We recorded this today with the University of Montreal&#39;s Political</span>

So don&#39;t mind if you skip through the first couple of minutes, But do stay tuned because it is a good episode. We have some amazing things that we talk about. Not amazing. I may have increased expectations there. It&#39;s a good episode. So don&#39;t leave it behind.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, perfect. So, guys, I think what we&#39;ll do today is we&#39;ll do a quick little couple of minutes each, and I&#39;ll maybe tee it off for us just to give you a little bit of context to Alberta in the wake of the leadership of Jim Prentice and what this campaign looked like. And we&#39;ll go through a few of the numbers, and I&#39;ll throw it to Corey and Carter to take it up from there. So March</span>

            <span class="text">in May 2014 Jim Prentice does officially declare that he&#39;s going to be running for leader of the PC party and everything goes pretty smoothly from there on in he has a leadership campaign with two under other other candidates and that goes pretty smoothly, no real issues. I don&#39;t know if you guys saw any issues on that. And he wins and it looks like the PC party is going to regain full help.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">And I guess my overall sentiment on Jim Prentice is that he was brought in as this messiah, this savior, to what was already an ailing PC party. And although he made moves during his time as premier for six months prior to when he called the election, they certainly seem to have larger ramifications than they did immediately. And I think there&#39;s a few big moves that I think to get some context behind where we are today, we should probably mention.</span>

            <span class="text">This included Stephen Mandel, a very popular mayor, former mayor of Edmonton, and Gordon Dirks, a former school board chair. They were each going to be his health and education minister, respectively.</span>

            <span class="text">What you you would think was a little bit of a mild uproar, should have caused a larger uproar, actually had a consequence for Jim Prentiss that was quite positive. He won all four of those by-elections against the Wild Rose that were surging at that time, and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">The second thing was that he had 11 members of the Wild Rose party cross over and join the PCs, and effectively trying to unite the right.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Immediately, that had some positive connotation for him. His poll numbers increased like mad, and the poll numbers of Danielle Smith, the then leader of the opposition of the Waldros who came over, dropped like a rock.</span>

            <span class="text">member of the legislature that was then added multiple clauses and was a real sort of lightning rod to controversy. Prentice thought he&#39;d kind of ailed that, brought it back in, passed it out as it was supposed to be passed in its original intention by the Liberals, but that had consequences in this election. So the real, you know, background on Jim Prentice and his moves has been he had immediate wins with some of the moves that he made, But in the long term, the narrative of him being a Machiavellian CEO really,</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">really, really paid some hard realities for him. And we&#39;ll talk about that a little bit more</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">saw that during this election.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">election. Absolutely. Let me talk a little bit about the numbers. What we had in 2012 was the PCs with 61 seats, the Walgros with 17, the Liberals with five, and the NDP with four. Here</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Here is what happened this election. We had a 49-seat increase for the NDP. The PCs were down 60 seats. The liberals were down four, decimated to a single seat. And you have the Alberta party, an upstart party that&#39;s center, center left, pick up its first seats in an election basis. We have 70 new MLAs in the legislature. Out of 87, we have 70 new MLAs. And the NDP made gains in Edmonton, which they swept all 19 seats in Edmonton. They&#39;ve gotten 13 out of the 25 seats in Calgary with a couple more to come. Voter turnout neared about 60% and that was the most amount of people that have voted in Alberta since 1993 on the provincial side. Effectively, I&#39;m going to leave my top line comments with four sort of comments that we&#39;ll probably discuss. Number one, there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">there was an inevitable change in demographics. Corey will talk about this a little bit more that led to this win.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Number two, the NDP campaign, although although many people thought was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">was flawless, was not. It was just way, way, way better than the PC campaign, which was an absolute train wreck.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Number three, this election, as much as it was about ideologies on the left and the right, was about contrasting visions of what leadership looks like in this province. And Alberta spoke loudly about what that means. And finally, I think the biggest takeaway I want to leave here that we can discuss further is that the biggest catalyst to the PC&#39;s downfall was not this election, but was how they treated their base over the last 10 years or so. The PCs, through and through, have forgotten the base that has gotten them to the top of this pyramid. And they&#39;ve left them for granted. In 2011 and 12, it was Alison Redford alienating the left that made her premier and leader. And in this iteration, it was Jim Prentiss alienating the right wing that he really wanted to appease to with a budget that appealed to no one. So I&#39;ll leave it there, and I&#39;ll throw it to Corey and Carter, who may want to have their intro remarks. But I think that sets the stage a little bit for us to make some comments.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the contrasting styles of leadership, Zane. I haven&#39;t heard that said before, but that&#39;s totally true. Jim Prentice was running as the CEO of Alberta, and he wanted everybody to think of it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the tough father. But, you know, he wanted to look like dad, but he ended up looking like dad on a road trip, just losing his mind over issue after issue and overreacting to everything. everything.</span>

There was this very fascinating data set that came out during this election by a group called One Alberta Vote in which they polled individuals asking them the perception of their neighbors and how conservative they think they are. And there was a delta of minus 20 based on how they said how conservative they thought their neighbors were. And</span>

You tried to propose a merger between the NDP and the Liberals a few years back. I sure did. And so the question, as much as it is about the NDP forming the new dynasty, I think for for the typical Albertan voter that may have voted the NDP in a close race versus the PCs in some constituencies and may have had a revolt vote against the PCs is can they pivot to the center and become the new progressive solution a little bit? So answer what you&#39;re going to, but I think addressing that point is also important to projecting forward. Well,</span>

If you look at the Liberal platform versus the NDP platform the past couple of times, take the labels off, you would have a really hard time telling the difference between them.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Well, I mean the problem is with any party that&#39;s been in power that long is is they fuse with the bureaucracy So tightly and you have these people who are effectively party functionaries with government jobs They don&#39;t have those government jobs anymore And they&#39;re not going to be getting new jobs in the party if the party could even afford to pay them which they can&#39;t So I think that this problem is kind of self correcting for the PCs</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the only comment I&#39;d add is that when Jim Prentice went to go make his concession speech, there was two dozen people in that room. This is a party that one week prior</span>

            <span class="text">dinner on Thursday night. So the answer to your question there is, is that purge seems to be happening. of course but what will be really telling is to see how many of the quote-unquote grassroots and and frankly after 44 years i&#39;m not sure what&#39;s grassroots about being a pc supporter because you have direct access to power but how much of the grassroots to put that in air quotes shows up to rebuild this party you know there there might be some but i i would speculate to say that for a while this party&#39;s probably going to be going away into the night i guess not well</span>

            <span class="text">And I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happened to the PCs. Let&#39;s look back through Alberta&#39;s governments. The first government Alberta had was the Liberals. They don&#39;t exist anymore. And they really haven&#39;t except for like a little bit of the 93. UFA was our second government. They don&#39;t exist anymore. more social credit was our next government they don&#39;t exist anymore that&#39;s a that&#39;s a pretty bad uh historical precedent for the pcs to be looking at going forward and it&#39;s not like they can be assured that there&#39;s always a pc party because there aren&#39;t in either of our neighboring provinces that&#39;s true that&#39;s true what</span>
