And the NDP made gains in Edmonton, which they swept all 19 seats in Edmonton. They&#39;ve gotten 13 out of the 25 seats in Calgary with a couple more to come. Voter turnout neared about 60% and that was the most amount of people that have voted in Alberta since 1993 on the provincial side.

            <div class="said">Number three, this election, as much as it was about ideologies on the left and the right, was about contrasting visions of what leadership looks like in this province. And Alberta spoke loudly about what that means. And finally, I think the biggest takeaway I want to leave here that we can discuss further is that the biggest catalyst to the PC&#39;s downfall was not this election, but was how they treated their base over the last 10 years or so. The PCs, through and through, have forgotten the base that has gotten them to the top of this pyramid. And they&#39;ve left them for granted. In 2011 and 12, it was Alison Redford alienating the left that made her premier and leader. And in this iteration, it was Jim Prentiss alienating the right wing that he really wanted to appease to with a budget that appealed to no one. So I&#39;ll leave it there, and I&#39;ll throw it to Corey and Carter, who may want to have their intro remarks. But I think that sets the stage a little bit for us to make some comments.</div>

You tried to propose a merger between the NDP and the Liberals a few years back. I sure did. And so the question, as much as it is about the NDP forming the new dynasty, I think for for the typical Albertan voter that may have voted the NDP in a close race versus the PCs in some constituencies and may have had a revolt vote against the PCs is can they pivot to the center and become the new progressive solution a little bit? So answer what you&#39;re going to, but I think addressing that point is also important to projecting forward. Well,</div>

So the answer to your question there is, is that purge seems to be happening. of course but what will be really telling is to see how many of the quote-unquote grassroots and and frankly after 44 years i&#39;m not sure what&#39;s grassroots about being a pc supporter because you have direct access to power but how much of the grassroots to put that in air quotes shows up to rebuild this party you know there there might be some but i i would speculate to say that for a while this party&#39;s probably going to be going away into the night i guess not well</div>
