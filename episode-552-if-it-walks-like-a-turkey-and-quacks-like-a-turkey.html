            <span class="text">you guys were ever thinking of converting because i&#39;ve got a whole bunch of niqabs at home okay okay nonetheless that that we&#39;ll get into it let&#39;s go with our first segment our first segment quacking off on the weekend i want to talk about So not just your Thanksgivings, but everyone else&#39;s Thanksgivings in this country, as it relates to what a long weekend does during the final end of a campaign cycle. Now, Carter, I know you&#39;ve been through this in the mayoral corps. You&#39;ve been through this as well. So tell me off the top, what impact do you think this weekend had on the respective campaigns? Carter, I&#39;ll go with you first on this.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that there were a lot of people talking about it and a lot of social networks convening and talking politics. I mean, there were two big things happening this weekend. end uh one was the blue jays playoffs where the blue jays won a couple of games finally and people were talking about that and they were talking politics and i&#39;m always surprised to hear about the number of people who talk about politics uh because they they say that there are two things you shouldn&#39;t talk about at the big family dinners uh politics and religion yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah but both of them beat talking about your uncle&#39;s new girlfriend exactly</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">exactly that&#39;s awkward when that happens so this was people were talking about it and and uh what tends to happen and from my experience we see there&#39;s kind of this whole idea of how social networks shape voting. So the idea is that not everybody&#39;s listening to this podcast, for example. I know it&#39;s shocking, but the 25 million registered voters in Canada are not all listening to this podcast to get their information. Not yet. So the people who are listening to this podcast are</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">hyper-engaged and they&#39;ve got lots of information. Mavens and kind of that bad flawed terminology that we&#39;ve used for malcolm gladwell in the past and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">at their family dinners they are they are constructing models or they are constructing dialogues to get the people that they know to follow their vote right and people will be asking them how should we vote or you know like really that bluntly oh sure who should i vote for this year what riding am i in that&#39;s my favorite one right you can play the household game where people tell you their address and you tell them what riding they&#39;re in yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um because it&#39;s just embarrassing to be able to do that but that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s what we&#39;re that&#39;s what the the level that other people are at people not listening to this podcast they are at that level where they literally don&#39;t know what riding they&#39;re in who their candidates are and then you you form or shape their vote at these big social network gatherings cory</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">cory are the campaigns catering to that like are they catering to the fact that they knew this weekend families across the country were going to get together and and have conversations and we were in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">in the middle of an election yeah absolutely i the liberals put out specific materials about how to talk turkey i I think that we saw a bit of that from the New Democrats as well. Third party groups got into the action. You know, Press Progress had a guide as to how you can talk to friends and family at these dinners about the voting issues. And that&#39;s because Stephen&#39;s exactly right. There are people that are just trusted more on these issues because they think more about these issues and at the very least can control a conversation on these issues. And they want to make sure that they&#39;re being armed and they&#39;re able to move people. Now, in 2011, it&#39;s easy to forget the week of advance voting and the week before of</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">of the voting, you know, the actual election day was also on a long weekend. It was on Easter long weekend in 2011. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that was really the start of the NDP surge. It started going into that weekend, but that surge was solidified by the conversations that happened there. there. What&#39;s going to be interesting, we&#39;ve got a pretty clear parallel right now between the liberal trajectory in the lead up to this weekend and what the NDP trajectory was doing in the lead up to 2011 Easter.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Are we going to see liberals come out with the same steam? Because if they do, this is going to be a very, very, very interesting election day.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Interesting. Carter, tell me this. What goes into – Corey just mentioned that the liberals and the NDs had put out specific material for this weekend, wanting to capitalize on it with the hyper engaged that we&#39;re going to be talking about this anyways you&#39;ve done this in the past you&#39;ve credited some of your success in the nenshi campaign to a long weekend as well actually this specific long weekend if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

You think so? Nobody gave us an issue that we were going to be talking about other than that week-old niqab issue. I would have loved to have gone into it talking about a new health care initiative or talking about a new idea of some sort. You think it had</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think it would be impossible to come up with something new in a 70-plus day campaign. So something that was already in place would probably be something that I would pick on. But it needed to be given some jets. And we didn&#39;t really come into this weekend with anything that we wanted to talk about.</span>

I think that the liberals, knowing that we were going into this weekend and knowing that they wanted to set the tone for the final week of the campaign, doubled down, tripled down on that super optimistic we can do this message. Correct. That ad they had ready. Ready. was the best ad they&#39;ve done of this campaign. And I would also note that our big complaint of their very first ad of the campaign, they say, I&#39;m not ready, you know, repeating the charge. All of that was gone, you know. From this particular ad. From this particular ad. It was talking about Canadians being an optimistic people, about how the economy depends on you, not Stephen Harper. And we are ready to do better because we&#39;ve always done better as Canadians and just ends with the word ready. And I thought, what a, like, that was the theme of what he said. So again, if you&#39;d never heard the charge, you&#39;re just going to look at that and be like, yeah, I am ready for change. I&#39;m just ready for something different. But if you have heard the charge, and most people have heard the charge that Justin Trudeau is not ready, it was pitch perfect. It was absolutely perfect. It showed him commanding a room of 7,000 people talking about exactly why it was time for change and that he was the change. I&#39;ve</span>

But what would you have done differently this weekend? If you were leading these parties on a top line, what would you have done differently? I think you said that there wasn&#39;t enough to chew on policy-wise and the narrative wasn&#39;t baked yet. Is there anything else you want to add before I go to Corey? I</span>

            <span class="text">think the conservatives had some ways they could have optimized. I talked about the liberals and New Democrats provided people with those messages. The conservatives did as well, but I definitely didn&#39;t get the sense that the conservatives were as concerned about how the narratives may crystallize on the weekend.

Okay, lay it on me. with the liberals. Their whole message was this notion of we are ready. There was even a moment where Justin Trudeau this weekend said, the conservatives are our friends, they&#39;re our neighbors, they&#39;re our whatever, and we need to make sure they come on side. How would you rank that between one to 10, one being low, 10 being high? Corey, I&#39;ll go with you first. I</span>

And the general public, how many of them are going to hear these things? We are almost at the end of this. They&#39;ve got maybe two or three days to make a final splash. The New Democrats have to turn this around. The conservatives have to, I don&#39;t know. No, I mean, I think they&#39;re really crossing their fingers at this point that Justin Trudeau says something that&#39;s, you know, really puts into real strong relief this notion that perhaps he&#39;s not ready and brings back all of those things. And the liberals, what they need to do is they need to fight the urge to just hold on to a lead and coast. They need to be going for the jugular at this point and really reinforcing those messages.

And it&#39;s really going to take a significant vote collapse to count him out entirely. What he needs to do is he needs to try to trip up Justin Trudeau. He&#39;s got to try to get him into some debates that Justin Trudeau is going to do uncomfortably.

No, sorry, they don&#39;t. and when all of the parties have been very clear about what they&#39;ll do and there&#39;s no ambiguity here i don&#39;t know how much you get to pound on the table and start to pout about it because the other two parties have been very clear they are not going to support a conservative government carter</span>
