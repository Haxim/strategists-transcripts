This is being framed as a big win for the provinces and a loss for the federal government&#39;s environmental goals. I want to kind of dive into it. I think Friday was an interesting day.

I know that the Alberta Court of Appeal had said this should happen and they use some very strong language. But frankly, they do that a lot on things that the Supreme Court then turns around and says, yeah, I don&#39;t think so. I mean, fundamentally, Fundamentally, as you go through the decision, it is rooted in a view of Canadian federalism that exists. It just seems to have been going out of style as it pertains to the environment, right? It&#39;s this idea that you&#39;ve got these watertight</div>

And in areas of overlap, a certain amount of cooperation is required and you can&#39;t just unilaterally make these sorts of decisions. So, you know, maybe we shouldn&#39;t have been surprised by it. I think that there were a lot of people saying they suspected that the federal government would be successful in court on net. They obviously were not. And I think we&#39;ll wait and we&#39;ll see how all the lawyers write this up and assess it and look at the various pieces and say, oh, this makes sense. Or, you know, I wouldn&#39;t have necessarily called that, but that work is still to be done. You know, we&#39;ve</div>

            <div class="said">we&#39;ve got the instant analysis, but not the deep analysis. And yeah, I mean, we&#39;ll see where it is from there. But the bottom line, and the most important part here is it is a very big win for provinces who are standing up against it. And it is a black eye for the federal government who, you know, largely treated the province, at least in a political sense, as though these arguments were ridiculous.

            <div class="said">do you want to jump in on that?

This fundamental unfairness that has become their narrative, that&#39;s going to continue to be their talking point. So in Alberta, I think that they&#39;ve got it pretty well lined up. And I think the same even with Scott Moe. I mean, does this ruling in some kind of perverted fashion make it easier for him to get the notwithstanding clause through, right? Like, notwithstanding this other situation, like this is unrelated, but it does seem to indicate that federal overreach is this constant problem that we have.

See previous comments. It was about the Constitution. But like, what is the sanctity of the Canadian Constitution? I mean, I get behind we&#39;re a nation of laws, but there&#39;s nothing about the Constitution that says to me we can never change it. There&#39;s nothing about the Constitution that says to me it is certainly right in all circumstances. I mean, the Canadian Constitution is not even just a written document.

And look, I mean, the case they make is not a bad one in the sense that courts in the federal system have long been concerned with the idea that one jurisdiction could come in and claim to override the actions in another jurisdiction by squinting and looking at their power in a different way, right? And saying, well, because I interpret this either as a criminal act and I have power over criminal law, I can do whatever I want in your jurisdiction, or because I have power over civil rights, you know, and in this case, that means something a little bit different. It&#39;s more like what you&#39;re allowed to do locally. Well, then I can override federal law, which can&#39;t happen because there&#39;s like kind of a, you know, supremacy of federal. But the point is, they like to elbow into each other&#39;s jurisdictions, and sometimes the courts need to settle it all out. And sometimes the courts can&#39;t, and they say you got to figure it out as kind of partners.</div>

You get one and you are done. The BC Liberals, you lose, you&#39;re gone. That&#39;s the ballgame. You lose, you&#39;re gone, right? Everybody who was going after Christy Clark on the 801 Club with their little buttons where they would get rid of her at 801 the moment she lost the election in 2013.

He doesn&#39;t really enjoy hanging out with Justin Trudeau in this supply and confidence but just really wants to get these things and now has a new red line on pharma care and um and certainly his caucus talked a lot tougher on that than he did so now he&#39;s in a whole different jam because he was the guy walking on supply and confidence and now he&#39;s the guy threatening supply and confidence and I just don&#39;t know that that&#39;s a tenable position for a leader and I don&#39;t think that ever works for leaders I just don&#39;t I think you&#39;ve already lost the people who think how dare you do this with the liberals you&#39;re never going going to get them back and now you risk undercutting your own agreement if your agreement fails so let&#39;s</div>

            <div class="said">i think that going kind of a bit wild and testing a bunch of stuff is would be a little bit fun and the ndp should look at it and they should really be exploring kind of various think pieces and going out there and saying things like hey what about like national profit sharing we increase corporate taxes by 10 and that all goes to canadians right and it&#39;s a way that we bring in like a version of a ubi what if we went out and we said, hey, we&#39;re going to make it so that any car under $30,000 that&#39;s electric is subsidized and any car over $60,000. So take the liberal one and just like dial it up to 11 and make there a version where it&#39;s actually helping lower income people too. Raising minimum wages, calling for all sorts of crap. Go out there, see what people immediately go like, oh, that&#39;s interesting. Remember the beware of novel concepts challenge. So go out, do a little bit of durability testing on it try to figure out what the counter arguments are see where people will land but if you want to be known as this fresh new exciting party you&#39;re not going to get there</div>
