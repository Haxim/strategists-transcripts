          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">okay guys let&#39;s uh let&#39;s jump into it let&#39;s start with our first segment our first segment a 5-2 decision big news on friday across the country the supreme court of canada ruled that much of the impact assessment act better known as bill 69 is unconstitutional. This is being framed as a big win for the provinces and a loss for the federal government&#39;s environmental goals. I want to kind of dive into it. I think Friday was an interesting day. I&#39;m curious, I guess, to start off, if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">if you guys were surprised by the decision and surprised by the fact it was 5-2. Let&#39;s start there. And then there&#39;s lots of different threads we can pull apart. Corey?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So was I surprised? I wasn&#39;t after Stephen Carter Carter predicted this wouldn&#39;t happen, which basically assured that it would with 100% certainty.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But yeah, beyond that, I mean, it&#39;s interesting. I didn&#39;t really know what to expect. This is not, I&#39;m not a lawyer. I know that the Alberta Court of Appeal had said this should happen and they use some very strong language. But frankly, they do that a lot on things that the Supreme Court then turns around and says, yeah, I don&#39;t think so. I mean, fundamentally, Fundamentally, as you go through the decision, it is rooted in a view of Canadian federalism that exists. It just seems to have been going out of style as it pertains to the environment, right? It&#39;s this idea that you&#39;ve got these watertight</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">watertight compartments. These are areas of provincial jurisdiction or federal jurisdiction or areas of overlap. And in areas of overlap, a certain amount of cooperation is required and you can&#39;t just unilaterally make these sorts of decisions. So, you know, maybe we shouldn&#39;t have been surprised by it. I think that there were a lot of people saying they suspected that the federal government would be successful in court on net. They obviously were not. And I think we&#39;ll wait and we&#39;ll see how all the lawyers write this up and assess it and look at the various pieces and say, oh, this makes sense. Or, you know, I wouldn&#39;t have necessarily called that, but that work is still to be done. You know, we&#39;ve</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ve got the instant analysis, but not the deep analysis. And yeah, I mean, we&#39;ll see where it is from there. But the bottom line, and the most important part here is it is a very big win for provinces who are standing up against it. And it is a black eye for the federal government who, you know, largely treated the province, at least in a political sense, as though these arguments were ridiculous. Clearly not ridiculous as the Supreme Court has now weighed in.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">do you want to jump in on that? Like, is it, and we can get into kind of the response and the strategy, but absolutely big win, like huge win, historic win is how the provinces are framing it. There are others, there&#39;s legal experts and federal officials, obviously, that are saying premiers are exaggerating the impact of the ruling. Is this like as big of a deal as the provinces are saying it is, Carter?</span>

This is what they&#39;ve done. It makes electoral sense. But just because it makes electoral sense doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s the most sensible thing to be doing in the long run.

And in Alberta, I think it&#39;s going to be relatively straightforward because they had already mapped out so many different things that they were going to go after the federal government for. This fundamental unfairness that has become their narrative, that&#39;s going to continue to be their talking point. So in Alberta, I think that they&#39;ve got it pretty well lined up. And I think the same even with Scott Moe. I mean, does this ruling in some kind of perverted fashion make it easier for him to get the notwithstanding clause through, right? Like, notwithstanding this other situation, like this is unrelated, but it does seem to indicate that federal overreach is this constant problem that we have. And they just don&#39;t understand the good people of Saskatchewan and our, you know, great fear of transsexual youth. I mean, or, you know, like, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s insane to me.

In fact, the decision goes to great lengths to say, hey, the environment very well might be the biggest problem of our time, but that doesn&#39;t mean the federal government gets to ignore the Constitution under the rule of law, right? See previous comments. It was about the Constitution. But like, what is the sanctity of the Canadian Constitution? I mean, I get behind we&#39;re a nation of laws, but there&#39;s nothing about the Constitution that says to me we can never change it. There&#39;s nothing about the Constitution that says to me it is certainly right in all circumstances. I mean, the Canadian Constitution is not even just a written document. It&#39;s also a series of decisions and kind of a body of precedent there. And this thing is almost</span>

It doesn&#39;t really make sense in the overall scheme of things.

            <span class="text">i think that also again i don&#39;t want to be just kind of beating a dead horse here like banging this drum for too long but the courts the courts were interested in whether this was an appropriate division of powers. And look, I mean, the case they make is not a bad one in the sense that courts in the federal system have long been concerned with the idea that one jurisdiction could come in and claim to override the actions in another jurisdiction by squinting and looking at their power in a different way, right? And saying, well, because I interpret this either as a criminal act and I have power over criminal law, I can do whatever I want in your jurisdiction, or because I have power over civil rights, you know, and in this case, that means something a little bit different. It&#39;s more like what you&#39;re allowed to do locally. Well, then I can override federal law, which can&#39;t happen because there&#39;s like kind of a, you know, supremacy of federal. But the point is, they like to elbow into each other&#39;s jurisdictions, and sometimes the courts need to settle it all out. And sometimes the courts can&#39;t, and they say you got to figure it out as kind of partners.</span>

It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to bring in the crowds the way we need them to. But a lot of time and effort gets spent in wishing things were different. What I would encourage instead people who support the aims of the federal act that is largely been gutted now, you know, in terms of the ability to go in and regulate major projects, say, if that was, you know, that was a means to an end, that means is no longer on the table. the end has not changed what</span>

We&#39;re going to continue to assert Alberta&#39;s rights in this. And by the way, these three three paragraphs that somewhat criticize the federal government&#39;s actions in this parallel universe where the feds win i&#39;m going to talk about them for the next 30 minutes at this press conference because that&#39;s what governments do they make their victories look big and they look their defeats look small and um and of course that&#39;s what we can anticipate and that&#39;s certainly what we&#39;ve seen even from the federal government saying like oh no big deal big deal you know sorry but it is a big deal you know the you know this impact assessment act has been a major piece of discourse in this country for many years. Literally, the day after he was sworn in as premier, Jason Kenney was talking to the Senate about the need to rapidly overhaul this bill and all of that.

That&#39;s actually a very, very weak showing in a party. And I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m not trying to pick on Jagmeet Singh here, but in that kind of setting, that&#39;s a very bad number.

I think that, you know, Jack Layton stays because there&#39;s no one who&#39;s seen to be as good, right? Whereas, you know, Mulcair loses because there are seen to be other players that could come in, right? So Jagmeet Singh is being viewed, I think, as someone who&#39;s, there&#39;s other people who could come in. Now, I think that they are viewing them in the perfect sense. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s any one person like Mulroney or Jim Denning or Ted Morton, who was gunning for Stelmack and Redford.

I think part of his vote being where it was wasn&#39;t in part because of that, a sense that he wasn&#39;t taking the fight to the liberals. And now coming out of this convention, he seems to be a different guy based on the votes of his party, saying he&#39;s really going to hold Justin Trudeau to account. He doesn&#39;t really enjoy hanging out with Justin Trudeau in this supply and confidence but just really wants to get these things and now has a new red line on pharma care and um and certainly his caucus talked a lot tougher on that than he did so now he&#39;s in a whole different jam because he was the guy walking on supply and confidence and now he&#39;s the guy threatening supply and confidence and I just don&#39;t know that that&#39;s a tenable position for a leader and I don&#39;t think that ever works for leaders I just don&#39;t I think you&#39;ve already lost the people who think how dare you do this with the liberals you&#39;re never going going to get them back and now you risk undercutting your own agreement if your agreement fails so let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">i think that going kind of a bit wild and testing a bunch of stuff is would be a little bit fun and the ndp should look at it and they should really be exploring kind of various think pieces and going out there and saying things like hey what about like national profit sharing we increase corporate taxes by 10 and that all goes to canadians right and it&#39;s a way that we bring in like a version of a ubi what if we went out and we said, hey, we&#39;re going to make it so that any car under $30,000 that&#39;s electric is subsidized and any car over $60,000. So take the liberal one and just like dial it up to 11 and make there a version where it&#39;s actually helping lower income people too. Raising minimum wages, calling for all sorts of crap. Go out there, see what people immediately go like, oh, that&#39;s interesting. Remember the beware of novel concepts challenge. So go out, do a little bit of durability testing on it try to figure out what the counter arguments are see where people will land but if you want to be known as this fresh new exciting party you&#39;re not going to get there</span>

Um, is this going to be the tool, the ticket that really shows people the value of the, uh, the Alberta pension plan? I don&#39;t think so.
