We started off pretty appropriately, I think, talking about sports fans not being reasonable. And what Donald Trump has managed to do is create a bit of a sports fan base. These people will stick with him through thick or thin, no matter what he says, they will take his hypocrisies, they will create justifications, they will dismiss all of the criticism of him as coming from an establishment that doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, and has led them astray. and this is almost</span>

And here&#39;s what I think your strategy is in these situations. It&#39;s not to run somebody in the swing states, because all you&#39;re going to do is make sure Hillary Clinton definitely gets the electoral votes in the swing states. It&#39;s actually to run people in the third party in the strong Republican states and throw enough votes that it ends up in the House of Representatives. representatives uh because for those who don&#39;t know under the u.s constitution if you don&#39;t get an outright majority in the electoral college then it goes to a vote in the house of representatives which is still probably more likely than not to be republican controlled and hopefully their cooler heads could prevail could be the thinking if you&#39;re the republican trying to do right but i think the notion of just running a third party candidate across the board i</span>

And before we get into the specifics of the two leadership contests that we have on the go right now, the NDP and the Conservative Party, let&#39;s talk about the concepts between one member, one vote versus the hundred point system. Just lay it out on us because we&#39;ve touched upon this multiple times, but we actually haven&#39;t gone in depth in explaining to people how we actually vote for our leaders.

Explain that, yeah. is that you may for example always get at least 100 votes right or 100 points in it but if you have more members maybe it goes up to you know say the first 100 members or less and there&#39;s 100 votes anything beyond that maybe it goes up for another point for every five members and whatnot a ceiling would be the opposite it&#39;s maybe one member is just one point and two is two points and so on and so forth to 100 but after that it&#39;s prorated and then you can only ever get 100 points so there are variations that have been tried in different situations but the basic the</span>
