          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about how the Democrats and Republicans are uniting behind their respective candidates and how the Conservative and NDP leadership contests are kicking off. Can the GOP unite behind Trump? Are the Sandernistas uniting behind Clinton? And where do I address my $5 million cheque to the Michael Chong campaign? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
