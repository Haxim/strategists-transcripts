            <span class="text">it&#39;s like the bag of pucks i like it i like it okay we&#39;re moving on to our next headline cory i&#39;m going to start with you for a very specific reason on this one this one comes to us from buzzfeed hot off the press people are accusing robin hood of stealing from the poor to give to the rich after it limited trading on gamestop shares we could spend the entire episode on this i mean we could spend the entire episode i could spend the entire episode So learning about this, I feel like I&#39;ve got a rough sense over the course of the last 36 hours as to what&#39;s going on. But this most recent twist, which is the fact that the app that many of these retail traders on WallStreetBets have been using to buy their shares and boost the price of AMC and GameStop has now ultimately halted the purchase of said socks, I think is quite ironic in the grand scheme of things, of course, named Robinhood.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Robinhood&#39;s an interesting app in that they have a bit of a gamification of savings and stock investment. And one</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one of the things that they will occasionally do is just give a free share to people. And about a year ago, I guess, they actually gave a free GameStop share to people who signed up. Oh, I didn&#39;t know that. Yeah, so there&#39;s all sorts of angles here. But ultimately, it&#39;s a pretty bad look when it looks like the app that you are using to make trades that the claim is it&#39;s in your control, it&#39;s in your power, it&#39;s in your hands. It says, actually, we don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing here. You&#39;re kind of driving people out of business, so we&#39;re just going to limit that. Now, to be fair, they are somewhat saving these people from themselves. This is pretty mad house what is going on with these large investments into stocks that have no business being anywhere near the valuation level they are, really just to kind of stick it to people in Wall Street who are shorting these stocks. So for those who are not familiar with the story, when you short a stock, what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re essentially selling</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">selling a stock you don&#39;t have and you&#39;re going to buy it back at a later date to make whole the market maker. and if the stock goes up your downside is unlimited you know the difference between what you quote-unquote sold it for and the the price that you ultimately buy it for and sometimes you&#39;re just forced to buy it that&#39;s what you owe so if you buy for example gamestop or you sell i guess gamestop at ten dollars a share and then you are forced to buy it at 300 you have lost 290 dollars a share so i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i mean you can see how this can drive somebody out of business however the flip side is Because in order for GameStop to get the $300 a share, people are buying GameStop at</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">$300 a share. It&#39;s a self</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so to speak. It will ultimately come down. It is effectively, like so much of the market, a bit of a Ponzi scheme, a bit of a confidence scheme. But the fundamentals just aren&#39;t there. And when everything kind of comes crashing back down to earth, when it comes back to $10, you will have lost a</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">No, we genuinely appreciate it. You know what? The most interesting part about this, actually, actually, was the political comparison that I think a journalist wrote around how this memification of this stock, this irrational sort of like joyous sort of celebratory cult-like community that was built on Wall Street bets to kind of pump the stock price up was not dissimilar to what was happening in a less private corridor in 2016 around Donald Trump posts, right? People just pushing that stuff out on social media, incubating it in this sort of vortex and pushing it out there. The same sort of behavior of not necessarily caring about the outcome, or in this case, GameStop. I don&#39;t think any of these folks have an affinity to this outcome, as much as they care about memeing the process and having, you know, shits and giggles along the way, which leads to pretty shitty outcomes.

It was Hillary Clinton and the, you know, the Republican establishment on one side, and it&#39;s Wall Street hedge funds now. And in both cases, you had people saying, we&#39;re not the nihilists, they are. Look how shitty they are. Look how much they&#39;ve screwed me over. And I think that we&#39;ve seen what happens when you kind of take this nihilism and you kind of fight fire with fire here. I would caution people against getting too excited and too gleeful about this the the market is absolutely um a strange thing and it is not always working for the benefit of main street let&#39;s let&#39;s just so i&#39;ll say that you might not agree with me but that</span>

Not so much funny, but just on a serious note from the CBC, BBC data error means completed Ontario COVID-19 vaccinations, only half of what was reported. The Ontario government says that only only it was it has only fully vaccinated half the people it had originally reported due to a government data error, according to the Ministry of Health, rather than providing a data on the number of people who&#39;ve been fully vaccinated, which would require the two doses. They&#39;ve inadvertently indicated</span>

            <span class="text">indicated the amount of vaccines scenes that have been administered. Carter, your take on this, the impact that this will have to the continuing narrative on the vaccination stuff, which we&#39;re going to talk about next, but also how this error was handled, just going straight and to the public. Do you feel like that was the right strategy here on this headline?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it absolutely is the right strategy. I mean, you make a mistake, you own up to the mistake, and you move forward. That&#39;s the best practice of making mistakes. And I&#39;ve, I&#39;ve made a couple and that&#39;s the easiest thing to do just to smart asses grinning at me. So you own up to them, you move forward and you say, you know, you say you&#39;re wrong and you move forward. You know, this reminds me of when Chester got our subscription numbers wrong in the earlier versions of the strategists. And I mean, we had to let them go because the mistake was so big, but you know what, we rebuilt the audience and everything worked out. This is a A little bit different because it&#39;s people&#39;s lives, you</span>

            <span class="text">know, but this is still vaccinations that aren&#39;t happening fast enough. The challenge that we&#39;ve been talking about vaccination on this show now for weeks because I&#39;ve been saying that this is going to be the metric by which Trudeau is going to be measured as well as the provincial health ministers. And you can see now everybody just pointing fingers at everybody else. It&#39;s not going well. We&#39;re way behind the OECD countries. countries. We&#39;re not doing as well as the United States, which has been a gong show on every metric of COVID. We&#39;re going to need to see some significant improvement or Trudeau and these premiers are all in trouble.</span>

            <span class="text">Very similar to Stephen&#39;s. I think that ultimately, what could the province of Ontario do except for correct the mistake and move forward could you imagine if they held on to that even for a day two days you know they could get they could have just gotten crushed but uh this is a growing narrative and a growing concern for many canadians um the vaccine numbers are not where we optimistically hope they would be the government has yet to really revise down numbers i think as recently as this evening i saw the federal government say no no no we&#39;re going to get our four million by the end of march don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about what some of those numbers we provided you said provinces but we haven&#39;t hit a single</span>

They&#39;ve been telegraphing this for the last four days. Many critics are calling this as a compensation to the fact that we don&#39;t have vaccines. So you&#39;re trying to do one thing where as a replacement or as a mitigating factor when you don&#39;t have vaccines to deliver, What do you kind of make of this and what do you kind of make of the political both strategy and perhaps even cost that the Trudeau government might have on the new travel restrictions?</span>

Do we bring him back now? We&#39;re not sure that he&#39;s going to be en route, but just tell us what the fucking rules are. Tell us what the rules are so we can follow the rules.

It&#39;s like buying a $1.5 billion pipeline. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn&#39;t. And that&#39;s fundamentally, as we&#39;ve seen, a bit of a mistake. You&#39;ve got to take things more in your control and look at the things that are within your ability to manage. And what you are seeing O2 will do is start talking about transparencies around vaccines.

There&#39;s so many things we could talk about the United States. But I think the filibuster is the most interesting thing to me right now, because it&#39;s about spending political capital. And it ties into what we talked about at the top when Corey was talking about dropping the, in many ways, to me, it talks about the capital and the time spent in Biden&#39;s first 100 days. And so you&#39;re seeing right now that progressives within the Democratic Party and movements and caucuses within the Democratic establishment establishment party are warning that Joe Biden&#39;s agenda could collapse if the Democrats don&#39;t change the Senate and how it works. It could have an immediate ramification on this nearly $2 trillion bill that Biden wants to push through. And they&#39;re already putting pressure on whoever stands in their way. They&#39;re framing the Senate filibuster as like this tool of racism and oppression, trying to, you know, this procedural mechanism makes it impossible to move legislation without 60 votes. votes. Corey, on a previous episode, I don&#39;t recall of this podcast, I don&#39;t recall if it was last week or the week before, you were talking about Biden&#39;s skittishness to kind of go down this path. Having observed the last couple of weeks, do you feel like this is worthy of the political capital necessary in the early days of the Biden administration?</span>

You know, there were some silly things here. Despite Schumer being the Senate leader, the Republicans still carried control of all of the Senate committees, right? And I think that was pissing Democrats off. And that was leading to more likely that the filibuster would be killed. there&#39;s a game that uh mcconnell is playing right now which is it&#39;s his job he&#39;s trying to keep as much powerful as possible for his conference and that is that is a game where you&#39;ve essentially got to be as obstructionist as possible without forcing the counter reaction from the democrats bringing in this this you know a bomb of a solution so uh if i&#39;m joe biden and i think that i can get it done at this point i</span>

The reason this comes up is that, you know, not just progressive groups, but most recently at the funeral for former Congressman John Lewis, Barack Obama, talking about the filibuster as being a sign of systemic inequality. Carter, do you feel like this is something worth the political capital if you are Joe Biden?

They&#39;ve obviously got a procedural issue with it, but they&#39;ve also got one regarding convincing Biden. Is there some strategies or tactics more broadly that you feel like they should employ in trying to convince their democratic establishment leaders that this is something that needs to happen? And kind of what tactics would you broadly be thinking about right now? Because I don&#39;t know if this is what leads to fracturing, but many on the progressive progressive side are</span>

            <span class="text">But you can be creative about it. This is not a binary. The rule is not there is a filibuster exactly as there is or there is not. We&#39;ve already seen the filibuster be weakened pretty significantly in the past decade. It can be weakened further. You can extend the times when you can use reconciliation. So this process where the house votes for something the senate votes for something different the reconciliation process you you come up with something else and then it goes back to both houses and maybe that can&#39;t be filibustered in any way shape or form and you extend the terms under which you can avoid the filibuster it already can avoid the filibuster right now maybe you look at ways that the filibuster allows you to hold</span>

The federal conservatives here in Canada, I should specify, because we&#39;re talking about both America and Canada, say that they&#39;ve raised more than $7.6 million in the final three months of 2020. The figures come as political parties or federal parties are counting their year-end donations. They say $7.6 million for the final three months, their highest on record.

But one person has been making the headlines this week, and that is the newly minted Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. We&#39;ve talked about her before, the QAnon conspiracy theorist who&#39;s got some of the wildest claims, which I won&#39;t repeat here. But the question for you, Corey, on a scale of 1 to 10, the damage she&#39;s doing to the Republican Party in your mind?</span>
