        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk vaccine roll-out, the possibility of a spring election and Biden's first few days. Are the Liberals in trouble with all the vaccine roll-out stumbles? What's the optimal strategy for the Conservatives? And why does Corey love the filibuster so much? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

But this most recent twist, which is the fact that the app that many of these retail traders on WallStreetBets have been using to buy their shares and boost the price of AMC and GameStop has now ultimately halted the purchase of said socks, I think is quite ironic in the grand scheme of things, of course, named Robinhood.</div>

And about a year ago, I guess, they actually gave a free GameStop share to people who signed up. Oh, I didn&#39;t know that. Yeah, so there&#39;s all sorts of angles here. But ultimately, it&#39;s a pretty bad look when it looks like the app that you are using to make trades that the claim is it&#39;s in your control, it&#39;s in your power, it&#39;s in your hands. It says, actually, we don&#39;t like what you&#39;re doing here. You&#39;re kind of driving people out of business, so we&#39;re just going to limit that. Now, to be fair, they are somewhat saving these people from themselves. This is pretty mad house what is going on with these large investments into stocks that have no business being anywhere near the valuation level they are, really just to kind of stick it to people in Wall Street who are shorting these stocks. So for those who are not familiar with the story, when you short a stock, what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re essentially selling</div>

The most interesting part about this, actually, actually, was the political comparison that I think a journalist wrote around how this memification of this stock, this irrational sort of like joyous sort of celebratory cult-like community that was built on Wall Street bets to kind of pump the stock price up was not dissimilar to what was happening in a less private corridor in 2016 around Donald Trump posts, right? People just pushing that stuff out on social media, incubating it in this sort of vortex and pushing it out there. The same sort of behavior of not necessarily caring about the outcome, or in this case, GameStop. I don&#39;t think any of these folks have an affinity to this outcome, as much as they care about memeing the process and having, you know, shits and giggles along the way, which leads to pretty shitty outcomes.

Not so much funny, but just on a serious note from the CBC, BBC data error means completed Ontario COVID-19 vaccinations, only half of what was reported. The Ontario government says that only only it was it has only fully vaccinated half the people it had originally reported due to a government data error, according to the Ministry of Health, rather than providing a data on the number of people who&#39;ve been fully vaccinated, which would require the two doses.

So you own up to them, you move forward and you say, you know, you say you&#39;re wrong and you move forward. You know, this reminds me of when Chester got our subscription numbers wrong in the earlier versions of the strategists.

They&#39;ve been telegraphing this for the last four days. Many critics are calling this as a compensation to the fact that we don&#39;t have vaccines. So you&#39;re trying to do one thing where as a replacement or as a mitigating factor when you don&#39;t have vaccines to deliver, What do you kind of make of this and what do you kind of make of the political both strategy and perhaps even cost that the Trudeau government might have on the new travel restrictions?</div>

There&#39;s so many things we could talk about the United States. But I think the filibuster is the most interesting thing to me right now, because it&#39;s about spending political capital. And it ties into what we talked about at the top when Corey was talking about dropping the, in many ways, to me, it talks about the capital and the time spent in Biden&#39;s first 100 days. And so you&#39;re seeing right now that progressives within the Democratic Party and movements and caucuses within the Democratic establishment establishment party are warning that Joe Biden&#39;s agenda could collapse if the Democrats don&#39;t change the Senate and how it works. It could have an immediate ramification on this nearly $2 trillion bill that Biden wants to push through. And they&#39;re already putting pressure on whoever stands in their way. They&#39;re framing the Senate filibuster as like this tool of racism and oppression, trying to, you know, this procedural mechanism makes it impossible to move legislation without 60 votes. votes. Corey, on a previous episode, I don&#39;t recall of this podcast, I don&#39;t recall if it was last week or the week before, you were talking about Biden&#39;s skittishness to kind of go down this path. Having observed the last couple of weeks, do you feel like this is worthy of the political capital necessary in the early days of the Biden administration?</div>

Corey, I guess my question to you is if you&#39;re if you&#39;re advising some of these progressive groups who for their political agenda and policy agenda, so to speak, feel like the filibuster needs to go. They&#39;ve obviously got a procedural issue with it, but they&#39;ve also got one regarding convincing Biden. Is there some strategies or tactics more broadly that you feel like they should employ in trying to convince their democratic establishment leaders that this is something that needs to happen? And kind of what tactics would you broadly be thinking about right now? Because I don&#39;t know if this is what leads to fracturing, but many on the progressive progressive side are</div>

So this process where the house votes for something the senate votes for something different the reconciliation process you you come up with something else and then it goes back to both houses and maybe that can&#39;t be filibustered in any way shape or form and you extend the terms under which you can avoid the filibuster it already can avoid the filibuster right now maybe you look at ways that the filibuster allows you to hold</div>

The federal conservatives here in Canada, I should specify, because we&#39;re talking about both America and Canada, say that they&#39;ve raised more than $7.6 million in the final three months of 2020. The figures come as political parties or federal parties are counting their year-end donations. They say $7.6 million for the final three months, their highest on record.
