        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Avi Lewis, Ontario's reopening and Quebec's unilateral constitutional gambit. What will it mean to federal politics if Quebec just declares itself a nation, constitutionally? Is tying Covid reopening to vaccines a good idea? And when's the last time you saw a "Honk if you're horny" bumper sticker? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

This first headline comes to us from AP. Five Oregon counties vote to leave the state. They want to create a new state, a greater Idaho. So, Carter, once again, they want to leave Oregon. They want to create greater Idaho. On Tuesday, voters in five counties in eastern Oregon urged county officials to begin to promote border relocation and joining Idaho. While President Biden defeated former President Donald Trump statewide in last fall&#39;s election, five Five counties heavily favor Trump. The group Move Oregon&#39;s Borders for a Greater Idaho, that is actually the advocacy group&#39;s name, very literal, is behind the effort. In addition to rural eastern Oregon, the plan Greater Idaho would also encompass large swaths of northeastern California. Just FYI, they also want to take some parts of California. Just throwing it in there. Carter, what do you think of this? Does this seem right? Does it seem about time that these five counties leave and just kind of decide their own future, so to speak? Which might be a theme of the show in some ways.</div>

          <div class="said">We&#39;re going to compare the reopening plans for Ontario and Quebec, and then we&#39;re going to jump into Quebec about something else they want to reopen. constitutionally we want to talk about uh some of their language laws that they want to consider as part of bill 96 but let&#39;s first hit up a comparison on the reopen plans for ontario and quebec and talk about the politics of them uh in ontario they just announced today i believe if i&#39;m not mistaken that there is three-step plan to reopen the province with outdoor recreational amenities gradually opening uh as part of the uh restrictions as of may 22nd i.e this saturday outdoor recreational amenities, golf courses, tennis, etc., will allow it to reopen. Outdoor limits for gathering and organized public events will be expanded on Saturday, which will allow these amenities to be used by up to five people. And then we have two other stages based and tethered with vaccination rates in Ontario. Since this has been dropped, this plan, many have called it a very cautious approach for Ford, you know, a step-based plan tethered to vaccination rates. You know, many many people within his own party, even some commentators surprised by how slow and perhaps, I think cautious is the right word, the opening plan was. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on this one. A, would you agree that it&#39;s in the cautious territory? And I&#39;ll very quickly introduce Quebec here so we can have a comparator. And B, do you feel like that&#39;s the right strategy for Ford given some of the heat and political L&#39;s he&#39;s had recently with perhaps reopening too early or are having some restrictions fall flat on their face or be outright rejected by a broad base of the Ontario population. So I want to ask you both of those questions. And let&#39;s introduce Quebec quickly. And we&#39;ll go to Corey. Do</div>

I think tying it on one dimension to vaccine makes a ton of sense. And I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s about throwing the blame to Trudeau. I think it&#39;s about incentivizing vaccination. It&#39;s encouraging people who are on that next level out, because we are now getting to the point in this country where we&#39;ll be talking about the vaccine hesitant an awful lot more.</div>

This seems quite different. I don&#39;t know if it necessarily is going to be quite different in terms of how it shapes itself between the two provinces. But Carter, any initial observations?

If you&#39;re Ontario and you&#39;re thinking, pretty sure we&#39;re going to get there, maybe even totally confident, but you want to have that extra kind of security and so you tie it explicitly to vaccination, why not? And it all kind of makes sense. And we can expect to start seeing decline in those trailing indicators of ICUs and deaths going forward as the third wave starts to look behind all of the provinces. And well, except Manitoba, unfortunately, there&#39;s terrible stories coming out of Manitoba. But, you know, pray we don&#39;t get to a fourth.

          <div class="said">Let&#39;s stick with Quebec, but let&#39;s change the definition to reopening. I want to talk about the reopening of something else, the Constitution. Basically, Quebec wants to insert. Now, if you haven&#39;t heard this story, two bullet points into the 1867 Constitution Act, one that says, quote, Quebecers form a nation, and the other that says French shall be the only official language of a Quebec. It&#39;s also the common language of the Quebec nation. nation. Taken by themselves, these two things are not especially controversial. The House of Commons back in the day in 2006, I believe, passed a motion around recognizing Quebecers forming a nation. And the second point captures an easily verifiable fact about how the government operates and most people interact in Quebec. Where things get messy is figuring out how these two points get included into the Constitution. So while Quebec can alter aspects of its own constitution. Any challenges that also alter the Canadian constitutions are likely to run into roadblocks, i.e. Canada is a nation of both French and English. Corey, you know a bit about this issue. My first question is, how well did I summarize it as it relates to Quebec&#39;s Bill 96? Because there&#39;s so much politics about it, but as it relates to the facts of what Quebec is trying to do, you know, how well did I do and what else would you add, I guess, is the second part of the the question to help listeners contextualize the true nature of this story.</div>

Because the prime minister does not want to be telling the people of Quebec that they can&#39;t have this right, that in some fashion they are constrained by the rest of the population of Canada, because Quebec doesn&#39;t like that.

It has a very different, not an entirely dissimilar flavor to 2019. Let me lay out on the table what each of our federal leaders have said, right? So Justin Trudeau&#39;s general answer has been, you know, not a high praise for it, but yeah, Quebec could rewrite a section of Canada&#39;s constitution, no permission needed from the provinces or the federal government. Jagmeet Singh says, if the Quebec government wants to make modifications to the constitution to better protect the french language and the culture of quebec the federal government should work with the province to make it happen um o&#39;toole says to la presse that uh he believes quebec is able to alter parts of the constitution by itself a little bit of that undone by michelle rempel garner in alberta who says that uh posted her reaction suggesting that trudeau was setting a very dangerous precedent signaling and posing an example could alberta just do whatever the fuck it wants, you know, based on this. So that&#39;s kind of where the parties generally stand. Corey, where, first of all, I&#39;m going to ask you the basic question, you know, bear trap by Legault? And how should the leaders think about navigating this? And I want to start with Trudeau at the top. So give me the answer to the bear trap question, which I suspect you&#39;re going to say yes to.

It&#39;s scary to think about the chain of events that that could trigger for our country here.

Carter, I want to extend on your comments, though. Let&#39;s talk about liberal strategists today based on what Trudeau said.

I don&#39;t think that people will go to the ballot box saying, oh, you know what, I really wanted our ability to amend the Constitution unilaterally using Bill 96.

You know, you&#39;ve talked about the down-the-road consequences, and perhaps I should even say down-the-road, you know, crisis that could come from something like this. Is there a political strategy for a federal leader that would not be rooted in fear, that would actually be around having your cake and eat it too, not alienating Quebec voters, not necessarily losing losing out on seat-rich Quebec, while simultaneously being a strong and ardent defender of perhaps, you know, what happens down the road? Is there a lane here? Is there a tight rope here that you could think of for a political leader, maybe even agnostic of party, because it seems like almost everyone&#39;s on the same fucking page on this issue, federally, that you could advise them and say, you know, do consider this as a route of action? I want to see if you kind of have any thoughts on that. And you too, Carter, before we kind of close this segment out.</div>
