            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i need to talk to you guys about something before we jump into the headlines um because i don&#39;t have much time about in the show about this and i&#39;ve just come to mind uh steve allen has another extension on his report can you give me your quick 45 seconds each on the uh inquiry that has an extension and uh maybe also answer the question, at this point, should he just be using the crowdsourced document we have produced for him? Not we, you, as the listeners, have produced for him at this point. Carter, jump in, and then Corey, let&#39;s get a take on both of these before we jump into the headlines.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, absolutely. The document that has been created by the Strategist podcast listeners is the best document. As always, our listeners come through with everything that is needed, and they did it in a timely fashion um they only took one delay uh and made it all happen i mean we did repost it with the second or i guess third delay how many delays has this been um it&#39;s at least two too many four i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i think this is four four</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">four oh my god i put three i&#39;m so embarrassed this is you know it&#39;s just embarrassing and uh i&#39;m really glad that we&#39;ve got loyal podcast listeners who who can complete a Google Doc faster than Steve Allen can complete an inquiry.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, should he be just referring to the Google Doc at this point?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think our listeners could have done better. They didn&#39;t try very hard. They could have tried more.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And on top of that, I&#39;m just disappointed in them generally about most of the things going on in their lives. Hey, are we going to actually talk about what the Steve Allen report is for anybody who hasn&#39;t been subjected to this in the province of Alberta? Everyone</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Everyone should be subjected to this in the entire world. Corey, do you want to add some context?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The Steve Allen report is the report into un-Alberta activities, I think technically called like the anti-oil campaign inquiry, where a prominent Calgarian named Steve Allen was commissioned to look into foreign sources of funding that were coming into Alberta to talk shit about the oil sands. And this has now been going on for, what, two years? Two</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Two years, yeah. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, two years this commission&#39;s been going, or this inquiry&#39;s been going, and nothing to show for it. Nothing to show for it except for a couple of documents that were kind of teased out to us that have a bunch of climate denialism and crazy copy-pasted conspiracy theories. So not looking good right now. And getting into the fourth delay, the excuse given was because they were sued. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So you know you&#39;re always in great stead when that&#39;s happening here. here but uh you know be easy on steve allen the creative process takes time if you&#39;re going to find a nice story to tell that you&#39;ve pulled out of thin air you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s move it on to our headlines steven carter i always like to go to you first for our headlines because i know you&#39;re not going to fill time waste space do do any of that. This first headline comes to us from AP. Five Oregon counties vote to leave the state. They want to create a new state, a greater Idaho. So, Carter, once again, they want to leave Oregon. They want to create greater Idaho. On Tuesday, voters in five counties in eastern Oregon urged county officials to begin to promote border relocation and joining Idaho. While President Biden defeated former President Donald Trump statewide in last fall&#39;s election, five Five counties heavily favor Trump. The group Move Oregon&#39;s Borders for a Greater Idaho, that is actually the advocacy group&#39;s name, very literal, is behind the effort. In addition to rural eastern Oregon, the plan Greater Idaho would also encompass large swaths of northeastern California. Just FYI, they also want to take some parts of California. Just throwing it in there. Carter, what do you think of this? Does this seem right? Does it seem about time that these five counties leave and just kind of decide their own future, so to speak? Which might be a theme of the show in some ways.</span>

They may not be able to afford MacBooks for all their staff at the party HQ. So this Liberal staffer, you know, has their own iPhone, came with a couple stickers, put it on their Liberal Party issued laptop.

I&#39;m not even talking about factionalism here, but I&#39;m saying there are flavors of social democracy.

He&#39;d be one of the candidates available who might actually make liberal and conservative voters decide it&#39;s better to kind of congeal votes. votes.

But I&#39;ve I&#39;ve got to tell you, most ridings in this country, green plus NDP does not equal majority or plurality of vote. And so it&#39;s a bit of a mirage.

Outdoor limits for gathering and organized public events will be expanded on Saturday, which will allow these amenities to be used by up to five people. And then we have two other stages based and tethered with vaccination rates in Ontario. Since this has been dropped, this plan, many have called it a very cautious approach for Ford, you know, a step-based plan tethered to vaccination rates. You know, many many people within his own party, even some commentators surprised by how slow and perhaps, I think cautious is the right word, the opening plan was. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on this one. A, would you agree that it&#39;s in the cautious territory? And I&#39;ll very quickly introduce Quebec here so we can have a comparator. And B, do you feel like that&#39;s the right strategy for Ford given some of the heat and political L&#39;s he&#39;s had recently with perhaps reopening too early or are having some restrictions fall flat on their face or be outright rejected by a broad base of the Ontario population. So I want to ask you both of those questions. And let&#39;s introduce Quebec quickly. And we&#39;ll go to Corey. Do</span>

            <span class="text">So I hear what Stephen&#39;s saying. And I do think that from a pure public health point of view, tying it to ICU beds, tying it to cases that makes sense. But I also believe you&#39;ve always got the option as the government to say, you know what cases are out of hand, ICU is out of hand, we&#39;re going to shut this thing down, or we&#39;re going to to do a bit of a small circuit breaker. I think tying it on one dimension to vaccine makes a ton of sense. And I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s about throwing the blame to Trudeau. I think it&#39;s about incentivizing vaccination. It&#39;s encouraging people who are on that next level out, because we are now getting to the point in this country where we&#39;ll be talking about the vaccine hesitant an awful lot more.</span>

At least not in any kind of measurable way at this point, but that day will will come and if you really want to get to 75 20 or 75 25 or any of these metrics that have been laid out there by various authorities you&#39;ve got to start worrying about where your ceiling is and if you&#39;re if you&#39;re sealing if you can get extra five points out of your ceiling and get that much closer or perhaps tip over to herd immunity because you have said your life gets to go back to normal when you get vaccinated that</span>

But he&#39;s giving us a scorecard that enables us to know what the hell is going to happen over the summer.

They have a stage plan as well. that on the 31st they&#39;ll have they&#39;ll be in what they call the orange zone restaurants and gyms will open with some restrictions high school students will be back to class two weeks later on the 14th the province will go into yellow zone team sports will start people will be able to visit other households again bars will throw open their doors and slightly ahead of that terraces will open and then by the end of june um even more relaxed rules will come into play as quebec moves into the green zone 10 people to get together indoors outdoor festivals will be allowed up to 2,500 people. This seems quite different. I don&#39;t know if it necessarily is going to be quite different in terms of how it shapes itself between the two provinces. But Carter, any initial observations? Maybe I&#39;ll start with you in terms of how Quebec is dealing with this, both on the communications side of it and how they look at their reopening.</span>

And those targets that PHAC built were not really themselves more to what&#39;s going on in ICUs, what&#39;s going on in case counts, right? And so we are going into a different paradigm here.

            <span class="text">many times in the past year and a half, governments have acted too slowly. And people have perhaps acted too slowly or mentally not gotten there fast enough. And as a result, we have acted too late. And perhaps that&#39;s a lesson we have now at this point overlearned. Because now, you know, people are almost feeling like everything needs to be perfectly resolved before we start moving forward and out of this. But there is a moment, and I can&#39;t say with any certainty that we&#39;re at this moment, but there is going to be a moment in this, in</span>

And the public health officials seem to think that when we hit certain targets on vaccination, we&#39;re there. So if you&#39;re Quebec and you think totally confident you&#39;re going to get there, why wouldn&#39;t you start planning to open up? If you&#39;re Ontario and you&#39;re thinking, pretty sure we&#39;re going to get there, maybe even totally confident, but you want to have that extra kind of security and so you tie it explicitly to vaccination, why not? And it all kind of makes sense. And we can expect to start seeing decline in those trailing indicators of ICUs and deaths going forward as the third wave starts to look behind all of the provinces. And well, except Manitoba, unfortunately, there&#39;s terrible stories coming out of Manitoba. But, you know, pray we don&#39;t get to a fourth.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s stick with Quebec, but let&#39;s change the definition to reopening. I want to talk about the reopening of something else, the Constitution. Basically, Quebec wants to insert. Now, if you haven&#39;t heard this story, two bullet points into the 1867 Constitution Act, one that says, quote, Quebecers form a nation, and the other that says French shall be the only official language of a Quebec. It&#39;s also the common language of the Quebec nation. nation. Taken by themselves, these two things are not especially controversial. The House of Commons back in the day in 2006, I believe, passed a motion around recognizing Quebecers forming a nation. And the second point captures an easily verifiable fact about how the government operates and most people interact in Quebec. Where things get messy is figuring out how these two points get included into the Constitution. So while Quebec can alter aspects of its own constitution. Any challenges that also alter the Canadian constitutions are likely to run into roadblocks, i.e. Canada is a nation of both French and English. Corey, you know a bit about this issue. My first question is, how well did I summarize it as it relates to Quebec&#39;s Bill 96? Because there&#39;s so much politics about it, but as it relates to the facts of what Quebec is trying to do, you know, how well did I do and what else would you add, I guess, is the second part of the the question to help listeners contextualize the true nature of this story.</span>

It has a very different, not an entirely dissimilar flavor to 2019. Let me lay out on the table what each of our federal leaders have said, right? So Justin Trudeau&#39;s general answer has been, you know, not a high praise for it, but yeah, Quebec could rewrite a section of Canada&#39;s constitution, no permission needed from the provinces or the federal government. Jagmeet Singh says, if the Quebec government wants to make modifications to the constitution to better protect the french language and the culture of quebec the federal government should work with the province to make it happen um o&#39;toole says to la presse that uh he believes quebec is able to alter parts of the constitution by itself a little bit of that undone by michelle rempel garner in alberta who says that uh posted her reaction suggesting that trudeau was setting a very dangerous precedent signaling and posing an example could alberta just do whatever the fuck it wants, you know, based on this. So that&#39;s kind of where the parties generally stand. Corey, where, first of all, I&#39;m going to ask you the basic question, you know, bear trap by Legault?

It&#39;s scary to think about the chain of events that that could trigger for our country here.

We&#39;re gambling with perhaps even minority rights and confederation overall. So I think that&#39;s, I think, I&#39;m glad you put that out on the table. Carter, I want to extend on your comments, though. Let&#39;s talk about liberal strategists today based on what Trudeau said.

If Alberta did this, imagine what would happen. I think that&#39;s predictable. And given the state of politics in Alberta, I don&#39;t think it has any impact at all on the on the federal election but if if uh newfoundland and new brunswick uh start jumping up and down um that could have real implications for the liberals so um you know if new brunswick uh newfoundland and british columbia start getting riled that quebec has a special power that they don&#39;t have um then watch the liberals maybe have to shift back and do something like a referral uh to the courts uh like cory was saying the the predictable outrage in alberta isn&#39;t going to force anybody to change their political position cory</span>

            <span class="text">A question for you, Corey. I&#39;ll start with you on this. I&#39;ll give you a chance too, Carter. You know, you&#39;ve talked about the down-the-road consequences, and perhaps I should even say down-the-road, you know, crisis that could come from something like this. Is there a political strategy for a federal leader that would not be rooted in fear, that would actually be around having your cake and eat it too, not alienating Quebec voters, not necessarily losing losing out on seat-rich Quebec, while simultaneously being a strong and ardent defender of perhaps, you know, what happens down the road? Is there a lane here? Is there a tight rope here that you could think of for a political leader, maybe even agnostic of party, because it seems like almost everyone&#39;s on the same fucking page on this issue, federally, that you could advise them and say, you know, do consider this as a route of action? I want to see if you kind of have any thoughts on that. And you too, Carter, before we kind of close this segment out.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, look, I think that the solution of kicking it to a reference and saying we&#39;re on board, but we want to make sure that it works and is not going to just fall to a court challenge down the road would be my recommended course of action. Because here&#39;s the thing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Opposing the Quebec&#39;s a nation, that would be actually a reversal for all of the federal parties, right? Right. The idea of French language protections, I just don&#39;t believe that any of the parties are willing to willing to stand up and say, you know what, I&#39;m going to fight this fight. And we&#39;re not going any further on this. You can say what you will about Quebec&#39;s language laws. But at this point, they&#39;re so well entrenched and established. I think the suggestion that you&#39;re not on board with French being the, quote, only official language of Quebec, that&#39;d be difficult. And by the way, we didn&#39;t talk about that much, but the Constitution says that, you know, English</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what does that mean, again, knowing that you can&#39;t amend that part of the Constitution with the part you&#39;re trying to kind of call out at this moment? So I honestly, I think you&#39;ve just got to say, conceptually,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is too important, we can&#39;t have this fallout later. But we&#39;re there with you. If the courts say it requires parliament on board, we&#39;re happy to push this through parliament. If the courts say you need seven plus 50, we&#39;re happy to work with the other provinces to try to get this in. And, you know, there will be risks there because people will say, well, Quebec should have the right to do this. This is so important to the cultural and the identity of this province. You might be also kicking up the, you know, the sovereigntist fires. But I guess my point is that could be a lot worse if it falls out of the Constitution other ways.</span>

The politics of it on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being horrible, 10 being excellent, amazing politics.
