        <p>It's Toronto mayoral election eve. Lots has happened in the past couple of days which demands the question: why does action crowd to the final days - and is it too late to have an effect? Plus: Online News Act and RFK Junior.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Toronto mayoral election, how elections can change in the closing days and why they usually don't - as well as a grab bag of topics from the Online News Act to the value of debating a conspiracy theorist like RFK Junior. Why are endorsements in the Toronto Mayoral election happening so late? Should conspiracy theories be addressed head on, or does that just give them oxygen? And will Bill C-18 make it impossible to find reputable news about lizard people? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We might even jump into Alberta politics. And why not use our favorite framework, Corey, if something is fine, if something is fabulous, or if something is totally fucked. Corey, let&#39;s start here. Tomorrow, Toronto elects a new mayor. If you&#39;re Olivia Chow, how do you feel tonight, the night before? Do you feel fine? Do you feel fabulous? Do you feel fucked? For some context, she&#39;s been up in all the polls, polls, but her lead is getting narrower and narrower and narrower based on almost every single poll you see out there. She&#39;s a frontrunner. She&#39;s one day away from glory. Corey, how does she feel? Fine, fabulous, or fucked tonight?</div>

Obviously, the most recent polls have shown a tightening, but that tightening is still her with a lead of about, I don&#39;t know, seven points, right? And one of the challenges is that her biggest competitor was was uh endorsed by the former mayor and maybe if that had happened a week or two earlier it would be a bigger deal but i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know if the ship can turn one of the interesting questions here and why maybe if i was going to lean a little fucked like if it was like fine fine slash fucked it would be that in toronto a couple things one is not</div>

And then you&#39;ve now got the Saunders camp with, you know, the premier doing a voicemail drop for him as well, saying, listen, this is the guy. If you want to have a mayor in Toronto, this is the guy you got to go for. talk to me about the partisanship you might think it&#39;s fine you might think it&#39;s fabulous because why not we&#39;ve already got these built-in ecosystems of political organizing why not mobilize them to increase voter turnout and something in a by-election for mayor or you might think it&#39;s because we&#39;re actually uh doing the opposite of what we should be doing in terms of civic and city issues which don&#39;t necessarily lean left to right carter fine fabulous or fucked uh the now very overt partisanship in the Toronto mayoral election.</div>

And I think that that&#39;s ultimately all that matters is will people actually get out and vote and will they vote for for Chow or will Will they vote for someone else? Now, the endorsements to me don&#39;t matter at all. We&#39;ve seen, you know, we&#39;ve discussed endorsements quite a bit. I think that they&#39;re relatively useless, but the</div>

Folks that that are usually on opposite sides of a partisan political campaign become good friends, or at least for the purposes of electing a mayoral candidate or a city council or school board trustee, right? Or someone where you don&#39;t necessarily have to wear the jersey. We saw in Ottawa with their mayoral. We saw it, of course, in Toronto. We&#39;ve seen it in our city, Calgary, Edmonton, elsewhere. Partisans making themselves known, fine, fabulous, or fucked for the Toronto mayoral right now.</div>

          <div class="said">Maybe let&#39;s talk about what it is for the candidates. And it&#39;s tricky, right? It might even veer towards fucked. Here&#39;s the thing. We are in an era of negative partisanship. We&#39;ve talked about this. People tend to vote against political parties as much as they&#39;re voting for them, if not more. And so one of the interesting things i think about this last and again wow i mean where was everybody two weeks ago the campaign had gotten to this point two weeks ago it would be just such a different campaign but you have one candidate endorsed by the sitting premier you have one candidate so clearly i mean it&#39;s olivia chow for crying out loud like she is synonymous with the ndp of course</div>

          <div class="said">and then uh you&#39;ve got by lao and what&#39;s interesting to me about the third name on that list as well Well, you know, my understanding is the Ontario Liberal Party apparatus is strongly behind her. You&#39;ve also got the John Tory endorsement, right? And so you see sort of a breaking down of that. So this is a long walk to get to the point where if you have one candidate that seems like they&#39;re associated with the New Democrats and one candidate that seems associated with the Conservatives and one candidate that&#39;s a little harder to pin down and maybe seems to be pan-partisan or non-partisan just by – You&#39;re talking about</div>

          <div class="said">from you, Carter, is that there&#39;s a bit of hubris here, that I can create my own weather system in the last couple of days. In fact, that is part of it, that if I drop it in an endorsement or if we get John Troy to drop it in an endorsement, he creates a weather system. It&#39;s the conclusion. There&#39;s no other time for anyone else to get their point in, ergo we win. I&#39;ve heard that. I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anything deeper. Corey, I want your take on this. You asked the question. I want you to try to posit an answer.</div>

          <div class="said">So I do think what Stephen said is one of the forces that&#39;s driving us here. I 100% agree. There are so many people I&#39;ve heard have some version of, well, now is not the time. We&#39;re going to leave that for the last minute. We&#39;re going to wow them on the last week, and we&#39;re going to do the big policy drop. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s kind of, I think in some ways, it&#39;s like learning the wrong lesson from a truth that you&#39;ve learned about politics. which is people do make decisions late. But you assume they make those decisions with perfect information as of that minute, because you assume they&#39;re like you. And while they&#39;re making that decision late, the information takes time to trickle to them. And that&#39;s the reality that forces you to have to make these bigger plays earlier. But to your point, is there something else going on here? Yeah, 100% there is. It&#39;s the 11th hour phenomenon.</div>

          <div class="said">right it&#39;s when status quos break down because you start to realize you&#39;re not going to get that time back and um that that&#39;s probably occurred to an extent here people sat there hoping i&#39;d suspect for many weeks people who did not want olivia chow to be mayor, they hoped that it would become clear, and somebody would come forward, and that would be that, and yeah, everybody would consolidate, and there&#39;s no way they&#39;re going to vote for Olivia Chow. I&#39;m sure that was a thought that many, many people had. And with a week left to go, they looked at those polls, and they said, oh, fuck, Olivia Chow is going to be mayor. Guess I better do something if I don&#39;t want to do that. And the conversations are happening with the campaigns, and they&#39;re putting more pressure on you, and they&#39;re also leaning on that ego and And that notion that you can come in late and change things at the last minute. And then, hey, if you&#39;re John Tory, you make an announcement. Hey, if you&#39;re Doug Ford, you record a phone call. Because you feel the fact that you&#39;ve got to leave it on the field and you don&#39;t get to redo this when you get to the 11th hour. And so I think that&#39;s also part of it.

Um, it&#39;s everybody votes on the same day, give or take. And that means that the decision needs to be made now.

The tactic, whether it&#39;s good or bad, depends on your strategy, depends on your audience, depends on a million other things. This is such a blown up, like, there are going to be so many people tomorrow who are like, well, I don&#39;t know who I&#39;m going to vote for. I think I&#39;m going to vote for candidate number 18 on the ballot, but who the hell knows? There&#39;s so many of them. And to have somebody who can help clarify that for you, by the way, delivered through a channel that generally an older population, which generally skews conservative, is going to get, and they&#39;re going to get the voicemail of the Premier of Ontario, that kind of makes sense to me. Like, I think it works really well in this particular context, because it will help clarify who conservatives are supposed to go to. You&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s a leader of conservatives, and when you&#39;ve got a field of literally 100, it tells you who, you know, conservatives should be rallying around. So that makes an awful lot of sense to me.</div>

He has an opinion about the place where he lives, and to pretend otherwise is a bit ridiculous. In some ways, isn&#39;t it better you know those connections? And look, there is going to be benefits to the city of Toronto if Saunders becomes the mayor as a result of those connections. And there will be reasons why that should give you severe pause if you&#39;re residents of Toronto, because there&#39;s going to be some pretty significant alignment with provincial objectives, regardless of whether they actually support. Or you could reasonably believe, right, that he&#39;s going to owe something to the premier. And a lot of the job of being mayor of Toronto is standing up to the premier of Ontario. So, you know, I don&#39;t have huge problems with it.

I think one of the things about Doug Ford that his opponents hate to admit, but I think I will just call out, is that he can kind of get away with that. Like, it sort of matches his shtick pretty good. I can easily imagine him going like, oh, geez, Olivia, I mean, you know I&#39;m a Conservative. Of course I was going to vote for a Conservative. But you&#39;re here now, and we&#39;re all here for the people of Toronto. So we&#39;re going to figure it out. And by God, I&#39;m going to work as hard as I can with you. And we got this strong mayor thing happening now. And God, I can&#39;t wait to see what we could do for the people of toronto like he could pull that off a little bit more i think than say uh you know somebody who&#39;s seen as more of a machiavellian for us more calculating i&#39;ll use jason kenney like if jason kenney came in after endorsing somebody like say jason kenney had endorsed jeremy farkas and then had to work with jody gondek he</div>

Because he puts himself out here, like literally months after saying he&#39;s not going to get involved. You know, he&#39;s going to stick aside, they&#39;ve asked him these questions, like, nope, nope, nope, not going to get involved, and then gets involved. Yeah.

The current strategy says, if it&#39;s not a debate, which many people are arguing, right? We just let this guy be himself. We let him continue to flourish, right? So as someone who&#39;s like, if you&#39;re like advised to strategize on this, and knowing, you know, and being a student of persuasive storytelling, is the answer to just just say, if it&#39;s not a debate, you just let him go do his thing? And has that been kind of a mistake of the mainstream to just let it flourish and not try to comment on it or kind of leave it in quarantine, being like, ah, we can&#39;t touch that. We can&#39;t touch that. That&#39;s not going to be something we touch. Because that seems to be the other side of the argument. You don&#39;t touch conspiracy theorists. Leave these fucking people alone. Is that a mistake from a political strategy, persuasion strategy perspective, Carl?</div>

And now they have morphed into, you know, the Las Vegas shooting was, you know, a false flag operation by the U.S. government. You know, 9-11 was another fall. I mean, they love their false flags.

You start recapping conversations. You start saying, so if I did this, you agree that we would meet the condition here. So if I managed to prove this thing was not true, Bobby Kennedy Jr., you would agree then that there was a problem with your vaccine argument. And then of course, they won&#39;t want to be pinned down. They&#39;re going to say, well, no, and they&#39;ll move the goalposts and you&#39;ll say, well, hold on. Let&#39;s just all agree on terms here. You do it in paper. You do it in a concrete way. You do it slowly. You don&#39;t give them kind of the flash and chaos that a real-time debate provides them. There are ways to have these conversations without giving them, like, a Joe Rogan-experienced 30-minute flash dance. Like, nobody needs that, okay? Nobody needs that.</div>

It&#39;s not how much do you agree with the following statements. It&#39;s literally there&#39;s a fucking strongly disagree. You don&#39;t have to agree. This is a professional researcher doing professional work in a professional environment. And I was all over the discord on this. Don&#39;t join the fucking discord. Don&#39;t join Patreon. Don&#39;t spend your six dollars because you wind up with these people who followed this. and they all had to have a remedial lesson in the Dunning-Kruger effect because they didn&#39;t know enough to get down off their fucking high horses atop the peak of Mount Stupid. But it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m fine. There&#39;s some great work. Read Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind. Look at his moral foundations. Take a look at the questions. Researchers around the world use these types of questions to really see what&#39;s happening underneath the surface. And if you can&#39;t understand that, read a fucking book.</div>
