We might even jump into Alberta politics. And why not use our favorite framework, Corey, if something is fine, if something is fabulous, or if something is totally fucked. Corey, let&#39;s start here. Tomorrow, Toronto elects a new mayor. If you&#39;re Olivia Chow, how do you feel tonight, the night before? Do you feel fine? Do you feel fabulous? Do you feel fucked? For some context, she&#39;s been up in all the polls, polls, but her lead is getting narrower and narrower and narrower based on almost every single poll you see out there. She&#39;s a frontrunner. She&#39;s one day away from glory. Corey, how does she feel? Fine, fabulous, or fucked tonight?</span>

Obviously, the most recent polls have shown a tightening, but that tightening is still her with a lead of about, I don&#39;t know, seven points, right? And one of the challenges is that her biggest competitor was was uh endorsed by the former mayor and maybe if that had happened a week or two earlier it would be a bigger deal but i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know if the ship can turn one of the interesting questions here and why maybe if i was going to lean a little fucked like if it was like fine fine slash fucked it would be that in toronto a couple things one is not</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">The NDP sort of organizers obviously going to Olivia Chow. She&#39;s had a long history in the party. You got the liberal-ish organizers supporting Anna Bailao. And then you&#39;ve now got the Saunders camp with, you know, the premier doing a voicemail drop for him as well, saying, listen, this is the guy. If you want to have a mayor in Toronto, this is the guy you got to go for. talk to me about the partisanship you might think it&#39;s fine you might think it&#39;s fabulous because why not we&#39;ve already got these built-in ecosystems of political organizing why not mobilize them to increase voter turnout and something in a by-election for mayor or you might think it&#39;s because we&#39;re actually uh doing the opposite of what we should be doing in terms of civic and city issues which don&#39;t necessarily lean left to right carter fine fabulous or fucked uh the now very overt partisanship in the Toronto mayoral election.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s absolutely fine. I think that partisans are always going to be involved in elections for no other reason than they seem to care more. So, you know, you&#39;re you&#39;re wearing your team&#39;s colors. Sure. I mean, but at the same time, you&#39;re you&#39;re probably more likely to get out and vote. And I think that that&#39;s ultimately all that matters is will people actually get out and vote and will they vote for for Chow or will Will they vote for someone else? Now, the endorsements to me don&#39;t matter at all. We&#39;ve seen, you know, we&#39;ve discussed endorsements quite a bit. I think that they&#39;re relatively useless, but the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, we&#39;ve seen a bit of strange bedfellowings in this in this election. We always see it in mayoralty elections, right? Folks that that are usually on opposite sides of a partisan political campaign become good friends, or at least for the purposes of electing a mayoral candidate or a city council or school board trustee, right? Or someone where you don&#39;t necessarily have to wear the jersey. We saw in Ottawa with their mayoral. We saw it, of course, in Toronto. We&#39;ve seen it in our city, Calgary, Edmonton, elsewhere. Partisans making themselves known, fine, fabulous, or fucked for the Toronto mayoral right now.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Maybe let&#39;s talk about what it is for the candidates. And it&#39;s tricky, right? It might even veer towards fucked. Here&#39;s the thing. We are in an era of negative partisanship. We&#39;ve talked about this. People tend to vote against political parties as much as they&#39;re voting for them, if not more. And so one of the interesting things i think about this last and again wow i mean where was everybody two weeks ago the campaign had gotten to this point two weeks ago it would be just such a different campaign but you have one candidate endorsed by the sitting premier you have one candidate so clearly i mean it&#39;s olivia chow for crying out loud like she is synonymous with the ndp of course</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then uh you&#39;ve got by lao and what&#39;s interesting to me about the third name on that list as well Well, you know, my understanding is the Ontario Liberal Party apparatus is strongly behind her. You&#39;ve also got the John Tory endorsement, right? And so you see sort of a breaking down of that. So this is a long walk to get to the point where if you have one candidate that seems like they&#39;re associated with the New Democrats and one candidate that seems associated with the Conservatives and one candidate that&#39;s a little harder to pin down and maybe seems to be pan-partisan or non-partisan just by – You&#39;re talking about</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And so I guess the thing is, there&#39;s a little bit of game theory here. Like if everyone&#39;s partisan, well, then you&#39;re kind of locked into a paradigm time everybody gets but if some people are playing that game and some people are playing</span>

If a John and listen, the answer to the John Tory endorsement might be he said no, no, no. And he eventually said yes, because he saw that it was so close or whatever. there could be a story.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">from you, Carter, is that there&#39;s a bit of hubris here, that I can create my own weather system in the last couple of days. In fact, that is part of it, that if I drop it in an endorsement or if we get John Troy to drop it in an endorsement, he creates a weather system. It&#39;s the conclusion. There&#39;s no other time for anyone else to get their point in, ergo we win. I&#39;ve heard that. I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s anything deeper. Corey, I want your take on this. You asked the question. I want you to try to posit an answer.</span>

            <span class="text">So I do think what Stephen said is one of the forces that&#39;s driving us here. I 100% agree. There are so many people I&#39;ve heard have some version of, well, now is not the time. We&#39;re going to leave that for the last minute. We&#39;re going to wow them on the last week, and we&#39;re going to do the big policy drop. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s kind of, I think in some ways, it&#39;s like learning the wrong lesson from a truth that you&#39;ve learned about politics. which is people do make decisions late. But you assume they make those decisions with perfect information as of that minute, because you assume they&#39;re like you. And while they&#39;re making that decision late, the information takes time to trickle to them. And that&#39;s the reality that forces you to have to make these bigger plays earlier. But to your point, is there something else going on here? Yeah, 100% there is. It&#39;s the 11th hour phenomenon.</span>

I&#39;m sure that was a thought that many, many people had. And with a week left to go, they looked at those polls, and they said, oh, fuck, Olivia Chow is going to be mayor. Guess I better do something if I don&#39;t want to do that. And the conversations are happening with the campaigns, and they&#39;re putting more pressure on you, and they&#39;re also leaning on that ego and And that notion that you can come in late and change things at the last minute. And then, hey, if you&#39;re John Tory, you make an announcement. Hey, if you&#39;re Doug Ford, you record a phone call. Because you feel the fact that you&#39;ve got to leave it on the field and you don&#39;t get to redo this when you get to the 11th hour. And so I think that&#39;s also part of it. I&#39;m sure you saw this in your own campaign you refused to talk about, Zane. This</span>

The tactic, whether it&#39;s good or bad, depends on your strategy, depends on your audience, depends on a million other things. This is such a blown up, like, there are going to be so many people tomorrow who are like, well, I don&#39;t know who I&#39;m going to vote for. I think I&#39;m going to vote for candidate number 18 on the ballot, but who the hell knows? There&#39;s so many of them. And to have somebody who can help clarify that for you, by the way, delivered through a channel that generally an older population, which generally skews conservative, is going to get, and they&#39;re going to get the voicemail of the Premier of Ontario, that kind of makes sense to me. Like, I think it works really well in this particular context, because it will help clarify who conservatives are supposed to go to. You&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s a leader of conservatives, and when you&#39;ve got a field of literally 100, it tells you who, you know, conservatives should be rallying around. So that makes an awful lot of sense to me.</span>

I know there are people who think that he shouldn&#39;t be involved in this particular way, shape, or form, but the reality is he&#39;s a resident of—he was a councillor in Toronto. He has an opinion about the place where he lives, and to pretend otherwise is a bit ridiculous. In some ways, isn&#39;t it better you know those connections? And look, there is going to be benefits to the city of Toronto if Saunders becomes the mayor as a result of those connections. And there will be reasons why that should give you severe pause if you&#39;re residents of Toronto, because there&#39;s going to be some pretty significant alignment with provincial objectives, regardless of whether they actually support. Or you could reasonably believe, right, that he&#39;s going to owe something to the premier. And a lot of the job of being mayor of Toronto is standing up to the premier of Ontario. So, you know, I don&#39;t have huge problems with it. I think that generally speaking, I&#39;m not wild about pretending clearly partisan people don&#39;t have an interest in elections and don&#39;t have opinions about elections. Of course they do.

I think one of the things about Doug Ford that his opponents hate to admit, but I think I will just call out, is that he can kind of get away with that. Like, it sort of matches his shtick pretty good. I can easily imagine him going like, oh, geez, Olivia, I mean, you know I&#39;m a Conservative. Of course I was going to vote for a Conservative. But you&#39;re here now, and we&#39;re all here for the people of Toronto. So we&#39;re going to figure it out. And by God, I&#39;m going to work as hard as I can with you. And we got this strong mayor thing happening now. And God, I can&#39;t wait to see what we could do for the people of toronto like he could pull that off a little bit more i think than say uh you know somebody who&#39;s seen as more of a machiavellian for us more calculating i&#39;ll use jason kenney like if jason kenney came in after endorsing somebody like say jason kenney had endorsed jeremy farkas and then had to work with jody gondek he</span>

I think it&#39;s costed in both in everybody assumes that this is generally where Doug Ford&#39;s going to be.

Number two, it also speaks to, you know, if you were to tell me during the pandemic that Doug Ford would win an election handily and have coattails to even endorse in the city of Toronto thereafter, I&#39;d tell you you were nuts. But here we are, Carter. But give me your political calculus. Fine, fabulous, or fucked for Ford here?

And I think that that&#39;s why he&#39;s chosen to endorse the way he has. I think that he was a late comer to this because he really just doesn&#39;t want Olivia Chow to be the mayor, and he&#39;s trying to stop that. I think that that&#39;s his only calculation. I think he&#39;s coming at it from his own personal bias, his own personal point of view, and we can agree or disagree, but that&#39;s why he&#39;s doing it. Corey?</span>

It seems like it was a noble mission, but not kind of saying it&#39;s over here for the liberals, but Meta saying that this is it. We&#39;re planning to add news access on Facebook and Instagram in response to legislation that would require us to pay news publishers. Fine, fabulous, or fucked for the liberals?

If we start at that end, then you can absolutely not debate Robert Kennedy Jr. It just adds more smoke to the fire. It adds more confusion. And we know of all kinds of psychological effects that happen when we try and do this. Instead of getting people to believe us just because our well-reasoned argument really hit all the boxes, it actually has a backfire effect. It pushes people the wrong direction. And there&#39;s absolutely no reason for us to propel these ideas any further. Yes, at some point, we should try and find a tonic, something that creates remission of this this great epidemic of people believing in conspiracies. But we&#39;re not going to do it on a debate stage, and we&#39;re certainly not going to do it on a debate stage hosted by Joe fucking Rogan. Like, come on.

They clearly have influence over millions of Americans who&#39;ve declined the vaccine. The man himself is a famous figure and already has access to many prominent platforms.

So as someone who&#39;s like, if you&#39;re like advised to strategize on this, and knowing, you know, and being a student of persuasive storytelling, is the answer to just just say, if it&#39;s not a debate, you just let him go do his thing?

You start recapping conversations. You start saying, so if I did this, you agree that we would meet the condition here. So if I managed to prove this thing was not true, Bobby Kennedy Jr., you would agree then that there was a problem with your vaccine argument. And then of course, they won&#39;t want to be pinned down. They&#39;re going to say, well, no, and they&#39;ll move the goalposts and you&#39;ll say, well, hold on. Let&#39;s just all agree on terms here. You do it in paper. You do it in a concrete way. You do it slowly. You don&#39;t give them kind of the flash and chaos that a real-time debate provides them. There are ways to have these conversations without giving them, like, a Joe Rogan-experienced 30-minute flash dance. Like, nobody needs that, okay? Nobody needs that.</span>

It&#39;s not how much do you agree with the following statements. It&#39;s literally there&#39;s a fucking strongly disagree. You don&#39;t have to agree. This is a professional researcher doing professional work in a professional environment. And I was all over the discord on this. Don&#39;t join the fucking discord. Don&#39;t join Patreon. Don&#39;t spend your six dollars because you wind up with these people who followed this. and they all had to have a remedial lesson in the Dunning-Kruger effect because they didn&#39;t know enough to get down off their fucking high horses atop the peak of Mount Stupid. But it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m fine. There&#39;s some great work. Read Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind. Look at his moral foundations. Take a look at the questions. Researchers around the world use these types of questions to really see what&#39;s happening underneath the surface. And if you can&#39;t understand that, read a fucking book.</span>
