            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, vibes. How did they do Stephen Carter? I thought that Mark Carney was boring, which might be good, but I thought he was boring. I thought that Pierre Polyev did fairly well and almost almost to the line of good, very well, but fairly well. And I thought that Jagmeet Singh was was just terrible. Blanchett lived in there somewhere. But when he said he didn&#39;t want to be prime minister, it becomes easy to not really listen to him.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">So Zain, is boring good? What&#39;s your general assessment of how it went last night?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">boring is fine if you&#39;re Carney. It&#39;s absolutely fine. The way I&#39;d analyze Carney&#39;s debate performance, and in fact, this is my wife who kind of said this, and I think it&#39;s absolutely correct, which is he looked less like someone who was actively at a debate and debating others versus the guy that was chairing a debate. All the attacks came to him, and rather than trying to fend them off, he reconciled them. He pretty much said, I like this point. This one is dumb. This one is stupid. Four points. Here&#39;s the solution to all of them, what&#39;s the next question? It looked like what a really experienced board chair would be doing at like a board meeting versus like a candidate debating three other candidates. And you&#39;d think that that would actually be a losing strategy. But in this case, when we&#39;re looking for consensus, unity, someone to lower blood pressure, really not really caring as a country who came up with which idea, when, where, and how, the guy who can kind of say, say, Jagmeet is right. Pierre makes a good point on Iran. I will work with Quebec and then just kind of reconcile and say, this point doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I need to examine it more. That&#39;s actually kind of the vibe Mark Carney has been building as a candidate. And it&#39;s the vibe and energy brought to the debate. So in some ways, he</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">he was boring. In other ways, you could look at what I just said. And if you agree with and say, he just won that debate just by being the guy that reconciled all those things. Now, on pure debate metrics, I think Pierre Polyev was fantastic. I think Pierre Polyev last night was really good. I think he dialed in on his emotional answers. I think he dialed in on his</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">his propositional, what he was going to do. A big criticism of Pierre Polyev was not just vibe and tone, but was like, what the fuck do you stand for? You got to see some clear distinction between him and Carney around what they stood for. What I found fascinating was just if you look at the focus on energy development projects last night, I took, I don&#39;t know, like maybe 40 minutes of the two hours, Carter, between the first segment and then the actual dedicated energy segment. And both men were talking about reaching the same outcome, but I thought were really substantive around how to get there. And I frankly thought Jagmeet was not just entertaining, but quite helpful to his cause to be like, as these two fuckers talk about development projects, are you forgetting about climate change? Are you forgetting about all those things? I thought he was like a positive additive, not a distraction to kind of ground us as Carney and Pierre went down the policy rabbit hole on how you would fast track one approved development projects in this country. So on the overall basis of it, my argument would be Carney chaired a debate effectively well. Pierre debated effectively well. Jagmeet made a case for his cause, which he has not been able to do over the last number of weeks. And let&#39;s not forget, for Jagmeet Singh, it&#39;s about winning two to five percent more back of his voters. It&#39;s not a huge task. It&#39;s a hard task. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not. It&#39;s an easy task, but he needs to win that two to five percent back.</span>

I feel like campaigns have lost the plot on this, right? It was supposed to be one or two things that define a debate. Rachel Notley in 2015 did not clip 25 moments. They found one that they saw a little bit of buzz on and that was it. Do we remember anything else? No. Is that deliberate? Yes. But these campaigns now are trying to throw shit at the wall, which means they&#39;re throwing nothing. It&#39;s like if you have 20 priorities, you have zero priorities. And I think that same lesson applies to when you&#39;re trying to engineer moments.</span>

It should be to say, here&#39;s one fuck-up moment. Mark Carney not knowing that Keystone and TMX are different, throwing out a fucking example, and saying, this actually proves something. It was pretty fucking bad. But the problem is that the CPC have crowded it out with 15 other things.</span>

You and I don&#39;t disagree that we watch for the same reasons. But more and more, those outright like stabbings or falling off a tightrope are not going to happen in these debates. You&#39;ve got to pick your strategy correctly and say, what do I want to amplify to 11 rather than just spray and pray, which is what every campaign seems to be doing.</span>

Because the theory was the Liberal Party goes away, Trudeau loses all his seats, they&#39;re done, and they don&#39;t have a provincial infrastructure across the country, at least a reasonable, robust one like they did 10 years ago, to get back up. You need those provincial infrastructures to get back off the mat. Now we&#39;re talking about a similar reality with the NDP, the saving grace for the NDP, and we&#39;re projecting into the future a bit. But let&#39;s just say they lose party status is that they&#39;ve got decent provincial infrastructures however</span>

And secondly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to give you any long distance lift in the future. So your best bet is to wait, watch the NDP flounder, perhaps disappear at a national level and then become the Alberta Democrats like I&#39;ve suggested 36 different times on this podcast.

            <span class="text">because the case is much more clear cut than it was back for them. But I just think they lacked, frankly, Carter, I think it&#39;s one thing we go back to a point we&#39;ve made often on this podcast, what are political instincts? And you&#39;d expect that the commission would have political instincts. We talk about political instincts at a corporate level, what those look like, how to kind of understand them.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">They just don&#39;t have the political instincts, ironically, for a group organizing a political debate. I think they look at themselves as a democratic institution that is here for broader sort of democratic appeals. They need to be an institution that has a political IQ.</span>

            <span class="text">In this case, I hate to criticize them so aggressively, and I&#39;m just piling on to what many people are saying today, but I want them to succeed, but they need a better political iq than the one that they had that put these debates together on the onstage product i thought was great everything around it was a lot of stuff around it was a ton of bullshit well</span>

            <span class="text">There&#39;s something absolutely to be said by that. And they need a mirror. They need opposition. They need a big guy that they&#39;re fighting against. Establishment media continuing to exist and a liberal government is the recipe for how they exist. Now, I&#39;m not saying that was their strategy going in, but it is clearly what is coming out of this if a if the status quo remains in this election in the next 10 days these</span>

            <span class="text">nothing other than the analogy of Carney being a chair of a debate rather than actually debating I think that was a really wise move on his part it led to a bridge builder United sort of guy who doesn&#39;t have the debate chops but almost didn&#39;t need them in order to win I will be I&#39;ll be thinking about that and saying can can more candidates do that Or does this unique moment just provide Carney, unique moment and unique skill, and frankly, lack of skill in actual contemporary</span>
