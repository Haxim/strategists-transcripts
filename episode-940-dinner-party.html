        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk TVA debate, Liberal platform launch and a messy week in the 2021 federal election. Can the Liberals tie the Conservatives to anti-vax protests? Should the NDP have seen the Liberal endorsement ambush coming? And how many minutes does a Peanut Buster Parfait take off your life? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.

Uh, mainly, uh, as we have tried to talk about the hot dog to hot dog bun ratio, uh, but is it all now moot as we realize that, uh, eating a single hot dog may take 36 minutes off your life. Now, one thing I will say before you jump in, it does not say what eating just a hot dog wiener takes off your life. We don&#39;t know what portion of this is bun and what portion of this is wiener that is eroding life by the minute. So I&#39;ll let you jump in on this first. Two</div>

          <div class="said">Two thoughts. First of all, I think that it&#39;s a good trade-off if I could give up the 36 minutes that I&#39;ve had to spend dealing with people talking about putting their bread in the fridge. If I could get that back, I&#39;d be fine with it. The second thing is, they don&#39;t say when this comes off your life. Here&#39;s the trick. It comes off at the end of your life. So the 36 minutes you&#39;re giving are the 36 minutes you&#39;re going to be sitting in your own shit so it doesn&#39;t even matter right just let it go it doesn&#39;t matter like eat some hot dogs you&#39;re giving up the time where you&#39;re sitting in your own shit and you don&#39;t even know this</div>

I&#39;ll tell people of Canada that if you want a real plan, one that is going to grow our economy, that is going to put us at the front of the competitive green economy of the future, the only option in this election for you is the Liberals, she said. Now, of course, she was misspeaking, and it was an unfortunate gaffe. But Stephen Carter, package moment. What do you think? What do you make of this?

This happened two days ago. Let me explain it to you. Two First Nations leaders from Manitoba endorsed a liberal candidate during running in the provinces north while standing next to NDP leader Jagmeet Singh at a campaign event. Singh and two NDP candidates seeking re-election met with the Manitoba First Nations leaders in Winnipeg last week to discuss some of the pressing issues facing Indigenous communities like housing and mental health. While the chief said they were thankful for Singh and his team organizing the event during a busy election campaign, they said they were backing the Liberal candidate Shirley Robinson over NDP incumbent this is a name Nikki Ashton uh because they want more indigenous voices in Canada&#39;s parliament I want to get your guys&#39;s thoughts on this first as a story overall and then let&#39;s talk about you know I don&#39;t know if we want to talk about like your guys&#39;s tour stories or worst tour gaffes or tour issues that you&#39;ve seen or what the fuck you think happened as soon as Jagmeet Singh got back into the bus and uh and all that sort of jazz but Carter give me your first take and then let&#39;s get into the extrapolation of it thereafter oh</div>

He puts his mask back. I&#39;m painting the picture for those who haven&#39;t seen the clip. And let me tell you something. Seeing the clip, there is no better version of this than seeing the clip. I&#39;ll try to explain it to you. But he puts his mask back on. And then one of the First Nations leaders stands up and says, I&#39;m endorsing, of course, Shirley Robinson. And then the other one comes up and says, I concur, and here&#39;s why. So it keeps digging the knife in deeper. And then as soon as he says concur, the first guy comes back up and he&#39;s like, you know what that guy just said? I concur with that. Almost to like make a point. It was incredibly awkward. Jagmeet Singh is the luckiest man in the world that he had a mask on because I don&#39;t want to see his face. Corey, jump in.</div>

They tend to be more of that nature. I can think of a time when Advance went with the leader that I was working with to a campaign event. And Advance gave me a call while they were being set up and they were running through and they said, like, you cannot put the leader up on this event. Like this is – I&#39;m hearing them run through their script and I&#39;m being deliberately vague here. This is not going to go well. And I said, they&#39;re just getting it out of their system or whatever. And so I didn&#39;t listen to advance. And then the event occurred and it was such a disaster that the reporter on the online version of the story just said, I don&#39;t even know how to explain this.

Trudeau condemns anti-vax protesters, accuses them of endangering others. Liberal leader Justin Trudeau said anti-vaccine protesters that have disrupted some of his Ontario campaign events ought to be condemned and that his chief opponent, Conservative leader Aaron O&#39;Toole, has not done enough to correct those protesters. It was Trudeau&#39;s strongest language yet since one group of protesters forced the party to cancel an event one week from tomorrow, I guess, in Bolton, Ontario. The Bolton protest was followed by a similar one on Sunday in Cambridge, Ontario, as well. Corey, I know you&#39;ve got strong thoughts about this because we talked about prepackaged moments. We talked about roles to play. This is kind of following a theme because this was one of those moments, it&#39;s 90 seconds or so, where you have these protesters, by the way, audibly,</div>

And I felt like this was the first time he actually landed that sort of – yes, you may call it like the caffeinated version or the Bartlett Trudeau version of himself. himself. Sure, you may disagree on the strategy. I was actually praising the execution because it was the first time for me that it landed. Carter, I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts, though. Like, is both from the top line of Trudeau condemning protesters and then this particular moment, and then maybe I&#39;ll spend some time on this with you guys, talking about the politicization of vaccines and vaccine passports, because that&#39;s the true story here that&#39;s kind of come out of this and the wedges that we&#39;re creating out of vaccines. But Carter, first, your thoughts on the moment. Or you could talk about the candidate I managed back in 2012. Either your choice. It&#39;s totally your call. You don&#39;t have to follow any instructions. So</div>

And Corey and I have talked about that a million times. I don&#39;t want to go too deep down it. But this is at least a position that about 75 or 80 percent of the population understands and is connecting with. There is a group of people that, you know, that are really angry about vaccines and masks. That is not a group of people that is part of his voter voter group. It is not a group of people that he cares about offending. And the other side of it is larger than his current voting group. So it actually is a way for him to win votes and look strong and look like the prime minister that we&#39;re expecting to see. So he did that.

And you saw that reflected in some of the tracking polls. And you&#39;ve seen pollsters even who weren&#39;t doing tracking saying, yeah, they could see a receding of the numbers over the weekend. And there was this durability that came and, you know, I&#39;ve heard whispers of the same from some of the campaign pollsters that I&#39;ve been, you know, or campaign pollster adjacent people that I&#39;ve been talking to.

This is actually on top, if I&#39;m not mistaken, of the $100 billion that they promised prior to the election. An 82-page document, no Trudeau in a T-shirt. Key highlights include finishing the fight against COVID, a home for everyone, healthcare, healthcare, healthcare, resilient economy, climate change, accelerating the climate goals, and a focus on reconciliation. What we also saw, Corey, maybe we start here, with some thoughts is a bunch of what you&#39;d expect in a conservative platform, micro-targeted little things for a bunch of different people that I suspect they&#39;re going to be targeting and trying to use as mobilization tactics for various demos and groups as well.

I think it&#39;s the kind of platform that you build after you&#39;ve been involved in government too long. I feel like it is a platform written by bureaucrats, notwithstanding the fact that it was full of all of those targeted elements that you discussed. And actually, that&#39;s not even fair, because bureaucrats wouldn&#39;t have created some of these policies, but it&#39;s a very dry policy book. It was a rough read in that sense. And in</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I thought it was fascinating that they chose to release the, you know, they had the abortion piece in there. And by releasing the platform on that day of the Texas decision to basically allow your neighbors to report on you if you&#39;re an abortion provider or someone seeking an abortion, which is an abomination, by doing that, they managed to overshadow their entire platform with one plank. So instead of just putting out the abortion piece on that day, they put out their entire platform and managed to make it less than the abortion plank. And while I think the abortion plank is important, and I think that there are a lot of people to Corey&#39;s micro-targeting comment, who will find the abortion plank to be very reassuring in a world where we&#39;re seeing the rise of right-wing fundamentalism. While that&#39;s happening, they&#39;ve totally overshadowed themselves. They&#39;ve hurt themselves by putting out their entire platform on a day when no one cared. And it&#39;s going to haunt them because the narrative that&#39;s going to come out of this is, I don&#39;t remember anything from it. I don&#39;t remember anything that&#39;s It&#39;s actually going to impact me, even though apparently Annamie Paul even thinks that this is the best green policy that exists. So I think that I think that they screwed themselves again by being bad tacticians. And I&#39;m watching, you know, I&#39;m watching a campaign being run by the liberals that is only being outdone by the badness of the campaign being run by the NDP.</div>

And if it wasn&#39;t, then you have to say, well, it didn&#39;t really get that kind of juice. I am confused why they decided to release it before the long weekend, just as everybody&#39;s going back to school. I think that if the intention was you&#39;re going to sprint to the finish with this thing and you&#39;re going to try to define the issue, maybe you do a couple of days later. And if it is all just to feed the big machine that is just spitting out wedges that you can then spit out and turn to Canadians via social media that&#39;s targeted, then it should have probably come a little bit earlier. So I guess in that sense, I don&#39;t get the timing. I&#39;m sure that if I were sitting having a beer with liberal strategists, they could make a compelling case as to why this was the timing, right? This is why it needed to be.</div>

And it reminds me of a story from the 93 campaign. I feel like I&#39;ve told on this podcast before. And of course, the more you tell a story like this, the more the details change. So indulge me here. But during that campaign, there was a conversation between liberal pundits and conservative pundits, you know, is the Red Book a good plan? Is the Red Book a bad plan? The conservative pundits said, well, there&#39;s not even a plan for X. And the liberal strategist said, yes, there is. There&#39;s a plan for X on page 212, or</div>

Let me explain to you what you&#39;re doing. So at least when I was on campaigns, Friday mornings were the time that you would meet with all of the campaign managers across the country. It was either Monday or Friday. And in certain cases, Carter, when you ran the provincial, I remember that it was Friday mornings. You guys used to have campaign manager meetings every Friday, huddle up all, in our provincial case, 87 of us, put us on a conference call, and give us some marching orders. The week that was, the week that&#39;s going to happen, because we work on the weekends. There&#39;s no rest, and there&#39;s a bit of a reset. So in</div>

          <div class="said">in those campaign meetings, sometimes you have someone to come in and rally the troops to course correct, because often we know that the message is very much aligned with who&#39;s delivering that message. So here&#39;s what I want you guys to do. I want you to each be on a particular team. Corey, you&#39;re on Team Red. You&#39;re on the Liberal team. Carter, you are on Team Blue. And your task is very simple. You are speaking to all 338, and I guess in the Conservative case, 337 campaigns. campaigns, you&#39;re speaking to the campaign managers. This is a call in the morning. And you are speaking to them in a Pachaca Chow style format almost, Carter. You&#39;re doing, except rather than 20 slides and 20 seconds each, you&#39;re doing three slides and 30 seconds. And on each of these slides, this is an audible medium, this is an audio medium, so people can&#39;t see the slides. But what What you&#39;re preparing is three slides to kind of tell either Team Blue or Team Red about what they should be thinking about as local campaign managers. One heading on each slide, and then you&#39;re speaking for like 15 to 30 seconds on each. And</div>

The Conservative Party, for the first time in recent memory, is owning the ideas. We are owning the images. We are painting a picture in conservatives and non-conservatives heads. heads. This is how we are going to win this campaign, by setting the right ideas in the right images into people&#39;s heads. That is what we are doing. And we are also winning the air war. It is the air war that has been ceded to the liberals in past elections. But that air war has now been won by the Conservative Party. You can see that already. The media are jumping onto our side, even though they don&#39;t like what we normally say. They are jumping over because the The Liberals overreached. So we are winning the air war every day, both in the media and in the advertising markets. That is our strength, this campaign. And the best part is we haven&#39;t even started on the ground game. The ground game is the traditional strength of the Conservative Party. That is why you&#39;re here. 337 campaigns that can hit the ground running with a strength and ferocity that can&#39;t even be matched by the Liberals. And we are winning already before we put a single boot on the ground. When we start our GOTV, when we start our ability to move our voters, we&#39;re going to have the best campaign that&#39;s ever been seen in the history of conservative campaigns.</div>

You find them collapsed near dead at the 10 kilometer mark here. And Aaron O&#39;Toole is a marathon runner who doesn&#39;t know how to pace himself. The O&#39;Toole Conservatives threw everything they possibly could at us in the first two weeks of this campaign. They dropped their platform. They dropped their oppo. They did everything they possibly could besides, oh, no, I&#39;m sorry, they actually did follow around the prime minister with angry protesters as well. They&#39;ve done it all, and none of it is going to work from this point forward because they&#39;ve got nothing left. So let&#39;s</div>

Actually, who are we kidding? It&#39;s a white and white view. It&#39;s this leave it to beaver view of a Canada that never really existed. It ignores all of the pluralism that made us great.

What do, when you guys have done these speeches, whether it be to 87 or 50 or 100 people who are like top dog in their local area, what have they needed to hear? I know you&#39;ve kind of done it in a more specific particular sense, which I loved in this sort of gamey way. But what have they generally needed to hear? Is it generally motivation? Has it been course correction? Has it been that they want to feel like on the inside track? I&#39;m kind of wondering what some of those conference calls on a Friday or a Monday morning kind of sound like these days. And for those that, you know, listening may not have had the pleasure or kind of know what&#39;s happening on those conversations. Corey, I&#39;ll go to you first and then Carter thereafter.</div>

What were your guys&#39; principles on allowing, you know, as much as it was praise and support, latitude for campaigns to kind of do their own thing? You know, being like, you know, having the PM&#39;s picture in my brochures it won&#39;t work here i&#39;ve been doing this for too long like i know what works in my situation you know the you know the template you sent me where we have to do the realtor style shot on our big lawn signs well fuck you we&#39;re doing our own like i&#39;m kind of curious what that experience has been like for those campaigns that might have experienced might have seasoned people that have been there time and time again or just have a freelance streak to them how do you generally control them because i suspect that&#39;s one of the biggest challenges that either the The campaign manager centrally or the deputy campaign manager is putting out those fires and liaising on that constantly.

You&#39;ve got to set your non-negotiables, and then you&#39;ve got to know when to turn a blind eye because probably most of your non-negotiables are negotiable in different contexts, right? Sure. But I try to establish a principle that we&#39;re creating these standards, and there are certain things that you must do, like put data into the central database. You can&#39;t use other databases. basis but beyond those standards if you can show me that you can do something like think of the standards of setting the floor you use these templates because we don&#39;t want everything to look like hot garbage but if</div>

          <div class="said">you can create a version that is not that template but does the same basic job and looks just as polished then i&#39;m good right if if you&#39;re willing to negotiate on that particular thing again it depends on your non-negotiables and um and by setting that sort of framework in advance or defining it in advance you sometimes have a little bit more latitude attitude the thing is campaigns are going to fight with you and we are in an environment now where campaigns have an awful lot more or central campaigns have an awful lot more authority they&#39;ve figured out ways to hold on to the money in ways that wasn&#39;t possible 20</div>

So you can be a little bit more authoritative in those matters. But in parties where you can&#39;t, either because of history or because of current systems, just think about the fact that you are going to lose some fights.

          <div class="said">Andrew Weaver, Tom Mulcair, those are just two of the individuals that have endorsed either implicitly or explicitly the liberal climate platform. You had Weaver come out with a video, you know, talking about how he&#39;s endorsing the liberal plan, how he feels like it&#39;s the only plan that is bold and thoughtful and that he&#39;s impressed with. You had similar comments from Tom Mulcair, which I don&#39;t think he did a video, but I think commentary said something to the extent of it&#39;s like a marvelous plan. So there&#39;s some pretty high praise for it. Question for you there, Carter, starting with you, overrated or underrated endorsements? I don&#39;t want to say in general, because we&#39;ll get to that later on in future episodes. Endorsements for the Liberal climate plan, overrated or underrated by these two individuals?</div>

          <div class="said">I think underrated because they will allow the liberals to put in writings where that vote could make a difference. Splashy quotes on literature that they&#39;re dropping specifically to Green supporters, NDP supporters. I mean, Mulcair can be hit and miss depending on the supporter. But, you know, I can think in particular in some writings in Quebec, perhaps. And it&#39;s something that allows them to execute a strategy you know they want to execute anyways, which is this hurting of the vote in order to, quote unquote, stop the Conservatives or secure a majority. already.</div>
