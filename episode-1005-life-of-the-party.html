How are you reading, whether that be the press conferences, the admission that the Sovereignty Act, you know what, Carter, may not be all that bad by some other candidates, the endorsements, the lack of final push, so to speak, by the other candidates. Stephen Carter, show me your work. Tell me what tea leaves you&#39;re reading and tell me what conclusion you are drawing towards as we head to uh to thursday well</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i mean i think i&#39;m reading the same tea leaves that everybody&#39;s reading right everybody&#39;s everybody&#39;s sucking up to danielle smith we&#39;ve already seen we&#39;ve talked about the people who&#39;ve crossed from one campaign to another including uh you know raj and sani&#39;s campaign chair uh ducking out the side door and running over to embrace danielle um there&#39;s been many people uh you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, I think reading all of those tea leaves are pretty straightforward. It says to us, it says to me, Danielle Smith&#39;s going to win on Thursday. So I jumped right to the prediction. Am I supposed to have done that?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find many pundits. I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find many Conservative Party members, UCP members, who think otherwise. I am not 100% sure how everybody has become so very definitive about it. But if there are a couple of countervailing facts on the table, it&#39;s that the polls that we do have that are a little bit more member-based and a little bit less Danielle Smith campaign-based still</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">still show, well, Danielle Smith is likely to win, is that she&#39;s probably around 40% and she&#39;s going to need a bit of a roll-up as things go. Now, maybe that&#39;s true, maybe that&#39;s not. We have some limited data points on that. but if</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um so yeah you know it&#39;s it&#39;s one of these things that i think everybody is acting very definitively about maybe it will be just a total crushing result uh maybe it becomes self-fulfilling at a certain point i&#39;m</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i&#39;m less convinced like if you ask me to put a bet even money i would say danielle smith probably wins this thing but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is sort of what Stephen was talking about, which is we haven&#39;t seen an exodus of MLA endorsements that were currently with Taves. there&#39;s been relatively few and relatively stable and uh yeah for reasons we&#39;ve talked about a few times it&#39;s a lot harder to switch on somebody once you&#39;re there of course but there is as we&#39;ve discussed a bit of game theory there and there is some value to switching if you think it&#39;s a sure deal and being one of the first switchers rather than one of the last i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And the other 20% was doing it. Exactly. Who did that? Oh, yeah. We were a special team. Hey, here&#39;s how you do the math. Here&#39;s how you do the math. Understand the psychology of not voting for the front runner. So when we have a definitive front runner, or when there&#39;s someone who is in front, it is very easy to vote for that person. It is very hard to switch your ballot to that person afterwards. If you were going to switch your ballot, if you&#39;re going to choose her number two, why wouldn&#39;t you just choose her number one? Right? Like everybody knows that Danielle Smith is going to beat Brian Jean. So why wouldn&#39;t I just choose Danielle Smith first? And so there&#39;s a psychology there of if you&#39;re going to choose the winner, you choose the winner on the first ballot. And if you don&#39;t choose that person, then that person slides down your ballot. So that&#39;s the first piece, the psychology of picking a second choice that&#39;s ahead of you. So generally speaking, that&#39;s just not something that you necessarily do with a front runner candidate. The second part of it is that the person who&#39;s in front tends to win not because of switchers, but because of attrition. And so attrition is when your ballot no longer has a viable candidate on it. So Corey and I both both marked our ballots. We&#39;re going to choose Raj and Sonny, Leela here and Todd Lowen. So those were our three choices. Oh my God, all three of them came off the ballots. One, two, three, but there&#39;s still four more people competing.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They&#39;re no longer given to someone. So that is now an attrition. So you&#39;ve lowered the denominator of what it&#39;s required to get to 50%. So the lowering of the denominator is actually the the primary means by which leaders, you know, the person who&#39;s in first place grows</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">grows their, their percentage. They don&#39;t actually grow their vote. They tend to grow their percentage because of attrition. So because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">because of that, um, if it&#39;s, if it&#39;s under 42, it&#39;s super hard to grow it through enough through attrition alone. Right? So you have to have some sort of vote switch or some sort of vote move. And so 42, 43 seems to be the line where the attrition isn&#39;t enough to get that first base ballot over the line. 47, you could get there after three ballots.</span>

I just don&#39;t have a home. Do you feel like this moment, this opportunity, this ability to upstart behind a leader to create election winning machines that may not be parties, so let&#39;s see a downside there for electors in that in that particular way. But do you see this as hopeful for the voter? Or do you see this as just another transaction piece that the voter has to feel like for a moment that they&#39;ve got some control or see themselves in, but really its purpose is to get you to mark an X and then move on.</span>

Now, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t share Carter&#39;s enthusiasm for new parties because unlike Stephen Carter, I believe in a thing called vote splitting because we use first past the post.

But coalition is a way of saying, I think the name is brilliant because it&#39;s like saying, we&#39;re not asking you to be a partisan.
