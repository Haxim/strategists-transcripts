          <p>Danielle Smith's campaign closeout and predictions for Thursday's Alberta UCP leadership race lead the show. Then the gang turns their attention to the Quebec election and the idea of leader-as-the-party-brand. Plus: BC UNITED.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter give their final predictions on the Alberta UCP leadership race before turning their attention to the Quebec election and the rise (and, in Quebec's case, dominance) of new party brands. Is Danielle Smith destined to win on Thursday? In an era of negative partisanship, does holding onto an old party brand make any sense anymore? And when does Stephen Carter's campaign to draft Kevin O'Leary start? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">And the other 20% was doing it. Exactly. Who did that? Oh, yeah. We were a special team. Hey, here&#39;s how you do the math. Here&#39;s how you do the math. Understand the psychology of not voting for the front runner. So when we have a definitive front runner, or when there&#39;s someone who is in front, it is very easy to vote for that person. It is very hard to switch your ballot to that person afterwards. If you were going to switch your ballot, if you&#39;re going to choose her number two, why wouldn&#39;t you just choose her number one? Right? Like everybody knows that Danielle Smith is going to beat Brian Jean. So why wouldn&#39;t I just choose Danielle Smith first? And so there&#39;s a psychology there of if you&#39;re going to choose the winner, you choose the winner on the first ballot. And if you don&#39;t choose that person, then that person slides down your ballot. So that&#39;s the first piece, the psychology of picking a second choice that&#39;s ahead of you. So generally speaking, that&#39;s just not something that you necessarily do with a front runner candidate. The second part of it is that the person who&#39;s in front tends to win not because of switchers, but because of attrition. And so attrition is when your ballot no longer has a viable candidate on it. So Corey and I both both marked our ballots. We&#39;re going to choose Raj and Sonny, Leela here and Todd Lowen. So those were our three choices. Oh my God, all three of them came off the ballots. One, two, three, but there&#39;s still four more people competing.</div>
