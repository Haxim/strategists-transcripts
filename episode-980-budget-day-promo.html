We then get down to business unpacking the strategic choices politicians make. We make fun of Steven. We talk about our sponsor. We talk about what we would do if we were lucky enough to be in the halls of power making these decisions that no one would ever allow us to make.</span>

Third of all, yes. Yes, you do. You get access to our, wait for it, Discord server. Also, I have no fucking clue what that is. You also get to help me write the show. And yes, I am aware. That means you are doing my job for me. but welcome to the world of capitalism and delegation you&#39;re welcome and</span>

We&#39;re willing to take even more of your money because at $10 a month, you get access to video live streams of our recording. You can watch them in real time or after the fact. It&#39;s really up to you. We don&#39;t really care. We don&#39;t even care if you watch them or not. We just care if you pay us the money.</span>
