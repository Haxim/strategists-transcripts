            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">we saw it coming. I mean, we knew how to read polls and trend lines and we used the data, whatever it took. You know, we&#39;re pros. Yeah, that&#39;s what it is. So what was I building up to there? Oh, yeah, we&#39;re professionals. But listen, the way I want to dissect this campaign is to go back to a technique we used a couple of episodes ago, actually probably more than a dozen episodes ago, to analyze where the parties stood and why they lost. So let&#39;s get into it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s talk about why they lost based on these five metrics that we discussed before. Strategy, execution, leader, timing, or team. So let&#39;s talk about the conservatives first. And once again, I&#39;ll put that out there. Strategy, execution, leader, timing, or team. Give me the one thing that you think that made them lose, And then give me what you think the antidote to that could have been out of the other four that are remaining. Does that make sense to you guys? Does that work? Okay. Yeah. Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first. The Conservative Party, what do you think was their downfall? Strategy, execution, leader, timing, or team?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;d be really easy to pick leader, right? That Harper was weak. Yeah. Harper&#39;s not weak. Harper has won elections in the past. He&#39;s the sitting prime minister. He in and of himself isn&#39;t weak. But if you think back to the elections that the Conservatives have won, they win on simple plans, right? The five reasons you&#39;re going to elect the Conservatives this time, and they didn&#39;t have that. They didn&#39;t have a strategy that said, this is how we&#39;re going to win this election. We&#39;re going to talk about the economy incessantly. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That may have been their strategy, but they stopped that. And instead they started talking about fractious issues like the niqab, which they thought would be like this magic pill that you could take. And then all of a sudden the election would be won. So the strategy was off because I think the leader question,</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the weak link like all the post-analysis is happening right now. It was all Harper&#39;s fault. You know, that&#39;s just crap. It wasn&#39;t all Harper&#39;s fault. It was the lack of a strategy, and every conservative can point to that. So,</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it was absolutely all the leader&#39;s fault. I don&#39;t know what Stephen&#39;s talking about because in that party, leader and strategy are one. Leader and tactics are one. There is no divide between the conservatives and Harper. That&#39;s a fair point. That&#39;s a fair point. It was strategy. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But ultimately, they got to the place where they were in strategy because of bad strategic decisions in the years coming up to this. Look, that was a weak bench. We all knew it was a weak bench. Hold</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">I want to highlight that point. You do not think this was strategy exclusive to the last 11 weeks. You think this was a combination of things.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, they made their bed. Okay. But let&#39;s talk about the strategy specifically during this campaign because that was a real failing for them. They called a 78-day campaign because they thought that would give them the strategic edge. Well, that backfired big time. They started trying to do that issue a day talk that they&#39;d always run a 35-day</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">-day campaign through. But guess what? what, you can&#39;t do that for 78 days. And that&#39;s not what this election was about. As we were saying since day one, that didn&#39;t work. Then they got pushed really far off message by the Syrian refugees. And their decision at that point was to throw out the message of day strategy and go hard on this kind of fearful, hateful message. That was a huge miss. And then finally, at the end of the day, they forgot who their voting blocks were. And they threw out all of these individuals that they had built coalitions with, you know, new Canadians over the years in a desperate attempt attempt to hold on to power which they failed to do when you start looking at the results immigrant majority and you know immigrant strong plurality writings across canada they got killed in interesting absolutely</span>

So, Carter, for the longest time, even when we did this episode, I think it was 539, when we initially threw in these magic pills. if you could take one of them, which one would you take? And you were confident that the conservatives, the best thing they had going for them, even outside a leader, was strategy. They were solid on their strategy. They didn&#39;t need to change it. Yet it became their failing today. Explain that to me. How does that happen within a campaign? How do you have the strategic edge for a decade and lose it in the red period? You forget where you came from.</span>

So you slip a little bit on your base because, I mean, there are people who voted conservative in the last election who voted liberal this time. We saw it a lot, actually, here in Calgary, where we saw a lot of voters or first-time voters who moved to the conservatives, or I&#39;m sorry, moved to the liberals from the conservatives because of things like the NACAB.</span>
