        <p>Trudeau has resigned. The Liberal leadership contenders lurch towards the starting line. And during this time of intrigue and danger, Donald Trump crosses some big red lines, with threats of more to come.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Prime Minister's resignation, the soon-to-be-set Liberal leadership rules and Donald Trump's threat to use economic force to annex Canada. Has Justin Trudeau left Canada in "the worst possible position"? Would it be so bad if it cost $500,000 to enter the Liberal leadership speed run? And who's excited to see how Doug Ford spends billions of dollars to mess up Trump's weekend? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Or should we move to the candidates and the rules which will come out? Because I want to give you guys an opportunity in the 24 hours or less that we have to make your public appeal in terms of what the rules should be. Now, we&#39;ve had an episode, Patreon, and then we released it to the public talking about the rules. But those were in speculation, not necessarily knowing the time. We have a better sense of time. Prorogation, March 24th. We now know how much time we actually have. I want to talk about rules. But before we do that, Carter, anything for you on the PM and his resignation before we go there? And then Corey, I&#39;ll ask you the same thing.</div>

If it doesn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t have the buzz anyways. I&#39;m not going to do it. I won&#39;t be able to beat Carney. I won&#39;t be able to beat Freeland. I think that&#39;s all possible.

The premiers have already planned a trip in February where they&#39;re going to work their networks of Congress people and senators and other legislators to talk about this, and I believe government officials as well.
