Garnet Genuis, I believe it was yesterday stands up uh in the house um and starts using uh queen while while asking justin trudeau about inflation i say queen the band right he uses lyrics for bohemian rhapsody he tries to make like a quasi connection to inflation bohemian rhapsody the best thing to say is go find it online uh it&#39;s interesting for two reasons number one to see the amount of conviction Garnet Genuis has, and I know Garnet, Alberta MP. He&#39;s been like this since he was a teenager. This is exactly who he is. He has always been. This is the same guy, by the way, who&#39;s released a book that you can find on Amazon, which is his features of first year as an MP. It&#39;s an exhilarating read.</span>

That puts you into an even smaller sort of cocoon where you&#39;re getting, you know, high fives virtually and perhaps in person for your actions.

And often that&#39;s why you see if you&#39;re getting asked to donate, some of the reasons why the dollar amounts are so low, number one, it&#39;s to make it accessible. But number two, it&#39;s the psychology of saying that even a couple of bucks keeps you around around longer, keeps you more loyal, keeps you around for the roller coaster because it&#39;s an emotional attachment to the campaign or the leader or the advocacy mission, less so a strict logical one, even though you may have started where you may have thought it was a rational connection with a campaign about food security. But now it&#39;s one that you have to see succeed. And</span>

What What can the other side do to get them from you? And we know that dollars, especially donated dollars, even in the smallest amount, kind of turn something that might seem rational into something that is now significantly more emotional in terms of the type of connection.</span>
