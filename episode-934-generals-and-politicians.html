Well, they knew that they were behind the times, of course. This definitely seems like it is on par. Corey Hogan, anti-vaxxers finding the wrong address for the BBC, does</span>

            <span class="text">no that was excellent we&#39;ll give you another shot at this. Let&#39;s go for our next headline from Fortune magazine. Cleveland Indians&#39; new name and website domain is already taken. That is right. I talked about this last week. You guys had zero thoughts on the Cleveland Guardians, which was correct and apt. But officials at Cleveland&#39;s Major League Baseball team didn&#39;t do their homework when changing their team&#39;s name last month. They announced that they would no longer be the Cleveland Indians, would now be be the Cleveland Guardians. One problem, Corey, a male roller derby team in that city has been using the Guardians for the past decade, and it owns the website and is not willing to give it up from a branding and communications and frankly, sport strategy perspective. Please, your thoughts.</span>

In fact, if you were to go through all of your favorite sports teams, I think you would see that there&#39;s an awful lot with some pretty damn janky URLs. It doesn&#39;t really matter that much. And ultimately, I feel like the Guardians, the</span>

Saskatchewan man charged after flying helicopter to Dairy Queen to buy an ice cream cake, say the RCMP. A customer&#39;s unusual arrival at a Saskatchewan Dairy Queen has resulted in a criminal charge. Around 5 p.m. on July 31st, the RCMP received a complaint that a helicopter had landed in a high traffic parking lot in the community. According to a news release, the aircraft, quote, blew up dust and debris, unquote, in an area that includes a school and aquatic center. RCMP said a passenger had climbed out of the helicopter and bought an ice cream cake. Stephen Carter, how was the ice cream cake?</span>

The source said that changes previously scheduled to go into effect on August 16th, only a couple of days from now, will not be implemented at this time, but the changes are scheduled, the changes scheduled, I should say, for August 31st are still on track. Dr. Dina Hinshaw, Alberta&#39;s Chief Medical Officer of Health, is scheduled to speak alongside the Education Minister on Friday morning, we record on Thursday evening, to provide an update on the back-to-school guidance and the ongoing work to protect public health in Alberta schools, unquote.

And to be honest, I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about what Corey talked about, I think, two weeks ago when he said what they should have been doing is resetting what the measures of success would look like. Because they didn&#39;t do that, the number of cases continues to be the primary driver. Now, I will say hospitalizations and intensive care unit hospitalizations are also going up, which is very concerning. But had they reset from the number of cases to the number of acute cases, they wouldn&#39;t necessarily be in as much trouble as they&#39;re in today.</span>

That&#39;s the media&#39;s job. That&#39;s not the official opposition&#39;s job. And even if they wanted to do it, there are ways you do it where you just say, hearing strong rumors, this, blah, blah, blah, not essentially holding a press conference of the government&#39;s own.

            <span class="text">Well, because it&#39;s not a game. And this is supposed to be serious stuff. And you&#39;re trying to win points on a scorecard that doesn&#39;t matter. Ultimately, this is the kind of shit that gets It&#39;s people like you and me talking. Even Stephen Carter might arouse from a slumber to have an opinion on it. But it&#39;s not the kind of thing that moves votes. It&#39;s really not. And in fact, it can be quite off-putting to people because it just seems like games, right? Why does it matter? Who cares? And so I think that the time would have been better spent perhaps getting ready to have the most killer response rather than the fastest response, because fastest doesn&#39;t matter for breaking government news like this, if you&#39;re the official.

            <span class="text">Have you seen anything like this before, Corey? And Carter, I&#39;m going to expand it to you, too, where there&#39;s trickles of it in the media. The media is reporting that sources say, and then an opposition party just pounces on it and saying, here&#39;s what we&#39;ve heard, here&#39;s what&#39;s happening, almost like they&#39;re breaking the news. I can&#39;t recall, but I&#39;m curious if either of you have historically seen this, whether it be in our province or in our country writ large.</span>

            <span class="text">can&#39;t think of a specific instance, Zane, but I am quite sure that I have seen it happen. And it&#39;s the kind of thing that when you are in a political party office or a caucus actually seems like it&#39;s a win because</span>

I&#39;m sure they thought this is an awful lot of fun, but it doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t matter at all. And certainly, I think that the things that do matter, you would be better positioned to do well on if you had taken the time and used it differently. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m curious to get your take on this, because can I give you guys my take of the reading, which is probably a little bit more pedestrian in the sense of saying, okay, this is the NDs trying to box the UCPN. They have hearing sources, and they&#39;re trying to crystallize it and calcify it and ensure that there&#39;s no way that they can get out of it. Carter, what are your thoughts? Lay it on me.

            <span class="text">Demand that it actually happen. Demand that the numbers today drive a more comprehensive outcome. demand that they that they extend these for at least six more weeks uh so then when they announce the six weeks tomorrow it&#39;s like see we demanded it now it actually happened um or you know so set a pre-trap and then once they&#39;ve done it or set something that they can&#39;t possibly attain that makes their six weeks look like it&#39;s not the right choice right but by simply announcing look what&#39;s going to happen tomorrow that they&#39;re going to do all you&#39;ve done is is scoop them that&#39;s the the media&#39;s job, to Corey&#39;s point. That&#39;s not your job. Your job is to win politically, not to win informationally.</span>

And it&#39;s I mean, decisions in government don&#39;t happen in eight hours, so it&#39;s often kind of silly when it occurs. But if anything, I think, Zane, this reverse box, I mean, this gives an incentive to the government not to do it and then say, what the hell was the NDP talking? You can&#39;t trust them. They&#39;re flaky on this. They&#39;re just being followed around by rumors that are being thrown out in the Twitter sphere. And I don&#39;t know. I mean, how would that box you in if you&#39;re the government? If anything, it creates an opportunity to make your opponent look foolish by not doing what they&#39;re saying you&#39;re about to do.

If this is true, if everything we&#39;ve heard reporting is true, and there&#39;s still that caveat, although there&#39;s increasingly firm government sourcing on the media side. So good reason to believe it&#39;s true.</span>

Because, again, as the government, you&#39;ve got to be much more worried about the outcomes that you&#39;re trying to drive with the policy. That was probably a bit of a bit of a conversation at cabinet. So you&#39;re not going to just say, no, screw it, because I want to make David</span>

And one could argue that the only two times that we&#39;ve seen this type of sustained protest in Alberta would be Jim Prentice&#39;s Bill 11 around Bill 10. Bill 10. Was it Bill 10?

You&#39;re helping script the tone and a skeleton of the message tomorrow for the education minister, of course, downloaded by the premier&#39;s office. What&#39;s the tone and kind of what are you you saying uh for your backtrack tomorrow how are you how are you stick handling something like this and are there any tenets of political strategy that would be important to consider uh when you do backtrack because</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">because we always talk about the double down we rarely talk about how you do a really good backtrack or how you do a really good off-ramp so to speak so i&#39;m curious uh to hear if you&#39;ve got any thoughts on that yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean the first thing i would do if i was doing this is i I would make it look like it&#39;s not a backtrack. You know, we were always going to be evaluating what was going to be happening prior to the school year. We&#39;re going to keep pushing for vaccinations. We&#39;re going to make sure that vaccinations occur. We were never going to just waltz into the school year with everything just, you know, we were aware that children between zero and 11 were not being vaccinated. We understood that. We weren&#39;t going to just run into Corey&#39;s burning building. We had a good plan. And unfortunately, this plan has been undone by the number, just the sheer volume of people who are refusing to get vaccinated. We will double down on our vaccination efforts. But this is their fault, not ours. And that&#39;s probably the tone that I would take is that we&#39;re not actually backtracking at all. We want things to be open. In fact, all they&#39;re doing is reinstating some of the testing stuff. You know, you got to still quarantine. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re saying, you know what, let&#39;s get back to some of the masking things. No, they&#39;re not doing any of that. They&#39;re just they&#39;re just not stopping testing. They&#39;re just not stopping reporting the numbers. That&#39;s it. Everything else. You can still walk into a store unmasked here, man. Like it&#39;s not a big backtrack. Not at all.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, how do you position a reversal, of course, an off-ramp, a backtrack, whatever you want to call it? What are some lessons here that a political party or political leader should consider? And what do you, to your introducing of the topic, expect the message and the tone to be tomorrow? And how would you script it? Should you be advising a minister of education?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We listen to our experts. We still believe the experts are correct here. This is a pause to illustrate that this plan will work because testing will continue and Albertans can see those numbers decline. Now, it&#39;s really unfortunate that the federal government has decided to make this a political football and attack Alberta and rattle confidence in the province of Alberta, taking actions that are hurting our economy, taking actions that are hurting our people who are having these concerns brought on to them by these groups that are just trying to make a point and win some political scores here. We are a science-driven. And jurisdictions like Germany are ending their public testing. They&#39;re following our lead. But Justin Trudeau would rather hurt our province, rattle confidence, and wreck kind of the public psyche here just in service of trying to win a couple of other seats in Quebec. It&#39;s absolutely outrageous, but we&#39;re out. We are not going to allow ourselves to be a football during this ill-conceived federal election that we know is coming. Nicely</span>

This is what I&#39;m really fascinated about because I&#39;m sure different strokes for different folks applies, but there&#39;s probably some conventional wisdom in terms of as we move from political strategy to our sweet spot, campaign strategy what are people doing to to put their campaigns together right now like what exactly is happening so we&#39;ll go through i&#39;ll try to go through it in terms of like order but carter i want your thoughts first of all give me overarching right thursday night to sunday everyone now knows we were expecting it for a long time it&#39;s been telegraphed for everyone that was going to happen last sunday or this sunday but now that it&#39;s real it&#39;s clicked into focus what are some of the high level things that that that each um each political party perhaps perhaps even agnostic of their partisanship, is thinking of right now? And then, Corey, same question to you, and then let&#39;s dig deeper on a bunch of stuff.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Every single campaign has got two things going right now that they&#39;ve been working on. And we&#39;ve actually been seeing some of these things. The first is the proactive messaging structure, right? So what is it that we want to be talking about on any given day? And they&#39;ve now mapped out their message board for the 36 days of the campaign. In fact, they&#39;ve been mapped out for they probably did a 50 day, 60 day message board where they could start the RIT, so</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So they know exactly what they were saying prior to the RIT. They know exactly what they&#39;re going to say.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You know, like the fact that this leaked today through Reuters, that wasn&#39;t a big scoop from Reuters. Someone in the liberal campaign said, you know, we should do we should make sure that three days before we actually drop the RIT. Yeah. People are prepared mentally for the RIT to drop. We do not want this to be a surprise. eyes right if this is a surprise then this is gonna this this will take us off of our message of that particular day and that particular day&#39;s proactive message is blank whatever they want it to be and i imagine that it is we need a new mandate for uh economic recovery post-pandemic rather than the amazing spectacular pandemic response that we&#39;ve managed up to this point um so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so that that&#39;s the first piece is the proactive then the second thing and i think we&#39;ve seen evidence of this in play as well, is the reactive messaging. The war rooms are all up and running for each of these parties. They&#39;ve got their top 15 to 20 media professionals all sitting in a room. They&#39;ve assigned out desks. They&#39;ve got the phone calls from each of the regions. Each region has a reporting structure to make sure that the HQ knows what&#39;s happening in each of the areas. areas those professionals have been working 12 hour days for the last week and a half anyways doing</span>

So we&#39;ve seen that in the podcast already. We&#39;ve talked about that in the podcast. And those reactive pieces are ramping up. And the third thing, and I don&#39;t want to get into any detail on it, because it&#39;s a totally different thing. And that is the actual logistics of a 36 day election campaign and tour. That&#39;s all written. Of course, there&#39;ll be variants, there&#39;ll be variations. And the plan will change every every election professional knows that the plan will change but that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t already have your 36 day logistics schedule and your logistics captains all ready to go because i&#39;ll tell you something we&#39;re all going to be shocked when the airplanes roll out of the hangar and there&#39;s a conservative airplane and there&#39;s a liberal airplane and</span>

You can&#39;t believe it&#39;s here. There&#39;s never enough time. You start thinking about the things that you&#39;ve decided to do. You second guess so many decisions. You&#39;re making these revisions like it&#39;s a wedding seating plan on your kind of message board. board, weekly themes, daily themes. Maybe we put this one first. Maybe we put this one second. Maybe this is stronger in week two than it is in week three. You&#39;re blocking out where your oppo hits come if you&#39;ve got them ready to go. And you&#39;ve got the plan and you&#39;re ready and you&#39;ve got the plan and you think this is what you&#39;re going to do for the next 36 days. But you know it&#39;s not, right?</span>

            <span class="text">right? That&#39;s the thing. If you&#39;ve done even one campaign, you know it won&#39;t work. It never does. With apologies to Harold McMillan, you know, what knocks campaigns off of course. Events, dear boy, events, right? Things happen, and then you have to react to them. And then you&#39;re all of a sudden saying, do I react to this thing? Or do I try to stay on my message box? And how do I make this about my message box? And sometimes there&#39;s inelegant fits. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll talk more about that along the way. The other thing I want to say is, generals and politicians are always fighting the last war.</span>

            <span class="text">do to make make sure we didn&#39;t find ourselves in a similar situation and you&#39;re almost running the scenario test, but using the data sets you have, which are previous campaigns. And, and so you, you do tend to think a lot about like</span>

And, you know, again, you know, the situation&#39;s not going to be the same, but you&#39;re, you want to make sure you&#39;re more durable than the previous campaign, whether you were the person who won the campaign before or the person who lost the campaign. And then what Carter said is really important. they are testing systems right or they should be somebody has to hit send on a press release through campaign tools for the first time in years yeah i remember we talked about this in 2015 because there was some sort of uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and it&#39;s really important to test the system uh and and both of those things need to happen because what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re switching off of all of your existing government paid systems and then they they kind of shift into something completely different yeah and so that that has to be completely rethought and tested all the way through and the plan itself everybody knows it&#39;s not going to happen the way you wrote it down, but you still have to have that written down. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the reason why is the plan is about the exercise. It&#39;s the thinking that goes into it. It&#39;s the processes where you identify the issues that you are strong on, you identify the issues they are weak on, and all of that rigor that informs a plan, that&#39;s the important part in many ways. I say it all the time, but good strategy comes from good analysis. And the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the analysis that you have to do, even if the strategy ends up changing because of all of the various events. That&#39;s durable product. That&#39;s useful things to have at hand. And it gets your team ready. You know, if they have to build a plan and then rebuild a plan and then rebuild a plan and then rebuild a plan and then rebuild a plan and then rebuild a plan, when they have to rebuild the plan, they&#39;re going to be ready to do so. Right,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right, right. And so that iterative exercise matters. Carter, you guys both talked about government to campaign, both from a technology technology perspective. I want to talk about that in a second. But before I get into that, talk to me about, bring me inside. If I&#39;m someone listening to this show who&#39;s never seen what is quote-unquote scripted in a political campaign, tell me what sort of elemental things are scripted. And I think there&#39;s a few things that are obvious. Policy, logistics, who&#39;s going to be where, where the leader is going to be at certain times. What other things that might surprise people are scripted? I assume oppo research and timeliness of that are scripted. Is the whole story of the campaign scripted in a sense where it says if we hit this oppo piece, we hit this oppo piece, it means this and they&#39;re going to say this and they – bring me into it a bit.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Change all the way. But the story is the most important part. I think Stephen and I would both agree as him as a current campaign practitioner, me as a former campaign practitioner, nothing is more important than story because we&#39;ve talked about it all of the time. You are trying ultimately to establish a ballot question. You want a narrative in somebody&#39;s mind when they go to the poll and say, this is what this election is about. And by defining that question, you define the answer, right? If you&#39;re worried about issue X, conservatives. Issue Y, NDP. Issue Z, liberals. And you set that question if you&#39;ve got a successful campaign. But then you break the story into themes. Those themes become your weeks, in all likelihood. It doesn&#39;t have to be. It&#39;s kind of arbitrary. And within those themes, you have individual announcements or events. And those become your set pieces. And you&#39;re able to move those around within your theme weeks relatively effortlessly. Within all of that, you also then have the oppo and the way you&#39;re trying to knock them off of their theme weeks. And Carter, you&#39;re trying to jump in, so I&#39;ll stop there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Everything is scripted and everything has to fit. And the trick is, so I work on an awful lot of character development for the opposition, right? So what is the brand or the character positioning that I want the opposition to occupy? And then how do I write that into my stories? Because the stories that we&#39;re writing, I like to think of it like a very long novel, right? Right. And so the 36 day campaign structure is 36 chapters and you&#39;re going to have 36 scenes. You know, so within each of those, there&#39;s so you&#39;re doing three events a day. Right. So there&#39;s three different scenes a day. Inside of those scenes, you have the characters. Right. You have a character of yourself. How much do I want to spend exploring the character of Justin Trudeau? How much time do I want to spend exploring the character of Jagmeet Singh? thing? How much do I want to explore Aaron O&#39;Toole? And you can put into your script how much time you wish to expose those people to. So I&#39;m in the middle of a campaign right now. We&#39;re not doing any character exploration of our opposition right now. We could do character exploration, but the opportunity hasn&#39;t written itself into our script. So you don&#39;t just jump into it just because you think to yourself, you know, I haven&#39;t talked about Aaron O&#39;Toole for a while. You only talk about Aaron O&#39;Toole in the context of the chapter that you&#39;re writing, right? So So all of these stories have to tie together. So at the end of it, the 36 days reads like an actual planned novel. And the interesting part about it is some pieces were planned. Sometimes you know that on the 11th to last day, you&#39;re going to do Lake of Fire. But more often than not, you don&#39;t know that on the 11th to last day, Lake of Fire is going to be there. But if you&#39;ve done your work properly, when Lake of Fire happens, it&#39;s exactly the character expectation that your primary audience has and that character expert expectation is all the work that you did prior to the 11th last day right</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s jump into the stress testing of systems. What sort of stress testing are you generally doing? And then let&#39;s talk about also, you know, this transition between governance and campaigning. One of the things we&#39;ve seen in the past is certain leaders and teams, not just on a systems basis, but on like a cadence tone basis, kind of still feel like they&#39;re governing in the first days of a writ period. They still feel like they&#39;re in almost like either premier or prime minister mode, not leader of the party mode. So talk about how you kind of prime and test all of those things, heading into a pretty short election period and making sure you&#39;re you&#39;re ready on day one yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah realistically one of the best ways that you&#39;re able to provide that continuity is that the staff that you had who were either government staffers or caucus staffers if you&#39;re the opposition or you know working in the olo they take leaves they go on vacation whatever and then they go and they do the exact same function for the campaign so you the the media spokespeople are the media spokespeople and the</span>

You&#39;re used to things. You use certain tools. All of a sudden, you&#39;ve got to use different tools. You don&#39;t have the same tools available. You&#39;ve got to make sure you&#39;re able to work the same workflows. You&#39;ve got to put out news releases over the wire, maybe differently. Maybe you&#39;re using the same service. Depends on how you&#39;re doing it right now, right? And what you want to do is you just want to make sure all of them are working. You don&#39;t want the first time you hit send on an email to continue to use this example to be when it really matters. You want to have some other examples there. You want to make sure all of the phones are there. You want to to have people go through it and and um sort of vet that everything is occurring uh you know with the right phone numbers on it and everything as you&#39;re going through i mean in many ways zane it&#39;s like setting up any office you&#39;ve got to go through the checklist of of things big and small as small as where do i get pens yeah and as big as um how</span>

Is it different? Maybe I&#39;ll ask you that question. Is it different than the muscle that they&#39;ve been using perhaps prior to a rip being dropped and a full-on campaign being on? And how do you ensure and how do you stress test your candidate, your leader, your chief spokesperson to ensure that they&#39;re at the top of their game on day one well</span>

            <span class="text">well first of all it is different uh it has similar elements right because uh you know you have question period every day when you&#39;re in the house of commons and that feels like it&#39;s very much um you know the theater it&#39;s not uh it&#39;s totally different because the audience is different right so you know i came up studying theater and and one of the things we learned very quickly in theater is that the the the venue matters right Right. If you try and do a black box theater and in a giant, you know, Broadway style theater, Presidium Arts Theater, it won&#39;t work because the space is different. And one of the things that I fear with with elections is that everybody just thinks that what they&#39;re doing is moving the House of Commons outside.</span>

It&#39;s about putting aside the pageantry and the theater of the metapolitics that we all get so absorbed in. We start talking about things like who scooped whom on the release of news from the government.

People, when they start to pay attention differently, it changes the show, right? So the Super Bowl is different than every other football game, but it&#39;s still the exact same football game. Oh, that&#39;s a good analogy. So if you know that the Super Bowl is different, what is it that makes it different? And what pageantry and changes do you add that actually makes it work, right? So every once in a while, you got to rip off Janet Jackson&#39;s costume and show a little bit of nipple. That&#39;s what makes it all work, right? So, no, that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">I, Carter, I want to come to you, but I know the answer to this next question I&#39;m going to ask Corey from your perspective, or at least I think I do. So I&#39;m going to ask Corey for it. Corey, you know, from a strategy perspective and transparency on strategy, if you were the national campaign director for a campaign this weekend, you had your call, let&#39;s say, Saturday morning, right? Saturday morning, 9am Eastern, every campaign manager in the country dials in. How open source are you with our campaign strategy, with the party&#39;s campaign strategy? Because I think I know Carter&#39;s answer to this, which is why I&#39;m asking you, what&#39;s your approach as it relates to, hey, here&#39;s what we&#39;ve scripted, here&#39;s our story? Now, you could go in varying degrees of it, but how are you kind of getting buy-in from a group of people across the country, decentralized, leading up, knowing that they&#39;ve still got disproportionate skin in the game? I&#39;m kind of curious how you would lead into that. Carter, I&#39;ll ask you too, but I want to go to Corey first on this. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So there&#39;s two things, right? I talked about generals and politicians are always fighting the last war. We&#39;ve talked about the military metaphors. It&#39;s called a campaign, for fuck&#39;s sake. It&#39;s because it is a bit more command and control. So you&#39;re not necessarily under any kind of requirement to share all of this information down. It&#39;s go do your thing, we&#39;ll do our thing. Now, obviously,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">obviously, in a modern campaign, and I think even if you were Patton back in the day, you&#39;re not going to run entirely like that. You want to build a sense of camaraderie amongst people. You want to give people a sense they&#39;re on the inside. There are things, frankly, that make people feel like they&#39;re on the inside that it would be great if they were run on the front page of the Globe and Mail. This is what this campaign is all about. Rah,</span>

And I&#39;m, I&#39;m way more open than Corey, but I&#39;m, I agree with him that you&#39;re not telling everybody when you&#39;re going to drop the oppo piece, right? But you do need to make sure that everybody understands your core messages. Everybody understands the brand structure you&#39;re trying to create. Who is, who are we? What are we talking about? When are we talking about it? How do we respond to things? You know, are we the conservative party and we never send our candidates in into a debate? Or are we, you know, are we going to say yes to all the debates? Like, there should be some sort of big strategic, you know, strokes on the painting that everybody knows where they are. Everybody operates the exact same way because that&#39;s how you&#39;re going to be able to build the brand, frankly,</span>

Lunch Day matters an awful lot more for Aaron O&#39;Toole than it does Justin Trudeau, because for Aaron O&#39;Toole, it will be an introduction to a great number of Canadians who don&#39;t know him.

            <span class="text">It&#39;s not going to have the same kind of effect that it would necessarily on somebody who&#39;s new. Similarly, if there&#39;s a sense that there&#39;s a campaign that can&#39;t shoot straight, and they don&#39;t shoot straight, that will reinforce narrative. So it&#39;s going to have a different answer depending on who you are and where you are in the overall political conversation. But by and large, I think launch day is pretty important. I think it&#39;s important because it establishes so many of the themes that in theory you are going to carry throughout the election you want to be able to hear them coming through clear as a bell and it&#39;s also important because it&#39;s when your team has to start moving and if you have a campaigns take a while to ramp up don&#39;t kid yourself they there are hiccups galore and you only see a few of them from the public point of view but there&#39;s there&#39;s all sorts of troubles occurring uh there&#39;ll be somebody who&#39;s texting and they&#39;ll realize four days later they were texting the government phone that that person previously had, not the actual phone, and they haven&#39;t seen these texts. I mean, this shit happens.</span>

The bones of the house are good. If you have problems with that, you&#39;ve got problems. If it&#39;s just the regular stuff, it&#39;s the shakedown stuff, okay, manage it. That&#39;s what managers do. Managers managers manage. But in that sense, the launch matters.</span>

            <span class="text">Not a single vote is cast on election day because of the launch day success or failure, But a launch to a success or failure determines the overall success of the campaign. So that is a gobbledygook answer that just tells us that where we&#39;re going, if you can&#39;t launch properly, you&#39;re probably not going to campaign properly. But just because you launch well doesn&#39;t mean that the entire campaign is just going to unfold for you like the yellow brick road. It just doesn&#39;t work that way.</span>

Now, there&#39;s a longer campaign, and maybe you could make the case that in a shorter situation, he wouldn&#39;t have been able to pull it off.
