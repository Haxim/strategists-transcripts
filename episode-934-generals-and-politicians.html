Cleveland Indians&#39; new name and website domain is already taken. That is right. I talked about this last week. You guys had zero thoughts on the Cleveland Guardians, which was correct and apt. But officials at Cleveland&#39;s Major League Baseball team didn&#39;t do their homework when changing their team&#39;s name last month. They announced that they would no longer be the Cleveland Indians, would now be be the Cleveland Guardians. One problem, Corey, a male roller derby team in that city has been using the Guardians for the past decade, and it owns the website and is not willing to give it up from a branding and communications and frankly, sport strategy perspective. Please, your thoughts.</div>

According to a news release, the aircraft, quote, blew up dust and debris, unquote, in an area that includes a school and aquatic center. RCMP said a passenger had climbed out of the helicopter and bought an ice cream cake. Stephen Carter, how was the ice cream cake?</div>

The source said that changes previously scheduled to go into effect on August 16th, only a couple of days from now, will not be implemented at this time, but the changes are scheduled, the changes scheduled, I should say, for August 31st are still on track. Dr. Dina Hinshaw, Alberta&#39;s Chief Medical Officer of Health, is scheduled to speak alongside the Education Minister on Friday morning, we record on Thursday evening, to provide an update on the back-to-school guidance and the ongoing work to protect public health in Alberta schools, unquote.

Now, I will say hospitalizations and intensive care unit hospitalizations are also going up, which is very concerning. But had they reset from the number of cases to the number of acute cases, they wouldn&#39;t necessarily be in as much trouble as they&#39;re in today.</div>

And that will be interesting to see the ramifications of, because certainly the government has said this was advice from the health professionals, right? They were very cool to say that. That was actually the trigger to my text to you all on August 2nd,</div>

You&#39;re helping script the tone and a skeleton of the message tomorrow for the education minister, of course, downloaded by the premier&#39;s office. What&#39;s the tone and kind of what are you you saying uh for your backtrack tomorrow how are you how are you stick handling something like this and are there any tenets of political strategy that would be important to consider uh when you do backtrack because</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">yeah i mean the first thing i would do if i was doing this is i I would make it look like it&#39;s not a backtrack. You know, we were always going to be evaluating what was going to be happening prior to the school year. We&#39;re going to keep pushing for vaccinations. We&#39;re going to make sure that vaccinations occur. We were never going to just waltz into the school year with everything just, you know, we were aware that children between zero and 11 were not being vaccinated. We understood that. We weren&#39;t going to just run into Corey&#39;s burning building. We had a good plan. And unfortunately, this plan has been undone by the number, just the sheer volume of people who are refusing to get vaccinated. We will double down on our vaccination efforts. But this is their fault, not ours. And that&#39;s probably the tone that I would take is that we&#39;re not actually backtracking at all. We want things to be open. In fact, all they&#39;re doing is reinstating some of the testing stuff. You know, you got to still quarantine. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re saying, you know what, let&#39;s get back to some of the masking things. No, they&#39;re not doing any of that. They&#39;re just they&#39;re just not stopping testing. They&#39;re just not stopping reporting the numbers. That&#39;s it. Everything else. You can still walk into a store unmasked here, man. Like it&#39;s not a big backtrack. Not at all.</div>

What are some lessons here that a political party or political leader should consider? And what do you, to your introducing of the topic, expect the message and the tone to be tomorrow? And how would you script it? Should you be advising a minister of education?</div>

          <div class="said">We listen to our experts. We still believe the experts are correct here. This is a pause to illustrate that this plan will work because testing will continue and Albertans can see those numbers decline. Now, it&#39;s really unfortunate that the federal government has decided to make this a political football and attack Alberta and rattle confidence in the province of Alberta, taking actions that are hurting our economy, taking actions that are hurting our people who are having these concerns brought on to them by these groups that are just trying to make a point and win some political scores here. We are a science-driven. And jurisdictions like Germany are ending their public testing. They&#39;re following our lead. But Justin Trudeau would rather hurt our province, rattle confidence, and wreck kind of the public psyche here just in service of trying to win a couple of other seats in Quebec. It&#39;s absolutely outrageous, but we&#39;re out. We are not going to allow ourselves to be a football during this ill-conceived federal election that we know is coming. Nicely</div>

This is what I&#39;m really fascinated about because I&#39;m sure different strokes for different folks applies, but there&#39;s probably some conventional wisdom in terms of as we move from political strategy to our sweet spot, campaign strategy what are people doing to to put their campaigns together right now like what exactly is happening so we&#39;ll go through i&#39;ll try to go through it in terms of like order but carter i want your thoughts first of all give me overarching right thursday night to sunday everyone now knows we were expecting it for a long time it&#39;s been telegraphed for everyone that was going to happen last sunday or this sunday but now that it&#39;s real it&#39;s clicked into focus what are some of the high level things that that that each um each political party perhaps perhaps even agnostic of their partisanship, is thinking of right now?

In fact, they&#39;ve been mapped out for they probably did a 50 day, 60 day message board where they could start the RIT, so</div>

We do not want this to be a surprise. eyes right if this is a surprise then this is gonna this this will take us off of our message of that particular day and that particular day&#39;s proactive message is blank whatever they want it to be and i imagine that it is we need a new mandate for uh economic recovery post-pandemic rather than the amazing spectacular pandemic response that we&#39;ve managed up to this point um so</div>

They&#39;ve got the phone calls from each of the regions.

          <div class="said">the reason why is the plan is about the exercise. It&#39;s the thinking that goes into it. It&#39;s the processes where you identify the issues that you are strong on, you identify the issues they are weak on, and all of that rigor that informs a plan, that&#39;s the important part in many ways.

I want to talk about that in a second. But before I get into that, talk to me about, bring me inside. If I&#39;m someone listening to this show who&#39;s never seen what is quote-unquote scripted in a political campaign, tell me what sort of elemental things are scripted. And I think there&#39;s a few things that are obvious. Policy, logistics, who&#39;s going to be where, where the leader is going to be at certain times. What other things that might surprise people are scripted? I assume oppo research and timeliness of that are scripted. Is the whole story of the campaign scripted in a sense where it says if we hit this oppo piece, we hit this oppo piece, it means this and they&#39;re going to say this and they – bring me into it a bit.

          <div class="said">Change all the way. But the story is the most important part. I think Stephen and I would both agree as him as a current campaign practitioner, me as a former campaign practitioner, nothing is more important than story because we&#39;ve talked about it all of the time. You are trying ultimately to establish a ballot question. You want a narrative in somebody&#39;s mind when they go to the poll and say, this is what this election is about. And by defining that question, you define the answer, right? If you&#39;re worried about issue X, conservatives. Issue Y, NDP. Issue Z, liberals. And you set that question if you&#39;ve got a successful campaign. But then you break the story into themes. Those themes become your weeks, in all likelihood. It doesn&#39;t have to be. It&#39;s kind of arbitrary. And within those themes, you have individual announcements or events. And those become your set pieces. And you&#39;re able to move those around within your theme weeks relatively effortlessly. Within all of that, you also then have the oppo and the way you&#39;re trying to knock them off of their theme weeks. And Carter, you&#39;re trying to jump in, so I&#39;ll stop there.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Everything is scripted and everything has to fit. And the trick is, so I work on an awful lot of character development for the opposition, right? So what is the brand or the character positioning that I want the opposition to occupy? And then how do I write that into my stories? Because the stories that we&#39;re writing, I like to think of it like a very long novel, right? Right. And so the 36 day campaign structure is 36 chapters and you&#39;re going to have 36 scenes. You know, so within each of those, there&#39;s so you&#39;re doing three events a day. Right. So there&#39;s three different scenes a day. Inside of those scenes, you have the characters. Right. You have a character of yourself. How much do I want to spend exploring the character of Justin Trudeau? How much time do I want to spend exploring the character of Jagmeet Singh? thing? How much do I want to explore Aaron O&#39;Toole? And you can put into your script how much time you wish to expose those people to. So I&#39;m in the middle of a campaign right now. We&#39;re not doing any character exploration of our opposition right now. We could do character exploration, but the opportunity hasn&#39;t written itself into our script. So you don&#39;t just jump into it just because you think to yourself, you know, I haven&#39;t talked about Aaron O&#39;Toole for a while. You only talk about Aaron O&#39;Toole in the context of the chapter that you&#39;re writing, right? So So all of these stories have to tie together. So at the end of it, the 36 days reads like an actual planned novel. And the interesting part about it is some pieces were planned. Sometimes you know that on the 11th to last day, you&#39;re going to do Lake of Fire. But more often than not, you don&#39;t know that on the 11th to last day, Lake of Fire is going to be there. But if you&#39;ve done your work properly, when Lake of Fire happens, it&#39;s exactly the character expectation that your primary audience has and that character expert expectation is all the work that you did prior to the 11th last day right</div>

And then let&#39;s talk about also, you know, this transition between governance and campaigning. One of the things we&#39;ve seen in the past is certain leaders and teams, not just on a systems basis, but on like a cadence tone basis, kind of still feel like they&#39;re governing in the first days of a writ period. They still feel like they&#39;re in almost like either premier or prime minister mode, not leader of the party mode. So talk about how you kind of prime and test all of those things, heading into a pretty short election period and making sure you&#39;re you&#39;re ready on day one yeah</div>

You don&#39;t want the first time you hit send on an email to continue to use this example to be when it really matters. You want to have some other examples there.

If you try and do a black box theater and in a giant, you know, Broadway style theater, Presidium Arts Theater, it won&#39;t work because the space is different.

Oh, that&#39;s a good analogy. So if you know that the Super Bowl is different, what is it that makes it different? And what pageantry and changes do you add that actually makes it work, right?

Corey, you know, from a strategy perspective and transparency on strategy, if you were the national campaign director for a campaign this weekend, you had your call, let&#39;s say, Saturday morning, right? Saturday morning, 9am Eastern, every campaign manager in the country dials in. How open source are you with our campaign strategy, with the party&#39;s campaign strategy? Because I think I know Carter&#39;s answer to this, which is why I&#39;m asking you, what&#39;s your approach as it relates to, hey, here&#39;s what we&#39;ve scripted, here&#39;s our story? Now, you could go in varying degrees of it, but how are you kind of getting buy-in from a group of people across the country, decentralized, leading up, knowing that they&#39;ve still got disproportionate skin in the game? I&#39;m kind of curious how you would lead into that. Carter, I&#39;ll ask you too, but I want to go to Corey first on this. So</div>

There are things, frankly, that make people feel like they&#39;re on the inside that it would be great if they were run on the front page of the Globe and Mail.

But you do need to make sure that everybody understands your core messages. Everybody understands the brand structure you&#39;re trying to create. Who is, who are we? What are we talking about? When are we talking about it? How do we respond to things? You know, are we the conservative party and we never send our candidates in into a debate?

Similarly, if there&#39;s a sense that there&#39;s a campaign that can&#39;t shoot straight, and they don&#39;t shoot straight, that will reinforce narrative. So it&#39;s going to have a different answer depending on who you are and where you are in the overall political conversation. But by and large, I think launch day is pretty important. I think it&#39;s important because it establishes so many of the themes that in theory you are going to carry throughout the election you want to be able to hear them coming through clear as a bell and it&#39;s also important because it&#39;s when your team has to start moving and if you have a campaigns take a while to ramp up don&#39;t kid yourself they there are hiccups galore and you only see a few of them from the public point of view but there&#39;s there&#39;s all sorts of troubles occurring uh there&#39;ll be somebody who&#39;s texting and they&#39;ll realize four days later they were texting the government phone that that person previously had, not the actual phone, and they haven&#39;t seen these texts.
