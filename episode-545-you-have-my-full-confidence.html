            <span class="text">I want to talk about first and foremost the conversations around the deficit and hone in a little bit on Thomas Mulcair. Mulcair has come in, and this almost seems to be a pattern now of issues that he&#39;s taken a stance on where he has shown some fiscal conservative bona fides. Does Tom Mulcair need to go to the right, Corey?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">forced to the right almost. most but by not moving he looks more right wing simply because justin trudeau now is saying things like i will run a deficit i will spend a lot of money uh and so on and so forth i</span>

            <span class="text">i don&#39;t think this one this one confuses me it puts me in a bit of knots i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s good strategy or bad strategy for the liberals on one hand it is a good wedge between them and the new democrats so we are now talking about the differences between the liberals and new democrats substantive differences which i think can help justin trudeau on the other hand i remain convinced that that it&#39;s a very risky strategy to to paint mulcair as more moderate than you i&#39;m not really sure if that&#39;s going to be in the liberals best interest i come</span>

            <span class="text">so hold on am i hearing both of you say that that he&#39;s being forced to the right and this may not be a deliberate strategy because there are others out there who may feel that tom will care trying to go to the right will take out justin trudeau from the equation in a lot of ridings where he wants to make it an orange blue swing do you do not believe that this could be strategic or is this simply accidental and he&#39;s now embracing it well should Should he be</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">be embracing it? Look, I would say left and right have been redefined, not Tom Mulcair. What we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve managed to change where the conversation is in this election. And that is a conscious strategy of the liberals. Tease that out for me a little bit more, because I think that&#39;s interesting.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, at one point, everybody was sitting there saying no deficits, or at least the assumption was nobody would run a deficit. And that was the political middle. And everybody was there. Tom Mulcair didn&#39;t move yesterday. Justin Trudeau moved yesterday. But because Justin Trudeau is now redefining the leftward flank on the economic argument, on the fiscal hawk argument, I guess, the budget</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">All of a sudden, it looks like Tom Mulcair has taken a step to the right. He didn&#39;t. Justin Trudeau took a step to the left. It&#39;s a bold move. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Exactly. It was so much better than usual. No, but this is the crux of it is that Trudeau has looked at this and said, I can get some votes here if we start talking about going community to community and what we can give to you, what you need and what I can give to you as the next prime minister. Whereas Mulcair has said, I&#39;m going to take that fiscal conservatism because I&#39;m reading the population is wanting some sort of fiscal conservatism. And this isn&#39;t new just of last week. Mulcair was being pegged as a fiscal conservative all the way back in June and July. Prior to this, there are columns written in various newspapers about Mulcair&#39;s</span>

That argument was made about Michael Ignatieff and his buyout of families. I can&#39;t even remember the specific policies there. Arguably, the Liberals and the New Democrats, who have had very little daylight between them in the past 15 years or so, if there is daylight, you could argue that the Liberals have run on the more left-wing platform for three elections in a row now.</span>

This is an infrastructure spend where the conservatives have touted $60 billion, billion and Justin Trudeau has said another $65 billion would be added to that over the course of 10 years, making this the largest infrastructure spend in Canadian history. Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. Is this a, obviously it&#39;s a move to the left of Tom Mulcair. We&#39;ve discussed that in the previous question. Is this a solid move for Justin Trudeau? Because the question here becomes, is he defining himself on Stephen Harper&#39;s terms around the economy? Well,</span>

Stephen Harper went into deficit then, and let&#39;s not believe these little fiscal projections that they have coming out right now. Stephen Harper is still in deficit today.

That big, broad national announcement generates a few days of media coverage, and then they move on to the next thing. First of all, he announced it at a time that it&#39;s going to carry him over this weekend. So people are going to be talking about this over the weekend, at least the hyper-engaged are.

            <span class="text">Corey, maybe fill people in as to what a ballot box question is, because we had a few people on Twitter ask us last time when we threw around the term, and we should maybe explain that.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">is Canada safe, or are we spending enough on infrastructure, or some variation of that. And there&#39;s been a lot of examples of ballot box questions. And even after the fact, even when the strategists explain what they were aiming for on a ballot box question, rarely is there consensus as to what the ballot box question was. There&#39;s a few rare examples. The NAFTA election in the 80s, we all knew the ballot box question was, should we, or it wasn&#39;t even NAFTA at that point. It was just free trade with the Americans. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

People have seen the effects of it. And let&#39;s be clear, we&#39;re talking about quibbling over whether they spend $10 billion or not in a $2 trillion economy.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It plays if you can do more voter identification and count your voters to come out more than the other guy&#39;s voters. And that&#39;s where the New Democratic surge has been interesting. We&#39;ve been seeing numbers that show that the New Democrats are getting their voter base from across the board almost equally. This is a significant change for a quote-unquote progressive party, where you would have seen an emphasis on younger voters, which is still Justin Trudeau&#39;s problem and the liberal problem.</span>

And Corey, I think you&#39;re the first to make this point on this podcast, that this is going to be a battle between the liberals and the Indies. You&#39;ve just said this recently. And if they balance themselves out and Harper can take it, right? How does he play the Justin Trudeau angle right now? Because if he knows that Justin Trudeau is a little bit more depressed in the polls, and let&#39;s be very clear. These are small, small margins in the polls that we&#39;re seeing, right? These are small margins. There&#39;s three-way ties. There&#39;s maybe a max of a five- or six-point lead for the NDs in certain polls. Small margins. How does he play with Justin Trudeau right now? If he&#39;s throttling on the NDP, does he let Trudeau rise so that there&#39;s some sense of equilibrium with the two progressive parties?</span>
