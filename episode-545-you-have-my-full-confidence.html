          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan tackle the latest events in federal politics. Is Tom Mulcair to the right of Justin Trudeau? Is the Liberal infrastructure plan a solid ballot box question?

And Corey, I think you&#39;re the first to make this point on this podcast, that this is going to be a battle between the liberals and the Indies. You&#39;ve just said this recently. And if they balance themselves out and Harper can take it, right? How does he play the Justin Trudeau angle right now? Because if he knows that Justin Trudeau is a little bit more depressed in the polls, and let&#39;s be very clear. These are small, small margins in the polls that we&#39;re seeing, right? These are small margins. There&#39;s three-way ties. There&#39;s maybe a max of a five- or six-point lead for the NDs in certain polls. Small margins. How does he play with Justin Trudeau right now? If he&#39;s throttling on the NDP, does he let Trudeau rise so that there&#39;s some sense of equilibrium with the two progressive parties?</div>
