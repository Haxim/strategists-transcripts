        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the impact holidays like Thanksgiving have on elections. What is the endgame for each Party? Will we be staying up late to see how BC votes? And did Corey actually bet $400 that there would be a Liberal majority? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

And that&#39;s because Stephen&#39;s exactly right. There are people that are just trusted more on these issues because they think more about these issues and at the very least can control a conversation on these issues.

I think that the liberals, knowing that we were going into this weekend and knowing that they wanted to set the tone for the final week of the campaign, doubled down, tripled down on that super optimistic we can do this message. Correct. That ad they had ready. Ready. was the best ad they&#39;ve done of this campaign. And I would also note that our big complaint of their very first ad of the campaign, they say, I&#39;m not ready, you know, repeating the charge. All of that was gone, you know. From this particular ad. From this particular ad. It was talking about Canadians being an optimistic people, about how the economy depends on you, not Stephen Harper. And we are ready to do better because we&#39;ve always done better as Canadians and just ends with the word ready. And I thought, what a, like, that was the theme of what he said. So again, if you&#39;d never heard the charge, you&#39;re just going to look at that and be like, yeah, I am ready for change. I&#39;m just ready for something different. But if you have heard the charge, and most people have heard the charge that Justin Trudeau is not ready, it was pitch perfect. It was absolutely perfect. It showed him commanding a room of 7,000 people talking about exactly why it was time for change and that he was the change. I&#39;ve</div>
