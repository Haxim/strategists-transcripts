Because Taves is in the space in between where he knows a lot of his supporters support the Alberta Sovereignty Act and a lot of the pieces that are in it in particular, and perhaps even personally might support things like the Alberta pension plan. I can absolutely see why a minister of finance in Alberta might be seduced by something like that. And so you might say this is unworkable, this is magic, but you don&#39;t want to get into the specifics. You don&#39;t want to dwell a ton of time on these things And you don&#39;t want to have a bunch of clips of you attacking her on that because that certainly has the risk of backfiring if you&#39;re a candidate who&#39;s a little closer to where Danielle Smith is on the spectrum.
