These lists exist in some way, shape, or form, and they&#39;re going to be getting better as things go along. Wouldn&#39;t call it polling. When we look at some of the polling that&#39;s out there, even if people who say, like, are you a UCP supporter? Are you a UCP member? You&#39;ve got to take it all with a grain of salt, right?

Because Taves is in the space in between where he knows a lot of his supporters support the Alberta Sovereignty Act and a lot of the pieces that are in it in particular, and perhaps even personally might support things like the Alberta pension plan. I can absolutely see why a minister of finance in Alberta might be seduced by something like that. And so you might say this is unworkable, this is magic, but you don&#39;t want to get into the specifics. You don&#39;t want to dwell a ton of time on these things And you don&#39;t want to have a bunch of clips of you attacking her on that because that certainly has the risk of backfiring if you&#39;re a candidate who&#39;s a little closer to where Danielle Smith is on the spectrum.
