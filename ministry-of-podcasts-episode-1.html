I guess that&#39;s the one thing I would really underline here, because you&#39;ve got to wait until the results are verified. And then they reach out to you to start orientation.

One of the interesting things about the throne speech is he gives it in the Senate, and then in the House of Commons, we have to take it up, and there&#39;s a motion moved to discuss the throne speech. Somebody has to move that motion. And I was the guy who got to move that motion. So it&#39;s kind of one of these things that&#39;s like, you know, it&#39;s a nice little thing to do inside Parliament. I don&#39;t think anybody in the rest of Canada knows or cares that I&#39;m the guy who moved the throne speech motion. But the</span>

There is a dress code in the house. The dress code is in order to kind of be there, you need to wear a jacket. And in order to speak or vote, you need to wear a tie. Or I think maybe you can vote if you just have a jacket on. Anyways, you can&#39;t speak without a tie. That&#39;s for sure. So men have to wear a jacket and a tie in the House of Commons. It&#39;s kind of old school like that. But to get to the second part of your question, Zane, there&#39;s no dress code for below your jacket and tie. Yeah, there isn&#39;t. So, yeah, I mean, most of the time I&#39;m wearing sneakers in the house. I will say, because I went to the Pope&#39;s inaugural mass, and I thought, I can&#39;t go to St. Peter&#39;s Square wearing sneakers to, like, the inaugural mass. I did buy my first pair of dress shoes in, like, decades. And so I do own a pair, and I do sometimes wear them as well, just to try to get a little value out of them but yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so one of the things about so there&#39;s time for debates i don&#39;t like i said like the whole parliamentary procedure is not my jam but long story short is there&#39;s like you get 20 minute blocks right where it&#39;s a 20 minute speech and then 10 minutes of questions from the rest of the house rotating</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">rotating through all of the parties uh but the 20 minute block can be split become two 10 minute blocks or whatnot but one of the things that happens in a debate uh pretty quickly is well let me put it this way if you have something to say on a bill you&#39;re not gonna have any trouble saying it like you just go to like the person who&#39;s managing your lobby and you&#39;re like hey can i get on the speaker&#39;s list either for today or tomorrow or whatever it is i&#39;ll go i want to go i have a few things to say they&#39;ll be like yeah fucking great because most of the time they&#39;re trying to fill that time and sustain the house and what&#39;s happening is uh they&#39;re rotating through like liberal conservative block liberal conservative liberal conservative liberal conservative block or some pattern like like that right yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and even though there&#39;s not necessarily something new to add to the conversation nobody wants to give up their part of the conversation because if a liberal&#39;s not there to do it it&#39;s just going to go on to the conservative right and then it&#39;s going to be a couple of those speakers save some</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well and thing i but no zane because we don&#39;t save it we just repeat them we repeat them in kind of different frames and so a lot of the house does start to feel pretty repetitive and you really take note of when when it&#39;s somebody who stands up and gives a speech, that&#39;s like, oh, this is coming from somewhere, right? Like, oh, they&#39;re speaking from personal experience. And yeah, some of them, it&#39;s like really great. You get this big extemporaneous speech or something like that, right? Because most of it is like the house leader has sent a speech, and I&#39;m reading the speech, and I&#39;m going to sit down and then there&#39;s questions. And you know, it&#39;s just it&#39;s like, it&#39;s very patent performa.</span>

            <span class="text">Unfortunately, so, because I do think that like, when people actually are leaning into it it&#39;s really great and i think truly if you could manage to compress the debate just into those moments where people are saying the things that matter to them and that they want to say i think the house of commons would be fucking awesome like it would be like people would watch it right like they would see interesting things but there&#39;s just too much too</span>

Just let them know the category so the minister knows who&#39;s up, can give some thought to what they&#39;re going to say. You get a much better response as a result. And you could have a more thoughtful exchange on an issue. And you could actually test somebody&#39;s knowledge of it. Because I&#39;ll tell you something, 35 seconds, you could say anything in 35 seconds. You know, as a joke, so as a Parle Sec, one of the things you have to do is answer if, like, your minister&#39;s not in the house. And sometimes there&#39;s moments where you&#39;re looking around and you&#39;re like, is that minister there? Am I going to be up? I don&#39;t have a binder today. you know like i don&#39;t know what to do uh and some of my colleagues will be like oh no what if i have to go up and i always say to them i&#39;m like well just it&#39;s 35 seconds you just say mr speaker i can&#39;t believe i let&#39;s start the clock right mr</span>

Like, it&#39;s always like, that was like part of the framing off the top. Like, so I don&#39;t know what their thinking was like from day one and that that they the vetting is not about like your qualities it&#39;s not about what you&#39;re good at it&#39;s like tell us let&#39;s go through your life about everything that could be bad right like let&#39;s let&#39;s just figure it out you know they&#39;re like how&#39;s your marriage you know uh drug use you use drugs you know like stuff like that like</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, I&#39;ll be honest. I think that the overall public desire to do it will likely abate a bit, but I don&#39;t think this government&#39;s desire to reorient is going to abate. I think that the Prime Minister is pretty fixed on making sure that we have new trade deals and new trade relationships. He was in Europe this week, you know, for new military partnerships. And I think that you&#39;re going to see a lot more of that, but it&#39;s kind of like step one, step two stuff, right? And so what I would say to anybody is, as much as it might be galling to find ourselves at this particular moment, we can&#39;t lose sight of the main objective here, and this is very much a game in progress. Like, there are steps going on behind the scenes, there are steps going on that, you know, that even I am not privy to, right, as a caucus member, right, where all of this is going on. And you&#39;re just going to have to sort of, well, my ask is, I guess, assess it on the full body of work, not like the individual moment within it. Like, you know, a month from now, two months from now, where are we in terms of a trade deal? Like assess that overall bundle rather than assessing like the individual thrusts and parries of a very erratic US president who often throws bombs into the discussion that</span>

But you have federally a government that will incentivize these things, that will make those trade deals. And ultimately, the market will then shift.

It was in the Toronto Star, they mentioned it. But like, then I&#39;m walking by and there&#39;s another question shouted at me about like, what do you think about Danielle Smith&#39;s government bringing in charges for COVID vaccines? And I was thinking, I really want to answer that question. I have some thoughts on that question. I don&#39;t have time. I&#39;m already late because I stopped to talk to those people. And so it just, it kind of sucks. It&#39;s like, just call my office. Like that was a question just for me from one journalist. Just call my office. happy to answer at a later point well</span>

            <span class="text">know it is a really good question it is one of those things that you have to kind of make peace with that you&#39;re trading external voice for internal voice and so you know there&#39;s a party line uh and you and the deal is now you get to raise in caucus and you get to talk to the prime minister and the ministers and you directly but get to influence policy but you&#39;re part of a team and so at the end of the day you hang with that team and so it does change the dynamic a bit as you go along that</span>
