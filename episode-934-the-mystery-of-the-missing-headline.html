This, of course, is on top of several other issues the Olympics have been having, including all the classic cost overruns issue. Will they make money issue? They just recently fired the creative director for the opening ceremonies, which are going to be held in a couple of hours the day before. Corey, what do you make of this as it relates to the Olympics, what, a day, two days before these things get going?</span>

Now, obviously, this is unique, even within that construct. We&#39;re in the middle of a global pandemic. They&#39;ve just had to fire the person who&#39;s running their open ceremony because of Holocaust jokes. Yeah,</span>

Or is it just going to shuffle back and forth between China and Russia or what? So that to me is the fascinating one. I think the Olympics themselves will go off. I won&#39;t say without a hitch because there&#39;s always hitches. But as soon as our countries, wherever you are, as soon as your country is on the podium, all of a sudden you get a little bit of excitement. In fact, when they&#39;re in competition, you&#39;re excited. And you kind of forget about all of the bullshit that surrounds the IOC.</span>

Stephen Harper lost to Justin Trudeau. You know, he&#39;s he&#39;s not going to come back. I mean, what are you going to do? Bring back. Who else are you going to bring back? Bring back candidates from the dead. Diefenbaker. How does Diefenbaker perform in this situation? Where&#39;s Mulrooney in this? Can we get Mulrooney into this? This is a joke.

Candidate, of course, just like, you know, there&#39;s an election happening in Nova Scotia. Former Dartmouth South candidate says liberals dropped her over boudoir photos. Let me give you a bit of context. So the former Dartmouth South candidate for Nova Scotia says the party dropped her from the ticket over boudoir photos she had already disclosed to the Greenlight Committee on numerous occasions and asked her to lie by citing mental health concerns as the reason for her resignation. She kind of goes on in this Instagram post saying that the party knew about these photos when they surfaced on the first day of the campaign. The comms director for the campaign pretty much gave her two statements and said, you&#39;re posting one of these. And she decided to post one of them, but then subsequently kind of came clean, so to speak, on social media and told her side of the story. story. Carter, you know, from a political standpoint, this is fascinating on a couple of levels in terms of number one, the nomination process and the green light process. Number two, you know, the one of the reasons I thought she was entirely credible with her statement, or I find her to be credible, let me put it that way, was this whole sort of communications director giving you two statements, like we&#39;ve heard of that so many times, and you&#39;re choosing one. And then so there&#39;s that to unpack. And then also, you know, there&#39;s a gender element here. You know, her photos, completely legal, a way she was trying to earn money versus the leader of the party, Rankin, who&#39;s, you know, disclosed that he had some DUIs in the past and that he&#39;d made some actual legal errors in the past, so to speak, and how this is a gendered process. So I&#39;m kind of opening it up in terms of where and what part of this story interests you.

To Corey, your point, some party will try to, whether it&#39;s a viable seat or not, will fill a candidate somewhere that they made a choice on or they may have used a different prism on vetting. And stories like this will come up. So for you, what is your sort of bar? Is it through that lens that you mentioned earlier of distraction? And is something binary a distraction or not to the party? Or are you kind of like thinking like Carter that you own up to these and you kind of maybe proactively think about some of these processes and these rules? Your thoughts?</span>

What might it cost with this candidate? Is the distraction just not worth it, right?

            <span class="text">other thing i would say though is that traditionally like if you think about the system as it&#39;s in a model form now this is supposed to work is somebody wants to become a candidate so they put forward nomination parties to or nomination papers to the party the party then has people go through it with either a legal lens or a social lens or both in most cases and says like okay let&#39;s validate that yes they actually did get this degree from this institution let&#39;s confirm that there&#39;s no criminal record here those are kind of the legal checks let&#39;s look through the listing of of papers that they have said that they&#39;ve written or or comment that they&#39;ve offered at various times let&#39;s also do a scan to see if they were complete in their list or if there were things that they missed now reality is if you are particularly loquacious you&#39;re probably going to miss some things just by accident but the party will go through and see if there was an attempt to conceal like that&#39;s what&#39;s supposed to happen right and</span>

            <span class="text">you know, that says, is there anything else you know that might be a problem for the party, right? And this is where you – this is like your spill it here, right?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that&#39;s where a smart candidate will have this candid conversation with the party about where it is. And one of the first mitigations that will be recommended is to say, okay, well, it&#39;s got to be out there because we don&#39;t want it to spill out during a campaign. That, of course, requires a certain amount of time.</span>

If you&#39;ve done that, if you&#39;re in advance of a campaign, if it&#39;s an actual contest, then you let the members of the riding figure it out. Do they care enough? Do they not care enough? Is it going to be a big distraction or not? If you think it&#39;s kind of on the bubble and it&#39;s not necessarily something to reject a candidate over. So</span>

And I have to imagine, like, one of the things I find fascinating, let me just say, is like the politics of English versus French, I shouldn&#39;t say English versus French, let&#39;s say English and French, but at certain times versus over the past hundreds of years, much longer than we&#39;ve been a country going back to the 18th century, that</span>

How arrogant are they? They must step down. They must leave. This is fucked. The party is done. And for Annamie Paul to be sitting up there and saying, well, I&#39;m not going to be distracted.

Number one, it&#39;s the fact that she literally did a press conference a day before it was revealed that the party&#39;s now taking her to open court. Number two, the second development, that Elizabeth May issued a statement, non-statement, I support the Green Party. Anna Mae Paul&#39;s the leader of the Green Party. That&#39;s a paraphrase.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. I thought that her messaging was very strong. And at this point, we&#39;ve already hit rock bottom. Like, I couldn&#39;t possibly think less of the Green Party executive who had been involved in this to date. And what Annamie Paul has managed to do is project something approximating, like, no sweat, don&#39;t worry about it. and done it in a not entirely unconvincing way when she said like, hey, listen, this is just churn. These people are all off the council in the next month. We&#39;ve just got to wait it out. No big deal. They&#39;re acting like idiots, but I&#39;m not going to let them distract me. I think that&#39;s a pretty cool approach. I don&#39;t have a problem with that approach at all. Now, the Green Party, all I can say is they haven&#39;t dug themselves any deeper, thankfully, because the leader that you are castigating right now has come up with a pretty good message track. But, yeah, I mean, the entire situation is an odd one. But this particular moment of the situation, I think she handled it fine.</span>

She was in Toronto Centre. Like, clearly, you know, a relatively quickly organized press conference had some of her candidates behind her. Her core message was, I&#39;m not going to leak any information. This has been tough for me. I&#39;m looking forward to winning in Toronto Centre, to taking the Green Party forward. She talks about diversity and how she&#39;s increased the diversity of the candidates. She made it about the candidates around her and said, you know, this is not just about me, but I hope this Phil gets elected and John and Joan. And like she did that thing. What did you make of her message and her standing? And then literally the next day that gets hit with this story that, you know, they&#39;re taking her to open court. She&#39;s</span>

A lot of people chirping from the sidelines saying it wasn&#39;t safe, I&#39;m not going to go. The Stampede tried many tactics to get people in the doors, or in the gates, I should say, including a free Sunday. If you&#39;re a frontline worker, it&#39;s free. If you you graduated this year you come in free uh despite that 40 attendance the question i have for you steven the brand of the calgary stampede after this year the brand is it fine is it fabulous or is it fucked uh going forward i</span>

We were a third of the size and we had the exact same attendance. So I think that the Calgary Stampede has been on a decline in terms of importance in the city of Calgary for decades. decades uh and this may just hasten that decline it&#39;s not something that i would have allowed myself to be used as as a political pawn um and that&#39;s unfortunate for the stampede now will they bounce back maybe</span>

Polls coming out saying he&#39;s doing better, you know, articles about his social media performance and how authentic he is, his likability factor, opinion pieces about, you know, if Trudeau doesn&#39;t win, look at this guy for why he might not get his majority. There seems to be a bit of a loving for Jagmeet Singh. And I just wanted to make sure that the conversation on him is also considered fine, fabulous, or fucked, the love-in that Jagmeet Singh is having this week in the press.

And if the liberals are denied their majority, and if there&#39;s a strong NDP contingent, it might be the most powerful the NDP has been in a generation as well.</span>

One of the biggest O&#39;Toole swords that he&#39;s been using against Justin Trudeau has been on ethics, has been on the whole classic sort of liberal liberal insider handing out contracts to their friends, keeping their friends close. Well, a story from Global News just reveals that Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s office gave away nearly $240,000 worth of taxpayer-funded contracts to conservative insiders in his first six months on the job, even while O&#39;Toole and many of his MPs were hammering the Trudeau liberals for the same. How bad is this for O&#39;Toole? Is this fine? Is this fabulous? Or is this fucked? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the middle one, but between fine and fucked, what do you think it is? I</span>

So there&#39;s no boomerang that&#39;s going to come and smack him in the head. You know, he&#39;s a hypocrite.</span>

            <span class="text">But it was never that great of an issue for the conservatives anyhow. I mean, they really needed another piece to kind of fall in their laps that made the thing seem a little bit more unseemly. And that could have been an ethics report, as we talked about, but that was probably not coming before the election anyhow, if this election happens on the timelines we&#39;re thinking. So, so it&#39;s probably fine. Liberal supporters will be able to throw it back in the face of conservative critics, but I don&#39;t think this is the kind of thing that&#39;s going to change the course of history. Now, interestingly, when you look at the details underneath it, and how money was flowing in the context of Aaron O&#39;Toole versus versus these other organization versus the liberals, it&#39;s</span>

You know, there is a legitimate case that these are different things, and they should be looked at through different lenses. In Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s case, the big one was really he&#39;s hired somebody who&#39;s making about $150,000 a year. And that person is also doing work benefiting with various candidates, right? I mean, that&#39;s the one that is kind of the most salacious in terms of like</span>

Carter, you know, Corey thinks this is not going to be a big deal. But regardless, if you have 15 minutes, and in this case you&#39;ll have 15 seconds, to hand together bullet points for the leader so that he&#39;s internalized them in terms of what his spin or defense of this looks like, what are you giving them in terms of some of those key bullet points, especially around this being a spear of attack that they&#39;ve used? Maybe not even a spear, but a proof point, I should say, more accurately, that they&#39;ve used against the liberals around their ethics and their insider politics. What are some bullet points you&#39;re handing over to your leader, Aaron O&#39;Toole, in defense of this story breaking?</span>

            <span class="text">highly specific contracts. These contracts required a high degree of understanding of our internal processes. They could only go to people who understood what we needed as a party. This was really less about handing over contracts to conservative insiders and more about handing over contracts to the most qualified candidates. We ran robust competitions to hand out these contracts that followed all of the best practices that we expect from the federal government. Sadly, the Liberals have not been doing that. And and had they been doing what we&#39;d been doing, we certainly would have been much more muted about our critique of the liberal government. But they&#39;ve been wrong. And we&#39;re we are we are not. This is a false point of comparison.</span>
