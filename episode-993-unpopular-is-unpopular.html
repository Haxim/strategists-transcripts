And the more broadband the caucus, the more that&#39;s true. But if the caucus is narrow in interest, you&#39;re kind of doomed, right? Especially if that caucus perhaps has decided that they were elected because of their intentions and their political views and not those of the party, which we all know is what people are actually voting on here.

And there was a CBC debate where Danielle Smith made a comment about climate change, which made her look very outside of the mainstream on that issue as well. And voters recoiled. You know, there was this recoiling from this position that they were at for most of the election.</span>

            <span class="text">Maybe because he started this runaway train, right? Which suggested that one of the reasons why the PCs failed was because they lacked a certain purity. Now, I mean, I think my view, my read of the PCs is a little bit different. They certainly lost any kind of principle, in my opinion, and drifted about. But it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it wasn&#39;t necessarily their lack of hardcore right wing values that cost them the election. because i mean albertans lest we forget in 2015 elected an ndp government and</span>

            <span class="text">and then the party you know the pcs ended up with uh well only 18 seats i think they came in second if i&#39;m not mistaken there so it to me doesn&#39;t suggest that that albertans were saying not right wing enough they they&#39;re not right wing enough so i better go elect a new democratic government like that doesn&#39;t fucking hang that doesn&#39;t follow but he validated and he he gave legitimacy to the grievances of those who were in the wild rose camp, right?</span>

            <span class="text">The problem with the previous government is they weren&#39;t grassroots enough. They weren&#39;t true enough to their conservative values. I&#39;m going to be different. Well, when you let the genie out of the bottle on that one, right?</span>

            <span class="text">Okay. All of a sudden, everything you do is, is it grassroots enough? And is it conservative enough? And Jason Kenney couldn&#39;t pass the purity test he himself set because governing&#39;s hard and governing requires you to do things like stay to the middle where the public is. And it requires you to do things like just make a fucking decision and not go back and talk to everybody all of the time about all of these things and it&#39;s really interesting and there&#39;s going to be a lot to dissect about the jason kenney days weeks years uh in in the coming months how&#39;s that for a turn of phrase but one of the things that i&#39;m most interested to to sort of discuss is this this view of jason kenney hotly</span>
