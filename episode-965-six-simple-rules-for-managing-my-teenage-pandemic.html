Because I imagine that the people who need multiple sittings to read a book probably have a very low attention span, probably don&#39;t grasp knowledge, probably need a refresher or reminder in terms of what they just read the next time they crack open that book six months later, which is why you leave it on the page you just read as a bit of a preview it&#39;s like the previously on the west wing and then you read that page and then you just go on to the next page carter so a couple of</span>

It&#39;s very simple. Without them knowing, we just mention them a lot on the program. And then once a year, we give them strategic advice on their ongoing marketing and communications campaigns. Why, Stephen Carter? Because we can. Because that&#39;s what we do. Yeah, that&#39;s what we do. And the fine folks at Flair Airlines with their, I assume, CEO, because we&#39;ve never met them. We don&#39;t go that high. Actually, we never communicate with them. With their CEO, have put out this one-minute-long video where they read mean tweets. tweets, and Stephen Carter, there are many to select from about Flair Airlines. Take a listen to this.</span>

            <span class="text">One of the simple ways to maybe explain that is that there&#39;s no longer two simple neat camps of individuals that are pro-public health at any cost, and those that are perhaps on the, you know, no more lockdowns, we&#39;re sick and tired of this. That group is no longer simply a minority. There is more bleeding of those that kind of say, we need to just live with this. The only thing that matters is hospitalizations, etc. So here&#39;s what I want to do, or here&#39;s how I want to try to structure this, which is from everything that we know thus far, can the two of you put together a one-pager on the new political rules of Omicron? And I want to do this as like a yes and. Each of you just add a rule to the list as a political rule that you could maybe just hand over to an elected official, a premier, a prime minister, a cabinet minister, saying, OK, we&#39;ve done the analysis. We see where things are, how</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Here are the new political rules. There could be five of them. There could be three of them. There could be 10 of them. We&#39;ll see how far this goes, but we&#39;ll start with the political rule that each of you throw on the table, and then the next one kind of yes-ands it and say, here&#39;s the next rule to the mix, the new political rules of Omicron. And Stephen Carter, I want to start with you because I always start with you. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Don&#39;t go too far off the center path. Find the center. You mentioned it a little bit in your opening, Zane, that in the past there was kind of like a group on one side and a group on the other side. I think that now things have kind of returned to kind of a normal bell curve, standard deviation type of thing where most people are in the middle. They want to be protected, but they also want to have the things that they want to have.</span>

            <span class="text">So this feels like if you move too far in any one direction, there&#39;s going to be a negative backlash. so if you are closing schools too quickly or if you&#39;re leaving schools open too quickly you got to try and go down a tried and true middle path and the good news is that this is what our fifth wave so we now know the various waves and we can and we can start to i think project out a little bit better how things are going to unfold and that means you can you can be in the middle and say say, okay, this is where we are in this spike, and this is why we need to stay consistent, stay in the middle, not too big a movement to the right or to the left, just stay right in the middle.</span>

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think so. I think that the political win opportunity out of COVID has always been fleeting. There was a time perhaps in maybe the third wave when we were articulating stronger measures and things like that, and there was a win to be had. But I think that that stronger measure win is gone. So walk down the middle where people are, and then just hope not to get crushed.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay. Well, so you asked me two things. Do I agree with Stephen&#39;s rule? Not generally, no, because I think, you know, splitting the difference when you&#39;re talking about a public health crisis is not necessarily going to get you where you want to be. But it does sort of lead me to my rule. And I take what Stephen&#39;s saying. I&#39;m not trying to shit all over his point here because there&#39;s some wisdom in it here. But you just have to be careful knowing that, you know, compromise can lead you into some pretty uncomfortable positions. I think that&#39;s a lot of where Jason Kenney ended up wrong side, you know, trying to challenge, do two strategies at the same time. My rule is don&#39;t turn off your brain, right? Like past performance is not a guarantee of future results here. And just because you want it to be over does not mean it&#39;s over. And you&#39;ve got to sit and look at Omicron for what it is and not either what you wish it is or what the last wave was. And I&#39;m sort of seeing signs that we&#39;re seeing a polarization into both of those camps, right? One of them is saying, well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, like, I&#39;m just tired, and I want Omicron to be over. So let&#39;s just, you know, guns ablaze and go through. And I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a particularly wise approach to public policy. And I&#39;m seeing another one that is, look</span>

            <span class="text">Therefore, this is worse than where we were in Delta. And we may end up there, but it&#39;s not there yet. So I think that all of the major actors in politics need to just sort of sit and say, what is this? Let&#39;s measure the base set of facts. Let&#39;s neither, you know, just wish this out of existence, nor assume that this is exactly like the last waves.</span>

Well, first of all, I like what Corey said, and I&#39;m going to add another one that I&#39;m actually stealing from his earlier advice around Wave 4. And it was stop focusing on case numbers. Start focusing on the negative outcomes because the case numbers are astounding. They&#39;re just like, even though we&#39;re not tracking PCR tests in the same fashion in Alberta, you know, 40% positivity rates in Alberta, those positivity numbers across Canada are massive. Like, we&#39;re talking huge numbers. Everybody and their dog, well, everybody, their dog, and one of the co-hosts of The Strategist has had COVID this time. And, but</span>

So let&#39;s pick up where Carter left off. Corey, how do you politically do that? First of all, do you agree with Carter restating your advice from the fourth wave? And secondly, how do you make that political shift? Because the public health advice is kind of going in multiple directions. Some are still focusing on cases, some media outlets saying we&#39;re switching over to hospitalizations. But from a political perspective, how are you making that pivot without burning yourself or spending too much political capital on it?</span>

They&#39;re just gone into</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the ether. And we have situations like our chief medical officer of health here trying to extrapolate what it means for case numbers. I remember when it was at 40%, she was saying, well, we&#39;re probably catching one in 10 cases, which means like a truly mind-blowing number of people have active cases, like 600,000 or something in a province of 4.4, 4.3, 4.4 million. million so uh you know when you start thinking about that we&#39;ve been at this for a month and you start thinking about the update she&#39;s given like just we&#39;re got to be approaching a third of this bloody province has had uh omicron in the past couple of months here which is wild right like totally wild um so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so it&#39;s broken like our case count numbers aren&#39;t real anymore i mean that&#39;s the other problem why you can&#39;t really test them as kind of a forward indicator so there are other Other forward indicators available after two years of COVID, the most obvious one is wastewater. So, you</span>

            <span class="text">know, universities such as the University of Calgary, University of Alberta in the province of Alberta are testing wastewater to see, you know, how much COVID is in the wastewater. And they&#39;re doing this fairly regularly. And it has been a pretty good leading indicator since summer of 2020. So that we can look at and we can say, okay, maybe that&#39;ll tell us a bit about where we are in the trend. because i think one of the reasons people are a little anxious to give up cases is uh the canary in the coal mine right you see cases rising you can expect uh icu&#39;s to rise</span>

            <span class="text">One is that, you know, there&#39;s this kind of the dream that I&#39;ve heard health professionals speak of and emergency planners speak of that says Omicron is the thing that&#39;s going to really level this and slow us down because everybody&#39;s going to get it. We&#39;re going to see much higher immunity levels. Not everybody&#39;s going to get it, but it&#39;s going to be widely, you know, Corey&#39;s numbers of 600,000 people active cases right now in about three weeks, we will see 60% of the population of Alberta will have been exposed or would have had this thing. It&#39;s a big it&#39;s a big problem, big opportunity, because when you get that kind of big spread that coupled with your vaccination rates gives you a fairly solid herd immunity. And this may be the last one. So in that case, then the win is winning. Right. The win is you&#39;re out of Omicron. You&#39;re done. We&#39;re done. COVID COVID is now the Spanish flu, which we get every year. Right. And we can have booster shots. We&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get better at managing COVID as it mutates. we&#39;ll be ready to catch it and hopefully we see just better and better outcomes for people who get it the</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s a good lead into what my next rule was going to be. Carter&#39;s right. The win is, if there&#39;s a win, it&#39;s that we&#39;re out of Omicron, not that we&#39;re out of Omicron before anyone else, and we can&#39;t control the types of variants. So the other thing governments need to do as a rule is focus on downside risk. There&#39;s absolutely no sense to let things go absolutely nuts with with the hopes that you&#39;re just out of this two weeks before, say, the province next door. Prudence has still got to be the rule of the game here. If this is running through and it takes another four weeks and that protects your health care system because of measures you&#39;ve taken, I think people</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people will forget that inconvenience a lot faster than they will forget a collapse of the health care system. So downside risk. It&#39;s not equal, right? You&#39;re not placing a bet and it&#39;s 50-50 either way. If you place a bet, this is all going to be fine and you do nothing and it&#39;s not fine. I mean, I don&#39;t think that, just to use this province as an example, I don&#39;t think Jason Kenney&#39;s got another one of those in him. I think it&#39;s over, over, over. Maybe not with his party, but certainly with the province of Alberta, if we still have something like Delta again. So given that, what is, is it worth it?

And maybe this is a follow-up for a specific class of leader who may not have necessarily handled COVID very well or may have been criticized publicly for their handling of COVID, right? And I look at a couple. Like, Jason Kenney&#39;s an obvious choice here in Alberta. Doug Ford may be another choice in that sense.

And there&#39;s probably parts of either themselves or their advisors saying, there is an opportunity, or if you nail Omicron, this could really help you in June, Doug Ford. Or if you really land the ship or the plane here, Jason Kenney, that this really really helps your leadership review chances, or this really sets you up for a nice trajectory for your eventual election in 23.

And what that might do, not downstream effects, but even converting the vaccine hesitant to getting their first doses in the next little while.

Perhaps it will come back. And we just get back to the normal thing, which says, oh, you&#39;re a health care provider. Make sure you&#39;ve got your tetanus shot, your COVID shot, your, you know, whatever shots you need to have in order to be safe, because that&#39;s where we want people to be. And the 6% or 4% that choose not to get vaccinated at least stop rallying because right now they&#39;re being persecuted and that persecution is creating a secondary response. And I don&#39;t mean that the persecution is wrong in any way, shape or form, but it&#39;s in everybody&#39;s mindset. And that&#39;s that&#39;s just if we can just make it back to normalcy, then the protests go away. We don&#39;t have to shut down roads every weekend. And something that&#39;s disturbing happening in Western Canada, especially with protests happening at politicians homes that needs to fucking stop right now, right now.

And I think that&#39;s something that we&#39;re experiencing here. It&#39;s not just a disparate 3%, 4%, 5%, but it&#39;s a percentage of people that are now able to communicate, organize, and reinforce that worldview. Corey, I want to go to you on this.</span>

It was turned into something that it wasn&#39;t. He flapped it. You know, the best way to describe it is he flapped his arms. he made text that was super big. It looked ridiculous. He looked more like Ezra Levant than the leader of the Her Majesty&#39;s Loyal Opposition. It was, you know, I just hate this stuff. I hate when people take things that aren&#39;t true and turn them into political opportunities. I think there&#39;s tremendous opportunity in truth. And you should pick that which is true.

And I think that in fact, if you do lie, if you use excessive hyperbole, and note the word excessive because hyperbole does have a place in traditional politics.

He wrote a tweet about it, and it really struck me because I agree with it 800%. He said, flapping about like a coked up second string Fox News host over things that were never said won&#39;t get Aaron O&#39;Toole elected. I agree.

            <span class="text">bit of a lag, you know, and again, I want to stress like, it&#39;s a little behind the Canadian average, but way ahead of like the American average, anything like that. So let&#39;s just keep this all in context. But you know, that in Alberta, it&#39;s probably if anything, likely tipping the other way with people saying, you know what, no enough, like, it&#39;s too much, like, it&#39;s enough, right. And so I just, you know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily a political winner to call for those kinds of actions. I think Stephen hit the nail on the head with schools. It&#39;s really tough. I knew it was five right away because I&#39;ve got a five-year-old. I&#39;ve got a seven-year-old. Those are pretty important years. And I will confess, I&#39;m getting a little freaked out about how much time they&#39;ve spent just sort of in bubbles, sitting at desks, even in kindergarten, on the mat on their own and all of that and what this is going to do in the future. And the idea of going to online learning again seemed wild. like there&#39;s things i want the government to do i want better ventilation in schools this should have been an eye-opener for all of us that schools need better ventilation this isn&#39;t just a covet thing let&#39;s just fix ventilation in schools how about that for a starting issue here i want to make sure that we have the protections available let&#39;s use the best mask let&#39;s do all of those sensible things that would allow us to continue those are reasonable things that i&#39;m looking for as a parent i&#39;m not looking for another fucking like shutdown of schools i&#39;ll tell you that right right now. But let&#39;s not make it all about me. The polling generally says that Albertans are feeling kind of the same level of fatigue. So look to</span>

And I&#39;m going to let our friend Corey Hogan go first. Corey, earlier today, Jean Charest, former Premier of Quebec said that the federal liberals will not, they will not challenge Francois Legault&#39;s unvaxed tax, that it&#39;s not going to be something that they try to clamp down on. Do you agree? Will the feds try to do anything to Francois Legault&#39;s proposed policy solution of taxing the unvaccinated. No,</span>

Part of why Charest was so confident saying that is because as</span>
