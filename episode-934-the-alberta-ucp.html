Just, yeah, I mean, listen, Eden Mubarak, both of you, I know, Carter, you&#39;re new to the tradition. You still are not accepting the copies of the Quran that I leave at your front step.

I know you want to talk about it, but now I&#39;m just doing the exact same thing. No, I&#39;m over it now. I&#39;d like to talk about Frosty.</span>

            <span class="text">after DQ. Next week, Burger King Deep Dive. We&#39;re doing it, guys. We have to do it. Great. Let&#39;s let&#39;s move it on to our headlines, guys. We have got so much to cover, but of course, I&#39;m not going to skip the headlines that I find intriguing, that I find fascinating. And this one starts with The New York Times, where the Ohio lottery is to give five people a million dollar each to encourage vaccination. That&#39;s right. The many propositions that governments have used to bolster slumping demand for the vaccine in the United States. Well, Republican Governor of Michigan Mike DeWine of Ohio, I should say, raised the ante considerably on Wednesday, announcing that the state would give five people a million bucks in return for having been vaccinated as part of their weekly lottery program. Stephen Carter, we have talked about incentives. We&#39;ve talked about vaccine hesitancy. We&#39;ve talked about vaccine behavior. What do you think of this particular incentive proposed by the governor of Ohio? Ohio I&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m all in I think it&#39;s fantastic I think it&#39;s a great way of incenting behavior uh with with some with some folks that are uh gonna have some problematic issues uh it&#39;s also you know I I like the idea of thinking that this is worth something right like it&#39;s worth at least a lottery ticket as well as my my wellness and my health so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so I love it I would love for Alberta British Columbia one of the one of the provinces to give it a try especially somewhere like Alberta where we have super high vaccine hesitancy. For me, this is a great idea. Let&#39;s do it. I&#39;m in. We&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;re all about the lotteries and the gambling here. So it could very well fit with our thematic elements of Alberta. Corey, how pissed off would you be if you got your vaccination and then figured out that you were not eligible for the $1 million jackpot every week?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, not very, because I understand probability. But to the point about why this is actually maybe be not such a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a bad idea. People who are worried about the one in 100,000 chance of a bad reaction, why not offer them one in a million chance to get some cash, right? This is not a group of people that are by and large looking at the statistics and running this thing like a computer would. I don&#39;t know, however, that I would have offered a million dollars chance if you get it. I would have brought social pressure into this as well. And so I would have said, if your neighborhood hits 75 percent your</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">your neighborhood&#39;s entered and draw everybody in your neighborhood and i define it like a block yeah everyone on your block will</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">will get two hundred thousand dollars or something to that oh i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i like that a postal code sort of lottery almost i think a postal code would actually be small enough in the canadian context if i&#39;m not mistaken to like net out a decent amount if you&#39;ve got a split of a million bucks i&#39;m just thinking top of mind that&#39;s an interesting interesting interesting strategy, Corey. Carter, do you legitimately feel like an incentive like this could work in Canada? It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re a few paces behind in terms of our cycle. But if we get to this point, is this something to keep in mind quite legitimately?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it is. And think about the cost-benefit ratio. Let&#39;s say that you give away five $1 million prizes or one $5 million prize. It really is irrelevant. It&#39;s absolutely inconsequential when you consider the overall health budget and the costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. So it costs nothing. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And you might be able to get an uptick, let&#39;s say 5% uptick, an 8% uptick. That&#39;s a significant number of people who are getting their first and second vaccinations that could save you a lot of money down the road. For me, this is a perfect idea. Let&#39;s do it. Really, there is no downside except having to give away a couple million bucks, which in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in the overall scheme of government is inconsequential.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, do you want to add to that point around would you actually encourage policymakers to consider something in this neighborhood if and when Canada approaches a similar moment in time?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I would absolutely encourage them to look at incentives here. I think carrots and sticks is what you&#39;re going to need to do to get the kind of numbers that we&#39;re hoping to get. I&#39;m not 100% convinced that the lottery formulated the way they&#39;ve done it will have any material effect. But what I like about the United States always is that there are 50 crazy experiments. So let&#39;s see which states figure this out. Let&#39;s see if it has any material effect relative to their neighbor states, because maybe it&#39;s just a situation where you&#39;re paying $5 million to people who would have been vaccinated anyhow.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s a good point. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">figure that out. But let&#39;s look at incentives for sure. Let&#39;s find ways that we can encourage people and find whatever they&#39;re motivated by to get them to get jabbed to make us all safe.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move on to our next headline. And guys, we&#39;re going to get into the headlines almost in rapid fire succession because we&#39;ve got so many things to talk about. This one comes to us from Global News. Tori&#39;s delete tweet that slams one dose summer. OK, so you guys have seen the image. I can&#39;t describe the image, but maybe I&#39;ll leave it to one of you to kind of help describe it. And then tell me what you think happened. I mean, we&#39;ve covered social media, you know, airs of parties before. four. But Carter, can I leave it to you to maybe kind of describe this meme? And then let&#39;s talk about it very quickly in terms of why the conservatives put it out.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Sure. I mean, I think that the easiest way to describe it is that there was a two-dose summer, which had a number of very happy-looking, well, let&#39;s call them white people, all celebrating... Is that what we&#39;re calling them now? Okay. I think we should. I mean, I&#39;m not an expert in whiteness, but it appears to me that they are pretty damn white all celebrating uh the two-dose summer everything is great we can all be close together and then right underneath of it says the trudeau summer and it&#39;s got a person with a uh oxygen mask on it doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re uh</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and and the one dose summer is not good enough for canadians is the the caption of the tweet. So it was not seen necessarily as particularly politically correct or communications-wise particularly savvy.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, what was interesting about this tweet that they&#39;ve since deleted was a couple of things. You know, if you&#39;re on social media like us, you notice a few of these things. One of them was that it was a scheduled tweet. You could tell because exactly at a particular timestamp, like 8 a.m. So this must have gone through like a vetting process by some folks being like, yeah, put it in the queue, so to speak, right? Right. So this was not a off the cuff. Someone came up with an amazing idea that Trudeau kind of said one dose summer. So, you know, Trudeau sounds like Trudeau. And they kind of put it up. This was at least some form of vetting, which I thought was interesting because there&#39;s probably checks and balances to these things. And then the second thing was, you know, a question around which audience were they trying to play with? So those are just two observations from my mind. But I&#39;m curious to get your reaction to this mean tweet by the conservatives. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">how very charitable. You actually think they were playing to an audience and providing any strategic thought as they assembled this tweet.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">As you mentioned, it was part of a queue, or I mean, either that or it&#39;s the mother of all, I mean, mother of all coincidence. It&#39;s the one in 60 chance it&#39;s just going to be on the top of the hour. always right but um i i would suspect it was probably on the queue and um and that means it was probably at least on an editorial calendar a binder that gave somebody in authority the position say yep this looks good oh that&#39;s awesome yeah you&#39;ve nailed whatever it is oh you&#39;ve dunked on them or whatever yeah but uh to the point about dunking it</span>

            <span class="text">seems to me if this was for anybody this was for the base that would lap this up the people who are just looking for ways to dunk on Trudeau and find snide ways. This was a party-sanctioned version of Trudome or the Liberals or any of the other, you know, very weak sauce insults that are thrown around on social media that play entirely to a specific type of person. Because let me count the ways this was kind of bad. On execution, just the cheesiest fucking stock photo I&#39;ve ever seen. Like, what are these people doing? They&#39;re all kind of huddling around like they&#39;re playing invisible football uh with a bunch of like 25 something bar stars</span>

I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re making such a big deal out of it. It just does not feel like it is compared to the risk of the pandemic compared to the risk of other issues. This just does not feel like it&#39;s something I&#39;m going to worry about. Until it reaches the level of birth control risk. It&#39;s just something I&#39;m not going to care about. Corey,</span>

And do we want to be discouraging people from getting vaccines? It&#39;s, it&#39;s a bit befuddling to me. And frankly, if we&#39;re moving away from AstraZeneca, it just needs to be a much clearer communication. It can&#39;t be, you know, one-off decisions by provinces to act in different ways, NACI doing different things. We&#39;ve got,</span>

            <span class="text">Totally. Let&#39;s hit, let&#39;s hit a few more headlines very quickly. Next one comes to us from CTV. Minister backtracks on Bill C-10, says social media users will never be regulated. I mean, this bill has been a disaster from the beginning. We&#39;ve talked about it briefly in a few episodes ago. Stephen Carter, what do you think this kind of says about the minister here? I&#39;m just kind of curious from your communications lens, you know, was this a policy issue? Was this a communications issue? Now that the bill is held up, he couldn&#39;t really translate it all that well to Canadians in terms of what it was or was not supposed to do. I&#39;m quickly getting your thoughts on the minister here on this particular bill.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Either the minister didn&#39;t understand the file when he took it over, or he didn&#39;t have a real clear communication strategy. This did not work. It did not work from the beginning. It did not have simple talking points that he could stick to and understand. And based on the various discussions and the various times he&#39;s spoken to the bill, he has not been able to present a clear understanding of what this bill is designed to do, because I fear that this minister did not understand what this bill was designed to do. And that is a real problem if you&#39;re Justin Trudeau, because the prime minister&#39;s office can&#39;t do it all. This type of bill, this type of regulation of the internet shouldn&#39;t be that challenging. We&#39;ve covered it off here before. I think that there is a difference between a right speech and a right to broadcast. There is some sort of a line in</span>

I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s just putting up a podcast. I don&#39;t think we get to say whatever pops into our pretty little heads. I mean, we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, policy issue or communications issue? Many say that there should have been a slam dunk for the minister, a linear sort of approach with the sense, hey, listen, our rules are dated. They don&#39;t really accommodate for platforms and networking, and sorry, streaming giants. We need to make that happen. What do you think kind of happened here now that it&#39;s on hold or being held up, so to speak?</span>

            <span class="text">Communications were challenged, but you&#39;ve got to keep in mind that all problems manifest as communications. problems. And I think in this case, it&#39;s pretty easy to look at the policy and say, boy, they were not on firm or clear ground on that particular matter. The number of things that came up in the discussion where they changed what they were saying, like, yeah, no, we&#39;re not going to regulate social media users. Well, maybe we&#39;ll regulate big accounts. No, we would never regulate social media users.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s not really fundamentally a communications problem. They flip-flopped, and that that added to the chaos of it all similarly when we talk about the policy of all of this and the fact that they kicked so much of it to the crtc to regs that were unable to answer very obvious questions about how this could possibly be implemented and just basically said not even trust us but trust the crtc like let&#39;s let&#39;s figure this down the road that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s a half baked policy and and i think i said it at the time but beware when uh somebody comes and says we&#39;ll just figure it out in regs right yeah because even though there are i mean it&#39;s the reality of any bill you&#39;re going to put into the regulations more specificity than you would into the bill because bills only get opened every so often but you should be able to answer with a lot of clarity what those regulations would look like at that particular moment doesn&#39;t mean they need to be drafted yeah but i mean they weren&#39;t even there like they couldn&#39;t even speak to intent uh on the regulations or what was to come we</span>

            <span class="text">we we hear that a lot of the driving force behind this this bill was Quebec, you know, the politics in Quebec, the need for something like this in Quebec.

Nor is there the political desire to. I mean, sure, they may be wanting to do this for Quebec, But there&#39;s other things that they can give to Quebec that may mean more to the average Quebecer. This is not a policy that necessarily carries the election for them. And given the timelines get tighter and tighter, I would just go back to the budget and focus on the amount of money that&#39;s being spent and the money that&#39;s been left over that hasn&#39;t been spent.</span>

Trudeau did not break federal ethics rules in We Charity scandal, but Morneau did, says a new report. Mario Dion found that Bill Morneau violated conflict of interest provisions of three specific aspects, and that those findings were directly linked to the fact that Morneau&#39;s relationship with We Charity co-founder Craig Kuehlberger meets the definition of a quote-unquote friend under the rules.

            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m not. There is no case for it, because the the best case was made in the moment. And that was by the conservative leader when he said Bill Morneau&#39;s resignation is further proof of a government in chaos. And of course, that that conservative leader was Andrew Scheer. So he&#39;s gone. This is not something that&#39;s stuck. And I think that this is part of the reason that Scheer himself is gone, because they chased they chased issues that didn&#39;t matter. And so my recommendation to the conservatives, don&#39;t chase this. it&#39;s over it&#39;s done uh chase c10 that seems to be working chase um chase the budget chase uh chase what you can do for canadians but bill morneau is gone and these ethics violations come with no impact at all it&#39;s over move on cory</span>

            <span class="text">cory i want to ask you the same question you know one of the conservatives threads for a long time has been trudeau and his ethics these liberals and their fucking ethics this this would have proved to be a proof point of that i&#39;m sure they can still bring it up in the abstract. Help me make that point stronger for them if they want to bring up this narrative thread.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Liberals aren&#39;t sorry. The Liberals aren&#39;t apologizing for their ethics failings. They didn&#39;t fire Bill Morneau. Morneau, they just wanted to move behind the curtain. They tried to get him a cushy job elsewhere. In fact, as was reported in Blacklock&#39;s last month, they spent nearly $11,000 during a pandemic on hospitality and printing in order to try to get this guy the OECD job. I mean, it&#39;s madness to think that somehow Morneau was being punished. This is just another example of how when the spotlight gets too hot, the liberals try to give their buddies jobs somewhere in the dark. And that&#39;s all you&#39;re seeing here. And you should not give Justin Trudeau a pass for this. This is not ethical heroism. This is ethical failure at the highest stages. It wasn&#39;t bad enough that he had to be an ethical failure in Canada. He tried to make Bill Morneau the world&#39;s ethical failure by putting him in charge of the OECD.</span>

We record tonight on Thursday evening. The party caucus met Thursday evening to discuss a letter from former UCP caucus chair Todd Lowen, published announcing his resignation as chair and stating that Premier Jason Kenney was, quote unquote, causing dysfunction within the party. MLAs from the party voted to remove him as well as, wait for it, drumroll, Stephen Carter, True Barnes, of course, finally, from the government caucus in a statement issued by Mike Ellis, who&#39;s the party whip. He said members recognize the need for government caucus to remain strong and united behind our leader, Premier Jason Kenney, as we continue to fight through what looks to be the final stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. OK, guys, a lot to talk about. I mean, we had the letter in terms of timeline. First, in terms of how the letter was delivered. What was it, midnight, 1 a.m., something like that, like in the middle of the night, right? I think if we heard about it, we heard about 5, 6 a.m. when we were getting up in the morning. So timing, I want to talk about that. I don&#39;t want to actually bypass the entire letter conversation. Then the subsequent steps of an additional MLA coming and supporting this particular MLA, Todd Lowen. No real support for Jason Kenney from his caucus. I want to talk about whether that was strategy, whether that was happenstance, whether that was a directive by the Premier&#39;s office, whatever that was. Then we get into a caucus meeting that lasts several hours, leading into a vote later in the evening, where we find out the results of what I just mentioned, these two members, Drew Barnes and Todd Lowen, out of caucus. Corey, can we start with the letter? Or do you want to start somewhere else? Because I wanted to start with how the letter was delivered first. But maybe give me, before I jump into that, how bad is this for Jason Kenney, top line, and then let&#39;s jump into the mechanics of what happened over the course of the last 24 hours. Well,</span>

I&#39;m not convinced by the end of the recording of this podcast there hasn&#39;t been another major development that helps us to somewhat adjust things. What is clear, however, is that we&#39;ve moved into a different stage in the rebellion. So when we last talked about this, I made the comment, it&#39;s not real because nobody&#39;s putting their name to it. Well, Well, we got it. We got a name to it. We got it on MLA</span>

We can speculate with a moderate degree of confidence that not only was it not unanimous, but it was closer than the government is comfortable about because they did not release the numbers within caucus either. So it wasn&#39;t unanimous. That didn&#39;t make it into the news release.</span>

Carter, you feel like there&#39;s another shoe to drop. Corey, you&#39;re saying there could be. You know, Carter, talk to me more broadly. You&#39;ve seen this from the inside. Is this how premiers go down? Oh, like, because I&#39;m trying to reconcile your initial comment of today being good and not horrible for Kenny versus if we&#39;re in the middle of something where there&#39;s potentially other shoes to</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to drop, bridge the gap for me, my friend. No, the way that the way that premiers go down is when the people who are in their caucus take them down. The people who are outside your caucus can&#39;t do anything to you. Right. Right. The people who are outside of the caucus are sitting out there thinking about their next moves and how they&#39;re going to get reelected, forming their own party. They&#39;re not coming back in. So it&#39;s the people who are in the caucus that represent the real threat to you. So what what I&#39;m certain Kenny&#39;s concerned about right now are the six. What did you say, 60 that are left? Those 60 are, you know, they&#39;re more than enough to keep your majority. There&#39;s 16 more that can leave and you can still hold your majority government. But you have to make sure that those people aren&#39;t gunning for you because all of these things added together, like I said a number of episodes ago, the best thing that could happen to Kenny is that he kicks eight people out of his caucus and those eight people form a different party. And then he can start to shift into what does a true conservative government look like? A true conservative government that&#39;s concerned about the cost of health care, that doesn&#39;t want to see people&#39;s lives wasted for no particular purpose, that wants businesses to get back to being</span>

Maybe Jason Kenney came in and said, you know what, I don&#39;t want to run my caucus the way that Stephen Harper ran his caucus. Maybe I want to give more freedoms to people to speak out. I mean, it&#39;s the only thing that I could think of that explains the way he treated Drew Barnes and allowing Drew Barnes to be so hyper hypercritical of the premier and the government over the last two years. I mean, your point, Corey, is bang on.</span>

So that&#39;s what should have happened to Drew Barnes months ago. But I I think that, you know, is it possible that Jason Kenney said, I don&#39;t want to be like Harper, I want to, to allow more flexibility within my caucus. And, you</span>

            <span class="text">Well, let me project forward in the timeline. So let&#39;s assume that Corey&#39;s correct, that they wish to stay close and be able to take over the UCP. There are two timelines to do so. One is a relatively short timeline where the leader needs to be forced out and step down. In order to do that, you&#39;ll start to see some sort of letter-writing campaign from executives</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">timeline or they&#39;re on a different plan. So there&#39;s really three options. If you go with Corey&#39;s thesis, the first option is they&#39;re going to try and get rid of them right away and try and win the leadership right away, the results. Because you still have two years, tons of time to run a leadership, reestablish the leader, and win the next election. The second timeline is right—</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right— Can I stop you before you get to second? I need to clarify this for myself as I act as a proxy of the lister, okay? Carter, on option number one, finish off what the tactics are for a quick unseating of a leader, right? You said letter-writing campaigns. I interrupted you, and you said, yeah, they need to be specific. People need to put their names on them. What other pressure tactics get a premier to resign in scenario one? Just explain that tactically to me before you jump on to number two. Leadership</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Leadership review is the first tactic. You must get to the place of a leadership review. The second is an actual caucus revolt, where the caucus, including cabinet ministers, are talking about how this guy needs to go. That is what took Alison Redford out. She made it through the leadership review, but then she was unable to sustain through the actual caucus revolt because she kept committing errors. right so the errors right now um the the challenge that this timeline has is that the errors that are happening most of the caucus i don&#39;t think see them as errors i think most people most of the caucus recognize that the thing that is making kenny unpopular with the 13 or 15 mlas is the thing that&#39;s going to actually make him popular with albertans right stop this fucking pandemic So I think that those</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The second pathway, the second longer pathway is to wait until after the election. If he loses the next election, you take over the party. You&#39;re the leader. Now, it means you have to be in opposition for four years, but that&#39;s not all bad. You can take it back four years later. So that timeline is relatively simple. simple the third course of action of course was the idea that they&#39;d be forming their own party that reflects their actual values instead of their compromised values that a uh a combined party would have to by by its nature has to represent cory</span>

Call sheets for every constituency association president, call every single person in caucus, how was today for you? What did this mean? If this is reset, you guys have used the word reset or redux or whatever, something in that neighborhood. Is this where the guy that has been mythically known as a master or organizer pulls out those chops and quite literally enters campaign mode to ensure that he doesn&#39;t win the day, spends the time, spends the perhaps political capital and runway in public, just making sure everything is aligned and is rock solid.

And imagine that you&#39;re one of the caucus or one of the constituency presidents. You don&#39;t want to have a phone call from an issue manager. You want to have a phone call from the premier himself, because that makes you feel like you&#39;re valued. And at this stage, the premier needs to actually show that he values the people that ultimately make up the entire party. Now, you can&#39;t call 70,000 or 80,000 or 90,000 members. Party</span>

You have to be careful using the leader because people will lie to the leader, people will tell the leader the things they want to hear. But there are certainly times you want to deploy the leader. And I think certainly when you&#39;re talking about the caucus, for sure, it&#39;s Jason Kenney who needs to be making those calls. And maybe you&#39;ve got to be very careful with the the tone too i mean if i were jason kenney i would probably start each call with well this was a hell of a week wasn&#39;t it and i think we probably got a few things to talk about and um and you you cannot reek of weakness but you need to say like i i want to talk to you i want to hear more from you and um i you know carter i&#39;m really curious your thoughts on this i would be really hesitant about saying like i&#39;m gonna change i&#39;m gonna listen i&#39;m gonna do all of this more.

That&#39;s something you&#39;ve brought up in the past, where he&#39;s been kind of been playing in a box that isn&#39;t where kind of what he sold and what&#39;s got him to this position.

A lot of comparisons being made today in media around this sounding, feeling, sensing, smelling very similar to Premier Redford.

            <span class="text">the Premier should be doing something else this weekend instead of making these telephone calls. But if the Premier wishes to remain Premier, the Premier makes these telephone calls, right? You have to staff out the management of the pandemic so that you can focus on the management of your caucus. And the difference between where Jason Kenney is and where Alison Redford was, is that Alison Austin Redford, let these moments of festering continue, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? Something as simple as trying to have a pizza party night with their caucus. Just have five people come in and talk about what their issues are, what they&#39;re hearing. You bring in five MLAs that have a common regional or geographic issue. Or you bring in five MLAs that have a common concern for the post-secondary system. Or you bring in five MLAs that care about the health care system. I mean, you sit down, you have a pizza, and you talk about things. Those types of connections are the ones that are lost between the premier and the caucus. And it&#39;s all tried to be managed by a caucus chair or a caucus whip or caucus meetings that the premier himself or herself doesn&#39;t even attend.</span>

You simply cannot do it, especially when every one of those MLAs believes that they should be senior management.</span>

I will say, and this maybe as a bridge into Barnes and whatnot, sometimes two people storm off and say, I&#39;m going to start a parade and nobody follows. And that can happen for all sorts of different reasons. And so also don&#39;t assume that somebody is going to leave, because that&#39;s the other error you can make in this particular moment is say, well, did you see them? Do you see how they acted in that situation? And maybe they acted in a way that means you should keep your eye on them, but you shouldn&#39;t necessarily read deeply and negatively into everything.

He might have other friends and family on the sidelines waiting to help organize, endorse, do whatever, whether take over, as we&#39;ve talked about, and or form a new party how does he extend his strategic goals let me leave the question as broad as that what does he need to do tonight</span>

And it might be the more effective message to say, you got to stay in caucus, you got to stay in caucus, and you got to carry the message that we tried to carry. Obviously, we paid a price, but the price was worth being paid because we were carrying the right message. We were speaking for the people of Alberta. That telephone call should be made already to those 16. Some of them are going to be susceptible to that type of messaging. And that&#39;s</span>

And then I would probably take a look around and see who else is organizing, see what else is out there. Neither of these guys are involved, you know, would be involved with municipal politics necessarily, but there&#39;s, you know, certainly not in the two big cities. But there&#39;s right-wing groups that are forming. There&#39;s TPAs that are forming, third-party advertising groups that are forming. I would be making sure that I was reaching out to each of those TPAs and making sure that everybody in the various parties knows that you&#39;re a freelancer and you&#39;re open to talking. What I wouldn&#39;t be doing is going and licking my wounds. There&#39;s no time for that. There&#39;s time for movement only and action, and that&#39;s what these guys should be doing.</span>

Her message today very swiftly, as soon as this story broke late last night slash early this morning, technically, was saying this guy can barely govern. I&#39;m paraphrasing, can barely govern his party. How do we expect him to govern the province in the midst of COVID? She made a really clean example to the fact that where Todd Lowen is from, a writing that shares a name with her dad. out in Fairview that there&#39;s hospitals that don&#39;t necessarily even have enough doctors to staff them because of this party, that this is a government and a party that should be focused on Albertans, but instead they&#39;re focused on their own infighting. First of all, good message, bad message on what you heard from her and her party today. And more so than let&#39;s talk about Thursday to Sunday for her.</span>
