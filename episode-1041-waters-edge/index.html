        <p>The gang talk about foreign influence on elections, calls for inquiries on the same and what the parties leaders could do now to maximize outcomes for Canada, political upside or - in some cases - both. </p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about China's influence on Canadian elections and growing calls for a public inquiry on the same. Is an inquiry inevitable? Are Trudeau, Poilievre and Singh holding lit matches in a room soaked with gasoline? And did the gang really mention a movie other than Dave (1993)? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>PLUS: tickets to The Strategists' live show in Calgary on April 2, 2023 go on sale. Hilarity ensues.</em></p></blockquote>

I&#39;ll add plural, Stephen Carter, telling reporters that probes are already underway and are sufficient. This, of course, is on the heels of reporting by The Globe and Mail and by Global News, indicating many things that China interfered in our 2019 and 2021 elections, that there was a gift through a Chinese functionary given to the Trudeau Foundation of $200,000, which they have have recently returned, and that there were attempts for misinformation and disinformation campaigns, as well as localized tactics that tried to swing certain writings. Stephen Carter, we talked about this at the tail end of our last episode, the Patreon episode, and I want to kind of bring people into this. I got your guys&#39; top line thoughts, and I want to do that again, because today I want to spend the majority of this episode talking about the soup that Trudeau&#39;s in. Is it too hot? lot is it a soup that he can get out of is it a soup that he should try to get out of but stephen carter on the facts that you see right now the question i asked you last time how fucked is the prime minister let me ask you a different question to kind of make it even more zoomed out even more 30 000 feet um how fucked is the situation in</div>

I think that there are that that would be a very tricky thing for an outside for a foreign government to do. But I&#39;m not surprised that we&#39;re seeing allegations of foreign government interference in our elections. That&#39;s been ongoing. I mean, we&#39;ve seen Russia play in the United States. We&#39;ve seen Russia play across the Western world. I would imagine that Russia is playing in Canada in some fashion. We have enemies throughout the world that want to not necessarily influence the course of action within a specific outcome. We need Justin Trudeau or we need Pierre Pelletier. But what they want to do is sow distrust in the system. And they want to undermine democracy so that democracy becomes a less favorable form of government. And I&#39;m sure that they were active.

I mean, Corey mentioned the the ownership of media being largely American. Well, I mean, sure, he&#39;s talking about the newspapers, but where do we get our news from? You know, too many Canadians are consuming Fox News as though it&#39;s real news. I mean, we&#39;re seeing, you know, the complete, you know, we&#39;re seeing really behind the scenes right now with the Dominion voting scandal and how Fox News knew that it was lying to its viewers, but they were doing so for business reasons about the big fraud, about the big steal. deal. When you&#39;ve got an entire news network that&#39;s owned by a different country that is spewing filth within its country, but is consumed within our country, it&#39;s no question that it&#39;s going to actually have some impact. So I don&#39;t believe that just a few headlines saying that China&#39;s interfering in our election has done this. What we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve preset the soil. We&#39;ve tilled the soil with fox news for for two and a half years or two years that that this election has been stolen down in the states and</div>

You know, whether the Chinese have been successful in their, I know it&#39;s such a big question to ask, and there&#39;s a lot to unpack, but as we&#39;re in analysis mode, before we get into strategy mode, Carter makes a point that was definitely unearthed in the United States with Russian interference, which was the big sort of thrust of the Russian interference in the bot farms and the troll farms was to create the conditions that they knew the American public would respond to, that this was already a fractured, divided, polarized, use your word, electorate, and that if they prodded and poked them in certain ways, they would do the work for the Russians, that the Americans themselves with their current state of being would advance Russia&#39;s goals without even knowing it because their hatred of each other overarched or was greater than their hatred or their dislike like of any foreign actor or anything beyond the blue and the red. Your thoughts on, you know, the fact that we&#39;re having this conversation, perhaps a meta-narrative, but the fact that we&#39;re having this conversation this week at this particular volume and pace across the country, isn&#39;t that a metric of success to what Chinese interference could look like?</div>

I think that the better place to do this is behind closed doors with bureaucrats and experts that actually understand the nature of the internet, the nature of misinformation, the nature of promoted misinformation by state actors. These are all very complex issues that I think that, you know, you want, you know, the public always pretends that they have the ability to understand these things. They don&#39;t. They don&#39;t pay attention enough. And especially in today&#39;s partisan world, it&#39;s going to be grabbed onto by actors like Pierre Polyev, who aren&#39;t going to be acting in good faith, who only consider the outcome of the the next election, who don&#39;t think about the long term consequence. And they&#39;re going to grab this and turn it into a shit show that will benefit them at the cost of the country. And I say that wishing that it weren&#39;t true, but knowing in my heart that it is, because every time they have the opportunity to, to rise up and be nonpartisan, even for a moment, they haven&#39;t been able to find it within themselves to fight for that which is great for the country. Instead, they only fight for that which is great for themselves. And let&#39;s be very clear.</div>

          <div class="said">There are complicated issues at play here. I mean, we&#39;ve got right now the United States is looking at this Dominion voting issue, but they&#39;re also looking at how whether or not publishers or whether or not internet providers Like TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter are actually publishers, like a newspaper, or if they&#39;re like, just like a bookstore, right? They&#39;re not responsible for what is published on what is being available and being sold. And what is happening is that because Facebook has an algorithm that changes the way that we see things, that Facebook algorithm is ultimately responsible for a significant amount of the misinformation that is promoted and provided to people. And it&#39;s not just Facebook, it&#39;s Google, it&#39;s YouTube, especially, you know, your what&#39;s next recommendations are oftentimes very much leading you down a rabbit hole, because that&#39;s where they found they can get the most viewers and keep them for the longest period of time. the american capitalist dream is draining us of the ability to communicate effectively and cory and i&#39;ve had this argument before right he&#39;s always pointed back to uh and i&#39;ll let you clear it up afterwards cory i&#39;m not going to make you live in my words but the media has was very clean for like 15 minutes of our history right it was very clean from like the 19 late 1940s to the early 1990s, maybe, depending on how you view the 1980s. That&#39;s nothing. That&#39;s a blip. When you looked at before, newspapers were torqued, absolutely torqued.

And in some ways, their desire to want, Corey, as you&#39;ve mentioned on the last show, you know, you kind of made an argument that this is above partisan politics, that we should have this moment here, that the prime minister should take this moment. I&#39;ll get to his response and what he should do shortly to kind of try to park the partisanship. In some ways, the best thing China can ask for is that this kind of takes on the partisan divides and the fractures that they have, once again, perhaps want us to pound on. They want us to, in certain cases, pound on. But respond to Carter in his no for a public inquiry. And then, Corey, I know you&#39;re going to hate it, but I&#39;m going to get into the parties and the players. Because to Carter&#39;s point, Pierre has said Justin Trudeau is bought and paid for by China for the last 10 years. Jagmeet Singh is saying is that his minority government support for Trudeau perhaps might hinge on whether Trudeau calls a public inquiry. So there are politics here. But Corey, before that, respond to Carter on his no for a public inquiry in the face of your yes.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, well, first off, I think Russia wanted chaos. I&#39;m not entirely convinced China wants chaos like that, you know, China, China wants to a certain a certain authority and to get its way. But chaos is not really China&#39;s game by and large, right? So I think we have to draw a distinction between the various actors that are out there and what their motivations might be. And that&#39;s important, because those motivations matter, as we start thinking about where where the next attack vector may be and what we might need to shore up against, right? And so that needs to be put out there here. Stephen said he doesn&#39;t think an inquiry makes sense because, you know, you&#39;ll get better analysis internally. And I would say, yes, you will get more sophisticated analysis internally. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s better when I think about what my worries about this are. Because again, I don&#39;t think an election has actually flipped because of this. I am worried about the poison in the overall body politic. I&#39;m worried about, yes, just one poll that shows A pile of conservatives now thinking the last election was stolen on basically one data point. And Stephen&#39;s right. The pump&#39;s been primed forever based on the U.S. conversation. But I&#39;m worried about that. And let&#39;s be clear about Stephen&#39;s let&#39;s be clear. He said let&#39;s be clear. You know, Pierre Poliev&#39;s been acting in a very partisan fashion. The liberals look pretty fucking partisan here. The liberals were given advice at different points over the past five years that China might be involved and influence elections to their benefit.</div>

          <div class="said">And they seem to have ignored it. And I do wonder if the if the advice had come down that China was trying to influence elections to the conservatives benefit, whether they would have taken the same approach. And I think that&#39;s a fair question, and I think it&#39;s the kind of question that you do not get to the bottom of by asking the bureaucrats to look at it. That&#39;s the kind of thing that requires an inquiry. You need to look at whether the government acted in an appropriate fashion when it was faced with the facts of the day. Now, maybe they&#39;ve got good reasons for taking the actions they did or the actions they didn&#39;t take, but I don&#39;t trust the liberals to tell me they did. I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t, and nobody should. Liberals shouldn&#39;t. That way leads to ruin. And that is a madman strategy to say, I&#39;m going to let these foxes tell me the hen house is fine.</div>

          <div class="said">you know, this public inquiry, you know, how far is it going to be able to delve into, like, there&#39;s certain practicalities that will need to be addressed. How far will the public inquiry be allowed to delve into matters of national security? How would you differentiate between items of political importance and items of national security. Because ultimately, when we&#39;re talking about working with foreign governments, we&#39;re no longer talking about just simple politics as usual. We&#39;re now talking about issues that will have national security ramifications. And doing that type of conversation in public is generally contraindicated because we don&#39;t want the public to know. No, we don&#39;t want the other side to know what we know about them. We may not even want to know. We may not want China to know that they know what they&#39;re doing. We know what they&#39;re doing. Now that&#39;s public. Is that what we actually wanted? Does that make sense? The leak that came out was a leak for a reason. It&#39;s because it&#39;s not like we&#39;ve gone out and released this information for public consumption because we think that that&#39;s in the best interest of everybody in Canada. It&#39;s not. Um, it&#39;s probably in our best interest that bureaucrats and, uh, uh, diplomats try and figure out how we&#39;re going to deal with China, um, spying on our country, uh, trying to influence our elections and trying to create outcomes that they find desirable, um, using, uh, very, uh,</div>

And so if they were briefed, then the prime minister&#39;s office has the opportunity to roast them, to absolutely just burn them, to point to all the meetings where they were briefed on this scenario. Clearly, because that hasn&#39;t happened, one has to assume that the opposition wasn&#39;t briefed. The only way you&#39;re going to get to avoid a public inquiry is to share all the information that you have with the party leaders and their designated critics to ensure that the information and it needs to be shared in a confidential fashion. That&#39;s the only way that this actually proceeds. If it is held internally, if it is continued to be held by the liberals, then they are heading towards a public inquiry. There is no question. They will ultimately have to fail and they may lose their government if they don&#39;t, in fact, go that direction. So,</div>

And the problem is now the expectations are going to continue moving past him until he has no choice but an inquiry. And, you know, we&#39;ve talked about this before, and it&#39;s worth saying again, because it&#39;s good advice just in general for life, but certainly in politics, which is don&#39;t spend two weeks defending the indefensible, right? Issues management 101, crisis management 101. The first thing I always I always say to my clients, you know, my bosses, anything like that when we&#39;re working on a crisis is, OK, but are we wrong? Right. Think about it in terms of, you know, policy and process and content and all of those things. And you say, all right, but but are we actually wrong? Because everybody has an instinct when they&#39;re under attack to to defend. Right. It&#39;s this fight or flight that&#39;s there. And if you&#39;re not fighting, you&#39;re fighting. And if you&#39;re saying all of a sudden they&#39;re wrong, fuck them. We&#39;re right. You start digging in your heels only to find two weeks later you have no choice. You&#39;ve just bloodied yourself for two weeks for nothing. And so you&#39;ve got to put your ego aside. You&#39;ve got to say, what&#39;s the best way out of this? Where do we ultimately think this is going to land? Do we reasonably think we can head off the things that the other people are calling for? And if not, fail fast.

And now, unfortunately, we I think we do need to deal with this through some sort of public mechanism, because unfortunately, otherwise, like, where does it go away? If there&#39;s one thing we&#39;ve learned about, I don&#39;t know, like the last 30 years is you we are no longer in a place where you can negotiate away a movement. And I actually think the perfect example of this was the 2011 when Danielle Smith tried to cross from the Wild Rose with the Wild Rose Caucus to the PC party of Jim Prentiss. And ultimately, it didn&#39;t work. And the Wild Rose continued to exist because it&#39;s not about leaders. It&#39;s not about individual people. It&#39;s about the mob. It&#39;s about this crowd of people online who have already staked out ground. And it&#39;s a living, organic thing.

Both of you, in your optimal strategy for Trudeau, have a conversation with the other party leaders. Where you guys diverge, Corey thinks the inevitability is you come out, you call it together, that&#39;s your optimal scenario.

You know, the amount of foreign investment that we saw from China that Stephen Harper&#39;s, you know, stick handled into the country was significant. And at the time, heralded. And now they&#39;re the ones that are going to stand strong against China. I mean, that&#39;s almost ludicrous on its face. But that&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re in government for a while. Everything becomes possible and you start to wear all these scenarios. scenarios and that to me is is the challenge that the trudeau is facing i don&#39;t necessarily think that trudeau has been weak on china um so much as i think that it is plausible that people think that trudeau has been weak on china and therefore it creates havoc in the future so i i&#39;m i think that that&#39;s trudeau&#39;s great weakness in the future is is that all of this could be plausible and that creates havoc.</div>
