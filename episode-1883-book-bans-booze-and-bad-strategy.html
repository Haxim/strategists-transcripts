Well, he is addressing Carney&#39;s cabinet. Carney and team say he was invited to share his U.S. trade policy insights ahead of next year&#39;s Cosmo review. But Project 2025, for those that are not in the know, initially Trump distanced himself from it and then now has almost wholly embraced it, elevating traditional family values, restricting abortion, dismantling federal departments.

But I think if you&#39;re an arrogant prime minister&#39;s office, you&#39;ll feel more pain because you&#39;ll just go running headfirst into the wall and not even look to see that it&#39;s there. And I feel that this one might might fall into the uh into the arrogant category we can get away with anything um because we are uh what we&#39;re trying to achieve is in the common good that it it is where i fell off on my fine right i just think that you know that was that&#39;s arrogance that makes me go to a position where i can&#39;t say that it&#39;s fine i want to be able to say it but i can&#39;t because this is just so rough and i think that it&#39;s born into hubris uh and the hubris of the of the carney government at this point i mean in fairness they&#39;re not going to suffer that much um because there&#39;s no one really to force them to suffer i don&#39;t think polyev&#39;s going to force them to suffer and the federal ndp isn&#39;t there so the suffering is probably going to be fairly minimal but this type of self-inflicted wound does have the ability to fester but</span>

Never get involved in something that your opponent&#39;s already doing for you. So wait for the teacher strike. There&#39;s tons of opportunity to start pre-messaging on that, to start really working. The ATA, I think, is doing an okay job on their communications, but could be doing better. The NDP can pick up on those communications and really start to crystallize what it is the teachers are fighting for, and they don&#39;t have to jump in on this particular one.

And so, you know, when you&#39;re focused on silly stuff and you&#39;re not focused on funding classrooms, hiring teachers, doing all the things, you just got day after day after day of validators, of earned media, of, you know, like once you&#39;ve got some research amassed, I would hope they do, right, to kind of say, oh, look at this school. This is how many kids they have, you know, and it was supposed to be replaced three years ago, and it wasn&#39;t, and yada, yada, and on and on.

Carter, there&#39;s a bit of right wing outrage, as Shannon alluded to, regarding the threshold that you were mentioning of 50 percent who are not cisgendered men. Is this fine? Is this fabulous or is this fucked for the party? You could think of it as fine in the sense that this has been convention for this party. And you correct me if I&#39;m wrong.

And you could argue, Carter, that this is also a party that could use more cisgender males, at least as part of its voting coalition, and perhaps even in its candidates. So it&#39;s like, it&#39;s a tension that I can, I can sense the tension. And I suspect that tension is going to present itself, even in the coalitions that form in this leadership race in some way, shape, or form.

Teachers have rejected a 12% wage increase, citing respect workload and social policy grievance. In addition, as I&#39;ve mentioned in in the previous segment, there&#39;s these new provincial rules on pronouns, sports eligibility, and of course, the book ban, as we just chatted about, that are kind of further fueling this discontent, this anger, this fuck you-ness with the provincial government. My frame here is not the government. My frame here is for the ATA and the union, okay? Just so we&#39;re clear. So that&#39;s the frame we&#39;re looking at. Stephen Carter, give me your go. Is this fine, the position they&#39;re in right now? Is this fabulous? Or is this fucked? And I know there&#39;s many considerations around around parents and the ramifications around that, the timing, the opposition, the government. But from a strategy perspective, are they fine in this moment? Is this a fabulous position to be in?</span>
