Did the first minister's conference go as planned? And will the #APEChottie go grey on the sides first or turn completely silver?

          <div class="said">you. Yeah, I think it&#39;s a great plan. And what excites me, I think, is the realism, the pragmatism. What the NDP did is they appointed a panel led by Andrew Leach, an economist at the University of Alberta, who took like a really, really smart approach to it. But basically, rather than creating targets, which is what pretty much every person who&#39;s created a plan in the past has done and then failed to meet those targets, they took an approach that was designed to, as they put it, bend the curve. So change the economics of carbon production and create a toolkit that the government could then reach into down the road as other jurisdictions catch up. So interesting stats from that. And I&#39;m going to mangle them a bit because they&#39;re not in front of me right now. But when you look at industries that are defined as carbon-intensive and when you look at industries defined as export-intensive, what you find is that the Venn diagram middle, industries that are both carbon-intensive and export-intensive, Ontario, it&#39;s like 2%. BC, it&#39;s like 2% of their economy. Quebec, 2% or sub-2% in all these cases. Alberta is 18%. That&#39;s a lot. And because of that, we are particularly susceptible to the economics changing the economics, right? Right. You change a bit about the carbon pricing and all of a sudden the sky can fall. And what Leach said was after going through that whole process, he was actually a little more sanguine than he went in, kind of thinking before we should go harder and we should be a leader. And I think he still wants to position Alberta as a leader. But what he&#39;s done is he&#39;s given Alberta the tools to be a leader now</div>

          <div class="said">absolutely because i think that this ultimately will tie back into market access and we can talk about that later um but the second group of people is that it changed the carbon uh reduction strategy from just industry to uh pushing a little bit onto all albertans right every albertan will pay a carbon tax on their own emissions uh and that&#39;s interesting because that hadn&#39;t been done that&#39;s been done in british columbia but</div>

          <div class="said">but it hasn&#39;t been done in in alberta was we had a carbon tax here but it was only for large emitters. And this now puts the burden and shares the burden across the economy at the same level. The third group of stakeholders, I think, is industry itself. Industry was very concerned when a new Democrat government came in that they would be forced to bear the brunt of the cost of carbon. And yeah, they&#39;re still responsible for a large part of carbon costs, but they are now now less likely to have to carry it alone. And I guess the fourth stakeholder has to be the coal industry. By essentially saying we&#39;re phasing out coal by 2030, which I think is actually, a lot of it&#39;s going to be offline way before that.</div>

But the reason why that&#39;s so fascinating, I think, to me, the the oil and gas response is of course they&#39;re overjoyed the carbon levy was set to go to 30 dollars a megaton in 2017 anyways this sets carbon&#39;s price the carbon tax at 30 a ton this is as much as anything a rebranding and a let&#39;s all share the burden exercise of the government really clever in my in my opinion i also think because they&#39;ve now done this in such a way that keeps the money in the province it&#39;s also a bit of an opportunity to do that you know the word has become almost pejorative or the phrase, but social engineering, right? Now we can take the money that comes from that carbon tax and we can redistribute based on need. So one of the big problems in Alberta, in my opinion, is our very flat tax structures.</div>

I think there are a lot, and frankly, the polls show it, there are a lot of Albertans who just believe it&#39;s the moral imperative to act. We need to act, and we need to do it. But so she&#39;s not going to be judged on whether or not there&#39;s a pipeline to the West or the East in 2019 by the people who she needs to vote for her anyhow. For me, it comes back to how she&#39;s going to use that money to help the lower income Albertans. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s full stop. Because not only does she have an opportunity to say, see, this doesn&#39;t hurt you, but we&#39;re talking about refund checks. They are going to literally get a check from the government of Alberta that&#39;s like, your government loves you. Here&#39;s some money.</div>

How can you tell the people of Alberta this is going to actually address the market access question? What are you doing to ensure that investors aren&#39;t fleeing the province of Alberta and the companies that need to have investment for growth? We&#39;re talking about growing the oil sands by 45%.

And so I would start taking that off the table for them. I&#39;d start saying things like, well, absolutely, and that money should go to innovation, but it can&#39;t go back to the rebates the way you&#39;re talking. The carbon tax does not work if you charge someone $30 a ton and then give them a subsidy of $30 a ton. Can&#39;t happen. Start making those options less and the choices less comfortable and the hurt more real for the NDP&#39;s base. and you can do that with an intellectually honest approach i just don&#39;t think any of the parties are going to do that and i think the ndp are going to run circles around them on that front well</div>
