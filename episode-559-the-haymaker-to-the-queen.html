            <span class="text">well let&#39;s start off by saying how brilliant it was to release it the day before the first minister&#39;s conference so essentially the first first minister&#39;s conference and i don&#39;t know how many years cory yeah it&#39;s at least</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And listen, 24 hours before it happens, Rachel Notley and Shannon Phillips, Minister of Environment here in Alberta, roll out a massive</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">massive climate change policy that depending on who you talk to is either the best thing ever or the best thing ever. so because because if you&#39;re talking to industry it&#39;s the best thing ever if you&#39;re talking to the environmentalist is the best thing ever now it&#39;s what&#39;s interesting is of course when you kind of break through that first veneer of it&#39;s the best thing ever you find a lot of doomsday uh scenarios a lot of people talking about uh maybe some of this isn&#39;t as good as it appears but rolling it out before the first ministers conference changed the way that alberta is viewed yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in the eyes of of uh canada and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and the way that canada is veered there&#39;s a new york times article today talking about how canada is has in one month reversed its entire focus on climate change okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">okay so before we get into this and carter thanks for teeing us up there because i want to talk local national international i want to talk about the industry cory give us some basic facts about what this plan is why now and why does this particular plan reframe alberta and more specifically as As Carter was saying, reframe Canada going forward. What about it excites you? Because I know it does excite you.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you. Yeah, I think it&#39;s a great plan. And what excites me, I think, is the realism, the pragmatism. What the NDP did is they appointed a panel led by Andrew Leach, an economist at the University of Alberta, who took like a really, really smart approach to it. But basically, rather than creating targets, which is what pretty much every person who&#39;s created a plan in the past has done and then failed to meet those targets, they took an approach that was designed to, as they put it, bend the curve. So change the economics of carbon production and create a toolkit that the government could then reach into down the road as other jurisdictions catch up. So interesting stats from that. And I&#39;m going to mangle them a bit because they&#39;re not in front of me right now. But when you look at industries that are defined as carbon-intensive and when you look at industries defined as export-intensive, what you find is that the Venn diagram middle, industries that are both carbon-intensive and export-intensive, Ontario, it&#39;s like 2%. BC, it&#39;s like 2% of their economy. Quebec, 2% or sub-2% in all these cases. Alberta is 18%. That&#39;s a lot. And because of that, we are particularly susceptible to the economics changing the economics, right? Right. You change a bit about the carbon pricing and all of a sudden the sky can fall. And what Leach said was after going through that whole process, he was actually a little more sanguine than he went in, kind of thinking before we should go harder and we should be a leader. And I think he still wants to position Alberta as a leader. But what he&#39;s done is he&#39;s given Alberta the tools to be a leader now</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">now and in the future. right? By essentially creating a toolkit of carbon taxes and policy initiatives that are available to the government to keep the money in Alberta, to price carbon and to ramp that up as time goes on. Okay, that helps. Tell</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Tell me this, Stephen Carter, who are the real stakeholders for this? Because that seems to be up for debate right now. You&#39;re talking international and national. Who did she do this for primarily? Because Albertans at large are now going to face the burden of this this tax that&#39;s coming upon them not just industry anymore but who did she actually do this for in your mind disagree with that but let&#39;s get to that well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well okay i think that it was actually it&#39;s a very broad stakeholder group i mean i think that uh the first stakeholder is the population of canada she wanted to actually uh design a program that the people of canada could look at and say hey hey alberta is a little bit different so you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">canada deliberately above alberta in that case that&#39;s a deliberate choice of words absolutely</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">absolutely because i think that this ultimately will tie back into market access and we can talk about that later um but the second group of people is that it changed the carbon uh reduction strategy from just industry to uh pushing a little bit onto all albertans right every albertan will pay a carbon tax on their own emissions uh and that&#39;s interesting because that hadn&#39;t been done that&#39;s been done in british columbia but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but it hasn&#39;t been done in in alberta was we had a carbon tax here but it was only for large emitters. And this now puts the burden and shares the burden across the economy at the same level. The third group of stakeholders, I think, is industry itself. Industry was very concerned when a new Democrat government came in that they would be forced to bear the brunt of the cost of carbon. And yeah, they&#39;re still responsible for a large part of carbon costs, but they are now now less likely to have to carry it alone. And I guess the fourth stakeholder has to be the coal industry. By essentially saying we&#39;re phasing out coal by 2030, which I think is actually, a lot of it&#39;s going to be offline way before that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The coal industry, of course, is the ones that now feel like they&#39;re picking up the cost. They&#39;re the ones who are shouldering the burden of reducing carbon output in Alberta. And I think that that&#39;s a bit of a false argument. We&#39;re the last group to finally address coal-generated electricity. It&#39;s, I mean, oh, hold on, check that, Saskatchewan.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">Well, no, I mean, it&#39;s not a story. Every Albertan would instantly know what you were talking about. But the reason why that&#39;s so fascinating, I think, to me, the the oil and gas response is of course they&#39;re overjoyed the carbon levy was set to go to 30 dollars a megaton in 2017 anyways this sets carbon&#39;s price the carbon tax at 30 a ton this is as much as anything a rebranding and a let&#39;s all share the burden exercise of the government really clever in my in my opinion i also think because they&#39;ve now done this in such a way that keeps the money in the province it&#39;s also a bit of an opportunity to do that you know the word has become almost pejorative or the phrase, but social engineering, right? Now we can take the money that comes from that carbon tax and we can redistribute based on need. So one of the big problems in Alberta, in my opinion, is our very flat tax structures.</span>

But right now, the oil sands produce 70 megatons. The cap is 100. So there&#39;s a lot of room. And I think that if anything, this is, again, one of those optics things. It could be changed. It could be adjusted. But who knows how they&#39;re going to do it. I would suspect it will be something like a cap-and-trade where they effectively auction these off. And not just for new people, but for existing people as well. But who knows? Who knows?

Let&#39;s talk about the execution of the plan going forward. Who do you say? You said industry. You said consumers, everyday Albertans, voters, et cetera. Who is the primary stakeholder going forward? Who does she need to smooth things out with first and foremost? Tell us the strategy if you were directing it for this plan going forward today onwards.

And I know that while that was a broader coalition than most people think, that the most stable part of that is probably higher education. So there&#39;s a gap in like desire to get involved in social changes, right? People used to call it the post-material stage, right? Right. You get so much money, you don&#39;t really care and you&#39;re willing to support a cause that you think is right. And there&#39;s kind of really in the middle where you&#39;re your true middle class, where you&#39;re most likely to be susceptible and skeptical to to some of these bigger social programs. Right. But get those lower income Albertans protected with some some things on that side. Get the environmentalists with a lot of money on board by just saying effectively you&#39;ve got to pay. And if you don&#39;t like it, you&#39;re probably not part of my coalition anyhow. out and then just ease it through the middle. Find a way that you can make their employers not so nervous about it. And that&#39;s really, I think that coal for me is the big one. I think oil and gas is just saying, this is great. We&#39;ve got a price. This is fine. When you look at it in a global context, who cares? Coal, however, with a hard phase out date and the impact of the $30 ton, that</span>

I think there are a lot, and frankly, the polls show it, there are a lot of Albertans who just believe it&#39;s the moral imperative to act. We need to act, and we need to do it. But so she&#39;s not going to be judged on whether or not there&#39;s a pipeline to the West or the East in 2019 by the people who she needs to vote for her anyhow. For me, it comes back to how she&#39;s going to use that money to help the lower income Albertans. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s full stop. Because not only does she have an opportunity to say, see, this doesn&#39;t hurt you, but we&#39;re talking about refund checks. They are going to literally get a check from the government of Alberta that&#39;s like, your government loves you. Here&#39;s some money.</span>

How can you tell the people of Alberta this is going to actually address the market access question?

Now, whatever you make of it, they have done that. They have started proposing a few things. But, Corey, I want to go to you.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;d be starting to narrow the government&#39;s options. And the government has all of this money that they can use to smooth over the bad of the carbon tax. And so I would start taking that off the table for them. I&#39;d start saying things like, well, absolutely, and that money should go to innovation, but it can&#39;t go back to the rebates the way you&#39;re talking. The carbon tax does not work if you charge someone $30 a ton and then give them a subsidy of $30 a ton. Can&#39;t happen. Start making those options less and the choices less comfortable and the hurt more real for the NDP&#39;s base. and you can do that with an intellectually honest approach i just don&#39;t think any of the parties are going to do that and i think the ndp are going to run circles around them on that front well</span>

That was her only choice. I mean, all politics is local, and she could not possibly have announced after she came back when the prime minister says we all need to act more. That would make her look like she was carrying his water. But I think she can&#39;t overplay that hand. I think she&#39;s just got to let Trudeau have his moment in Paris, and then she can pick back up on the other side.</span>

I mean, to have the New York Times writing about an attitudinal shift in Canada around climate change, that&#39;s coming out of Alberta. That is her move, her outcome. And she has now nationally and internationally made things different. Now, if I&#39;m Justin Trudeau, I might be a little bit ticked, but he still carried the day on his First Minister&#39;s Conference. He didn&#39;t lose a ton of media. It wasn&#39;t like it was a zero-sum game where Notley won, ergo Trudeau lost. Trudeau did just fine on his First Minister&#39;s Conference because</span>

And let&#39;s start by giving me a rating, 1 to 10, based on where you guys think Justin Trudeau performed on some of these issues or events. The first one, let&#39;s just get right into it, the First Minister&#39;s Conference. Corey, 1 to 10, what do you think his rating was and why? I</span>

Don&#39;t forget that. And I think that does sort of remind us that when you&#39;re a prime minister, and one of the reasons why Harper never did this is First Minister&#39;s Conference by name implies that the premiers are on the same level as the prime minister, right?</span>
