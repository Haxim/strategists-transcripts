        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about 751 unmarked graves at Marieval Indian Residential School, the appropriateness (or not) of Canada Day celebrations and Carolyn Bennett texting Jody Wilson-Raybould and much more. How do we sustain a national conversation on reconciliation? How - and why - do independent MPs get re-elected? And what is the proper unit of measurement for tuna? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  And last, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

So let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Oh No Canada. Guys, Aaron O&#39;Toole has accused activists of quote-unquote tearing down Canada after towns across the country have cancelled Canada Day events. Now, these calls are getting louder and broader across the country after the events of today, unsurprisingly, with the discovery of these unmarked graves. But let me give you some context, and let&#39;s talk about the politics here. Conservative leader Aaron O&#39;Toole today said he&#39;s troubled by the cancellation of Canada Day celebrations in some municipalities and accused a, quote, small group of activist voices of continually talking down the country rather than acknowledging its many successes. In a speech at the final Conservative caucus meeting before the House of Commons, he said that while Canada&#39;s history is littered with injustice and wrongdoing, that doesn&#39;t justify cancelling the nation&#39;s birthday, a time to give thanks for living in the greatest country in the world.

There&#39;s a call to cancel Canada. Let&#39;s move the spotlight off O&#39;Toole for a second. I really like this frame that Corey&#39;s talking about. Let&#39;s add some definition. Let&#39;s add some real, maybe heft or focal point to Canada Day. How do you go about doing that, Carter? And how do you go about doing it in a way that doesn&#39;t make you seem politically opportunistic? Like, oh, there&#39;s a call by activists that&#39;s spotlighting one of the darkest chapters of our collective history. Let me do what I do well, which is symbols, and try to add some definition to Canada Day. How does one actually achieve this transformation or what could it look like from the confines of government?

Some of the days needed to shift to reflect the traditions of the country before it was a country in the in the in the European sense of the of that word.

You know, a generation&#39;s issues cannot be just solved with a stroke of a pen, that that advocacy and activism was required. If you were advising people to get loud, as you have said in the previous segment, Carter, in our introduction, would you advise them to rally around Canada Day as like that wedge to make that point, to make this serious, to make politicians act or no?

          <div class="said">i&#39;m going to leave that segment there let&#39;s move it on to our next segment single shingle i want to talk about the lone uh independent mp out in vancouver the former justice minister jody wilson raybould i want to talk about her a little bit more broadly but i&#39;m going to use the incidents of today if i can call it that in the exchange for today that she had with uh crown and indigenous relations minister carolyn bennett uh so So there&#39;s a bit of context here. Jody Wilson-Raybould put out a tweet saying that, you know, Justin Trudeau, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here because I don&#39;t have the tweet in front of me, but saying Justin Trudeau, rather than trying to jockey for an election, should implement the, you know, massive legislation regarding Indigenous rights that he has promised. She then got a text message from the minister, Carolyn Bennett, aforementioned, with a question that attached that tweet and a question that said pension, question mark. She screencapped that tweet. She put it on Twitter. The context around pension, question mark, just so everyone is aware, as we&#39;ve discussed on this show, there is a calculus perhaps around going to an election before October because those who serve six years as members of parliament as of October are qualified for their federal pension. And that number out of a House of 300 plus is somewhere in the 150. So there&#39;s a long list of individuals, independents, liberals, conservatives across the board that are impacted by going to the polls before October. If they go and win and come back, it&#39;s not an issue. But for those that lose, they don&#39;t get access to that pension. So that&#39;s the that&#39;s the preamble. That&#39;s the context here. This, of course, blew up. Jody Wilson-Raybould taking this screenshot, posting it online, criticizing the minister who was her former colleague of racism, saying that, you know, this leans into a trope where all Indigenous people, all they care about is money, et cetera, et cetera. The minister then responds. Let&#39;s talk about this issue first, and then let&#39;s talk about Jody Wilson-Raybould, because that&#39;s what I want to spend this segment on. On the issue, Corey, I&#39;ll go to you first on this. um clearly</div>

Like you&#39;ve got a former Liberal Cabinet Minister running in Vancouver, Granville, clearly a name that many people in the political class know. She&#39;s done well for herself in the last, you know, six months, you know, coming out with the book announcements, getting into the media a few times with, you know, today&#39;s story, aligning herself to Annamie Paul, as we discussed last week on her criticisms of Justin Trudeau. But I want to talk about the strategy here for an independent MP and maybe one that has almost her unique profile, which is, how does she kind of come out ahead? And what does it look like for her if she&#39;s running her style of race? I know we are going to discuss political strategy of every political party, but I find it fascinating to discuss the strategy of a single MP here, especially one that&#39;s got this national profile. And I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve had any upfront or top line thoughts if you were advising her on her race. race?</div>

Even if you&#39;re a third party, you can kind of aspire either to be in government or significantly influence things. We have had situations in recent history where independent MPs have changed the balance of power in Parliament. So I&#39;m not going to say that never happens, but it&#39;s not very likely that your independent MP is going to kind of wield any sort of power. So in many ways, they are quite often a protest vote, a protest vote against the party in power, a protest vote against the system, saying this is somebody who I think represents me better than any of the options that actually have a chance of governing here. And it&#39;s a big middle finger to the entire apparatus that is government. So, if that is the case, like, let&#39;s just say, accept that as a hypothesis for a moment, then that&#39;s the job of an independent MP. It&#39;s to stand up and call the system bullshit and to call out moments like this when a liberal cabinet minister with a great deal of power fires a text of pension, question mark, suggesting that would be the rationale at a moment when there&#39;s so much rationale for holding off on an election.

We&#39;re going to a story coming out of, well, no other place, Corey. It&#39;s Ottawa, the center of the world. The Liberal Caucus Office has hired a firm that helps run the party&#39;s digital campaign. I want to talk about this. So the Liberal Research Bureau, a taxpayer-funded office that supports the Trudeau government MPs, used parliamentary money to hire a company that plays a key role in re-electing Liberal candidates. This same company, Data Sciences Incorporated, runs the digital operation, the ads, the website, the whole overarching support for the federal campaigns and has been doing so for the last few of them at least. East. It&#39;s run by a close friend of the prime minister&#39;s. And simultaneously, the same firm is providing support to not just the Liberal Party, but this public taxpayer-funded Liberal Research Bureau to the tune of $75,000 to provide IT support and back-end office support. I don&#39;t want to talk about an HR and procurement contract here, but what I do want to talk about is this sort of relationship. And I think that&#39;s probably the right word, Corey, relationship between party and taxpayer funded extension of the party, what maybe even some MPs feel it&#39;s that, versus relationship between this firm and the prime minister, very close with the individual that runs this firm. And maybe get a sense of, A, A, how common is this? Is this actually scandal worthy? And B, is there any sort of political meat on the bone here?

And so I think that there&#39;s actually pretty natural reasons why caucuses and parties often end up using the same suppliers, because they both need to be champions of the cause, or practically speaking. I mean, I know some people could say, well, for shame, the caucus shouldn&#39;t do that. But I mean, welcome to the real world population, a little over 7 billion, right? But there is a bit of an interesting thought experiment here for you, which is if the liberal party buys office 365 from microsoft can the caucus well sure i don&#39;t think anybody would object to that right well how about bell mobility okay</div>

He&#39;s trying to say, Tom Pitfield, lifelong friend of Justin Trudeau, another unethical relationship dealing like this, you know, trying to create a pattern here.

And in that sense, I think it&#39;s more kind of the, I can see some smoke, there&#39;s a bit of noise, pick your metaphor here. But ultimately, it&#39;s less about the specifics of this and more about the general overall vibe you get, or at least that Aaron O&#39;Toole wants you to get when you think about the Liberal Party of Canada, right? right? A little too cozy with their friends, a little too free with money that they shouldn&#39;t be so free with. They can&#39;t really see the difference between party and government. And, you know, who loses at the end? All of us, right? All of us lose for any number of reasons. There&#39;s the ethics of it. There&#39;s the actual cash involved. All of us. So I don&#39;t think that we are going to be talking per se about the specifics. But absolutely, I think if the The conservatives could turn, you know, turn it into a buzzword, you know, just almost like a just say it, you know, say the name. And then all of a sudden everybody gets gets upset at a rally. I&#39;m sure they would be happy to do so. But ultimately, it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just layering paint on paint. It&#39;s the fine strokes. It doesn&#39;t fundamentally change the story that Aaron O&#39;Toole is trying to tell. It&#39;s just more texture.</div>

What I wanted to talk to you guys about here is how common is this? I know we talk about polling from the purposes of the horse race, but Corey, maybe I&#39;m going to start with you.

          <div class="said">It&#39;s not uncommon. It&#39;s not uncommon. Governments have an awful lot of mechanisms available to them to poll. I think there&#39;s a couple of things I would observe. One is the bigger the project, the more likely this kind of polling is going to be. And there is no bigger project than how are we going to spend all of these billions of dollars and get Canada out of COVID-19 doldrums. The second thing I would say is governments have an awful lot of mechanisms that just pass through them regularly, monthly surveys, bi-monthly surveys, quarterly surveys, particularly at at the federal level where there&#39;s a little bit more money to put towards those projects. And it&#39;s not a particularly difficult task to just say, we&#39;re going to do a bit of, we&#39;re going to add to that. We&#39;re going to augment, we&#39;re going to plus on to the previous focus groups or polls we were doing. And I haven&#39;t seen enough to know for certain whether the details were a totally distinct project. I think it probably was based on the fact it came through, but not uncommon. common. Polling is just very normal in politics these days, doubly so at the federal level, because again, the scale is just so big. But even in Alberta, I can tell you, we had daily tracking on government approvals at various points. We had flash polling we would do when there were major issues available. We had polling that was on a monthly basis that provided some some sort of consistent baseline. And we had regular quarterly and annual polls that dealt with matters like this. And we would just bolt on questions in addition to various project work that would occur. So not shocking to me at all.</div>

          <div class="said">In a funny way, I think message testing gets a rap as the most nefarious government testing because it feels like it&#39;s manipulative, right? It&#39;s people trying to make you feel a different way about something based on the words you choose. I look at it a little bit differently. In some ways, I feel message testing is the most innocuous testing because you&#39;re not even talking about the policy, you&#39;re talking about how you frame a certain policy, but you&#39;re going to do the policy anyways. And so you&#39;re not just being a weathervane where you&#39;re just picking your policy based on what the majority opinion is, but you&#39;re thinking about these things consistently. Message testing, though, is funny because many people will say that&#39;s more appropriately done by political parties. But I can tell you, as somebody who&#39;s been a professional communicator in many contexts, in many organizations, message testing is done to to make sure that the thing you are trying to say is heard by the audience that you need to hear it. And there&#39;s not anything inherently wrong with that, right? It&#39;s about clarity. It&#39;s about making sure that the thing you say conveys the thing you want it to say to the people that you&#39;re talking to.</div>

And there&#39;s a – this is where it becomes as much art as science, even putting aside whether it&#39;s statistically representative to get a focus group together, right?

And then ultimately, it does come down to kind of personal preference of politicians, what we&#39;d call in a corporate setting, managerial preference. Managerial preference matters.

I would imagine that most people, you know, there may be a small group of people who who choose not to get vaccinated. But I suspect most people will get vaccinated because it&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s the way it works there. Right. Like it&#39;s not like if we had mandatory vaccinations being proposed in British Columbia, I think that you&#39;d see a totally different situation. But when it&#39;s proposed in the Philippines, it&#39;s probably going to work. Well,</div>

Number two, we don&#39;t identify any fish. Corey, Subway, Riddled, is there bread, real bread? Is there tuna, real tuna? The question I have for you, though, Corey, do you care? Would you even care? Does it even bother you that it may not even be real bread and real tuna? I don&#39;t know your tuna eating habits. I&#39;m a vegetarian. I don&#39;t eat tuna.</div>
