            <div class="said">political staffing, campaign staffing, political staffers that come from out of town to help support either your election campaign, but let&#39;s be more specific for the context of this conversation to help support your premier&#39;s office or your minister&#39;s offices, to help you support communications? How important is it that the staffers you have as a political leader are familiar with the parts that you operate in, the geographic areas, the communities, the context, the stuff that often you can only soak through osmosis and maybe not bring as context from other parts of the country? And what kind of spurs this conversation is our home province here, where Where former Wild Rose leader and co-founder of the United Conservative Party, Brian Jean, who for those outside of Alberta may not be familiar with, was someone also competing to be leader of the United Conservative Party against Jason Kenney. Long history there that we can get into if you&#39;d like around the kamikaze campaign, etc., etc. Anyways, Brian Jean writes a piece</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">piece in the Calgary Sun where he gives Jason Kenney a bunch of recommendations, including step down as intergovernmental affairs minister, eat healthier and sleep more. We can discuss that if you&#39;d like. But one of the considerations and, you know, recommendations, I should say, he gives them is about his staff. half. And twofold, Albertans want their premiers and ministers&#39; offices to be staffed by grownups who can be trusted to maturely address the issues facing Albertans. You would be well-served if your ministers employed more policy advisors and fewer Twitter warriors. And the second part was really about the staffers themselves. Political advisors are most useful when they have skin in the game. If they haven&#39;t lived in Alberta for a while, if they haven&#39;t committed to making Alberta their permanent home, they might not be suited for the job. Albertans would be surprised by how many of this government&#39;s top staff and bureaucrats aren&#39;t from Alberta. So guys, this is the conversation I want to have specific to this point. But before we get there, let&#39;s talk about some local politics, some regional Alberta politics for a second. Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. What did you make of this Brian Jean op-ed before we double click into the staffer conversation? What did you make of him using the media as the channel? And perhaps what do you think, speculate for us, what do you think this means around perhaps the discord within the larger conservative movement?</div>

Your staff are from not from Alberta could easily be spun as you&#39;ve chosen the best staff from across the country. You look tired and haggard. Well, of course, you work so fucking hard. It&#39;s in the middle of a global pandemic, make sure you take care of yourself, right? We saw the opposite of this with Mayor Nenshi during the floods, where he was, you know, high on life and people loved what he was up to. He looked tired and haggard, but people were like, you need to go take a nap. You&#39;re working really hard for us. But so I feel like some of these these recommendations and i and like i said this is not an insight as much as an observation could almost be spun the other way around if jason kenney was getting his outcomes that he wanted right like why consult caucus you&#39;ve got a such a strong premier&#39;s office you&#39;re able to kind of you know work this mandate that we&#39;ve given you thanks for doing that like all of this could be spun the other way so i just want to see if there&#39;s any reactions to that before i kind of move on to the staffing issue no</div>

Right. I think every one of us knows. And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll get both of you to perhaps examine on the scope of this right before we set the table. But I think we know that almost all political parties do this. So Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. Give us a bit of the context. Does this happen with all political parties? I think the answer is yes. What&#39;s the extent it&#39;s happened in your experience? Did you guys recruit from outside when you were chief of staff? And kind of how do these decisions get made to get us to this point to say, no, rather than going with some local talent that might be a little green. We&#39;re going to go find the best conservative staffer out of BC or Ontario or the best NDP staffer out of wherever and house them here within our legislature in Edmonton or Victoria or Toronto or whatnot. So two questions there. A, how widespread is this practice? And B, just some of your experience and what you saw. Carter, I&#39;ll start with you first.</div>

And we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t have chiefs of staff when I was I mean, the ministers had executive assistants, but we had mostly our staffers to the ministers were from Alberta.

            <div class="said">This is what I do. Carter, your final question to you is, summarize for me. You&#39;re leaving the proverbial sort of 30-second memo for your successor as Chief of Staff. How would you let them, you know, how would you, what would be the balancing act? What would be the advice you would give them when they&#39;re thinking about staffing as it relates to folks from away, folks from here. You guys may have already said these words, but I want to try to crystallize them into a nugget. Carter, what would that be from your perspective if you were providing some advice to an incoming chief of staff or an incoming premier regarding this?</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn" data-start="3523">

                58:43
              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">I&#39;d tell them to think of the staffing in the cabinet as three teams. And like any good team, you want to have diversity. You want to have different voices. And sometimes that means having voices from within Alberta. Sometimes it will mean having having voices from outside of Alberta, but you want to have balance. And so the three teams that I would encourage them to think of, I would encourage them to think of the ministers and the cabinet as a specific team. Do you have the diversity? Do you have the diversity of experience for that team to function appropriately? Then I&#39;d say the chiefs of staff are going to be a team on their own. We&#39;re going to be working for the ministers to be as effective as possible and to coordinate the business of government as it needs to be coordinated. And then I would suggest that the communications directors need their own team as well. So I would suggest, you know, my advice wouldn&#39;t be, you know, hire X percentage of people from outside. My advice would be make sure that each team is reflective of the balance and the variety of skills that you will actually need. No one person is going to have them all. So being able to fill out those teams with the diversity of experience that a modern government operation requires is really your first and foremost requirement.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Yeah, you got to balance the system as a whole and you got to balance the system in small ways as well. So when you&#39;re thinking about your minister&#39;s offices, think about creating a whole minister. This would be the extension of that superhuman I&#39;m talking about there. When you&#39;re thinking about your premier&#39;s office, think about the ways they&#39;re going to be interacting with the system and where you might have too many people from</div>

Alberta. It can be as funny as I want to pitch this thing. And you&#39;re like, yeah, a government did that 15 years ago, and it became a big joke. But you don&#39;t know that because you weren&#39;t from here, right? So you got to be careful about that.</div>
