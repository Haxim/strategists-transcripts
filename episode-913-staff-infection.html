And that still gives them time to run their 2021 election cycle strategy that they have. So I don&#39;t think this is all bad for them. And I certainly don&#39;t think that the Conservative Party should be playing this up too much, nor do I think the Globe and Mail should be making as big a deal out of it as they have been.

You don&#39;t belong in these parts. Guys, I want to talk about broadly an issue related to political staffing, political</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">political staffing, campaign staffing, political staffers that come from out of town to help support either your election campaign, but let&#39;s be more specific for the context of this conversation to help support your premier&#39;s office or your minister&#39;s offices, to help you support communications? How important is it that the staffers you have as a political leader are familiar with the parts that you operate in, the geographic areas, the communities, the context, the stuff that often you can only soak through osmosis and maybe not bring as context from other parts of the country? And what kind of spurs this conversation is our home province here, where Where former Wild Rose leader and co-founder of the United Conservative Party, Brian Jean, who for those outside of Alberta may not be familiar with, was someone also competing to be leader of the United Conservative Party against Jason Kenney. Long history there that we can get into if you&#39;d like around the kamikaze campaign, etc., etc. Anyways, Brian Jean writes a piece</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">piece in the Calgary Sun where he gives Jason Kenney a bunch of recommendations, including step down as intergovernmental affairs minister, eat healthier and sleep more. We can discuss that if you&#39;d like. But one of the considerations and, you know, recommendations, I should say, he gives them is about his staff. half. And twofold, Albertans want their premiers and ministers&#39; offices to be staffed by grownups who can be trusted to maturely address the issues facing Albertans. You would be well-served if your ministers employed more policy advisors and fewer Twitter warriors. And the second part was really about the staffers themselves. Political advisors are most useful when they have skin in the game. If they haven&#39;t lived in Alberta for a while, if they haven&#39;t committed to making Alberta their permanent home, they might not be suited for the job. Albertans would be surprised by how many of this government&#39;s top staff and bureaucrats aren&#39;t from Alberta. So guys, this is the conversation I want to have specific to this point. But before we get there, let&#39;s talk about some local politics, some regional Alberta politics for a second. Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. What did you make of this Brian Jean op-ed before we double click into the staffer conversation? What did you make of him using the media as the channel? And perhaps what do you think, speculate for us, what do you think this means around perhaps the discord within the larger conservative movement?</span>

            <span class="text">being on the outs with the UCP, thought, you know what, this could be a good time to fan those flames and to give himself a little bit of fun. You know, I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any point in speculating beyond that. I don&#39;t think that Brian Jean&#39;s looking for a political comeback within the UCP and creating, you know, a leadership crisis. I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s looking to Brian Jean to fill that particular void. But I do think that he looked at this as an opportunity to cause Jason Kenney, a beleaguered premier right now, some additional pain. And he jumped right on it. And I, for one, am a big fan of causing Jason Kenney pain. So good on you, Brian Jean. Just next time, try and, you know, be better. But nonetheless, still, you know, he did try and just cause some local pain.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. You know, one of the things I found interesting, and this is, I don&#39;t even know if this is an insight, but perhaps an observation I&#39;d love to just get each of your reactions on, was that many of the things that Brian Jean was listing in this, you know, recommendation list could be viewed as and spun as positives if Jason Kenney was getting the outcomes that he said he would, right? right? Your staff are from not from Alberta could easily be spun as you&#39;ve chosen the best staff from across the country. You look tired and haggard. Well, of course, you work so fucking hard. It&#39;s in the middle of a global pandemic, make sure you take care of yourself, right? We saw the opposite of this with Mayor Nenshi during the floods, where he was, you know, high on life and people loved what he was up to. He looked tired and haggard, but people were like, you need to go take a nap. You&#39;re working really hard for us. But so I feel like some of these these recommendations and i and like i said this is not an insight as much as an observation could almost be spun the other way around if jason kenney was getting his outcomes that he wanted right like why consult caucus you&#39;ve got a such a strong premier&#39;s office you&#39;re able to kind of you know work this mandate that we&#39;ve given you thanks for doing that like all of this could be spun the other way so i just want to see if there&#39;s any reactions to that before i kind of move on to the staffing issue no</span>

            <span class="text">permanently relocating to the province that they work in. First of all, let&#39;s put on the table, this is not a practice that is exclusive to conservatives, right? Right. I think every one of us knows. And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll get both of you to perhaps examine on the scope of this right before we set the table. But I think we know that almost all political parties do this. So Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. Give us a bit of the context. Does this happen with all political parties? I think the answer is yes. What&#39;s the extent it&#39;s happened in your experience? Did you guys recruit from outside when you were chief of staff? And kind of how do these decisions get made to get us to this point to say, no, rather than going with some local talent that might be a little green. We&#39;re going to go find the best conservative staffer out of BC or Ontario or the best NDP staffer out of wherever and house them here within our legislature in Edmonton or Victoria or Toronto or whatnot. So two questions there. A, how widespread is this practice? And B, just some of your experience and what you saw. Carter, I&#39;ll start with you first.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t think that there is a government that is formed that doesn&#39;t bring in and one or two or some staffers from outside. When Alison Redford became premier, we brought in my deputy chief of staff, Stephen Shapiro, came from Vancouver. And he brought a different set of eyes. Now, he was from Alberta originally. He&#39;d moved out to the West Coast and came back to work for us. He&#39;d been in the legislature before working with different ministers in a previous life. So he brought back a lot of experience that we desperately wanted to lean on, and we trusted him. Whereas some of the other</span>

            <span class="text">So we brought in some experience to fill out the bench strength a little bit differently. And then after I left, they brought in a communicator from Ontario who was kind of going back and forth. who uh that was a bit of more of a problematic thing because there&#39;s a lot of flights involved because he didn&#39;t really move out here um so you&#39;re trying to have the best possible people and sometimes the best people are from outside i think that that where</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">where this gets a little bit weird is how many right like what&#39;s the right number what&#39;s the right ratio um because you know the The NDP of Rachel Notley were strongly criticized for bringing in so many of their chiefs of staff for their ministers from outside of the province. And we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t have chiefs of staff when I was I mean, the ministers had executive assistants, but we had mostly our staffers to the ministers were from Alberta. We just had a couple of staff that were from outside. side so there&#39;s there&#39;s different levels and and somewhere someone gets to draw a line that says bringing in one or two from outside is great but bringing in uh two-thirds of the chiefs of staff is is perhaps less is good less is good</span>

And did you ever have that discussion? Was it you as chief of staff for the premier that could just say, this is who I want as talent? Who were the inputs to this? I think that would be really interesting for us to understand. I know your situation is unique to you, but I mean, we get to talk to you about this. So who were the inputs to help you, if anyone, make these decisions of who you wanted to staff and who you wanted to bring from outside?</span>

And when I first met him and he was running a campaign and we&#39;d been good friends ever since. And then, but he also knew Alison Redford. And so during the Alison Redford leadership, he came out and helped. And he was at a very stressful time. So when Alison&#39;s mother passed away, Stephen was kind of one of the candidate whisperers, to be frank, someone who could talk to the premier and talk to her in a way that is</span>

And that&#39;s where I think political parties can get into trouble and they will often strike a balance depending on what they need at the time. And we mentioned the Notley government got dinged for this when they started. I think it&#39;s inevitable when you go from four seats to, I think it was 53, that you are going to have more positions than you have people who have, frankly, the experience to do these jobs, right? They haven&#39;t had other political jobs they could work out through. So you&#39;re going to have a lot lot of people from outside of Alberta in a situation like that.

Well, what&#39;s the easiest thing to do in that situation if you happen to be a federal politician with a deep Rolodex?</span>

Or is this all really, at the end of the day, about the folks in the premier&#39;s office? I guess my question at the heart of it is, does it really matter who is staffing a minister when the mandate letters, whether you&#39;re the prime minister or the premier, are being directed from one singular spot? Do you just need people who can silently execute in those minister&#39;s office and doesn&#39;t really matter where the fuck they&#39;re from?

You know, it&#39;s really about how much shine you can give to the minister, the person who&#39;s on the ballot, and you know, the person who&#39;s going to carry the reputation of their political party. And I mention this because when you try to think about a minister as being like a superhuman, right, and they look absurdly prodigious. They speak so eloquently because they have speech writers, right? They&#39;re everywhere because their schedule is managed down to the minute. They are making phone calls with people and they&#39;re so on point because their stakeholder, you</span>

            <span class="text">what you need to think is what makes them a well-rounded human. And if you happen to have a minister who knows all of the local context, they&#39;re so great with it. They have just this feel for this notion of what is their constituency and what is Alberta or whatever your home province or jurisdiction may be. Then they don&#39;t need somebody with what I&#39;ve termed that kind of sectoral knowledge. They can get the subject matter expert who hopefully covers them off. Maybe this person who knows everything about their community is dog shit at pulling together like a policy thought. Well, then they&#39;ll get a brilliant policy director from outside of Alberta.</span>

You know, a minister&#39;s office has a handful of people.</span>

And some of the people I had the highest regard for, some of the most brilliant people in Kenney&#39;s government, were from other provinces. Katie Merrifield immediately springs to mind, of course, who was the director of communications until recently. recently and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">This is what I do. Carter, your final question to you is, summarize for me. You&#39;re leaving the proverbial sort of 30-second memo for your successor as Chief of Staff. How would you let them, you know, how would you, what would be the balancing act? What would be the advice you would give them when they&#39;re thinking about staffing as it relates to folks from away, folks from here. You guys may have already said these words, but I want to try to crystallize them into a nugget. Carter, what would that be from your perspective if you were providing some advice to an incoming chief of staff or an incoming premier regarding this?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;d tell them to think of the staffing in the cabinet as three teams. And like any good team, you want to have diversity. You want to have different voices. And sometimes that means having voices from within Alberta. Sometimes it will mean having having voices from outside of Alberta, but you want to have balance. And so the three teams that I would encourage them to think of, I would encourage them to think of the ministers and the cabinet as a specific team. Do you have the diversity? Do you have the diversity of experience for that team to function appropriately? Then I&#39;d say the chiefs of staff are going to be a team on their own. We&#39;re going to be working for the ministers to be as effective as possible and to coordinate the business of government as it needs to be coordinated. And then I would suggest that the communications directors need their own team as well. So I would suggest, you know, my advice wouldn&#39;t be, you know, hire X percentage of people from outside. My advice would be make sure that each team is reflective of the balance and the variety of skills that you will actually need. No one person is going to have them all. So being able to fill out those teams with the diversity of experience that a modern government operation requires is really your first and foremost requirement.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, same final question to you on this segment. The memo or the advice verbally or written that you might provide to someone if they were in the position of making staffing decisions, political staffing decisions for a premier&#39;s or a prime minister&#39;s office.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, you got to balance the system as a whole and you got to balance the system in small ways as well. So when you&#39;re thinking about your minister&#39;s offices, think about creating a whole minister. This would be the extension of that superhuman I&#39;m talking about there. When you&#39;re thinking about your premier&#39;s office, think about the ways they&#39;re going to be interacting with the system and where you might have too many people from</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">from away who might be able to get into a room and make decisions that really require the kind of input that comes from knowing where the bodies are buried in Alberta. Alberta. It can be as funny as I want to pitch this thing. And you&#39;re like, yeah, a government did that 15 years ago, and it became a big joke. But you don&#39;t know that because you weren&#39;t from here, right? So you got to be careful about that.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So it&#39;s just about creating checks and balances yourself and not lulling yourself into kind of looking just at the dashboard metrics, but also understanding the workflows of the place and where you might be setting up blind spots within different workflows.</span>
