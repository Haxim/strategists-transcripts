        <p>Ministry of Podcasts: Episode 5</p><p style="text-align: left;">Be it resolved that the Minister of Podcasts, Stephen Carter, together with the Chair of Oral Questions, Zain Velji, do hereby call this sitting of The Ministry of Podcasts to order, notwithstanding heckling from the floor or ambient jackhammering.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Be it further resolved that the House shall receive evidence from the duly sworn Member of Parliament and Parliamentary Secretary, Corey Hogan, on matters including but not limited to:</p><p style="text-align: left;">The structural failure of Question Period and why 35 seconds is enough time for a slogan but not an answer,</p><p style="text-align: left;">The strange experience of attending a Conservative convention as a Liberal observer,</p><p style="text-align: left;">The risks of pretending separatism is just another wedge issue that will go away,</p><p style="text-align: left;">And the difference between winning the moment and accidentally torching the country.</p><p style="text-align: left;">And be it further noted that testimony was provided without central messaging, written talking points, or permission from anyone in authority, and was instead governed by lived experience, and a dangerous amount of strategic clarity.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Therefore be it finally resolved that this episode, while lacking a formal agenda, shall be entered into the record as a cautionary tale, a media briefing, and a reminder that short-term tactics age quickly, but constitutional consequences do not.</p>

We often talk about, in politics in general, I&#39;m not talking about my party here, but we talk about what trips people up, like what Fs up their day, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think if your assumption was it was Trump, I would say, yeah, there&#39;s a little bit of that. Like, clearly, try to avoid saying the word. You don&#39;t want anybody to applaud Trump for all of that. So that would be one. But a much bigger one seemed to be the separatist stuff. Like, even in Pierre Polyev&#39;s comments, A,</div>
