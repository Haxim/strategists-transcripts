          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the strategy of John A Macdonald, the Catholic Church, the Olympics, cabinet ministers speaking out against their premiers and much, much more in this jumbo-sized episode. How big of a deal is it that Rachel Notley got 98.2% on her leadership review? Is giving NHL teams a Covid-19 travel exemption good politics? And will Stephen Carter wake up to be a crypto whale tomorrow? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

It could be a public figure. It could be a private figure that you make public, Stephen Carter. You with the the audience and the listenership could bring something to the fore with a birthday bump. Now, we&#39;re very selfless people. We don&#39;t talk about ourselves when we do the birthday bump. No, we&#39;d never do that. No, we wouldn&#39;t do that.

I mean, in addition to obviously getting just an outrageously high level of support from the party faithful, 98.2%, I&#39;ve never heard of a leadership review with a number that high. It provides such an enormous contrast with the news of the UCP this weekend, which had multiple cabinet ministers actively criticizing the UCP leader and our premier, Jason Kenney. So when you think about a world of contrast, I mean, there could not be one that was more stark. Those two things line up against each other. And, you know, last time, or the last leadership review I remember for Rachel Notley, she got something like 97.5%. Yeah, that&#39;s right. So by my math, after the 2031 election, she should be above 100%. And so, bravo. I mean, talk about having her party behind her. Fabulous for her. I can&#39;t even, like, in some ways, though, I&#39;m like, who are these 1.8%? Well,</div>

I&#39;m kind of curious what you do with a number like this, especially when we&#39;ve considered and talked about leadership reviews in the last couple of months as perhaps being, and I think we were split on this decision, but correct me, maybe an overrated metric. Yeah,</div>

But certainly, I would be not too shy if I was in, you know, kind of the staff level and the people around saying to different media, like, hey, look at the contrast here. Jason Kenney, his cabinet&#39;s not even necessarily behind him. Somebody was joking online. People named Jason within the cabinet might not even have a majority of support for him. And, and the idea that Rachel Notley would have, you know, so clearly be speaking, you know, for her party and leading her party, I think is that&#39;s a contrast that&#39;s worth noting.

How worried are you if you&#39;re the UCP? I know it&#39;s hard to ask in isolation, especially with other events going on this weekend, and we&#39;ll get to those. But if you see this number for Rachel Notley, you&#39;re probably expecting it, I imagine. So are you concerned, or is this kind of making a shake in your metaphorical boots? Well,</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Well, I think that there was a hope at one point that the UCP would be, you know, if I was a UCP strategist, I&#39;d be saying, you know, running against Rachel Notley is great because people already know that they don&#39;t, you know, they don&#39;t trust her government to be able to be effective. Whereas maybe someone else&#39;s government or someone else&#39;s leader gets a fresh start or a fresh slate and maybe has a little bit more upward momentum. I would say, though, that based on where things are right now, that that&#39;s just a lost opportunity that doesn&#39;t exist for the UCP because they&#39;re performing so poorly and Rachel Notley is performing so well. So the fact that she&#39;s got her base, you know, the people willing to participate in a convention, you know, on her side is good because everybody&#39;s just going to be working really hard, pulling on the yoke, making sure that everything goes the way it should go.

Do you feel like that&#39;s still in their sort of calculus, Carter? Or do you feel like they don&#39;t give a fuck anymore? Like post-pandemic, right, post-second dose or post-July, they&#39;re like, fuck it, we&#39;ll just call the election, we&#39;ll take a couple of days of blame for going to the LG or asking for the mandate, or the GG, sorry, and asking for the mandate that we don&#39;t require.

And it&#39;s all part and parcel of getting people used to the idea there&#39;s going to be an election in the fall.

Because if you went down the road of blame and retribution and attribution of sin, then it is a never-ending, never-ending list of people because we&#39;ve all committed these atrocities. At the end of the day, Canada committed these atrocities, and we need to move forward rather than simply moving backwards. So I think that South Africa managed their reconciliation process well.

            <div class="said">fans a buzz called superflux makes great ipas it&#39;s very exciting great beer uh and is living up to the hype this is not going to be that this will not live up to the hype unfortunately i i think the idea that you&#39;re going to to be able to jump on the celebrity bandwagon Reagan, if you&#39;re Justin Trudeau in 2021 is wrong. He was a celebrity in 2015. And if this tactic hadn&#39;t been applied for a campaign like that, maybe it would work. But ultimately, Canadians are in a different relationship with the prime minister at this point. And I don&#39;t think we&#39;re looking to have the celebrity prime minister right now. And if he tries to run as one, I think it will be to his detriment. Carter,</div>

            <div class="said">Carter, this platform, as I mentioned, is like a texting platform, right? So you put it in your your IG bio and your Twitter, and you get everyone who wants to reach out to you or your campaign to text you rather than DM you or reach out or, you know, tag you in a tweet. What do you think? Is a campaign tactic overrated or underrated?</div>

I mean, we were having a discussion about it the other day and it was like, I just don&#39;t see the breakout nature of it it&#39;s texting it&#39;s mass texting i&#39;m shocked and it&#39;s and on top of that it has um it has a very significant data uh collection structure so not only text us and then provide us with all your pertinent details so that we know way more about you i think that um i mean maybe in the world of celebrity people aren&#39;t that uh that</div>
