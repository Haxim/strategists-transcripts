Stephen Carter, birthday bumps is, of course, a segment that we do in every Birthday Spectacular on the Strategist podcast. We let the person whose birthday it is bump something in society that they feel like is underrated. So you get to give the Stephen Carter bump to something. It could be an alternative cryptocurrency. It could be a public figure. It could be a private figure that you make public, Stephen Carter. You with the the audience and the listenership could bring something to the fore with a birthday bump. Now, we&#39;re very selfless people. We don&#39;t talk about ourselves when we do the birthday bump. No, we&#39;d never do that. No, we wouldn&#39;t do that. So what is something you want to bump for</span>

            <span class="text">The Zane Velgey leadership campaign, obviously, is the one I want to go with because it&#39;s not quite picked up the way we had hoped. You know, we&#39;d hope to have sold at least 11 or 12 memberships by now. I think we&#39;re only at eight, which is a little disappointing. But if we could get it to 15, I think we&#39;ll be dominant. So, you know, people are out there listening. The Alberta Party memberships are available.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">We haven&#39;t officially entered. Corey has not given us the $7,500 that we require. It&#39;s a little bit of an upset, but but things are going the right direction, for sure.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Corey, on that front, you know, since Carter has chosen the Zane Velji for Alberta Party Leadership Contest as his birthday bump, please read to people the, how do they buy an Alberta membership? Which nano wallet do they have to access? Don&#39;t do that. Don&#39;t do that again.</span>

            <span class="text">exciting i think people are also now saying why stop at alberta party uh maybe the UCP leadership comes open. Yeah, sure. Rachel Notley got 98.1% approval, but did they know Zane Velji was an option? I mean, maybe there&#39;s a way that we can just sort of extend this brand, get to one party rule in Alberta, kind of collect them all Pokemon style. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">

Yeah, that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move on to our next segment. Our next segment. Fine, fabulous or fucked. Guys, I gave you a fourth option two weeks ago. Fuck you guys. guys. I&#39;m now removing it. We&#39;re gonna go through a bunch of stories. Oh, I hate you. I hate you so much. We&#39;re gonna do this right. We&#39;re gonna do this the OG way. We&#39;ve got a bunch of stories we need to cover, and I&#39;m gonna spend a bit of time on all of them, because I think they&#39;re quite interesting, most of them. But we&#39;re gonna give me the simple scale. Is it fine, fabulous, or fucked? Corey, let&#39;s just start here, because you mentioned it. Rachel Notley, 98.2% approval in her leadership review at the Alberta NDP virtual convention this weekend. Fine, fabulous, or fucked? Corey.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">her? For her. Fabulous. I mean, in addition to obviously getting just an outrageously high level of support from the party faithful, 98.2%, I&#39;ve never heard of a leadership review with a number that high. It provides such an enormous contrast with the news of the UCP this weekend, which had multiple cabinet ministers actively criticizing the UCP leader and our premier, Jason Kenney. So when you think about a world of contrast, I mean, there could not be one that was more stark. Those two things line up against each other. And, you know, last time, or the last leadership review I remember for Rachel Notley, she got something like 97.5%. Yeah, that&#39;s right. So by my math, after the 2031 election, she should be above 100%. And so, bravo. I mean, talk about having her party behind her. Fabulous for her. I can&#39;t even, like, in some ways, though, I&#39;m like, who are these 1.8%? Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, best way to leverage this for the NDP throughout the weekend. Do you hang 98.2 above people&#39;s heads? Do you move on from it? I&#39;m kind of curious what you do with a number like this, especially when we&#39;ve considered and talked about leadership reviews in the last couple of months as perhaps being, and I think we were split on this decision, but correct me, maybe an overrated metric. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, this is one of these cool guys don&#39;t look at explosions, and you don&#39;t want to be doing your own press on this. But certainly, I would be not too shy if I was in, you know, kind of the staff level and the people around saying to different media, like, hey, look at the contrast here. Jason Kenney, his cabinet&#39;s not even necessarily behind him. Somebody was joking online. People named Jason within the cabinet might not even have a majority of support for him. And, and the idea that Rachel Notley would have, you know, so clearly be speaking, you know, for her party and leading her party, I think is that&#39;s a contrast that&#39;s worth noting. And it&#39;s, it&#39;s one that on its own, getting</span>

            <span class="text">getting 98.2%, that&#39;s an enormous number, but it doesn&#39;t mean very much. You&#39;re right, leadership review numbers can be overrated a lot of the time. But again, I go back to what was going on for the UCP, what was going on on the rest of the field at the same time. And that&#39;s what makes it noteworthy. And that&#39;s the angle that you want out there. But you don&#39;t want to be I</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">mean, Rachel Notley shouldn&#39;t be pushing that angle. That&#39;s that&#39;s something that should be talked about in the background. Carter,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, what do you think? Do you have any confidence that this wasn&#39;t actually just a temperature that was taken, like literally a temperature? And she&#39;s just coming back as normal. I mean, I don&#39;t know. I mean, I wouldn&#39;t trumpet it. There&#39;s no real advantage. It&#39;ll be spoken of enough without you having to push it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let me ask you, like I said, I&#39;m going to spend a few seconds on each of these stories, but Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. How worried are you if you&#39;re the UCP? I know it&#39;s hard to ask in isolation, especially with other events going on this weekend, and we&#39;ll get to those. But if you see this number for Rachel Notley, you&#39;re probably expecting it, I imagine. So are you concerned, or is this kind of making a shake in your metaphorical boots? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that there was a hope at one point that the UCP would be, you know, if I was a UCP strategist, I&#39;d be saying, you know, running against Rachel Notley is great because people already know that they don&#39;t, you know, they don&#39;t trust her government to be able to be effective. Whereas maybe someone else&#39;s government or someone else&#39;s leader gets a fresh start or a fresh slate and maybe has a little bit more upward momentum. I would say, though, that based on where things are right now, that that&#39;s just a lost opportunity that doesn&#39;t exist for the UCP because they&#39;re performing so poorly and Rachel Notley is performing so well. So the fact that she&#39;s got her base, you know, the people willing to participate in a convention, you know, on her side is good because everybody&#39;s just going to be working really hard, pulling on the yoke, making sure that everything goes the way it should go. So, Corey,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you the question that Carter started to answer, which is, what would you say if you&#39;re a UCP strategist when you heard that when you hear 98.2 today, if you were forced to comment on it?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I would say it means nothing, means nothing at all. And if I wanted to be if if I was snarkier, depending on the setting, I might say, well, look at that. The group think of the NDP. That&#39;s not what&#39;s going to get this province moving forward. But the reality is, this is one of those examples where not communicating is the right approach. which I certainly wouldn&#39;t be proactively talking about this. The contrast is brutal for you. So, you know, if I were asked what it means, I would probably just answer with a very limited, not much.</span>

And more importantly, you get to kind of confound some of the messaging that&#39;s coming out of the provincial governments that may or may not still have hockey teams that are involved. How many hockey teams are left? Everybody&#39;s been eliminated except Montreal. all is that right no the jets oh they&#39;re going to be eliminated doesn&#39;t matter they&#39;ll be eliminated let them keep going</span>

Do you feel like that&#39;s still in their sort of calculus, Carter? Or do you feel like they don&#39;t give a fuck anymore? Like post-pandemic, right, post-second dose or post-July, they&#39;re like, fuck it, we&#39;ll just call the election, we&#39;ll take a couple of days of blame for going to the LG or asking for the mandate, or the GG, sorry, and asking for the mandate that we don&#39;t require. Do you feel like that&#39;s part of their calculus or has it been lessened in your mind?</span>

Like in recent years, minority governments that trigger their own elections tend to return majority government because they&#39;re triggering them on their own terms. And if you look at the liberal government and where it is right now they are triggering it on their own terms they have um the vaccinations are progressing as as evidenced by our hockey chat just moments ago our in-depth understanding of hockey ice hockey um then there&#39;s the the the uh the budget which we&#39;ve acknowledged many times is a an election style of budget um so the the government also has an awful lot of flexibility within that budget to spend, I think, $100 billion or something ridiculous, which is just going to give them additional monies to win over the voters.

The public is somewhat conditioned by the exact same talk. Even this news about electoral urgency is part of that conditioning. And it&#39;s all part and parcel of getting people used to the idea there&#39;s going to be an election in the fall. And even though that will just be at the two-year mark, I think that people are getting pretty used to that idea. And who knows, maybe there will still be a spring-summer election. That&#39;s still a possibility. I don&#39;t think that the news we got says that&#39;s going to happen, but it</span>

If you forced me then to choose, if you said, don&#39;t choose the fifth place party, of course, they&#39;re scared of every election. I would probably choose the NDP NDP just because I think that money remains a problem for the NDP. And even though there are strong associations across the country, I&#39;m not sure that the NDP itself is strong in Canada the way that it should be given their relative strengths across the country.</span>

And it&#39;s not even subtle, like they&#39;ll literally use the words cancel culture over the time.

I mean, literally took bribes to build a railway and didn&#39;t ever stop drinking. And he was not a great dude. And his veneration has more to do with the Canadian desire to have an equivalent to the founding fathers than anything else, right? right? He was the first prime minister, ergo, he&#39;s our George Washington, but he&#39;s no George Washington, right? We didn&#39;t have a break with our past like a revolutionary war.

So when you look at that retort, when you look at the retort that this is not about removing them from history, but about not celebrating them anymore, what do you say to the overall strategy as related to Corey&#39;s point around timing?

I always think of him the way I think of, for the Simpsons fans out there, like Shelbyville, the guy who founded Shelbyville, and how he was just kind of like this drunk who married his cousins, but he&#39;s just, you know, he&#39;s their titular thing.

I do agree though, with Steven, it&#39;s not as though the boy, this was a point you made last episode, Steven, or the one before the boycotts of the Olympics didn&#39;t really do much in the eighties, the tit for tat, you know, uh, Los Angeles Olympics, Moscow, was that the, uh, the one after?

In a tweet on Sunday morning, Pope Francis expressed sorrow over the discovery in Canada and of the remains of 215 Indigenous students of the church-run boarding schools, but didn&#39;t offer the apology sought by the Canadian Prime Minister for Trudeau.

The same one increasingly used by celebrities to interact more intimately with their fans through text messages. It&#39;s this platform called Community, where you give out a phone number as the prime minister or leader and be like, text me at 416, whatever, whatever. And then you have these threaded text messages that volunteers on your campaign kind of resource out for you. As a campaign tactic, and I want to do a show on campaign tactics alone at at some point uh overrated or underrated in your mind you</span>

He was a celebrity in 2015. And if this tactic hadn&#39;t been applied for a campaign like that, maybe it would work. But ultimately, Canadians are in a different relationship with the prime minister at this point. And I don&#39;t think we&#39;re looking to have the celebrity prime minister right now.

So you put it in your your IG bio and your Twitter, and you get everyone who wants to reach out to you or your campaign to text you rather than DM you or reach out or, you know, tag you in a tweet. What do you think? Is a campaign tactic overrated or underrated?</span>

            <span class="text">Overrated. I just, I mean, texting. Wow. New. Exciting. I mean, text to us instead of us texting you. I just don&#39;t, I don&#39;t know. I mean, I just don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to, how it&#39;s going to take off. I mean, we were having a discussion about it the other day and it was like, I just don&#39;t see the breakout nature of it it&#39;s texting it&#39;s mass texting i&#39;m shocked and it&#39;s and on top of that it has um it has a very significant data uh collection structure so not only text us and then provide us with all your pertinent details so that we know way more about you i think that um i mean maybe in the world of celebrity people aren&#39;t that uh that</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s the right thing but it it&#39;s difficult to do and you will always have in in the public service uh well-intentioned people saying yes but you&#39;ve got to be aware of the legal ramifications of do this and yes you must be aware that uh there&#39;s all of this case law over here or it could cause problems with this stakeholder group here or have you considered the international ramifications and we&#39;ve signed you know we&#39;ve got undrip and you know there&#39;s there&#39;s no shortage of yes buts in there but the proper response in moments like these is fuck it it&#39;s the right right thing to do. And this is also not a problem that&#39;s going to be going away. And people will drag their heels, perhaps as long as they can. But that day of reckoning is near. And best that you get ahead of this, you&#39;re not ahead of this thing already, best you not get further behind. And it&#39;s time.</span>

It&#39;s time to do a full inventory of the horrors of the the residential school system, return remains wherever possible, and at least start getting past this ugly moment. And it&#39;s not going to happen overnight or over one generation. This is going to take time,</span>
