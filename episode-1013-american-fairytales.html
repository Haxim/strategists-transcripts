By the time most people listen to it, they&#39;ll only be a day away from the U.S. midterms. And there&#39;s a lot to talk about, right? Right. The fact is that the economy seems to be overriding all other issues in the United States. Joe Biden&#39;s approval rating in the 40s. Every time we&#39;ve had a sitting president whose approval rating has been in the 40s, they&#39;ve lost big on seat count. The Democrats are certainly expecting that on the House side where the House might go to the Republicans with Speaker Kevin McCarthy soon taking over.

Is this a changing nature nature of politics, that you don&#39;t need to be in elected office. When you hear of someone like Abrams and Beto, where does your mind go to first?

All of a sudden, one day you&#39;re Kim Kardashian and the next day you&#39;re Kim Kardashian, you know, you&#39;re up, you&#39;re down, you&#39;re all over the place. You know, who remembers, uh, you know, the celebrities from the, from the early eighties, you know, they show you these pictures now, where, where, where are they now? You know, the, the, the TikTok time-lapses of these really ugly people that turn out to be the people I had crushes on in the eighties, You know, that that&#39;s kind of how celebrity works. Celebrity goes up and celebrity goes down. And when you put politics into a celebrity cycle, it may not work. I was, you know, when I was working with Nenshi, I was very worried about the celebrity cycle that he was on. I thought that it was potentially very damaging.

Number one, thank you for continuing to be the martyr in Texas slash Atlanta. These places are either red or purple, and you have to fight the uphill battle. So thank you for chipping away this time. We expect to see you in the ballot in four years, next Senate race, whatever. Thank you for the fight. your gloss still remains. We&#39;ll still support you at the national level.

Because he&#39;s kind of have two messages here, right? Like Twitter is going to be net new. We&#39;re going to be the most freest place on the earth. Today is just like we&#39;re going to be the most trusted place for information. And then he&#39;s like, everything&#39;s going to change. Nothing&#39;s going to change.
