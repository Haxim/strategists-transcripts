But there are lots of other people who don&#39;t have basic internet. So the problem that you find is whenever you pull the example out from your privileged life, you&#39;re going to be way above a lot of people whose lives aren&#39;t that privileged. And so you wind up in two categories. One, as Corey has said, um, don&#39;t make, don&#39;t tell me I have to cut, tell me what you&#39;re going to do to make my life better.

But perhaps is that part of the problem, that it was a relatable expense?

By the way, the way Christopher Freeland&#39;s speech should have gone is, listen, I review my credit card every month. What I&#39;ve noticed is on my personal travel expenses, I&#39;m using Air Canada and WestJet too often. And what I&#39;m going to now do going forward is switch to Flair Airlines. That budget airline will get me in the same place. Yeah, sure, later or never, but it will try. and that&#39;s what&#39;s worth it. That&#39;s just more time to be working for Canadians on the tarmac. It&#39;s great. Absolutely.</span>

Now, here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do with my deeply irregular powers is I was reviewing my credit card bill and I couldn&#39;t help but notice that credit card interest has gone up, I think more than could be defensible given this environment here. So I&#39;m going to be using my powers as finance minister to bring the banks together and I&#39;m going to say, what are we doing to keep credit card interest rates at 18.99, not shooting up to 22.99.</span>

She thought, well, I&#39;ll use an experience from my own life to illustrate how people, you know, we&#39;re all in this together. And once we&#39;re all in this together, everybody&#39;s going to see that I&#39;m working hard and And Prime Minister is working hard to make sure that everybody&#39;s managing their expenses the best way possible. But Corey&#39;s example had actual real teeth to it. Corey says, you know, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to actually take an action to prevent credit card companies from from massive windfalls at a time when credit card debt is growing. Right.</span>

By the time most people listen to it, they&#39;ll only be a day away from the U.S. midterms. And there&#39;s a lot to talk about, right? Right. The fact is that the economy seems to be overriding all other issues in the United States. Joe Biden&#39;s approval rating in the 40s. Every time we&#39;ve had a sitting president whose approval rating has been in the 40s, they&#39;ve lost big on seat count. The Democrats are certainly expecting that on the House side where the House might go to the Republicans with Speaker Kevin McCarthy soon taking over.

Do you feel like there&#39;s like no cost of losing? And then this combined with like celebrity will and the will of the party, Carter, to just force things by brute force to perhaps happen. Do you think that&#39;s perhaps diluted them and set them a step backwards?

Right, because maybe I&#39;ll kind of contrast that with an example where the Democrats haven&#39;t funded a single dollar into Tim Ryan, and this guy might take out J.D. Vance in Ohio for that Senate seat. This is a guy who&#39;s telling Biden to not show up, running of the place as a Northwestern, I believe Northwestern Ohio former congressman, and giving J.D. Vance, a Trump-endorsed candidate, a real run for his money, which maybe is a contrary example.

And that&#39;s the ones that are actually going to get you at the end of the day. And so the line that people have to walk is they want to get that money. They want to get that shine. In fact, they even want to pull some of that credibility into their state, but they can&#39;t lose focus on their state and the contest that&#39;s in front of them and the people that are actually voting for them or not voting for them here.</span>

And so if you court, if you&#39;re AOC and you&#39;re courting the celebrity lifestyle for your politics, all that extra attention probably means that AOC, you know, big prediction here. But I don&#39;t think AOC, I think AOC would really struggle to become the president of the United States because she has got so much attention and she is such a focal point for so many.</span>

And I&#39;m kind of curious to hear what strategic advice or political advice you&#39;d give to Abrams and Beto. And it might be different for each. I almost see three distinct lanes. Number one, thank you for continuing to be the martyr in Texas slash Atlanta. These places are either red or purple, and you have to fight the uphill battle. So thank you for chipping away this time. We expect to see you in the ballot in four years, next Senate race, whatever. Thank you for the fight. your gloss still remains. We&#39;ll still support you at the national level. We can&#39;t even come close in these regions if it&#39;s not for you. Thanks for this round. We&#39;ll see you next cycle. Keep going.</span>

We should learn about this guy. It&#39;s more so, let&#39;s learn about him. He&#39;s already got gloss. He&#39;s already got, you know, star power. We&#39;re going to usher him with and bless him with all this sort of cash and volunteer and resources. Let&#39;s see if he can make a go of the inflated sort of sense of worth that we&#39;ve given him on the front end rather than reward that with on the back end or in the end game sort of thing.

But they will have to win for us to care. And that&#39;s the difference between these folks, you know, the Stacey Abrams and the Beto O&#39;Rourke. Both of them lost and suddenly we care.

However, the advertising, what does he need to do in order to usher in a sense of confidence on the advertising, strategic comms wise? In your mind, Carter, what would you think? Because he&#39;s kind of have two messages here, right? Like Twitter is going to be net new. We&#39;re going to be the most freest place on the earth. Today is just like we&#39;re going to be the most trusted place for information. And then he&#39;s like, everything&#39;s going to change. Nothing&#39;s going to change. Everyone, especially advertisers, are experiencing a bit of whiplash. What would your advice to him be on securing the revenue base? Let&#39;s just have a clear-eyed objective.

So how is he going to find a billion dollars in debt servicing? Fortunately, he is the richest man in the world. So let&#39;s assume that he can figure out how to at least live one year without having to pay for it from operations he needs to slow down and figure out what his actual strategy needs to be and he can&#39;t tweet it right</span>

The Tesla stock started to drop. He finally closed on the deal. But before he did, there was a lawsuit which kind of exposed a lot of his text messages, which also didn&#39;t make him look all that great or strategic or the whiz kid billionaire that that we suspected. The moves of the last 10 days, to Corey&#39;s point, sloppy, not very thought out, questioning the brand of Elon Musk, the guy that is the richest man in the world and built these two empires in SpaceX and Tesla. If you were advising on the premise of brand, and of course, it&#39;s tied to the survival of Twitter because it&#39;s his interests, Carter, but what would your advice on Elon Musk&#39;s brand be around preserving it, rehabilitating it, on the fact that this guy has kind of built a bit of a brand? If you go back half a decade, the comparison was the Iron Man comparison. The Robert Downey Jr. like this guy, that was what he was seen as. So if that&#39;s the angle, Carter, how</span>

And sure, Howard Hughes took it a little bit too far and became this recluse that was afraid that everybody was trying to kill him and all these things. But there is something to be said about just doing the business and not being seen.

It&#39;s not like the most robust analysis that needs to be done, But after Dobbs, there was this real sense, especially in all of the various off-cycle elections that were occurring, that the Democrats were outperforming. Even in states they were losing, right? They were outperforming. They were losing by 10 points fewer than they were supposed to, things like that.</span>
