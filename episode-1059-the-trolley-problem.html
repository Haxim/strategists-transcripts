        <p>The gang discuss the first week of the Alberta election campaign - one that started with a tax pledge and ended with a wildfire derailing business-as-usual - and unpack what campaigns are looking for seven days in.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the first week in the Alberta election and what campaigns assess seven days in, before turning to the Alberta wildfire situation, Danielle Smith making a troubling comparison and a new “contender” in the provincial election. Was Rachel Notley right to offer her support to Danielle Smith for dealing with the Alberta wildfires? When does a party know it’s all over? And what other words can we add to our CTRL-F list? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">so you measure the ground game. Most, mostly you&#39;re probably measuring that in polling and things like that. Then you have to measure your ground game efficacy. And that&#39;s much harder to understand because you&#39;ve got all these people running around and you&#39;re in this particular case, you&#39;re divided into 87 little campaigns and 87 little campaigns are each going to have different personalities that are going to be dictating how those campaigns are actually performing sometimes those personalities will be dictated by you&#39;re in the middle of you know but fuck alberta and you&#39;re never going to win a seat or you&#39;re absolutely going to win the seat so you don&#39;t work very hard uh or you&#39;re in the middle of downtown calgary and everything is really challenging um you know you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re working super hard you&#39;re everybody&#39;s exhausted um you know different different situations different outcomes. So I&#39;d be wanting to measure those and trying to get some sense of where we&#39;re actually at. Because the other thing that&#39;s going to happen is that people are going to lie to you. The data that you&#39;re going to get, you&#39;re not even going to believe it yourself. It&#39;s so hard to understand where you are in the middle of the campaign. So I like to preset my objective measures for what we&#39;re going to see. And then I measure against those objective measures to see whether or not we&#39;ve actually attained them.</div>

And as I&#39;ve sat here, I&#39;ve thought about like, oh, yeah, there&#39;s like the mining, the coal mining, I think I saw something about educational assistance and whatnot. And I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m pretty keyed in. I guess what I would say is, the first week was really all about Danielle Smith, for good and for bad, right? For good and for bad. i can&#39;t really tell you too much about the ndp specifics i think there&#39;s some danger there though right because i can actually think of the the one policy that broke through for me this week was the ucp tax reduction and i wonder how many other albertans that might be the case for because that that is actually it feels kind of substantive and somewhat meaningful there that</div>

So we&#39;ll move on to our next segment, when natural disaster strikes. So there&#39;s things to talk about both locally as it pertains to the campaign, but then also this broader question of like what to do when a natural disaster strikes when you&#39;re campaigning. So almost, I think it&#39;s 30,000. It might be more than that now. Albertans have been evacuated from their homes due to several wildfires that are burning across the province. Today, we saw Daniel Smith and Rachel Notley sit down together to discuss the situation. It was photographed and posted on social. And then they actually visited with wildfire evacuees together. together so steven carter let&#39;s start with you what what is the right thing to do um when you were running for premier and it&#39;s still it&#39;s an election but you&#39;re dealing with sort of this big natural thing out of your control don&#39;t</div>

          <div class="said">but it was a cloud over so much of what happened so many conversations that occurred uh the anxieties people had every time wildfire season came around the health risks the the psychological challenges people had who had to deal with that who were both in the provincial operations center and then of course in fort mcmurray um and you know there was it is not an exaggeration i&#39;m not trying to be flipped to say people, had some pretty bad PTSD about that particular situation and the long, long hours they held and they did to try to keep this province safe. And so let me start here by saying these are really tough moments, like really, really tough. I didn&#39;t have anything on my watch that was like Fort McMurray. I had some bad wildfire seasons when I was there, but nothing like Fort McMurray. And I still feel that I&#39;m wrapped up in some of that and get the anxiety about it because you do forget how life or death government can be sometimes and</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">the uh the simple reality of it is that experience matters a lot too because you do spend an awful lot of time fumbling around at the start trying to say okay what do we need to do how do we do this and it&#39;s very useful to have people who remember how it was done last time even if it&#39;s them kind of racking their brain and being apocryphal and saying, we tried that. We tried that for a day. It didn&#39;t work, right? Maybe it would work this time. Maybe not. But like, let&#39;s at least be aware of where we were previously and let&#39;s make sure it can bring forward. So, you know, Stephen, I look at it a little less cynically than you. I actually believe, especially based on the experience that she went through in 2016 and some of the experiences after, that Rachel Notley was sincerely offering her help on these particular wildfire fronts. You got to keep in mind the regions it&#39;s threatening that&#39;s her that&#39;s her home region she was premier of this province too she cares about these particular matters and one of the funny things that i hope we get to unpack a bit is at these really sharp moments where this matters like this matters this is life or death and on like timelines of hours and days not on like yeah you screw up the health care system we&#39;re all a little bit in trouble in 10 years 15 years 20 years right yeah screw up the education system we could we could wreck everything right with the next generation of citizens in 30 years 40 years 50 years this is hours and days right it&#39;s so interesting to me to see politicians actually behave like i kind of would want them to behave any other time like the way that daniel smith and rachel notley yeah with petty jabs on the side but the way rachel rachel rachel smith and daniel notley i will say the</div>

We were rebuilding Slave Lake because we lost Slave Lake to a fire. And you know what? We&#39;re going to have so many more fires. We&#39;re going to have so much more catastrophe because Danielle Smith will not recognize that there&#39;s a climate emergency. She is ignoring the fact that there&#39;s a climate emergency. And as a direct result, more lives are going to be lost. So, yeah, OK, we may lose one person who may in this situation fall victim to Danielle Smith&#39;s poor leadership. But that&#39;s on Danielle Smith, not on Rachel Notley. So if you want to win and you know what? I&#39;d prefer winning to losing. Call me crazy. And if you think that this is important, as in, this is the, you know, we have to ensure that we have a functioning democracy with the capacity to recognize real issues when real issues develop. This is a woman who has ignored the COVID crisis. This is a woman who is ignoring the climate crisis. this isn&#39;t the time to sit to sit back and say well i&#39;m happy that it was her turn to govern this week this is the time to say fuck this we have to make sure that we&#39;re the ones in government because this shit&#39;s getting real i</div>

          <div class="said">think the wild rose wild rose loyalty coalition is unlikely to make much of a dent because of the areas it&#39;s decided to run when i look at where those 53 candidates are they seem to be in rural alberta and in edmonton i think there&#39;s a certain awareness that they they cannot if they if they want to maintain and build a coalition longer term cost the UCP the election. And so almost by design, it looks like they&#39;re not going to affect this election. They want to be able to have a showing in writings that the UCP would otherwise run up the board 70, 80% of the vote in some areas. And by the way, for those not in Alberta, maybe not an exaggeration. It&#39;s quite possible that these are the percents they&#39;re getting. And so no, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have an effect. They&#39;re certainly not going to be invited to any debates i i mean as i say that i&#39;m now wondering like i wonder if they pulled a 10 instantly if they&#39;d be invited to a debate but no they&#39;re not going to be invited to any debates and uh i actually don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to get a very high percent of the vote as a result like they&#39;re designed to not actually have a shot steven</div>
