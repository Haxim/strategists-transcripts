            <span class="text">so you measure the ground game. Most, mostly you&#39;re probably measuring that in polling and things like that. Then you have to measure your ground game efficacy. And that&#39;s much harder to understand because you&#39;ve got all these people running around and you&#39;re in this particular case, you&#39;re divided into 87 little campaigns and 87 little campaigns are each going to have different personalities that are going to be dictating how those campaigns are actually performing sometimes those personalities will be dictated by you&#39;re in the middle of you know but fuck alberta and you&#39;re never going to win a seat or you&#39;re absolutely going to win the seat so you don&#39;t work very hard uh or you&#39;re in the middle of downtown calgary and everything is really challenging um you know you&#39;re you&#39;re you&#39;re working super hard you&#39;re everybody&#39;s exhausted um you know different different situations different outcomes. So I&#39;d be wanting to measure those and trying to get some sense of where we&#39;re actually at. Because the other thing that&#39;s going to happen is that people are going to lie to you. The data that you&#39;re going to get, you&#39;re not even going to believe it yourself. It&#39;s so hard to understand where you are in the middle of the campaign. So I like to preset my objective measures for what we&#39;re going to see. And then I measure against those objective measures to see whether or not we&#39;ve actually attained them.</span>

Maybe I&#39;ve got a candidate who&#39;s really not what I was expecting at the doors. And there&#39;s a bit of corrective that needs to happen there. Maybe I&#39;ve got a campaign team that does not actually seem to be doing anything, or maybe they&#39;re just not putting the data in.</span>

            <span class="text">Earlier, when we were talking about this week, and the things and the policies and how they landed, and I said, like, and the NDP, and they had a few things, I kind of struggled to get to them. And as I&#39;ve sat here, I&#39;ve thought about like, oh, yeah, there&#39;s like the mining, the coal mining, I think I saw something about educational assistance and whatnot. And I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m pretty keyed in. I guess what I would say is, the first week was really all about Danielle Smith, for good and for bad, right? For good and for bad. i can&#39;t really tell you too much about the ndp specifics i think there&#39;s some danger there though right because i can actually think of the the one policy that broke through for me this week was the ucp tax reduction and i wonder how many other albertans that might be the case for because that that is actually it feels kind of substantive and somewhat meaningful there that</span>

            <span class="text">that said danielle smith has had such a disaster on some other fronts this week it&#39;s hard to give her the week right and in fact maybe the ndp strategy is in part letting you know it&#39;s like hockey this you know the the the line change after the line change right so you know who you&#39;re up against here might make sense to wait for the second week to do a lot of your big things if you are the the ndp or third week even but i will say this</span>

            <span class="text">this campaign for the ndp and for the ucp right now is going to live or die on danielle smith based on the first week if the next three weeks are like the first week it is all about daniel smith and that might not be a bad thing for the ndp</span>

So we&#39;ll move on to our next segment, when natural disaster strikes. So there&#39;s things to talk about both locally as it pertains to the campaign, but then also this broader question of like what to do when a natural disaster strikes when you&#39;re campaigning. So almost, I think it&#39;s 30,000. It might be more than that now. Albertans have been evacuated from their homes due to several wildfires that are burning across the province. Today, we saw Daniel Smith and Rachel Notley sit down together to discuss the situation. It was photographed and posted on social. And then they actually visited with wildfire evacuees together. together so steven carter let&#39;s start with you what what is the right thing to do um when you were running for premier and it&#39;s still it&#39;s an election but you&#39;re dealing with sort of this big natural thing out of your control don&#39;t</span>

            <span class="text">don&#39;t try and win don&#39;t try and win using the the situation you have to do your job and doing your job may enable you to win but you cannot try to win and i think that that&#39;s actually how the ndp got themselves in a little bit of trouble today because the NDP said in their you know their statement and the tweets and such that they would be prepared for Rachel Notley to step into the cabinet room to share her knowledge and to be briefed on the situation and I was afraid that that was going to open the door to Rachel Notley being invited into the cabinet room you don&#39;t want to be anywhere near this thing if it goes well nor do you want to be anywhere near this thing if it goes poorly and today she got invited into the cabinet room um you know the the the ucp called the bluff if you will invited her in and i&#39;m not sure that that was in the ndp&#39;s overall best interest but they tried they tried to play politics with it like don&#39;t worry we&#39;ve got experience in this and oops</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah well look and and the ucp have had experience too 2019 right after jason kenney was sworn in there were a bunch of wildfires in alberta and it got pretty wild um and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and unfortunately as a province we&#39;ve got a lot of experience with this in the public service in our political class rachel notley as much as anybody because of course fort mcmurray was really next level stuff i joined the public service in october of 2016 so i wasn&#39;t there for fort mcmurray but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but it was a cloud over so much of what happened so many conversations that occurred uh the anxieties people had every time wildfire season came around the health risks the the psychological challenges people had who had to deal with that who were both in the provincial operations center and then of course in fort mcmurray um and you know there was it is not an exaggeration i&#39;m not trying to be flipped to say people, had some pretty bad PTSD about that particular situation and the long, long hours they held and they did to try to keep this province safe. And so let me start here by saying these are really tough moments, like really, really tough. I didn&#39;t have anything on my watch that was like Fort McMurray. I had some bad wildfire seasons when I was there, but nothing like Fort McMurray. And I still feel that I&#39;m wrapped up in some of that and get the anxiety about it because you do forget how life or death government can be sometimes and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">these are quite clarifying moments when you have to deal with something like a wildfire the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the uh the simple reality of it is that experience matters a lot too because you do spend an awful lot of time fumbling around at the start trying to say okay what do we need to do how do we do this and it&#39;s very useful to have people who remember how it was done last time even if it&#39;s them kind of racking their brain and being apocryphal and saying, we tried that. We tried that for a day. It didn&#39;t work, right? Maybe it would work this time. Maybe not. But like, let&#39;s at least be aware of where we were previously and let&#39;s make sure it can bring forward. So, you know, Stephen, I look at it a little less cynically than you. I actually believe, especially based on the experience that she went through in 2016 and some of the experiences after, that Rachel Notley was sincerely offering her help on these particular wildfire fronts. You got to keep in mind the regions it&#39;s threatening that&#39;s her that&#39;s her home region she was premier of this province too she cares about these particular matters and one of the funny things that i hope we get to unpack a bit is at these really sharp moments where this matters like this matters this is life or death and on like timelines of hours and days not on like yeah you screw up the health care system we&#39;re all a little bit in trouble in 10 years 15 years 20 years right yeah screw up the education system we could we could wreck everything right with the next generation of citizens in 30 years 40 years 50 years this is hours and days right it&#39;s so interesting to me to see politicians actually behave like i kind of would want them to behave any other time like the way that daniel smith and rachel notley yeah with petty jabs on the side but the way rachel rachel rachel smith and daniel notley i will say the</span>

We were rebuilding Slave Lake because we lost Slave Lake to a fire. And you know what? We&#39;re going to have so many more fires. We&#39;re going to have so much more catastrophe because Danielle Smith will not recognize that there&#39;s a climate emergency. She is ignoring the fact that there&#39;s a climate emergency. And as a direct result, more lives are going to be lost. So, yeah, OK, we may lose one person who may in this situation fall victim to Danielle Smith&#39;s poor leadership. But that&#39;s on Danielle Smith, not on Rachel Notley. So if you want to win and you know what? I&#39;d prefer winning to losing. Call me crazy. And if you think that this is important, as in, this is the, you know, we have to ensure that we have a functioning democracy with the capacity to recognize real issues when real issues develop.

And so almost by design, it looks like they&#39;re not going to affect this election. They want to be able to have a showing in writings that the UCP would otherwise run up the board 70, 80% of the vote in some areas. And by the way, for those not in Alberta, maybe not an exaggeration. It&#39;s quite possible that these are the percents they&#39;re getting. And so no, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have an effect. They&#39;re certainly not going to be invited to any debates i i mean as i say that i&#39;m now wondering like i wonder if they pulled a 10 instantly if they&#39;d be invited to a debate but no they&#39;re not going to be invited to any debates and uh i actually don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to get a very high percent of the vote as a result like they&#39;re designed to not actually have a shot steven</span>
