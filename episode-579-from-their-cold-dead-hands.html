            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">kind of a psychological precept that we have to understand, right? When you present facts to certain people, right, we as Canadians try and present facts. We&#39;ve talked about this a few times on the podcast where we say we have a hard time seeing Trump supporters&#39; point of view. We aren&#39;t able to process the facts that they get and come to the same conclusion. Well, imagine this situation where you know that it&#39;s an American citizen who did this terrorist act. You know that many other Christians have carried out the same terrorist act. You see terrorist act after terrorist act. You see many, many different mass murders. But it doesn&#39;t matter because the facts that you&#39;re presented with all force you to the same conclusion that guns are good. And to protect your family, you must have a gun. And that&#39;s what the psychology of this is. Because everybody&#39;s trying to understand politically why is this not having an impact. Politically, why isn&#39;t this hurting Donald Trump?</span>
