      <h1>Episode 579: From their cold dead hands</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">June 14, 2016</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the fallout from Orlando, the American gun obsession and how history is written on the fly. Will Orlando finally force Americans to look at their blind support for gun ownership? Can we trust people to narrate events in their own life? And will the return of "Bold, Brilliant or Boneheaded" force a disbanding of The Strategists? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

We&#39;ve talked about this a few times on the podcast where we say we have a hard time seeing Trump supporters&#39; point of view. We aren&#39;t able to process the facts that they get and come to the same conclusion. Well, imagine this situation where you know that it&#39;s an American citizen who did this terrorist act. You know that many other Christians have carried out the same terrorist act. You see terrorist act after terrorist act. You see many, many different mass murders. But it doesn&#39;t matter because the facts that you&#39;re presented with all force you to the same conclusion that guns are good. And to protect your family, you must have a gun. And that&#39;s what the psychology of this is. Because everybody&#39;s trying to understand politically why is this not having an impact. Politically, why isn&#39;t this hurting Donald Trump?</div>
