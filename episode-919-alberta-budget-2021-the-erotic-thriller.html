And I&#39;m going to start us off with CTV News, Quebec Dairy Board, to examine and why Canada&#39;s butter is suddenly mysteriously harder. Carter, have you been following Buttergate? Now, what were you laughing at? Hold on, let&#39;s just, before you answer my question, what were you laughing at, Carter?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, you&#39;re a coconut cake. Calgarian, Julie Van Rosendahl, responsible for Buttergate. Corey, do you want to respond to either Buttergate or the headline as you read it for the first time?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think, you know, what&#39;s interesting to me about Buttergate is that this all kicked off in a big way during the winter months when I think Canadians would be least likely to be suspicious of butter being harder, right? Yeah, exactly. It&#39;s cold. It&#39;s hard to tell about these things. In the summer, if it&#39;s sitting there and it&#39;s a perfect block and it&#39;s 30 degrees outside, we might have different feelings about it. So I guess what I&#39;m saying is I think Buttergate is a conspiracy that goes very deep and involves global warming and the mole people and the Rothschilds. So I intend to spend the rest of my week looking into this. I&#39;ve taken the next couple of days off work, and I&#39;ll get back to you next episode. I&#39;ll get to the bottom of this for you.

            <span class="text">The improviser-in-chief, the governor of Florida, DeSantis says that his state is better off without having a detailed vaccination plan or effort, saying that we&#39;re approaching this pandemic in ways that other states are not. What other states are getting wrong is that they&#39;re planning and planning way too far ahead. Corey, jump in on here.</span>

            <span class="text">And there&#39;s a logistical overhead whenever you are trying to segment out groups and you&#39;re telling them they have to show up at certain times and they&#39;ve got to do certain things. And while that may be a faster way to get everybody vaccinated in Florida, it&#39;s not going to be a better way because the one problem you&#39;re going to have there is that people like me are in no real danger from COVID. You know, at least the danger is pretty remote. And I&#39;m just going to elbow my way to the front of the line. Well, grandma, age 75 with emphysema, is going to be struggling to keep up with me and everybody else who&#39;s decided to rush to these things. And that doesn&#39;t make any sense whatsoever. So the mistake he&#39;s making is assuming that every vaccination is as good as any vaccination, and that is just not the case.</span>

And I know you don&#39;t care. Getting to the front at any cost is the Stephen Carter mentality. So what do you think? I mean, we&#39;re supposed to be crushing DeSantis here, but Corey has an MBA, so he wanted to take this in a different direction. Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, Corey&#39;s so wrong, though. First of all, there is a much faster way to board a plane, and it is not everybody fucking storming the plane. You start off with the window seats first. You can even go in random order on the window seats. Then you go with the aisles and then you go or then you go with the middle seats and then you go to the aisle seats. Everybody knows this. Everybody who&#39;s ever watched the Internet knows that that&#39;s the proper way to board a plane. Everybody&#39;s ever watched the Internet. Nonetheless, what this does is it proves to me that I&#39;m in fact right. Because if DeSantis says that there is no benefit to this, then everybody goes back to my discussion</span>

            <span class="text">in mainstream media. And I wanted to figure out a way to talk about it without doing a whole segment. What the fuck is going on? And how did this happen? And just for some context, Corey, you may have a better sense of what the NDP one was, but I feel like they created a mock schedule between Trudeau and Biden for the first official leaders meeting. And then they had like handwritten annotations, like ice cream lunch and all this sort of weird stuff. It fell flat on its face. It got ratioed. And then the day after, Aaron O&#39;Toole released a video where he was out in front of Justin Trudeau&#39;s office saying, if we&#39;re successful as a party, we&#39;re going to move this guy pointing at the plaque at Justin Trudeau&#39;s office from here to and then camera pans to an outhouse located 10 feet away from the office. Both getting ratioed pretty hard, both not landing with the intended effect. We can dissect what happened, but I want to pretty much know from you guys why it happened. And if either of you have thoughts on how these sort of things come up and how these fails that are so clear to the audience within a matter of quite literally seconds get past what is a very sometimes rigorous vetting process to put stuff up on the official accounts.</span>

But it&#39;s dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens. And when you start looking at that, things can go wrong in a hurry. And ultimately, what really brought down the Obamacare website in those early days was an equally kind of stupid technical glitch that you wouldn&#39;t necessarily pick. They didn&#39;t have caching on in that case, so they weren&#39;t saving copies of things, and everything was a query, which really overwhelmed the system very quickly.</span>

Maybe it would have, if it was the federal conservatives taking apart the Trudeau government, they might have tried to make more hay. But realistically, these are mistakes that happen in government. And if you want to be in government, and you start to just pick these things apart, you do run into a problem.</span>

This is a that you know, you don&#39;t see this type of mistake in business, because generally speaking, businesses scale up much differently than just the turn on model that something like this. This is a turn-on model. And I think that if Tesla all of a sudden turned on their sales system and they were going to sell 400,000 Teslas in a day, they&#39;d have problems. They didn&#39;t do it that way, right? We remember them selling 400,000 Model 3s, but they&#39;d sold Roadsters</span>

Did you guys know about Hillary Clinton? We&#39;re going to spend the majority of it on this. And guys, last time when we left our last episode, Corey, you had some advice for Jason Kenney, which was do less of your job. Less is more. Carter, you also had some advice for Jason Kenney. Balance on both sides of the ledger. Let&#39;s start with initial hits on did the budget today meet your expectations in terms of your one word, one sentence of advice. And then I want to do a couple of things. I want to dissect this budget on three different strands, the message, the communications tactics, which I think are always fun to discuss, because we&#39;ve got a microsite and a video and then a headline related to it, and then the content of it. But I want to get your first take for and Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. Balance both sides of the ledger. Did you see it? Did that meet expectations for you? No,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they said no new taxes, no new tax increases. There were some tax increases. The education property tax seems to have gone up. Income taxes are projected to rise by 6.4%. I can&#39;t tell entirely if that&#39;s from income rise, which doesn&#39;t make much sense to me, or some sort of bracket creep. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">bottom line, there were some modest taxation changes.

I think ultimately, this is a bit of a Franken budget. And I&#39;ve been contemplating it since it was released and trying to make heads or tails of it and understand what exactly it says about the governing party and its ambitions going forward. And, I mean, it almost feels like a split personality budget when you read Tave&#39;s remarks and you hear the comments he&#39;s making about, like, literally, I&#39;m going to read you a quote here. I ask all Albertans to reflect on this. If we know that past excesses were ill-conceived and have left us depleted, then let us apply that wisdom to our decisions today.</span>

And the first group of people you need to tell your story to is your caucus, right? What is the story that we&#39;re trying to tell? And, you know, for example, our budget, the budget that I got to work on, the budget story that we were trying to tell is tackling our $3 billion deficit, which at the time was a tremendous sin.

And I will concede that taking a billion dollars of public sector worker salary and saying you&#39;re going to give that up now is a significant amount of money. But they didn&#39;t actually do anything in this budget. They didn&#39;t actually tackle the big questions of how are we going to make health care more sustainable? How are we going to invest? How are we going to generate new jobs? They invested $700 million in technology jobs to try and invigorate new technology while cutting post-secondary education where we&#39;re going to train the people who are going to take those jobs. jobs so how are those two things linked tell me the story mr premier he&#39;s not telling us a story and it sounds to me like um this is a budget that was created uh you know cory&#39;s words the frankenstein budget um but without the frankenstein story okay</span>

            <span class="text">there there is a school of thought that says if you just put out content and that content will play with an audience you can use it and in these deeply partisan times, that audience will ignore the counter content. So you&#39;re able to point to tough guy Taves and the messaging there, and they will ignore the fact that this is one of the largest budgets. Well, it&#39;s the second largest deficit ever. Interesting point here, of all of the UCP budgets, both actual and projected in budget documents now, there is only one NDP budget that had a higher deficit than the lowest of the UCP deficits. So, like, we&#39;re through the looking glass here. And the idea that you are going to be able to sort of spin it as tough action when it&#39;s the biggest deficits ever, I think, is a bit of a stretch. And I think some of the UCP&#39;s former words are going to come back and haunt them. Two things in particular I think about. One was, you recall during the election, I suspect, Zane, because you worked on Notley&#39;s campaign, the covers to the newspaper that said, we&#39;re heading towards $100 million of debt.</span>

            <span class="text">The other component of that was whenever the NDP said, yeah, but our debt to GDP ratio is still great. And at the time, it was the best in the country. Now it&#39;s not the best in the country. But now you&#39;re seeing the UCP start to use the language. Yeah, but our debt to GDP ratio is great.

And I think that the framing around it needed to better reflect that they didn&#39;t do anything crazy. They, they didn&#39;t reduce spending in most areas. Certainly any area where there&#39;s been any kind of fuss kicked up, You saw either holding the line or even more money, areas where people tend to kind of drift their attention, like post-secondary, and obviously, full disclosure, I work at a post-secondary institution. I think post-secondary institutions are great investments and worth putting more money in, but they got hit. I think that&#39;s because</span>

You want your first year, the finance minister is taking a pair of old shoes and really buffing them up and making them look all good because it&#39;s a tough year, but we&#39;re going to make it happen. Year two, it&#39;s a pair of work boots that they&#39;ve grabbed and they&#39;ve buffed them all up and they&#39;re getting to work. You know, they&#39;re taking forward and we&#39;re moving things forward. Year three, you know, it&#39;s a pair of economy shoes, right? Because things are okay, but, you know, we&#39;ve still got a long way to go. So in year four, it&#39;s like, we got brand new tap shoes. We&#39;re really making things happen. And you&#39;ve got a cycle of a story that says we are going in a direction that we wish to go. And I got to be honest with you, this budget doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s got direction in the middle at the beginning or the end of any of that cycle because it is so kind</span>

So this budget to me is – it&#39;s billions and billions of dollars of spending. spending, no recognition of the actual problems, whether you&#39;re Ken Bozenkul, who says, we&#39;ve got to cut our spending, cut our spending, cut our spending.

And it&#39;s always a bit of a dangerous situation when you can&#39;t really read the intentions of the government going forward. This doesn&#39;t necessarily seem like a pivot budget. It seems like we wanted to do a bunch of stuff, but we can&#39;t right now. Budget, right? And that&#39;s interesting to me. Now, as far as the individual moment of the budget, Carter mentioned it was a whole bunch of nothing. It would be hard to kind of peg it. People could Google it, not really know it. I do want to stress sometimes that&#39;s the plan. Sometimes the win is not getting the headline and just moving to another day. But ultimately, I think that a lot of us in this province are looking for tea leaves and saying, what</span>

And while you&#39;re speaking, it almost makes me think that while they&#39;re certainly trying to use the pandemic as a rationale for many things, as a rationale for the spending, as a rationale for not giving us the balanced budgets in their first term, which the finance minister said that is not going to happen. And they they&#39;ve been really poor at using it as as an excuse or a pivot. And I don&#39;t mean just about this budget, but I mean, about this government in general, like there is opportunity while every government struggles to figure out how to, you know, grapple with the pandemic, there does seem to be opportunity for some governments who said, fuck it, we&#39;re just going to lean right into it. And we&#39;re going to be the government that that made a recovery happen. We&#39;re going to throw away the initial playbook. And part of me wonders, do you guys feel like this government is hesitant to throw away the 2019 playbook? It seems like so much of it is that they want to do everything they can to not get rid of something that is clearly out of date, that is clearly</span>

            <span class="text">you do have to ask yourself at a certain point is the plan not working because of the pandemic or is the plan just never going to work one of the things we do need to keep in mind is that we were looking at it alberta had an enormous deficit the year before the pandemic hit as well now january february march we&#39;re starting to get into that the economy is starting to have some shutters but still we&#39;re talking about an over 10 billion dollar deficit a huge swing to towards larger deficits than in years previous previous um we had seen reductions in the corporate income tax rate we had seen an easing of these labor restrictions and the promised jobs hadn&#39;t really been showing up even before the pandemic began and so i think in some in some senses it is it is kind of this ideological like we know you know there&#39;s the faith in this we believe this will work this has got to work this is exactly what our our philosophy is that&#39;s driven us and you know there here&#39;s all of the economic theory behind it, all of those things. And I think they&#39;re really reticent to walk away from it. Because if they do that, at this point, even if it&#39;s pivoting to deal with the crisis of the moment, it&#39;s</span>

Maybe it&#39;s not even that it&#39;s not telling a story. It&#39;s that it&#39;s telling two different stories. And I don&#39;t know which one is foreshadowing the next chapter.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, let&#39;s leave the message and let&#39;s move on quickly to communications products and packaging. I know both of you have been intimately involved in that element of it. So I want to get your take on what you saw. So we&#39;ve got a microsite as usual, alberta.ca slash budget. And if you&#39;re in front of a computer or your smartphone, starts with a simple landing page, icons, a one-minute video, lives and livelihoods everywhere. Corey, give me, you know, we&#39;ve talked message. Give me your take on the communications products. And perhaps even an insight into how these are developed. Are these GOA products?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This is GOA. And this is, by the way, these are with very few differences. I could name them, but it would be boring if I did. This is the exact same budget page that&#39;s been used for the last couple of budgets. This approach is very common at this point. This was used for every UCP budget to date. And it&#39;s a rather turnkey process. And in fact, if you go into the budget documents themselves and you look at the aesthetic of them, again, exact same approach to budget documents. Nothing has changed there. There&#39;s been no kind of re-skinning or rebranding. I like that personally. I think governments spend a lot of time thinking about what these things look like. The reality is that consistency is both cheaper and easier to use. And in addition to those two benefits, it also has – it reflects the reality that people don&#39;t just look at budget documents all day and say, God, I&#39;m so bored with the fact that they made this budget document. and look this way again. Ugh, you know, like that&#39;s just not something people do. So I think it&#39;s just smart. As far as the language and how this all works, the process is, it involves many cooks in the kitchen, I guess is what I would say. You have Treasury Board and Finance who are really holding the pen on most of the products. You do have the communication staff at CPE who they&#39;re the ones who make these web products and put it into web language and are often suggesting drafts back on language. which I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s, you know, for sure how it&#39;s worked this time, but I&#39;ll tell you in the past, that is how it&#39;s worked. And ultimately, a lot of it flows from, or historically, I should say, how it&#39;s worked is there are like source documents. There is, this is the thing. And all of the other documents will reflect the tone and tenor of this. And I think</span>

Carter, I want to get your take on this, both around, Corey&#39;s answered a few of my questions around this, which is great, because we can power through if you don&#39;t have much more to say on it as well, around branding, like how much effort and what do you make of the brand and the products that you see, microsite videos and social media cards, pretty standard stuff. Is that fine for this iteration? Is that what you would have wanted? Or would you have perhaps pushed the envelope a bit more?</span>

No, it&#39;s a global health emergency. We don&#39;t want it associated with the government&#39;s main brand. Okay, well, let&#39;s go to the next color. That&#39;s orange. We can&#39;t use orange for that because that&#39;s the NDP&#39;s color and it will look like it&#39;s a partisan attack. Let&#39;s use green. Can&#39;t use green outside because it just blends into the background. So we can&#39;t use it for any of our signage outside. You&#39;re going to have to pick a different color still. Yellow, not enough contrast. You&#39;re going to have accessibility challenges. So let&#39;s go to the hot pink. Oh, I don&#39;t like the hot pink. It doesn&#39;t look particularly good let&#39;s go to the secondary version of all of those colors have the exact same conversation and end up on fucking purple because it&#39;s the secondary to the hot pink that&#39;s what happens every goddamn time you have a conversation like this in government it&#39;s actually better now because under the ndp it was like you do the color wheel but you&#39;d stay off blue because it was too partisan for the ucp as well so like again some of these decisions just don&#39;t read too much into them i guess is my point like they they are made nobody</span>

So those are just some items to throw your way on the cut side. Of course, if you want to talk about some of the other programs that they&#39;re introducing around diversification, et cetera, we can do that. But Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you.

Are they all somewhere cramped in some little facility somewhere? Now, this is a new spend with new requirements, and we&#39;re not going to see nearly the level of investment to support these. Remember when the South Hospital was built here in Calgary? We didn&#39;t staff that thing up forever. I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s still staffed up, because it turns out to staff up a big capital asset, you need to hire more staff. None of that&#39;s been reflected in this budget.

Like no matter what time. That&#39;s not even specific to this moment. And a huge chunk of people will actually say, I do not care if you ever settle the deficit. However, there&#39;s a block of 20% or so diehards who think that even next year is not soon enough. Why do we have a deficit at all? You absolutely must get rid of this deficit. And that group, even though I think that many of them, if you really push them on some matters, would say, yeah, OK, I guess there&#39;s some extenuating circumstances.</span>

But the story, if you&#39;re telling the right one, I think it can be can be very powerful um so i&#39;d say that it&#39;s underrated card</span>

            <span class="text">hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of information with data on every page that is difficult to figure out the better of. Like I&#39;m looking at social housing and I see a $70 million cut in the capital program and a $30 million cut in the operations. But I&#39;m not sure that that wasn&#39;t moved to a different responsibility. It wasn&#39;t a grant that&#39;s going to be given to a not-for-profit agency, right? Like, there&#39;s the shifting</span>

            <span class="text">shifting of these responsibilities. It takes time to analyze this properly, and I&#39;d say we really won&#39;t have a sense of this for a little while.</span>

            <span class="text">Stephen&#39;s absolutely right that it takes a long time to understand what the budget is actually about. out. But it is important because when a budget gets defined, it can be hard to shake that definition. This is not something that people are going to be talking about and thinking about by and large over the next several weeks. And so you want that first impression to stick. And for that first impression to be favorable, you need the analysis to be favorable. So I would say it is underrated. Now, there are expensive ways you can make up for a kind of a halting start out of the the gate, mostly involve buying</span>

            <span class="text">buying a ton of ads and reinforcing the message. Sometimes that&#39;s absolutely necessary if you&#39;re picking fights with many, many stakeholders in your budget, because they&#39;re just going to use their airtime bit by bit and kind of make you feel pain. But that analysis is worth its weight in gold, for sure.</span>
