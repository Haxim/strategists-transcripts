My greatest weakness is that I care too much. Guys, let&#39;s talk about Bill Morneau. And let&#39;s talk about the fact that he is no longer, well, he technically is the finance minister until Justin Trudeau finds a new one. But today, he has resigned as being the finance minister, resigning as the MP for Toronto Centre. Before we get into the words of what he said, Corey, I want to talk about what we kind of saw in the lead up to him resigning officially, which was a hastily organized press conference where the opposition members usually give their press conferences. They were running around trying to, you know, find enough flags to create some sense of a semblance of a backdrop. What does that kind of tell you? Give me your sense from, you know, this hastily organized press conference on the day he was meeting with the prime minister. Give me a sense of if you&#39;re reading any of those tea leaves for for any insight well</div>

          <div class="said">well i i just don&#39;t know enough about the booking of their various media rooms over in uh on parliament hill but i i don&#39;t so the media was pretty seized with this as we were all trying to figure out why morneau was calling a press conference at 7 p.m and then it came out that he was holding his press conference in a room that is not generally used by government ministers although i i certainly get the impression they they could use it. It&#39;s not necessarily verboten to them or anything like that. And so, of course, that started a flurry of speculation. And that speculation was, I think, directionally correct, which was that he was going to resign. But given the nature of his resignation statement and how he went back to how he and the prime minister were buddy-buddy and all of that, I don&#39;t think the prime minister&#39;s office said, no, you can&#39;t use the good media room. I think that&#39;s probably probably a bit of a stretch but i it does speak to the</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, we&#39;ll get into the double, triple reinterpretation and reckless speculation, which is what got us into this mess of recording two nights in a row. But before we do that, Before we do that, tell us about what you kind of make of the prime minister and the finance minister meeting on the day of and then having a press conference some 10 hours later in the day to kind of say, listen, it&#39;s over, we&#39;re done. What do you think was going on between that time of that initial meeting? I mean, I want you to speculate a bit in terms of maybe with some of your experience as to what could have been going on behind the scenes after that initial meeting. Because Morneau says he was not asked to resign, but there we are at a press conference some seven to ten hours later.</div>

So I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s related to the past scandals. I think it actually has something to do with the fundamental disagreement between the way the two of them view the Canadian economy and how they&#39;re going to move through it.

The prime minister could have gotten frustrated about we. That could have been compounded on frustrations he had about the finance minister&#39;s approach during this moment. And, you know, the prime minister does seem to want to remake the Canadian economy in response to COVID, right? This idea that you&#39;re going to build everything back for the 21st century, not for the 20th century, you know, the Biden build back better concept.</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, let&#39;s talk about the speech itself. Because that was what was most fascinating, at least in my mind, there was ultimately two prongs. The first one was him saying that, listen, he&#39;s proud of the work that he has done as finance Minister, that they need someone for the job that can be future-oriented. I was only going to run two terms. And then the second prong, which is, by the way, speaking of future-oriented, I now want to run the OECD and I&#39;m applying for that gig. So, you know, saying he can&#39;t lead the future of Canada, but certainly can lead the future of the OECD. I see no irony there whatsoever. But Carter, what do you make of that? Like, in terms of the message that you heard from a a political strategy level, some calm strategist said, go say this, right? Even if it&#39;s true, even if it isn&#39;t, go say this. What do you think the intent was? First, let&#39;s talk about the intent and let&#39;s then talk about what we should have done as an alternative. But go ahead, Carter.</div>

By the way, he&#39;s applying. So he&#39;s a very overconfident man talking about his application to the job and saying that the prime minister will be a reference, almost signaling that, you know, the prime minister likes people like Mark Carney, who&#39;ve got international finance and econ creds. So maybe I can go get this degree and come back and become a finance minister again. But Corey, what do you kind of make of of the communications intent, because I think that&#39;s really important for us to talk about, because I think that was a discussion that they must have had.</div>

I don&#39;t think it is a crazy notion that you don&#39;t want to be finance minister, but you are interested in being the Secretary General of the OECD. I think that might be a better job by most metrics. It probably pays days more. It almost certainly has less limelight on you. So you&#39;re able to do things like go on $41,000 trips for free, right? And maybe you shouldn&#39;t be able to, but just people aren&#39;t paying attention like that. And that</div>

          <div class="said">that to me was not the incredulous part of the idea that you are going to go and apply for the OECD. It&#39;s this notion that this is why is just so absurd, Because this is not how you would actually approach it if that was your – I mean, talk about burning your boats. It&#39;s like I&#39;m an MP, I&#39;m the finance minister, and I&#39;m giving up all of that to campaign for the OECD, and I&#39;m doing it right now during a global emergency. That sounds like the kind of employee you want to hire if you&#39;re the OECD. I mean, it doesn&#39;t really – it&#39;s strange credulity is putting it modestly. Like, if we were going to take at face value that he only wanted to do two terms, him resigning right now would be a sign of a snap election. And by the way, then he still wouldn&#39;t resign on the spot. He just wouldn&#39;t run again, right? None of this sort of holds together. But how</div>

You need to take, I think, a couple of nights to sleep on it, talk to a few people, see who would be best for it. there&#39;s an opportunity to appoint uh canada&#39;s i mean i i guess technically um the associate minister of finance is now the minister of finance so technically we have our first um female minister of finance i i&#39;m guessing um these technicalities i mean if she hasn&#39;t been sworn in i&#39;m not sure exactly how that works but um you</div>

          <div class="said">That really depends on how much work they&#39;ve already done and whether they were preparing for a cabinet shuffle, because let&#39;s not forget what the catalyst events here were. The suggestion that Morneau may be shuffled out by the Prime Minister into a different portfolio is pretty high on everybody&#39;s speculation list. So if that was potentially what was underway, and if that is what triggered Morneau to hand in his resignation, you know, because, you know, there&#39;s two ways you can read substantive policy differences. One is the Prime Minister said, I don&#39;t want you in this position anymore. And the other is Morneau says, I will not do this for you anymore. But if it was the I don&#39;t want you in this position anymore, and a cabinet shuffle was underway, do</div>

And we&#39;ll look to fill the minister of Canadian heritage at a future date because then it becomes really clear what the actual story was without the prime minister coming out and saying what the actual story was. And that could be part of a media strategy as well as to what actually happened. But again, I mean, this is in some ways this is the more reckless speculation because it is so dependent on how prepared everybody was and what things were. If they are not ready, if they were fully intending for Morneau to be the finance minister, and the cabinet to be the same today, tomorrow, next week,</div>

Obviously, if the prime minister&#39;s got large plans, he should implement them. And again, this is the speculation. We don&#39;t know what triggered it. But look, we&#39;ve got a $343 billion deficit. It is really tough for me to imagine that Morneau&#39;s line in the sand, the principle that he would not give away was putting a couple billion dollars towards green programs. Like, if there is a substantive policy difference here, it&#39;s got to be huge. It&#39;s got to be kind of remaking the Canadian economy kind of huge. And I can&#39;t</div>

But, yeah, of course, they&#39;re going to claim victory, quote unquote victory. And I think that it&#39;s reasonable that they do. People have been saying for weeks that Bill Morneau looked</div>

What do they do going forward, right? You know there&#39;s going to be this week long of a drip campaign, so to speak, of what the process story actually was.

Those are all going to be lines of attack this week.
