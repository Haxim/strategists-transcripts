That&#39;s why we do it. Otherwise, we live and die by polls. I mean, we do polls all the time.

There&#39;s been moments, I think, in Canadian political history where political parties are up in the polls, and it&#39;s not even about their polls overall. It could be polling on an issue. It could be a subject. They almost refuse to talk about it. It&#39;s like this no-go zone. We don&#39;t want to talk about the public opinion. something, whether it is us or an issue we are championing. Is this defensible, Corey?

            <div class="said">but carter to to this point right we know the behavior of politicians in fact i&#39;d argue that the elected uh principals often are the most obsessed with the polls right they want to understand where they&#39;re going if they match up if they line up uh where there&#39;s you know uh what the what the what the margin of error is all the things cory&#39;s kind of put on the table yet they also kind of say that they want to be data driven etc. To me, it would be refreshing, Carter, if a politician said, you know, fuck, you know, we looked at the polls and we said, this is kind of not going well for us. And we made a course correction. And I think it&#39;s going to hopefully help. And we&#39;ll see if it&#39;s it would be refreshing to me, Carter. But tell me this. Would it be strategic? This is the question I want to ultimately ask, right, is why the fuck do we still do this? It would be refreshing. It&#39;d be a breath of fresh air. But would it be strategic for politicians to say, fuck, yeah, I read the polls. I try to take all information, and currently what we&#39;re seeing is X, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing Y. Wouldn&#39;t that just make, even on this issue, such a simpler explanation for the Trudeau government in so many ways? So talk to me about this. Is it strategic?</div>

We&#39;ve talked about the balance that needs to be struck between leading and reflecting. Understood. And if you admit to leading by poll, then you are abdicating your responsibility as a leader in general. But so many do, Carter. I&#39;m not arguing that point. I&#39;m not arguing that point.

And those things will determine courses of action going forward. And if you sit there and you get a poll and it&#39;s like, oh, 80% of people are against me, they&#39;re deeply immovable. The only people that are movable are my people to the other side. Well, that tells you one approach of action. Whereas if you say, oh, you know, only 40% of people actually have made up their mind to any particular degree. The people who are really firm on it are my people. The people who are loose on their opinion are the other side&#39;s people. And they do seem to care about it. I mean, then you take a different approach, right?

            <div class="said">like me, an undercutting of his signature policy, Corey. I might be inclined to, yeah. Yes. Well, the Canadian government is doubling the pollution price rebate. We&#39;re all top up. That rate is going up. We should mention that. But what&#39;s capturing the headlines, lines, Corey, is they&#39;re implementing a three-year pause to the federal carbon price on deliveries of heating oil in all jurisdiction with the federal fuel charges in effect. This is what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Thursday. A couple of matters of fact, home heating oil, primarily Atlantic Canada. That&#39;s where this announcement was made. And, Carter, more importantly, to be clear, in simple words, this is a carve-out. This is a carve-out of the carbon tax policy that This government announced, I believe, just mere weeks ago, maybe even earlier, that they would not be doing. This was not under consideration. And yet here we are, Carter. So the question I have to start this off is, is this actually undercutting your signature policy or are you looking at it differently? Right. Just even my sort of like editorial sort of thumb on the scale. Am I fair in putting it and positioning it that way or am I wrong in doing so, Carter? Oh,</div>

            <div class="said">Oh, I think it&#39;s absolutely undercutting the signature policy. I mean, but but keep in mind that Corey Hogan, you remember Corey Hogan, he&#39;s a member of this podcast. He said at one point that the liberals need to steal policy ideas from the conservatives and steal they did. it um you know like this is one of their ideas this is something that uh will probably work in atlantic canada i mean uh and it won&#39;t work in other places so that to me is uh it it is an undermining too like let&#39;s not let&#39;s not kind of get too far away from that this is something that really uh undercuts the objectives of the carbon tax and really under under cuts all of the primary messaging especially around the idea that the rebates were giving back the money that was collected and there was so much more money collected that everybody was going to get more more money in their pockets uh corey and i in our fantastic podcast all the way back on friday yeah</div>

And the carbon tax wasn&#39;t a required, the only solution to the climate issue is this type of action. This was the one that many economists pushed forward.

            <div class="said">So undercutting their signature policy, I mean, I don&#39;t 100% know. no, I think you can debate it. Does it take what&#39;s supposed to be a neutral price mechanism and change that? Does it send a signal to the market that if things get really bad, don&#39;t worry, the government&#39;s going to back down on these things? I&#39;m not wild about it, but let&#39;s let the economists continue to have that conversation. My personal opinion is it probably undercuts the policy, but more interesting to me is it undercuts their signature politics. politics and so here&#39;s the here&#39;s the bottom line folks you can&#39;t run around for years saying this thing is a net positive to the good people of canada who are subjected to it and then say oh we recognize your hardship because of this so here is a holiday from it like those two things do not jive it was hard enough for the liberals to try to sell the carbon tax as revenue neutral because of the gap between you getting the rebate and you actually uh you know feeling it at the the pump on a daily basis like there&#39;s just like there&#39;s not a good alignment there there&#39;s no matching there right so that&#39;s a challenge but um then when you then go around and say but we acknowledge this has become a an affordability hardship and present it in this way by actually giving a holiday from the tax because of affordability and because of the pressure on affordability you&#39;ve blown up your comms on your biggest piece of politics uh arguably arguably full stop right there are other things that the liberals have done that are significant policy initiatives but they&#39;re not the things that we&#39;re talking about they&#39;re not the things on which discourse floats those are things even the child care thing the</div>

            <div class="said">right? So you&#39;ve got a fairness problem. You&#39;ve got to clean that up. You can&#39;t pull back the policy, so all you can do is extend it to other people. That&#39;s basically the only way I see out of that particular box. The second challenge you have is you have a policy problem. You have people saying this is going to undercut your environmental challenge. i guess i&#39;ll say policy problem is like the people who want to see environmental action are probably the most jaded and disgruntled about this right now so you&#39;ve got to fight through and you&#39;ve got to say this is how i&#39;m going to make even bigger impact on this particular thing now you have especially if you&#39;re addressing the fairness problem you know you&#39;re really kind of monkeying with that kind of market effect where it&#39;s supposed to be let the market determine the best way to reduce the price of carbon or reduce carbon output because you&#39;ve got a price on it and if it&#39;s a lot of carbon it&#39;s going to cost more and if it&#39;s less it&#39;s going to cost less and so the whole idea of a carbon tax is you dust your hands as a government and you let the market figure it out that&#39;s why economists love it it&#39;s why you think of it as more historically a right wing idea but you&#39;ve clearly walked away from that and to be fair because of construction and because of another you know million choices we&#39;ve made along the way it&#39;s never been like a pure market mechanism right i think we can acknowledge that so this is just saying i&#39;m</div>

            <div class="said">i&#39;m not going to get the economist back on side but i think i can get the environmental core back on site so if you want to deal with the fairness by extending it as far as possible and if you want to deal with the kind of the environmental zeal and the policy or however you want to describe it then you&#39;re going to have to go deeper right you&#39;re going to have to go into this farther and so what can you do that could have like a dramatic effect and</div>

            <div class="said">and then the third problem i want to put on the table is affordability which is driving all of this and so it&#39;s not even fair to put it third the whole reason you&#39;re you&#39;re feeling the need to act in this particular fashion is because you&#39;re getting fucking crushed on affordability. Stephen said it last on Friday, and he&#39;s 100% right. What boggles my mind is that they actually did this through the carbon tax. Why didn&#39;t they just create a new affordability measure for people in rural Atlantic Canada? What the fuck stopped them from doing that as an economic development thing in Atlantic Canada?

            <div class="said">But they didn&#39;t. And so now, how do you deal with the affordability thing writ large and so that&#39;s where the big spend to reduce overall bills comes in and so by tying you know this one policy or the series of policy steps could effectively deal with all three of those things so when you ask me why or how i came to these conclusions it&#39;s that it&#39;s saying okay what are the actual problems in front of us why are people reacting the way they are why did we feel we needed to do this in the first place and is there There&#39;s something we can do that can check all of these boxes.

And it actually allows you to have, like one of the challenges the Axe the Tax campaign has always had, in my view, especially with younger demographics, is it&#39;s the moral low ground. It&#39;s that we don&#39;t want to act on the environment because it&#39;s expensive and it&#39;s making things hard for me. That&#39;s not moral high ground. Now you can wrap it in, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to make things work for my family. i&#39;m just trying to get by this is making me all of a sudden in a precarious situation but it is you know grabbing that moral high ground isn&#39;t isn&#39;t innate for a lot of the audiences that pierre polyev wants and needs to connect to but</div>

But where he and I strongly differ is I believe it&#39;s a challenge as much in Alberta as it is in Halifax. I believe it&#39;s as much of a challenge in Ottawa as it is in St. John&#39;s.
