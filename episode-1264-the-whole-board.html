            <span class="text">podcast, political podcast is not what we&#39;re defending today. Carter, here&#39;s what I want to talk about. Over this weekend, I heard the rural development minister, I think that&#39;s her title, federal one, on Vashie Capella&#39;s show on Question Period. And she said something that I&#39;ve heard politicians say forever, which is we&#39;re not paying attention to the polls. We don&#39;t look at the polls. Carter,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">do we still have in a 2023 era where politicians say, I want to be data driven in how I make my decisions. Why do politicians still refuse to acknowledge that they look at polling? Carter, the question is, why the fuck do we still do this? Is this defensible in your mind? well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i mean there&#39;s only one reason to do this and that is the polls are bad that you would never do this i don&#39;t want to talk about the issue i&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i&#39;m talking about no i&#39;m talking about the issue of politicians refusing to acknowledge the polls regardless of issue yeah but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but you do that because there&#39;s only one reason to do it zane you would only do it if you were sucking in the polls if you&#39;re doing well in the polls you use the polls all the time you say well the polls show that we&#39;re doing a very good job and everybody loves us that&#39;s the you So when you ask, why do we do this? That&#39;s why we do it. Otherwise, we live and die by polls. I mean, we do polls all the time. I mean, I&#39;ve had polls out all over the place the last few weeks, really, and each one of those polls is telling me a story. Now, they&#39;re not the horse race polls that we see trumpeted in the media, but nonetheless, they&#39;re super important. The data-driven side, as you&#39;ve mentioned, is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is super important. We need to know exactly what&#39;s happening. So what you&#39;re asking me is, why does someone say that they&#39;re not important? Well, there&#39;s only one reason. Only one reason. They&#39;re getting killed.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Coy, I&#39;m not sure I agree with Carter. I want to push back a bit. There&#39;s been moments, I think, in Canadian political history where political parties are up in the polls, and it&#39;s not even about their polls overall. It could be polling on an issue. It could be a subject. They almost refuse to talk about it. It&#39;s like this no-go zone. We don&#39;t want to talk about the public opinion. something, whether it is us or an issue we are championing. Is this defensible, Corey? In your mind, Canadian politicians, at least, not wanting to acknowledge the fullness of polls? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, politicians want to be known as principled, right? And it&#39;s tough to be known as principled when it looks like you&#39;re just a weather vane and you could be replaced and your entire caucus could be replaced by a good contract from Ipsos, maybe backed up with another contract from another other polls just to be safe</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so that&#39;s a bit of why they do it but you&#39;re you&#39;re right it&#39;s absurd that of course they look at polls they sweat polls perpetually if you are within a political caucus hearing about a poll will send people scurrying like rats to cheese like oh my god did you do here did you hear there&#39;s this new poll by insert group x did you see the poll did you see the new poll oh i heard about the new poll but i didn&#39;t see the new poll did you see the new poll what&#39;s in the new poll did you see the cross tabs of the new poll when our numbers</span>

            <span class="text">but carter to to this point right we know the behavior of politicians in fact i&#39;d argue that the elected uh principals often are the most obsessed with the polls right they want to understand where they&#39;re going if they match up if they line up uh where there&#39;s you know uh what the what the what the margin of error is all the things cory&#39;s kind of put on the table yet they also kind of say that they want to be data driven etc. To me, it would be refreshing, Carter, if a politician said, you know, fuck, you know, we looked at the polls and we said, this is kind of not going well for us. And we made a course correction. And I think it&#39;s going to hopefully help. And we&#39;ll see if it&#39;s it would be refreshing to me, Carter. But tell me this. Would it be strategic? This is the question I want to ultimately ask, right, is why the fuck do we still do this? It would be refreshing. It&#39;d be a breath of fresh air. But would it be strategic for politicians to say, fuck, yeah, I read the polls. I try to take all information, and currently what we&#39;re seeing is X, and that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing Y. Wouldn&#39;t that just make, even on this issue, such a simpler explanation for the Trudeau government in so many ways? So talk to me about this. Is it strategic?</span>

And if you admit to leading by poll, then you are abdicating your responsibility as a leader in general. But so many do, Carter. I&#39;m not arguing that point. I&#39;m not arguing that point.

But the inputs matter a lot more internally to decision-making, to Stephen&#39;s point, right? Who is movable on this issue? Have people made up their mind? Do people actually care about this issue? And those things will determine courses of action going forward. And if you sit there and you get a poll and it&#39;s like, oh, 80% of people are against me, they&#39;re deeply immovable. The only people that are movable are my people to the other side. Well, that tells you one approach of action. Whereas if you say, oh, you know, only 40% of people actually have made up their mind to any particular degree. The people who are really firm on it are my people. The people who are loose on their opinion are the other side&#39;s people. And they do seem to care about it. I mean, then you take a different approach, right? And so this is all very important stuff. And I guess there is an overall poll literacy challenge we have, not just with media, not just with the public, but with politicians that</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s a lot of mind-bending stuff. Thankfully, most politicians never read polls or acknowledge their existence. We&#39;re going to leave it there. And I&#39;d probably expect to see a lot more of that. bad politicians on television, radio, and all platforms denying that they have knowledge or acknowledge any sort of polling. We&#39;re going to move it on to our next segment. Our next segment, climate change. Speaking of change, Corey, a big change by Justin Trudeau. One might even call it,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">like me, an undercutting of his signature policy, Corey. I might be inclined to, yeah. Yes. Well, the Canadian government is doubling the pollution price rebate. We&#39;re all top up. That rate is going up. We should mention that. But what&#39;s capturing the headlines, lines, Corey, is they&#39;re implementing a three-year pause to the federal carbon price on deliveries of heating oil in all jurisdiction with the federal fuel charges in effect. This is what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Thursday. A couple of matters of fact, home heating oil, primarily Atlantic Canada. That&#39;s where this announcement was made. And, Carter, more importantly, to be clear, in simple words, this is a carve-out. This is a carve-out of the carbon tax policy that This government announced, I believe, just mere weeks ago, maybe even earlier, that they would not be doing. This was not under consideration. And yet here we are, Carter. So the question I have to start this off is, is this actually undercutting your signature policy or are you looking at it differently? Right. Just even my sort of like editorial sort of thumb on the scale. Am I fair in putting it and positioning it that way or am I wrong in doing so, Carter? Oh,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I think it&#39;s absolutely undercutting the signature policy. I mean, but but keep in mind that Corey Hogan, you remember Corey Hogan, he&#39;s a member of this podcast. He said at one point that the liberals need to steal policy ideas from the conservatives and steal they did. it um you know like this is one of their ideas this is something that uh will probably work in atlantic canada i mean uh and it won&#39;t work in other places so that to me is uh it it is an undermining too like let&#39;s not let&#39;s not kind of get too far away from that this is something that really uh undercuts the objectives of the carbon tax and really under under cuts all of the primary messaging especially around the idea that the rebates were giving back the money that was collected and there was so much more money collected that everybody was going to get more more money in their pockets uh corey and i in our fantastic podcast all the way back on friday yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Uh, what? So I went and checked and Corey was right. And that&#39;s just infuriated me, uh, as you can imagine, cause I don&#39;t like it when Corey&#39;s right. So I&#39;m just furious that this is the way that they&#39;re going. Cause we talked about many different options. Like this was not a required back down in my mind to begin with. And the carbon tax wasn&#39;t a required, the only solution to the climate issue is this type of action. This was the one that many economists pushed forward. But in terms of voter impact, this maybe isn&#39;t the best solution. But now we&#39;ve moved to the place where the</span>

And give me just your political blast zone right now. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So undercutting their signature policy, I mean, I don&#39;t 100% know. no, I think you can debate it. Does it take what&#39;s supposed to be a neutral price mechanism and change that? Does it send a signal to the market that if things get really bad, don&#39;t worry, the government&#39;s going to back down on these things? I&#39;m not wild about it, but let&#39;s let the economists continue to have that conversation. My personal opinion is it probably undercuts the policy, but more interesting to me is it undercuts their signature politics. politics and so here&#39;s the here&#39;s the bottom line folks you can&#39;t run around for years saying this thing is a net positive to the good people of canada who are subjected to it and then say oh we recognize your hardship because of this so here is a holiday from it like those two things do not jive it was hard enough for the liberals to try to sell the carbon tax as revenue neutral because of the gap between you getting the rebate and you actually uh you know feeling it at the the pump on a daily basis like there&#39;s just like there&#39;s not a good alignment there there&#39;s no matching there right so that&#39;s a challenge but um then when you then go around and say but we acknowledge this has become a an affordability hardship and present it in this way by actually giving a holiday from the tax because of affordability and because of the pressure on affordability you&#39;ve blown up your comms on your biggest piece of politics uh arguably arguably full stop right there are other things that the liberals have done that are significant policy initiatives but they&#39;re not the things that we&#39;re talking about they&#39;re not the things on which discourse floats those are things even the child care thing the</span>

In fact, he went with more of a tax incentive, which we&#39;re now also competing in, to be totally clear, in that lane to get battery plants and others. but carter like to this point we see this math right even i see this math right which is why i was so confident about it the</span>

You&#39;re hearing that we just need a little bit of time. We&#39;re not telling you to get rid of the policy.

Everybody&#39;s driving an EV in Montreal because Because their plan offers a tremendous number of incentives for EV purchase. Are they not going to advocate for more? This implies that every important region of the country isn&#39;t going to have some sort of reaction. And then as they react, there&#39;s going to need to be action to placate.

            <span class="text">so when you face a problem like this you&#39;ve got to start saying okay what is the actual problem in front of me and you can&#39;t just say the the policy it&#39;s bad right you have to say okay what are the major lines of critique that i am actually feeling quite</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">quite um quite on the defensive on here and so i i see a few different problems i&#39;ll just name a couple of them here for the purposes of brevity one is there&#39;s a fairness problem it really looks like cynical politics that you&#39;ve You&#39;ve created a policy that you&#39;re pretending is about a type of fuel, but is in reality about a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? So you&#39;ve got a fairness problem. You&#39;ve got to clean that up. You can&#39;t pull back the policy, so all you can do is extend it to other people. That&#39;s basically the only way I see out of that particular box. The second challenge you have is you have a policy problem. You have people saying this is going to undercut your environmental challenge. i guess i&#39;ll say policy problem is like the people who want to see environmental action are probably the most jaded and disgruntled about this right now so you&#39;ve got to fight through and you&#39;ve got to say this is how i&#39;m going to make even bigger impact on this particular thing now you have especially if you&#39;re addressing the fairness problem you know you&#39;re really kind of monkeying with that kind of market effect where it&#39;s supposed to be let the market determine the best way to reduce the price of carbon or reduce carbon output because you&#39;ve got a price on it and if it&#39;s a lot of carbon it&#39;s going to cost more and if it&#39;s less it&#39;s going to cost less and so the whole idea of a carbon tax is you dust your hands as a government and you let the market figure it out that&#39;s why economists love it it&#39;s why you think of it as more historically a right wing idea but you&#39;ve clearly walked away from that and to be fair because of construction and because of another you know million choices we&#39;ve made along the way it&#39;s never been like a pure market mechanism right i think we can acknowledge that so this is just saying i&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i&#39;m not going to get the economist back on side but i think i can get the environmental core back on site so if you want to deal with the fairness by extending it as far as possible and if you want to deal with the kind of the environmental zeal and the policy or however you want to describe it then you&#39;re going to have to go deeper right you&#39;re going to have to go into this farther and so what can you do that could have like a dramatic effect and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then the third problem i want to put on the table is affordability which is driving all of this and so it&#39;s not even fair to put it third the whole reason you&#39;re you&#39;re feeling the need to act in this particular fashion is because you&#39;re getting fucking crushed on affordability. Stephen said it last on Friday, and he&#39;s 100% right. What boggles my mind is that they actually did this through the carbon tax. Why didn&#39;t they just create a new affordability measure for people in rural Atlantic Canada? What the fuck stopped them from doing that as an economic development thing in Atlantic Canada? But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But they didn&#39;t. And so now, how do you deal with the affordability thing writ large and so that&#39;s where the big spend to reduce overall bills comes in and so by tying you know this one policy or the series of policy steps could effectively deal with all three of those things so when you ask me why or how i came to these conclusions it&#39;s that it&#39;s saying okay what are the actual problems in front of us why are people reacting the way they are why did we feel we needed to do this in the first place and is there There&#39;s something we can do that can check all of these boxes.

            <span class="text">yeah because when you&#39;re looking at the moves right when you&#39;re looking at the moves the best way to do this is just to simply put cash in people&#39;s pockets right and it&#39;s it&#39;s not uh a super easy thing to do at certain levels of government but it is super easy to do at the federal level of government so you can you don&#39;t ever have to undermine the carbon tax you can say the carbon tax from you know we&#39;re just going to keep doing the carbon tax but we&#39;re also happen to be implementing some sort of a a new idea or a quick subsidy on you know those who are heating using heating oil and that subsidy is going to time out in three years right but for now everybody who heats with heating oil is going to get a subsidy it has nothing to do with the carbon tax it&#39;s actually just messaging right and and that&#39;s why i&#39;m so so convinced that this government is done because they didn&#39;t even think of that they didn&#39;t go to the easy way they went the hard way well we&#39;ve gone and we&#39;ve done ourselves a carbon tax so now we have to undo the carbon tax in order to make this other thing work where does it say that in the rules right the rules of politics don&#39;t say you&#39;ve got to do the The you know, you&#39;ve got to make sure that the the your primary policy initiative is undermined by your actions subsequent to the policy initiative being implemented. Right. There&#39;s no fucking handbook.</span>

            <span class="text">It&#39;s not a handbook. Right. So the handbook doesn&#39;t have you got to fuck yourself in order to, you know, do good politics. In fact, the policy handbook generally says you should try not to fuck yourself when you&#39;re when you&#39;re getting yourself out of a problem. And this government, for whatever reason, however they chose to make the decision, they decided that the best course of action for them was to fuck themselves. Now, personally, I think that that&#39;s pretty stupid. it corey by his definite you know by the way that he walked them out of it by walking them out of it straight into you know straight into essentially biden&#39;s plans which by the way i think we discussed on friday and ultimately was my idea but whatever corey i mean whatever you got to do to give yourself up but you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but yeah this is this is the time like all of those pre uh pre-planned events where you&#39;re going around saying ax the tax you&#39;ve just been giving your narrative here and even justin trudeau realizes now what a terrible tax this has been but you know what&#39;s worse good people of uh pickering ontario good people of downtown edmonton wherever you are that you&#39;re talking and that you&#39;re on the offensive here he&#39;s decided that that he cares much more about buying votes in Atlantic Canada than treating Canadians the same coast to coast to coast and for shame on him. And it actually allows you to have, like one of the challenges the Axe the Tax campaign has always had, in my view, especially with younger demographics, is it&#39;s the moral low ground. It&#39;s that we don&#39;t want to act on the environment because it&#39;s expensive and it&#39;s making things hard for me. That&#39;s not moral high ground. Now you can wrap it in, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to make things work for my family. i&#39;m just trying to get by this is making me all of a sudden in a precarious situation but it is you know grabbing that moral high ground isn&#39;t isn&#39;t innate for a lot of the audiences that pierre polyev wants and needs to connect to but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but it&#39;s pretty easy to understand they&#39;re buying votes in atlanta canada and you&#39;re getting screwed and that is moral high ground to say there&#39;s a problem with that the prime minister acknowledges this carbon tax is a challenge like We all agree about that now, apparently. But where he and I strongly differ is I believe it&#39;s a challenge as much in Alberta as it is in Halifax. I believe it&#39;s as much of a challenge in Ottawa as it is in St. John&#39;s. And so that all of a sudden opens up this whole other righteous lane for you if you&#39;re Pierre Polyev going out there.</span>

So advice and cautions to them as it relates to that advocacy. And we could talk about the drive-by that Minister Hutchings gave to Alberta, Corey, as well during this part, our Alberta MPs.

            <span class="text">well nothing Nothing in life is as good or as bad as you think it is. And I doubt that like the absolute final chapter on the carbon tax has been written. I&#39;m sure that it will apply in many different ways. But I could easily see, especially a government looking at an election in 2025, them making additional tweaks, shall we say, to it now that they&#39;ve opened that. And the question, it&#39;s kind of like George Washington&#39;s axe, right? You replace the handle, you replace the blade. Is it still George Washington&#39;s axe? You&#39;re just doing it bit by bit. i&#39;m not sure it&#39;s going to look anything like it does today just based on the action or like i guess i mean a week ago based on the actions of this government but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">So my question is, if you&#39;re in the PMO tonight, you&#39;re Katie Telford, right? You&#39;re the prime minister. You&#39;re on the WhatsApp chat with the PMO. Someone pitches this idea, right? Either as a voice note, long form, whatever. As a chief of staff, am I just like being like, fuck it, let&#39;s actually do this? And of course, it&#39;s not gonna be that flip, but it&#39;s like, let&#39;s go. I think there&#39;s something here. Or do I have to like, you know, am I like responsible for generating these ideas? This is actually like more of a culture question than anything else. Yeah. or a division of labor question, but whose responsibility is to solve this issue?</span>

            <span class="text">I want to hear Carter&#39;s answer too, but I&#39;ll tell you, it really depends. And if you have a principal secretary or somebody who&#39;s supposed to be the tall forehead, then you probably test these things as a group. You run it up the flagpole to see if the prime minister immediately kills it or not. And if they don&#39;t, then</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but the problem is the the prime minister immediately killing it and this you know like so the idea let&#39;s be clear the idea does not come from the pmo right the the the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but it&#39;s got to come it&#39;s got to come from uh you know it&#39;s usually a young person who&#39;s who&#39;s reaching way above their station to come up with an idea and and then that young person or or that uh tall forehead as cory has described them uh carries it up and it it makes it through the ADM and it makes it through the DM and then it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it makes it through the chief of staff and ultimately onto the prime minister&#39;s desk. And the way that Corey just described it is the problem. It doesn&#39;t get killed by the chief of staff or the prime minister.</span>
