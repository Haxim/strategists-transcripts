            <span class="text">This is a strategist episode 1024. My name is Zain Velji. With me as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Guys, I lied to the audience. I said see you next year. But guess what, Carter? It&#39;s still this year.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, lying to the audience is one of the things that we&#39;re most proud of. So that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s amazing. So when I was talking about the cold, cold weather, that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that wasn&#39;t true. I kind of Santos-ed you all. You</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You mean that time when you were in the bathtub recording the episode? Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, yeah. I was not actually in Calgary. Can you believe that? Wow. Or the other time where there was like the Hawaiian prince behind me. Yeah. You could see the beach and hear kind of like soft tropical music. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I was in Hawaii. Personally, I couldn&#39;t put it together.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s almost like I&#39;m a part of the Democratic Party. I just couldn&#39;t put it together. I have brought you here for a very special reason. I have brought you here, no, not to do a live reaction episode, Stephen, to our Holiday Spectacular, which is available if you haven&#39;t listened to it. Rave reviews, by the way. Rave reviews on the Holiday Spectacular. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Getting a lot of good reviews. Yeah, people love this. People love the eulogies every year. I mean, they love it every year because it&#39;s a tradition. But I have brought you together because there is a story, Carter, as they say in our political zeitgeist, not one of our own here in Canada, but a story out of the United States that has opened up a line of inquiry that is only suited by the capable hands of the strategist podcast, Carter. I&#39;m talking about one George Santos. You see, that&#39;s a name that Corey referred to earlier. We don&#39;t even know if that is his name. But Carter, this has become quite the story because George Santos is a newly elected congressman in new york if i&#39;m not mistaken long island baby long island um but carter he&#39;s a young man who apparently um does</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">does not or did not have the college degree he said he did no</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">no claim he held jobs that he did not hold at goldman sachs and others he claimed to own property that he did not uh he claims to have never committed check fraud which seems a very interesting thing to overtly claim you have never done, but he has. He claims to have been Jewish, but he said that he&#39;s actually Jew hyphen ish.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">He&#39;s also hilarious. That&#39;s one thing he claims to be. Has not claimed to be, but I agree. He&#39;s also described to be a self-described gay man, but he had a year-long heterosexual marriage that ended in 2019. Carter, this has been all the rage politically. He also did an interview on Fox News with Tulsi Gabbard, who, by the way, was a Democratic presidential candidate, now on Fox News. Welcome to 2022, 22 fucking people. This is insane. Anyways, he did an interview where he tried to apologize for all this stuff, tried to give a wide-ranging interview. It did not happen. All</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">All of this is put into question, A, his fitness to lead and be a congressperson. But Carter, this is not about that, because we are not in the United States. We really don&#39;t care much about George Santos. We really don&#39;t care about him as an individual. I mean, he&#39;s interesting in the sense of why he&#39;s created a different life for himself and what that might mean psychologically. ideologically, but there&#39;s a political element to this, of course, as it relates to Carter, vetting, opera research, the mechanics of that, why this happened, do the Republicans know about it, why the Democrats not catch it, the implications of, wait, could this happen here? That is why I&#39;ve brought you all together, because I want to discuss and use George Santos as a springboard, because, you know, he has opened up a question that I think many of us are wondering, which is, what the fuck? And can this happen here, Carter? So with</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">with that being said, I want to actually get started on the what the fuck element of it, Carter. When you read and have seen this story play out over the last week, I&#39;d say it&#39;s been roughly a week, right? Where the initial claims by the New York, by a smaller newspaper, and then the New York Times, and then the Washington Post started poking and prodding. And then he said, listen, guys, I&#39;m going to make a statement. And then he admitted kind of to having some falsehoods in his resume, and then ultimately to that series of interviews. Carter, when you saw all of this, I have a question for you that&#39;s perhaps a little bit more specific than what the fuck. It&#39;s, did you feel like what you were seeing was something that could</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">could happen here? Let me start with that. When you saw the drips and the drabs of what you witnessed with George George Santos, did you say, fuck, I know that story because there&#39;s one of them here? Or did you think, holy shit, this is crazy, like the rest of the internet reacted? From your strategist perspective, let&#39;s start there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I totally thought this is something that could happen here. And I totally thought this is something maybe that should happen here. Lord knows there&#39;s a lot of candidates I&#39;d like to make up rather than actually have to work with.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">name names? It&#39;s just before the holidays. Do you want to just commit all your sins right now? No, I&#39;m fine. I&#39;ll</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ll let people draw their own conclusions. Um, but it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it not only has it happened or not only could it happen, it has happened here where we&#39;ve had candidates who, uh, have a history that they try and get away from, um, that are able to get elected and then things are found out afterwards. Uh, maybe not to the same degree, maybe not to the same, you know, everything is happening all at once, but even you think of Andrew Scheer and his, his, uh, his claims of his history of, of work experience that he had. And I mean, essentially, the guy&#39;s an insurance salesman, but he was able to to puff that up. You know, there was there was elements of truth combined with some stylistic opportunism to to take him to a different level. And I think that that&#39;s relatively common. common um i also think that that some of what happened in the united states with the uh opposition trying to raise concerns or missing other concerns and trying to take things to the media i know we&#39;ll talk about that a little bit later or at least i hope we will um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know that that happens here i know that that if the opposition you know if if the other side says that this is a problem in the media can be very reluctant to pick it up and cover it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So, Corey, you know, when I say, can this happen here, let me get a little bit deeper, because Carter&#39;s actually hit on it. And I think, what was the term you used? Everything all at once, Carter? That&#39;s just it. That&#39;s what&#39;s really interesting about the Santos story, right? And Carter, just to be clear, this is not President Santos from the West Wing. Corey would not</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">not understand. No, I had that sense. Yeah, thank</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">His resume, impeccable. His resume, completely impeccable.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But as made up as George Santos. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s true. It&#39;s true. But made up. So, you know, that should have been a warning. Corey,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">everything all at once is what&#39;s interesting here, right? It&#39;s almost like a net new creation of self. Like there&#39;s almost like a psychological element to this, that when you put all of this together, identity, education, employment, history, religion, faith, everything had either a fabrication or an outright lie. It&#39;s almost like the only thing that was real was the physical manifestation of this guy. And then everything else scaffolding it was either, like I said, a fabrication or an outright fiction that he either internally believed or knew he was sort of and kind of convinced himself of or knew he was explicitly lying about. So when I asked that question, could this happen here with the frame I&#39;ve just given you? Corey, could this happen here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. I have not seen it at the level of like a federal elected official, but we have seen it. There was a person who was going</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">going to run for mayor of Calgary. I won&#39;t bother naming him because he&#39;s not the person in the story. And he hired a campaign manager. And that campaign manager said, I have all this money for you. I have all of these endorsements.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And it wasn&#39;t true. None of it was true. The person who was supposedly a legitimate candidate for office had to drop out because he didn&#39;t have the hundreds of thousands of dollars that his campaign manager said he had. And when they started digging into the campaign manager&#39;s background, not only was he using different names along the way, you know, Josh Baba, Josh Bredo. You know, it turned out he had made similar fabrications up in other roles, you know, about massive donations that were coming, I think, to like, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, widows of like war veterans and, you know, like really dramatic stuff. And it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it was all fake.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fake. And, you know, at the time, I remember thinking like, what in the actual fuck? Because it was somewhat tangentially related to things I was doing at the time because he almost ran in 2009 to be a candidate in a by-election in Calgary Glenmore for the liberals. and ultimately decided to run for mayor instead because his campaign manager said there was all this money. And then he launched a website and had to drop out when it learned that he didn&#39;t have the money that his campaign manager said he did.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But ultimately, my feeling about the person was he&#39;s not well, right? If you&#39;re fabricating these things and you&#39;re moving from lie to lie and you&#39;re just addicted to the endorphin rush of that one moment in the story or something, there&#39;s something unwell about that, right? I&#39;d like to start there. But I would also say that he is a logical conclusion of our nihilistic times. You&#39;re right. It&#39;s everything all at once. But we have seen versions of this. We&#39;ve seen embellishments that people brush off and say, oh, I don&#39;t care, right? Here in Canada, Stephen already mentioned, Andrew Scheer said he was an insurance broker. But Scheer had one of the four things required to be an insurance broker, had worked in an insurance office for six months, I think is what was finally there. I can also think of a liberal candidate who claimed to have a PhD. And while he&#39;d done most of the work to do that, he didn&#39;t. I was on the Greenlight Committee that should have caught that, which is probably why it sticks with me. I can think about candidates talking about being small business owners or consultants who were, in fact, basically functionally unemployed. I can think about times people have strongly implied degrees using language on their bios like attended University X, but did not have it. I can think about times where they did say they had degrees and implied they got them when they were younger, but in fact, maybe just finished them up a year ago before they were going on for a major job. And, you know, I&#39;ve certainly seen a ton of cultural connections implied, you know, we&#39;ve seen this in Alberta as recently as this month or last month, where our premier implied indigenous ancestry, and there&#39;s no evidence of that. We see this all of the time. And it used to be parties would hold their own to account for those things, because it was so damaging to the reputation of the party. And ultimately, parties held their own to account because the public would hold them to account if they didn&#39;t. And over time, we&#39;re seeing people care less and less. And as a result, we&#39;re seeing parties care less and less. And one of the things that really floors me, you asked like, what was the what the fuck? The what the fuck for me is the</span>

And I&#39;ll talk about whether that he believes that that exists here in parallel to how it exists in the United States. And we&#39;ll get back to that. But let&#39;s open this bracket on the why we have seen candidates in the past, either with a compounding effect of multiple fabrications or lies or singular ones, why we have seen them effectively</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">effectively make these stories up. Corey mentioned one that I want to revisit for a second. You said in your case, you thought someone was unwell. It&#39;s a sensitive topic. I don&#39;t want to dig deeper into it. I don&#39;t even know who you&#39;re referring to. But you mentioned that you think this person&#39;s unwell. So there&#39;s maybe a chronic sort of mental health issue or something. Carter kind of said there&#39;s that person who&#39;s kind of chronically unemployed, that politics is their way to earn an income. And they were hoping that they can maybe say small business owner, and then politics would effectively, you know, and that looks good on a resume. It&#39;s not very much tested. Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you on this. Any other reasons why you&#39;ve seen people lying? It could be about, you know, they feel like, A, they&#39;re not going to get caught, like other people don&#39;t call it out. It&#39;s kind of accepted. Give me the broader structure when you&#39;ve met with someone either as a political candidate or you&#39;ve seen them be elected and you&#39;re like, you know, I knew them. They really didn&#39;t do that. What do you think kind of leads to this particular moment from your experience yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah you know it&#39;s it&#39;s some sort of mix of need compulsion and desire right they&#39;re they&#39;re tempted in some cases by the opportunity that presents it uh often it starts as an embellishment or it starts with very specific language uh that over time just becomes very uh you know oh it just expands right so let&#39;s use the example of attended university x well Well, it was attended University X and then a campaign staffer gets their hands on it and says, graduated from University X and they don&#39;t correct it, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? And then all of a sudden it&#39;s there in a different way. So it can also just happen through a game of telephone that they don&#39;t correct because the embellishment is of value to them. But ultimately, I think the reason they don&#39;t correct it, the reason they make the embellishment in the first place is because they&#39;ve done a risk benefit analysis and they have decided either to take a gamble or that the risk benefit analysis makes sense for them to go out on that side and so here we are we&#39;re in a world where politicians are legally allowed to lie right you know there&#39;s no there&#39;s no contract with a politician when you quote-unquote hire them you know you&#39;re not getting what they promised there is no truth in advertising for politicians as we&#39;ve already talked about and the only kind of break on all of that was the public the public stepping in and saying unacceptable you are you are dead to us and And if your party stands by you, they are dead to us too. By extension, yeah. Yeah, over time, we have seen that that risk-benefit analysis has changed a lot as times have become more partisan. And so, yeah, this is a really nuts example. Like, this is an extreme manifestation, as we&#39;ve talked about. But we have also seen people brush off an awful lot. You&#39;re looking at the United States, Donald Trump&#39;s resume. Do we want to talk about Donald Trump? Like, all of the fraud allegations in the past. You know, that&#39;s, that was brushed away. So why wouldn&#39;t a Republican candidate think that was okay? We&#39;re willing to forgive most anything if they&#39;re on our sports team, it seems. So yeah, if that&#39;s the case, you&#39;ve got your Republican base locked up. The risk benefit analysis becomes, if I make this lie, my team will stand by me and maybe I&#39;ll convince some people in the middle. That totally changes the math. path.</span>

Carter, I want to give you an opportunity on this to expand on the list of the whys from your strategist and political operative experience. Why have you seen candidates embellish the truth? And it might just be the blindingly obvious. No one&#39;s called them out on it, so they expand it a bit. They add another degree to it. I mean that in both terms. They may add a degree in terms of what they graduate, but they go an extra degree in terms of the fabrication. But I&#39;m curious, what have you seen, and have you had to call candidates out to say, hey, reign this in, or I know this did not be true, or have you had to contour certain things? Curious about your experience and your thoughts. I&#39;m not sure</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that you feel like the George Santos story, the everything, everywhere? Yeah, I&#39;m gonna start with you on this one, Corey. All at once could not happen. Because in some ways, we might say that we might have more safeguards. In other ways, you might argue that your sports team analogy that we&#39;re willing to defend any behavior, as long as it&#39;s part of our sports team, and to what you and Carter have said about loyalty, that that might exist even stronger in Canada, with party discipline and with how we conduct our business, than it does in the United States. So I&#39;m not asking you to reconcile that, but give me what you think the Canadian take is. Do we have added safeguards? Do we have removed safeguards? And then when we talk about loyalty, doesn&#39;t it exist to a greater degree here than it does on the other side of the border?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Ah, yes, but you&#39;re forgetting one thing. and we talk about this a lot, in the United States, candidates pick their parties. In Canada, party picks their candidates, right? And so our big safeguard to avoid that happening here that the Americans don&#39;t have to the same degree is the green light process, the idea that candidates need to be approved by their political parties in order to even run for the nomination. So I mentioned that liberal candidate. And I mentioned that I was on the green light committee that should have caught that. One of the things that happens here is when somebody says, I would like like to be a candidate for a political party, to try to avoid this messiness, you fill out like a 50-page questionnaire about all these elements of your life. And then you are vetted by the party before you even get a chance to put your hand up and say, I&#39;m running for the nomination, right? You don&#39;t even get to say you&#39;re a candidate for the nomination until you&#39;ve gone through this particular process. And that process is quite thorough. I mean, it was very thorough when I I was doing it a decade ago. It could only be more thorough now. It involves you having to do kind of proof of your educational attainment. You&#39;ve got to do criminal checks. You&#39;ve got to do credit checks. So, for example, George Santos and his bad checks would not have gotten past a Canadian, even a basic Canadian vetting process. You need to write a list of all of the things that you&#39;ve written. You&#39;ve got to write out a list of all of the things that you have kind of participated panels. panels, it would just be a total nightmare for a lot of people to</span>

            <span class="text">The opposition research. Does vetting in Canada fundamentally change what opposition research is here and how it&#39;s done? Because we have seen in Canadian politics, the Bozo eruption style, as soon as the election is triggered, look what we found on this person. They tweeted this, they said that, we found some resume embellishments. But talk to me about the structure of opposition research, or even versus what you see in the United States, where we kind of have an understanding of the process where, you</span>

For example, the Wild Rose in 2012, 12, what was acceptable to them, you know, they were able to, you know, if someone was a pastor, um, that pastor was allowed to have said a lot of different things, uh, to have written a lot of different things and to be given certain frameworks for passing through because they were very pro Christian or very pro, um, that type of ideology. So the society can have different values, you know, and so things that were acceptable in the vetting process may not be acceptable to the society um the the uh</span>

What do you think it was that either didn&#39;t resonate or had the Democrats perhaps glare over this in one way, shape, or form?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but keep going. Yeah, they identified a number of holes. They couldn&#39;t confirm the degree. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean – actually, let me get through the list. They couldn&#39;t necessarily confirm the degree. They couldn&#39;t confirm the employment. They could not confirm the ownership of properties in – I think it was Nassau County. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so here&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s not that they missed it on the research. It&#39;s that they missed it on the follow-through because none of these things immediately – People have this assumption, I think, that when we&#39;re doing this kind of research, either as oppo or for green lighting, we get clear black and white answers. We don&#39;t. We do not get clear black and white answers. We get very gray answers and we have to decide how much follow through to do and is it worth it. So we talked about risk benefit. Let&#39;s also talk about cost benefit. And one of the challenges the Democrats had here was that this was at one point not supposed to be a competitive riding. So they did the initial research. They found a bunch of things. But they were not necessarily definitive, and to make them definitive would have incurred costs. And there were probably other races they thought it was better to use the resources that would be required to do that. And so what do I mean by cost? So, like, you hear we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">thing you want to do as a political party is to make that claim loudly and just look like total fools, because then you&#39;re going to have a boy who cried wolf challenge. Right. So instead, what you do is you have to shop it to the media. You have to encourage the media to follow up on these things. You have to say, we&#39;ve identified this. You should follow up on it. When you think about things like Citibank, Carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Carter made a great example. Maybe he didn&#39;t work for Citibank. Maybe he worked for a contractor, but like a deeply embedded one that&#39;s effectively Citibank. And you don&#39;t want to be the person who&#39;s parsing that and say, no, I didn&#39;t work for Citibank, but he sat in a Citibank office working for Citibank, but not for Citibank. So, again, you don&#39;t know. You need follow-up. You need follow-through. You need to start talking to other employees he would have worked with or not. You need to start talking to individuals who would be in the know as to the actual operations of that place. That takes time. That takes effort. And you might not think it&#39;s worth that effort. So it&#39;s the follow-through that becomes a challenge here. When you read the reporting, it sounds like the DCCC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, they had like the start of each of these stories.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">They just didn&#39;t do the follow through that&#39;s required to make these real stories. And there&#39;s no guarantee when you do the follow through, A, you&#39;re going to find out that you were right, or B, anybody&#39;s going to care.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, and this is where I think miss comes in, because Corey talks about resource allocation very smartly here around cost and risk benefit here. In your shoes, Carter, if you were the Democrats, right, the miss, I think, is did they miss an opportunity to execute on this and take it further? This was, to both of your points, a fringe riding in Long Island that they did not envision a Democratic meltdown, right, where the chair of the GCCC would actually lose a seat in New York, right, which he did.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so so in some ways if you were assessing this pre-november like the democrats did carter i know hindsight is 2020 but give me your honest take would you have gone further than them as a strategist would you said there&#39;s like nine things here and they&#39;re all open and there could be like this could blow up the party even more and and i guess the inherent question to for me Carter, is at what point does one candidate, like a Santos, start speaking to the character of a party, start speaking to the character of the Republicans? Do you feel like if you had executed on this, you may have gotten rid of him or you may have, you know, had him lose his seat, but you could have felt like the bigger win was to go after the Republicans in terms of the types of candidates they court? Or is it so easy to sever candidates these days that that&#39;s not worth it, that the only gain you get is ensuring that Santos is going to lose or off the ticket or drop by his party? Talk to me about how you would have approached this, given all the preconditions, Corey Layton.</span>

We&#39;re back on our shores, same scenario. What would your rules be of engagement? How would you think about this? Would you have gone further? Would you have gone for the kill? Would you have invested the resources? Knowing it&#39;s a riding you&#39;re supposed to win by double digits, how would you have approached it? I guess what I&#39;m trying to understand is, do the Democrats make any mistakes here, or do they actually play flawless ball and are now kind of getting um a rep or a reaction that they perhaps don&#39;t deserve i want to kind of think about it from rules of engagement perspective well</span>

But instead, in kind of this resource allocation, super frenzy that they do across</span>

            <span class="text">across the region, they look at it and they said, this is not where we&#39;re going to allocate the resources. And I suspect one of the corrections and it will probably be an overcorrection we&#39;ll see is there&#39;ll be a lot more focus on those individual races. But, you know, in Canada, it is different. In Canada, you sign off on a candidate in a way that you do not in the United States. Yes, you&#39;ve got groups that, you know, congressional groups that will donate the money and super PACs who put it in. And you can say, look, you supported this guy. But it&#39;s easier to say, well, that&#39;s who they chose in a primary or whatever the case may be, Zane. So it&#39;s a little harder, right? But, you know, one of the things that Carter said that is really worth underlining is the media&#39;s response to these things when you come to them with them, right? Yes.

So to give the media a little bit of credit here, they rightly look at these attacks with jaundiced eyes. When you bring them forward and you say, hey, look at this other campaign.

Think about the attacks they were already leveling at George Santos, about his involvement with January 6th and that he was an insurrectionist and all of this, these very breathless attacks about George Santos.

            <span class="text">something that they have said about their background right and you do it for a lot of reasons i&#39;ve known people who have claimed him to be a campaign manager for campaigns that I was campaign manager, and I&#39;ve not called bullshit on them, right? You just let a lot of things slide because we live in a society. But what I think is particularly interesting about the Santos thing, and just to wrap it here, is I&#39;m not remotely convinced if this New York Times reporting had come out, and if this had been broadly discussed on social media three days before the election, that it would have changed the outcome. I don&#39;t think the Republicans would have run from him. I think they would have stood by them. I think they would have said these are just smears and attacks. You know, they&#39;re trying to disparage the first openly gay, soon to be first openly gay Republican candidate, because we are in these partisan times. We&#39;re in these sports team times. And that&#39;s not just true of political operatives. That&#39;s true of people. You know, people are not very discerning about the things going on in their supporting candidates&#39; lives. And we should all maybe take this opportunity to reflect on that and say, what are we letting the people we support get away with?</span>

Like, at the end of the day, the check and balance we have on this democratic system is us and what we&#39;re willing to put up with and what we&#39;re not.</span>

            <span class="text">consuming all of this over the past week, having this episode put together, if a political party, any political party, could be any jersey color across the country, could be any order of government, were to ask you to write a memo, Stephen Carter, saying what lessons should we adopt based on what we saw in the United States, what would a couple of things on that memo be? be. And then I&#39;m going to get Corey to build on that to kind of finish us off here. Because what are the lessons you would take away, Carter? It could be investment in research. It could be about that. It could be about vetting. It could be about process. It could be about staffing. It could be about candidate quality control. It could be about many things, even derivative to what we&#39;ve discussed. But start us off here with a bit of a list, Carter. What are a couple of things you&#39;d put in that memo for any political party that wants to take this as a teachable moment, as a political operative what would you want to number</span>

And number two, make sure that you&#39;re finding every chink in the armor and going after the other side.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, you want to know my real lesson here? Yeah. People are willing to put up with almost anything these days. I&#39;m worried that the lessons that we will take here in Canada are negative ones. People are going to say, oh, sure, he padded it a little bit, but he&#39;s no George Santos, right? Like we have moved the bar as to what&#39;s acceptable political behavior in ways that are deeply unfortunate over time. And it takes a moment like this to really crystallize that. But if you want to know the true analysis, it&#39;s that you can get away with this shit in a way that you couldn&#39;t in the past, and that should scare us all. If you&#39;re thinking about how you can perhaps be on the lookout for this and how you can defend against it, what we need to say is what was the system failure here? Well, there were a bunch of things that were flags on the field. How do we make sure that we&#39;re following up on these things? How are we making sure that we are not so deep in our own spin cycles that we are following up on the things that matter to us and missing the things that would matter a lot to voters? And probably there&#39;s some work that needs to be done, even polling, you know, asking people, would you be concerned if candidate A had extreme views, if candidate A lied about a credential, if candidate A lied about a job that they had, and just get that list. Maybe one of the things that needs to happen for all oppo researchers everywhere is to build a better understanding of what matters to movable voters, not just their voters, not just the voters on the other side, but the group in the middle who could be swayed by a good argument. And maybe oppo has gotten really disconnected from that. I would argue here in Alberta, we have seen situations where the NDP have shown not a perfect sense of what&#39;s going to land. I would argue federally, for sure. both the liberals and the conservatives have thrown attacks at each other that I don&#39;t think are actually moving the middle.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, that is such a great point, because Carter, it does seem like we are in an era that opposition research is fundamentally changing in its efficacy if we keep going down the same path. Old tweets are less powerful every single day, their half-life is reducing. Even if with the the most controversial statements, to Corey&#39;s point, around the society we live in. And so the question is, like, what does effective opposition research fundamentally look like in the next cycle is different. And if you keep running that same playbook, like Carter, Bozo eruptions in 2023, the</span>

They thought that was the most salient thing and they didn&#39;t follow up on things that were at the end of the day like really fucking fascinating, really interesting. interesting and so i do believe that the lesson here is you&#39;ve got to get back to thinking about accessible voters not your side what is the orbit of movable voters be data driven what do they care about not what you think they would care about go out and get some polling have some focus groups understand what will actually move them with opposition research and then finally and most importantly not everything can be an 11 people are not able to discern the actual outrages when when you&#39;re outraged about absolutely everything.
