          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the vacations - both literal and from their senses - that politicians across Canada took during these times of Covid-19. Did Doug Ford set an impossibly high standard of action? How badly does this hurt Jason Kenney's government? And most importantly, what are the gang's New Year's resolutions? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

            <div class="said">guess, contravene orders, advisories, and travel either interprovincially or overseas over the course of our winter holidays. And it seems like Canadians don&#39;t like that shit. And not only do we have it happening at every order of government in this country, I would say that it is happening in a very interesting and perhaps more magnified way here in Alberta. So when we focus in on Alberta, we have right now, I think, six UCP MLAs that traveled out of the country over the holidays. We had, of course, the one that let it off, Municipal Affairs Minister Tracy Allard traveling to Hawaii, Calgary Klein MLA Jeremy Nixon to Hawaii, Calgary Pagan MLA Tanya Furr to Vegas. Vegas, what happens in Vegas is now in the news. Red Deer, South MLA, Jason Steffen to Arizona, Lesser Slave Lake MLA to Mexico. And of course, Fort McMurray, Woodbuffet MLA, Tony Yao, still in Mexico, unreachable by the Premier&#39;s office. Hilarious. So we&#39;ve got this growing list of MLAs here. We&#39;ve also got politicians from across the country. We just had this afternoon and this evening, a news break that two liberal MPs are giving up their committee and parliamentary secretary posts federally. We also had Nikki Ashton, a popular national figure within the NDP who traveled to Greece and is having her critic roles removed. And then we also have individuals from across the province, starting and most notably with former finance minister of the Ontario Ford government, Rod Phillips, who was at the airport, had a press conference and was later resigned from his position. So, you know, we can focus in on a lot of this stuff. And I want to go chronologically in a sense of what happened here in Alberta, because guys, I think what happened in Alberta is the case study for not just the scandal itself. I think it&#39;s also the heartbeat of the scandal itself. And it&#39;s also a really interesting analysis of how to and perhaps not do issues management and crisis communications, which is something we often discuss on this show, but we now have a live wire in front of us. So before we get into that, there seems to be a lot of conversation and perhaps even confusion as to how something like this could happen. So maybe let&#39;s start with you guys and your experience and knowledge of government, of government process, of perhaps even the mechanics of how this kind of works within a party or a caucus structure. And I&#39;ll start with a very simple question. And Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. How could this happen with</div>

Frankly, they can&#39;t. It strains credulity that one would be able to get away with it, let alone 10%, 10% of the UCP caucus traveling outside of Canada. That That we know of at this moment, that number could continue to climb. If they are asking how do they manage to just leave the country, well, they just – they do what anyone would do. They book a flight and they leave. And the requirements at the –</div>

So if we take this as a case study, right now, I think that the two biggest municipalities in Alberta are currently under states of emergency related to COVID. That&#39;s a very serious state for the municipalities and the municipalities kind of as, if you will children of the of the province that has very specific requirements of the minister of municipal affairs this minute this minister is not going anywhere without telling somebody else where she&#39;s going so she would have told the chief of staff and that would have been passed on the whip would have known it would have also gone through the premier because there would have had to be other assignments made because you can&#39;t just leave the country not when you&#39;ve got two municipalities to the areas that you&#39;re you&#39;re responsible for in a state of emergency that just does not happen now so kenny&#39;s</div>

But when you&#39;re a minister of the crown and you have responsibilities to the crown, you don&#39;t get to just miss a day. You don&#39;t get to miss academy and you don&#39;t get to miss some of these things that you&#39;re responsible for. So, yes, we have a tracking. The WIPP&#39;s office is primarily responsible for tracking all the MLAs themselves. But then the premier&#39;s office is responsible for for tracking essentially the whereabouts of the ministers. Not, you know, is this minister in their home riding today? We don&#39;t really care if you&#39;re in the province, if you&#39;re easily gettable.

Nobody actually cares what city they&#39;re in, especially if they&#39;re going to be in Calgary or Edmonton.

You had your, I guess, your most notable issues manager out of the province. How much do you think some of the key staff members being away allowed for this to happen in that sense? because now I want to get into, okay, before the mechanics of like, okay, what happened? How did it happen? Your experience? I love that. Thank you for layering that on. Now we know chief, like the chief of staff and key staffers are away. Do you think that that element of perhaps their eye not on said balls, plural, was perhaps one of the reasons we find ourselves or the UCP find themselves in this situations?

Multiple MLAs and cabinet minister travel. And this happens, you know, in different and varying degrees across the country, happens at the federal level, happens at different provincial governments. But then we hear that Rod Phillips in Ontario, the finance minister, was traveling to St. Barts. And we hear that he did this while posting on social media activities and videos and clips that ultimately tried to show, and we can discuss this, that he was here domestically in Canada. And ultimately, what happens to him is he gets, Corey, to your term, gets got quit. And to your point, it&#39;s a template is set. So before we even hear of any Alberta case, we have this Ontario case where a template is set. So Carter, talk to me about this template that you see? Do you feel like this ultimately set the table for perhaps anger and Kenny&#39;s response? Kind of what do you make of what happened in Ontario? And what do you make of Ford before we jump back to Alberta?

            <div class="said">Well, Carter&#39;s entirely right. If you only have one minister who&#39;s done this and the public wants blood, the decision is fairly easy. If you&#39;re Jason Kenney and you are aware of, let&#39;s just say it&#39;s six MLA&#39;s, one minister for fun, plus your chief of staff, like what are you going to do in that situation? Are you going to lose all of those people in one fell swoop? You can&#39;t. You can&#39;t make the same decision that Doug Ford made. And that puts you in a bit of a bind here.

            <div class="said">there are other options between doing nothing and terminating somebody, and they seem not to have been explored. But yeah, like the problem is, as soon as Doug Ford does that, everything is going to be measured relative to that. And that was, you know, that was one of those things that worked really well for Doug Ford, but actually could turn out to be a very bad idea for him if he finds himself all of a sudden with two more ministers, a pile of MLAs who are in prominent roles in the same boat.</div>

As you know, COVID has struck Albertans hard. It has also struck WestJet incredibly hard. They are now asking for their own miracle, which is why they are proud to announce the WestJet Miracle Workers Program. It&#39;s, of course, a loyal trip takers program that tries to help you justify non-essential international trips with a clear conscience and a full heart, knowing that you, of course, are helping the heartbeat of Alberta, i.e. WestJet. So thank you to WestJet for your sponsorship of our podcast. You know, we usually don&#39;t do sponsors, but when a sponsor of such magnitude and strength and with such a compelling program shows up. Once again, this is the WestJet Miracle Workers Program, allowing you to take non-essential international trips. Thank you for your sponsorship, WestJet. I really do appreciate it. And all of the money from the sponsorship will be going directly into my pockets. Thank you. Carter.</div>

But let&#39;s just take it at face value. Right. He&#39;s not stupid. At the very least, he&#39;s tactically smart. He&#39;s strategically sound. Try to justify for me what his thinking was here as to standing up on that stage and doing that press conference that we saw. I think a press conference as a strategy would make sense. That press conference certainly did not to many people. But try your best for me. Put me in his, you know, his chief of office was out of town. So that spot is empty.

So let&#39;s get him out there, and then let&#39;s take the offense. The offense has worked with him before. I mean, blaming Trudeau always works. So let&#39;s blame Trudeau. I mean, the rules are confusing, Zane. You know, why is it that you can get on an airplane, but you can&#39;t cross at a land crossing? I don&#39;t understand that. I think it&#39;s a stupid ass rule. If the border of the United States is closed, it should be closed. We have a special deal with Hawaii. Okay, granted, the Kenney government helped to negotiate that. But let&#39;s shit on that, right? Like, let&#39;s go and make this, and bring in all the confusions and all the exceptions. Because people hate the exceptions. And we can be on their side. So I think that, you know, a good offense is the best defense to me was the thinking that went into this press conference.

I think you got to go harder. For me, I would probably build around the idea of punishment that is short of resignation in most cases. So I would basically say this is serious and we let you down. Every single one of these MLAs, these ministers, my staff, and myself are being fined under the public health orders to the highest level possible. We are going to accept those punishments because we were wrong. I was wrong in not having proper oversight. site. They were wrong in violating these public health orders. We expect more from ourselves. We know you expect more from ourselves. They will not be paid for their vacation time or 14-day quarantine. And I would fire one of them. I would fire whichever one was the most egregious. And I would just really underline, this is serious as death because people are dying. And we blew it. And it could have been an opportunity for him to be a leader and even take on a punishment that That he doesn&#39;t necessarily, like, he wasn&#39;t directly, he didn&#39;t leave the country, right?

So I&#39;m going to start with you on this. Why are people so mad? This is seeming to be the issue. And I think we know the naked it hypocrisy. We&#39;ve put that out on the table. People made their own sacrifices. But give me your take. You know, you&#39;ve been studying campaign behavior, psychology, and how people kind of react, how people make decisions, how people become engaged or apathetic. In your perspective, from the work that you&#39;ve done and the experience that you have, how do you kind of summarize the palpable level of anger and almost universal disdain for Kenny&#39;s response that we&#39;ve been seeing over the past 24 to 36 hours?</div>

The second problem is that understanding an issue sometimes is really tricky, right? Issues that are very bite-sized, that are manageable, are deadly. We saw that in the No Meat Committee in Alberta, where, you know, we had a committee that got paid $1,000 a month and didn&#39;t meet for 23 months or something like that. So people got $23,000 just for hanging out or whatever the numbers were. Well, I know what $1,000 a month this. And I&#39;m able to really put $1,000 a month into my bank account.

So it seems like we can safely say, at least as we&#39;re recording this on Sunday evening, that they are in the clear from this particular scandal. Are they sitting back here and watching their chief political enemy hang themselves proverbially? Are they being more assertive? Are they creating an on-ramp to people? Like, what is their strategy right now?

We&#39;ve heard that so many times about COVID&#39;s handling, we&#39;re hearing it now about this particular scandal amidst COVID. Is there anything that the NDP can do, you know, tactically or strategically, as they look forward to what is ultimately their end goal electorally? Is there anything they can do now to try to make something like this have lasting impact? Or is that a card that you play when 2023 enters the equation?
