She has been booted, Corey, by Marit Stiles, the leader of the NDP, in a statement on Monday that while the caucus allowed different viewpoints, some of her actions since making her comments have, quote, contributed to unsafe work environments for staff. Ms. Cham and I reached an agreement to keep her in the NDP caucus, which included working together in good faith with no surprises. Our caucus and staff have made significant efforts to support her during an undoubtedly difficult time. Corey, she&#39;s gone.</span>

I mean, every political operative ever has to deal with negative calls. I think that there&#39;s something that that kind of goes beyond that. That&#39;s more about her behavior. So in terms of what this looks like from afar, this is a leader taking a fair action against someone who&#39;s not participating in the process. That&#39;s why it&#39;s not flummoxing for me. Corey has a difficult time understanding big concepts, but for me, this is fair. You</span>

And this is the challenge of these types of, of issues. And when this is what we talked about before, I mean, how do you make the statement? How do you thread the needle on this? And, and my thing, I think I think the biggest problem was that she didn&#39;t attempt to thread a needle at all. And that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s fair that the leader acted as she did.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. But, you know, if you ask me how it&#39;s going to age, I think that&#39;s something on Stiles&#39; mind, because I think part of the statement and the way it described other challenges and sort of tried to change the root challenge from a particular worldview to, I think, interpersonal conflict and the way that Gemma manages these things internally in the NDP is a way to be able to say down the road, it wasn&#39;t about that, it was about this. So will it be successful? I don&#39;t know. But to me, there was a clear planting of that flag to allow that kind of latitude down the road.</span>

And they don&#39;t necessarily look maybe too forthright or too one-sided. This was, of course, in an era where many were being accused of both sides-ism. Well, now, you know, people are asking in some ways, not to be too overly simplistic, for both sides-ism to actually explain the other side in some ways.

And the fact that the cause of Palestinian independence is much more prominent in Canada than it was. So if you assume that&#39;s the baseline, if you assume that&#39;s the baseline, then, you know, just as 9-11 and the horror of that faded, and let&#39;s be fucking clear, that was a horrifying day.

She reaffirmed all her commitment, called the Israeli sort of counteroffensive inappropriate, called for a ceasefire. What would you advise her to do here? You know, given the political box that she is in, right? We&#39;re talking the raw political box that she&#39;s in. She&#39;s out of the caucus. She&#39;s been censured on either of those two fronts or even what she says outside of the legislature.

What the call for peace right now is saying is, you know, Israel down tools, hundreds of your citizens will still be hostages. I don&#39;t know any nation that would accept that. I&#39;m sorry, I simply do not. And so it seems a little bit naive when you think about it in the context of international relations. If I can detach myself from human emotion and look at this from space, do I think maybe that is ultimately going to save more human lives? lives okay but this is the real world and there is not really any nation that&#39;s going to accept a hundred literally hundreds of hostages taken pulled across the border and being told down tools down tools guys we&#39;re going to figure this out it&#39;s not going to fucking happen and i think it shows a certain naivety by a lot of the mps who signed it particularly the government ones i through this particularly complex situation intense situation and not complex because it&#39;s It&#39;s like, is the loss of human life good or bad?

And I&#39;m just basing that on like the very simplistic last name check, right, of the fact that many of these folks are Muslim, right?

Not ideal for the Alberta Premier that the, you know, the more popular leader of the federal conservatives would take this particular position. Shouldn&#39;t surprise her.

But I was gobsmacked by the big number and found it difficult to swallow. And then I dug deeper into it. And then he concludes later in the article that it&#39;s totally legit. He did his own research. Well, he did the research that was provided to him in the report, later on in the report. And he concludes, totally OK. Totally the right number for us. I&#39;m paraphrasing. Corey, how much of this is, this is a fun one, I guess. But continuing on the theme of a pain or a nuisance to Danielle Smith, fine, fabulous, frustrating, or fuck to have the chairperson of your own sort of panel, A, choose not to kind of take a side, so to speak, to kind of be a convener or a referee, not a salesperson, and B, also be surprised by how big the ask is of Alberta to rob the CPP and bring it back home.</span>

            <span class="text">don&#39;t think that was bad at all. I think that the idea that they get on the record on a couple of things is important. I think they need to be seeding those doubts. I think they need to be undercutting the validity of a very long process that the government is spooling out here. I think they need to advertise. They were, I assume they still are. I haven&#39;t seen one in a while, but I&#39;ve seen lots of CPPIB advertising in the past couple of years here. I think that&#39;s the right approach. And I also think you&#39;ve got to be watching very carefully, learning, gathering data, really getting into the metrics. To Carter&#39;s point, this is going to be an individual decision times 4.5 million, not a group decision. So, what is moving people in demographic A? What is moving people in demographic B? Demographic C is never with you? Fuck them. Just make sure they&#39;re not very motivated. Demographic E, demographic F, so on and so forth. Really getting into the details in terms of what&#39;s going to be productive. productive also know who your champions are and how you can arm them with messages that&#39;ll move the middle and you certainly you&#39;ve got to keep kind of that all in context and all in mind as you move forward there but ultimately it comes back to this notion it&#39;s a marathon not a sprint the benefit you have if you&#39;re cppib governments</span>
