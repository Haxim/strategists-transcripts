        <p>Zain tries to mess with a classic. How frustrating.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Ontario NDP caucus expelling Sarah Jama from their ranks, the MPs who signed a letter calling for ceasefire, the head of the Alberta Pension Plan panel expressing surprise at the pension analysis and much more in a supersized edition of "Fine, Fabulous, or F--ked". Will the Ontario NDP regret their decision? What's the gang's advice for the CPPIB? And what is to be done with the "Freemasons on the Land"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

And they don&#39;t necessarily look maybe too forthright or too one-sided. This was, of course, in an era where many were being accused of both sides-ism.

I appreciate kind of this overall plea for peace, but there are hundreds of hostages still being held. We are still in this moment. What the call for peace right now is saying is, you know, Israel down tools, hundreds of your citizens will still be hostages. I don&#39;t know any nation that would accept that. I&#39;m sorry, I simply do not. And so it seems a little bit naive when you think about it in the context of international relations. If I can detach myself from human emotion and look at this from space, do I think maybe that is ultimately going to save more human lives? lives okay but this is the real world and there is not really any nation that&#39;s going to accept a hundred literally hundreds of hostages taken pulled across the border and being told down tools down tools guys we&#39;re going to figure this out it&#39;s not going to fucking happen and i think it shows a certain naivety by a lot of the mps who signed it particularly the government ones i through this particularly complex situation intense situation and not complex because it&#39;s It&#39;s like, is the loss of human life good or bad? I don&#39;t know. Of course it&#39;s fucking bad. But we are talking about trying to resolve a situation, and we don&#39;t do that with magical thinking. We do not do that with magical thinking.

So you&#39;ve got to make sure you&#39;re not doing absolutely nothing. I know there&#39;s been commentary on both sides as to the CPPIB&#39;s letter and analysis of whether the</div>

          <div class="said">don&#39;t think that was bad at all. I think that the idea that they get on the record on a couple of things is important. I think they need to be seeding those doubts. I think they need to be undercutting the validity of a very long process that the government is spooling out here. I think they need to advertise. They were, I assume they still are. I haven&#39;t seen one in a while, but I&#39;ve seen lots of CPPIB advertising in the past couple of years here. I think that&#39;s the right approach. And I also think you&#39;ve got to be watching very carefully, learning, gathering data, really getting into the metrics. To Carter&#39;s point, this is going to be an individual decision times 4.5 million, not a group decision. So, what is moving people in demographic A? What is moving people in demographic B? Demographic C is never with you? Fuck them. Just make sure they&#39;re not very motivated. Demographic E, demographic F, so on and so forth. Really getting into the details in terms of what&#39;s going to be productive. productive also know who your champions are and how you can arm them with messages that&#39;ll move the middle and you certainly you&#39;ve got to keep kind of that all in context and all in mind as you move forward there but ultimately it comes back to this notion it&#39;s a marathon not a sprint the benefit you have if you&#39;re cppib governments</div>
