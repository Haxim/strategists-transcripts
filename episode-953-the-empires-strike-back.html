        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Jason Kenney's (seemingly and relatively) successful AGM and Erin O'Toole's (seemingly and relatively) successful quelling of caucus rebellion. Has Jason Kenney charted himself a course through surviving his leadership review? Should Erin O'Toole "call the question"? And can we never talk about Pierre Poilievre's wood again? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Guys, we spent an entire episode last Sunday talking about what happened this weekend. Well, suggesting what should happen this weekend, strategies, tactics, conversations for the UCP AGM, which is now concluded. And one of the last questions, maybe I&#39;ll start here with you guys, that I asked both of you. I said, Stephen, Corey, what would the ideal news headline be for Jason Kenney at the end of the UCP AGM? And if I&#39;m not mistaken, you guys can jump in and correct me, Corey, you said something to the extent of Kenny sets the stakes, that he sets the stakes for what happens going forward. Well, let me read you the headline for the Canadian press and what they have written on this fine Sunday evening. The headline from the Canadian press, Kenny more confident in his leadership following United Conservative Party meeting.</div>

But when we actually got to the weekend, it was essentially probably an awkward, tense affair that didn&#39;t have the fireworks that I think some people were hoping for. And certainly I would say Jason Kenney won the expectations game, handily, handily won it. You had people like Brian Jean saying things on the first night of the convention like, my back is getting sore from people slapping it saying I should run. Well, that sounds like an expectation rising game. There was all sorts of suggestions that maybe there would be walkouts or less than full support of the premier. But even on the Friday night where Jason Kenney arguably got his one black eye of the convention, when the convention failed to pass a rising of the requirement from one quarter of constituencies to a third, arguably to just sort of short circuit this call for an early review, he</div>

The child care announcement, where he used that as a moment to bicker against the prime minister in an awkward press affair in Edmonton. You, of course, then had conversations about other leaders emerging. What&#39;s the tone and the tenor of third party PACs paying for registration fees of certain Kenny, pro-Kenny delegates? And then, of course, you had the story, I believe it was the day before, if not two days before, the Thursday, ultimately saying that the premier&#39;s office has directed certain people to vote in certain ways explicitly. Implicitly. So didn&#39;t look great for Kenny heading into the Friday. To Corey&#39;s point, was this a win for Jason Kenny now as we record on Sunday evening, Stephen Carter?</div>

Now it&#39;s a race. Now it&#39;s a contest. Do you want Jason Kenney? Or do you want Brian Jean or Daniel Smith? And in some ways, Danielle Smith entering just exacerbates that distinction, right? Makes it more like Jason Kenney is the moderate in that group of people. And, you know, it&#39;s not like a basic left-right spectrum is not fair. You&#39;ve got libertarian versus not. Danielle Smith tends to be more libertarian. There&#39;s social conservative or not. And, you know, you could say whatever you want about some of these folks. But it</div>

          <div class="said">We&#39;ve talked about this in different contexts, but quite often in political parties, the rules for selecting a leader are different for the rules for reviewing a leader. And under the UCP, you know, policies, governance documents, whatever you want to call them, it&#39;s one member, one vote-ish, you know, they could could change it to weighted and all of that. But if you&#39;re a member, you get to vote for the leader, for the leader. When it comes to a review, the rule is, and it&#39;s very simple, I can read it in its entirety.</div>

It would be very difficult, I think, when you know the leadership is on the table to keep the interest at the level you need and be able to control that outcome. come but it&#39;s not hard to imagine all of a sudden there&#39;s a 500 convention fee and you&#39;ve got to go to calgary and it&#39;s in calgary and that&#39;s jason kenney&#39;s backyard and all of those things and then all of a sudden jason kenney gets 57</div>

Seems like the weekend they may have had was maybe not just a contextual win on expectation setting, but now with Gene and Daniel Smith announcing they may have something to play with. Carter, Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you, Carter, and jump in, Corey. What are you telling this group to do going forward right now, heading into the leadership review?</div>

Don&#39;t go start running around saying we&#39;re right back on the right track. I think that you should be talking about how things are difficult and things are difficult because of COVID. And this premier has the opportunity now, now that the fourth wave is ending. and that the rest of the world continues to struggle. This premiere is going to show that Alberta can, in fact, have a cohesive plan for economic and health recovery that works. And that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to be judged on in the future, is your future plans, not where we are brought to today and certainly not by any false expectation games created by the media.</div>

You had learned that you have to find a way to make it so that the expectation of victory is always on Jason Kenney&#39;s side and you can thwart it, not the other way around here. because you walked into that with every reporter in this province salivating at a gong show of an AGM you know and I I was watching Twitter uh pretty pretty readily on Friday night and I was seeing reporters saying like oh there&#39;s buttons that you know you&#39;re wearing if you&#39;re pro Jason Kenney uh oh and you know not everybody&#39;s wearing them you can basically you know I think it was Jason Marcus I&#39;ve said you can basically tell if it&#39;s government stuff totally true right but like Like you could tell from some of the angles that were in there that people were sort of waiting for something</div>

And so that was in no small part because the rebels had thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Jason Kenney in the week leading up to this AGM. And that was a mistake. That was a mistake because that led everybody to sensibly believe that this was going to be the moment, the infliction point. This is why you&#39;re putting everything out now. This is why the timing of those things mattered. You fucked up. You know, in fact, you should have stomped on all of Jason Kenney&#39;s quote unquote victories by releasing that letter with the 22 constituency associations Monday after the convention. You should have had many of those comments coming after the convention. The fact that he&#39;s buying all of those AGM convention delegate passes after the convention. Because the damage is done. His ability to get the success does not change by you releasing those things in the week before the convention. If you undermined his victory the week after, that&#39;s a different ball of wax altogether. together. So yeah, once I&#39;m done the scolding, because they can&#39;t change anything now, I would say, now you know better.

You need to find a different game here. And where you have had some success is in giving him body blows via his caucus and via the public narrative about him.

Carter, final room, and it&#39;s a cabinet minister and it&#39;s a few other conservative statespeople, right? They say, Carter, has our strategy changed after this weekend? You told us that we have to be pro-Kenny on the floor. We did our job, but now Daniel Smith is out. Now Brian Jean is out. This is no longer a competition versus perfection. This is a competition versus choices. And now people have got two choices, many of whom they may not like. Is it time for me to start declaring bearing that I could be one of those choices? Does anything change for me, Carter? Just make sure I&#39;m still solid, sticking with the leader. What do you think?</div>

He&#39;s tackling significant inflation, perhaps even pushing back against his, if I can call it loosely, his Build Back Better agenda, his government spending agenda, big major government programs announced, promised, now waiting to be delivered. But inflation, the cost of living, groceries, gas, et cetera, rising everywhere across the country. That&#39;s Justin Trudeau. Then you got Aaron O&#39;Toole, who seems to, at least on the surface, be in a shittier position. The wall seemed to be caving in a bit. You know, people didn&#39;t hear from him in a while. When they did, he showed up and tried to talk about the liberal NDP coalition government.

And I feel like the one on the upswing, ironically, might be Aaron O&#39;Toole, which is he, to the exact, to your point, Corey, to the exact same tactic and perhaps tactical misfire by the conservatives, the rebels in the federal conservative party, going too early, putting out a multi-pronged strategy, saying there&#39;s several behind me, having voiceless MPs, none of them wanting to show their face in caucus, jumping on board and having a petition that largely didn&#39;t, you know, get off the ground. Is Aaron O&#39;Toole perhaps in a better position here to take advantage of, you know, the House sitting tomorrow especially if he can get his caucus in line on on you know vaccinations which is going to be a big spotlight heading into tomorrow yeah</div>

So O&#39;Toole has said that all 118 of his MPs who will be in the the House when it returns on Monday, very specifically using that phrase, will either be fully vaccinated or they have a medical exemption. He&#39;s repeatedly refused to say how many are not fully immunized. The groundwork right now for O&#39;Toole, you know, walk me through what a strategic sort of angle or framework he should be looking at to solidify his leadership is. Of course, he needs to get through tomorrow, ensure it isn&#39;t a big issue regarding vaccinations, vaccinations, but he may have added a source of strength with the batter&#39;s move. What does he need to do to solidify terrain for his leadership as questions still surround whether he&#39;s the right guy to lead the Conservatives going forward? Have an excellent</div>

The exception to that rule is the journalists. The journalists will watch and see how is your caucus responding to the questions from the leader of the opposition to the prime minister.

You know, and there&#39;s many who are trying to say, you know, Batters is not a fringe person. She represents a larger coalition. She&#39;s not a pariah. There&#39;s a group of folks behind her. They&#39;re silent MPs. This is just what this is trying to do is have the grassroots do that leadership review. Erin O&#39;Toole should just frickin&#39; call the question. You can see the parallels here in Alberta. In that sense, what do you think kind of goes into this calculation of a leader calling the question or saying, fuck it, you know, I can&#39;t have this cut me every single day. I&#39;m just going to put my leadership to the test. We&#39;ll be done this once and for all. And do you kind of feel like this is where O&#39;Toole might be right now?</div>

And calling a question is a very dramatic moment. You are effectively asking people to stand up and stand with a side. And what do you do then? At least if somebody is moderately opposed, you have the opportunity to bring them back before you force them to stand up and be counted with the rebels. Because here&#39;s the thing, Zane.</div>

She&#39;s, of course, a senator, not a member of parliament. Your take on what you saw there, like the swift action, clearly a strategic win, as Carter would address. Do you agree?

You&#39;ll notice, like for us, we&#39;re noticing fruits and vegetables are much higher. I suspect that the recent challenge in British Columbia is just going to make all of our fruits and vegetables more expensive. But this happens and we start to feel that pressure. But it&#39;s actually interest rates that are the thing that would really are devastating because all of a sudden your mortgage rate goes from – your mortgage goes from $1,000 or $1,500 or if you live in Toronto or Vancouver, a million dollars a month. And then all of a sudden now it&#39;s a million five, right? And that&#39;s a real, you certainly feel that pressure. So I think that that&#39;s a little bit further off.

Trudeau should address it, as Corey said. Is there any big strategic moves he needs to think about? You know, one of the conversations that seems to be coming up, especially around the media class, to your point, Carter, where this is perhaps more popular, is does Trudeau need some plans for the winter around gas prices? Does he need to do anything programmatic to even, I guess, for many, acknowledge that this is real, that monetary policy, something he was derided for the election that&#39;s saying that he doesn&#39;t think about is real it&#39;s affecting cost of living it&#39;s affecting affordability cory anything you want to jump in on that before we kind of round it out there and then card i&#39;ll come to you well</div>
