            <span class="text">know what? I&#39;m just going to leave that there. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Rebel Misfire. Guys, we spent an entire episode last Sunday talking about what happened this weekend. Well, suggesting what should happen this weekend, strategies, tactics, conversations for the UCP AGM, which is now concluded. And one of the last questions, maybe I&#39;ll start here with you guys, that I asked both of you. I said, Stephen, Corey, what would the ideal news headline be for Jason Kenney at the end of the UCP AGM? And if I&#39;m not mistaken, you guys can jump in and correct me, Corey, you said something to the extent of Kenny sets the stakes, that he sets the stakes for what happens going forward. Well, let me read you the headline for the Canadian press and what they have written on this fine Sunday evening. The headline from the Canadian press, Kenny more confident in his leadership following United Conservative Party meeting.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Sounds like a pretty good headline to me. Corey, what do you make of what happened this weekend from your perspective as we dive into some of the details of what we saw in Calgary for the UCPA GM?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t think it was very surprising. I think the week leading up to it was full of all sorts of twists and turns. You had the constituency associations pass that threshold of one quarter in order to allow or</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">or to call for an early leadership review. Although let&#39;s talk about that in a bit because I did a bit of a dive into their bylaws. And, and then there was, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, comments made by one of the MLAs that maybe the party is over effectively. And just in general, it was a bit of a rocky ride over the past, you know, it&#39;s so much happened in the past seven days, it&#39;s hard to remember. Like this, that was also this last week was the week where he sat or stood next to the Prime Minister of Canada, and they had their petty little squabbling back and forth, the two of them, about</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">about all of these things. But when we actually got to the weekend, it was essentially probably an awkward, tense affair that didn&#39;t have the fireworks that I think some people were hoping for. And certainly I would say Jason Kenney won the expectations game, handily, handily won it. You had people like Brian Jean saying things on the first night of the convention like, my back is getting sore from people slapping it saying I should run. Well, that sounds like an expectation rising game. There was all sorts of suggestions that maybe there would be walkouts or less than full support of the premier. But even on the Friday night where Jason Kenney arguably got his one black eye of the convention, when the convention failed to pass a rising of the requirement from one quarter of constituencies to a third, arguably to just sort of short circuit this call for an early review, he</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he got 57% of the vote in the room. room, just didn&#39;t hit that supermajority threshold. So from that moment on, it was pretty clear he</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he was going to hold the room. He got some standing ovations the next day. Generally speaking, it was a tame affair.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that same AGM could have been seen as a massive black eye for Jason Kenney if his opponents had handled it entirely differently.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">They raised expectations. They put people up on slates to run for positions. that they ended up not getting. And they suggested that this convention would show that Jason Kenney doesn&#39;t have the support of his party. And that was a big mistake. Jason</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">did a lot better on that front. We&#39;ll get into</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">of the details. Carter, I want your take on this, right? Corey mentioned some of the lead-up activities. Let me run you through the ones at least I recall, because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">because I don&#39;t have the news articles in front of me, right? The early leadership review threshold vote that Corey talked about, we&#39;ll get into that. The child care announcement, where he used that as a moment to bicker against the prime minister in an awkward press affair in Edmonton. You, of course, then had conversations about other leaders emerging. What&#39;s the tone and the tenor of third party PACs paying for registration fees of certain Kenny, pro-Kenny delegates? And then, of course, you had the story, I believe it was the day before, if not two days before, the Thursday, ultimately saying that the premier&#39;s office has directed certain people to vote in certain ways explicitly. Implicitly. So didn&#39;t look great for Kenny heading into the Friday. To Corey&#39;s point, was this a win for Jason Kenny now as we record on Sunday evening, Stephen Carter?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">was interesting because I think he got caught stacking the deck. I think he got caught putting the aces in certain places that he wanted them to be. And then he dealt up his hand and the aces all came out and everybody went,</span>

You guys like pretty aggressively were like, do not fucking declare that you&#39;re running. That is not a good idea. And you gave us several reasons.

Now it&#39;s a race. Now it&#39;s a contest. Do you want Jason Kenney? Or do you want Brian Jean or Daniel Smith? And in some ways, Danielle Smith entering just exacerbates that distinction, right? Makes it more like Jason Kenney is the moderate in that group of people. And, you know, it&#39;s not like a basic left-right spectrum is not fair. You&#39;ve got libertarian versus not. Danielle Smith tends to be more libertarian. There&#39;s social conservative or not. And, you know, you could say whatever you want about some of these folks. But it</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;ve talked about this in different contexts, but quite often in political parties, the rules for selecting a leader are different for the rules for reviewing a leader. And under the UCP, you know, policies, governance documents, whatever you want to call them, it&#39;s one member, one vote-ish, you know, they could could change it to weighted and all of that. But if you&#39;re a member, you get to vote for the leader, for the leader. When it comes to a review, the rule is, and it&#39;s very simple, I can read it in its entirety.</span>

            <span class="text">and I&#39;m quoting, all members eligible to vote on matters at a general meeting shall be eligible to vote in the leadership review. So you control You control who&#39;s eligible to vote there. You control the electorate. You control the outcome, as we saw this weekend. So it&#39;s not going to be the same as this weekend. It would be very difficult, I think, when you know the leadership is on the table to keep the interest at the level you need and be able to control that outcome. come but it&#39;s not hard to imagine all of a sudden there&#39;s a 500 convention fee and you&#39;ve got to go to calgary and it&#39;s in calgary and that&#39;s jason kenney&#39;s backyard and all of those things and then all of a sudden jason kenney gets 57</span>

Seems like the weekend they may have had was maybe not just a contextual win on expectation setting, but now with Gene and Daniel Smith announcing they may have something to play with. Carter, Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you, Carter, and jump in, Corey. What are you telling this group to do going forward right now, heading into the leadership review?</span>

Don&#39;t go start running around saying we&#39;re right back on the right track. I think that you should be talking about how things are difficult and things are difficult because of COVID. And this premier has the opportunity now, now that the fourth wave is ending. and that the rest of the world continues to struggle. This premiere is going to show that Alberta can, in fact, have a cohesive plan for economic and health recovery that works. And that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to be judged on in the future, is your future plans, not where we are brought to today and certainly not by any false expectation games created by the media.</span>

And so that was in no small part because the rebels had thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Jason Kenney in the week leading up to this AGM. And that was a mistake. That was a mistake because that led everybody to sensibly believe that this was going to be the moment, the infliction point. This is why you&#39;re putting everything out now. This is why the timing of those things mattered. You fucked up. You know, in fact, you should have stomped on all of Jason Kenney&#39;s quote unquote victories by releasing that letter with the 22 constituency associations Monday after the convention. You should have had many of those comments coming after the convention. The fact that he&#39;s buying all of those AGM convention delegate passes after the convention. Because the damage is done. His ability to get the success does not change by you releasing those things in the week before the convention. If you undermined his victory the week after, that&#39;s a different ball of wax altogether. together. So yeah, once I&#39;m done the scolding, because they can&#39;t change anything now, I would say, now you know better.

You need to find a different game here. And where you have had some success is in giving him body blows via his caucus and via the public narrative about him. So that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to need to focus your efforts again and see if you can&#39;t put enough pressure on it that there is just an expectation. reputation, and I don&#39;t know how successful this is going to be, because I don&#39;t get the sense that Jason Kenney is about to say, oh,</span>

But, you know, you set this thing where it becomes almost this critical mass, and if you can pull some of his caucus away, if you can start trickling out actual members of people saying, this is too far, this guy&#39;s got his thumb on the scale to make sure he wins the leadership, this is not a clean leadership review, this is him determining who&#39;s allowed to be there and whatnot and pull away his actual source of power which is his mlas which allows him to be the premier uh i mean that&#39;s your door number two i suppose um and that is all about narrative and that is all about the expectation game so it&#39;s</span>

Carter, final room, and it&#39;s a cabinet minister and it&#39;s a few other conservative statespeople, right? They say, Carter, has our strategy changed after this weekend? You told us that we have to be pro-Kenny on the floor. We did our job, but now Daniel Smith is out. Now Brian Jean is out. This is no longer a competition versus perfection. This is a competition versus choices. And now people have got two choices, many of whom they may not like. Is it time for me to start declaring bearing that I could be one of those choices? Does anything change for me, Carter? Just make sure I&#39;m still solid, sticking with the leader. What do you think?</span>

As you&#39;re sitting there defending Jason Kenney, you&#39;re tearing down Daniel Smith and Brian Jean, your two most likely leadership contenders. Rip the shit out of them. Destroy them. Remind everybody that Brian Jean Gene had the opportunity to beat Rachel Notley, who had four seats in the legislature and all of a sudden became the accidental prime premier because Brian Gene was so weak, so weak that he couldn&#39;t beat her. Right.</span>

Instead, it went to socialists, Socialist Party beat the shit out of Brian Gene and Danielle Smith. She had the government. She had it. It was in her hands, and she let it go away because she couldn&#39;t stop the lake of fire. You know what? You know who stopped lake of fire? Jason Kenney, the guy I&#39;m serving with right now.</span>

If you are one of the cabinet minister, conservative states people that on that floor, we&#39;re defending Jason Kenney and ensuring that he got the standing ovations, the votes and the enthusiasm that led to a pretty good weekend for him.

He&#39;s got a speech from the throne coming up on Tuesday. The House resumes, but he&#39;s tackling inflation. He&#39;s tackling significant inflation, perhaps even pushing back against his, if I can call it loosely, his Build Back Better agenda, his government spending agenda, big major government programs announced, promised, now waiting to be delivered. But inflation, the cost of living, groceries, gas, et cetera, rising everywhere across the country. That&#39;s Justin Trudeau. Then you got Aaron O&#39;Toole, who seems to, at least on the surface, be in a shittier position. The wall seemed to be caving in a bit. You know, people didn&#39;t hear from him in a while. When they did, he showed up and tried to talk about the liberal NDP coalition government. That had a bit of mileage, but not a ton. done we thought that the overt or more explicit attacks on his leadership were done and then of course then</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the reason I phrased my question as a comparison between the two leaders is, I feel like one&#39;s on an upswing and one may not be. And I feel like the one on the upswing, ironically, might be Aaron O&#39;Toole, which is he, to the exact, to your point, Corey, to the exact same tactic and perhaps tactical misfire by the conservatives, the rebels in the federal conservative party, going too early, putting out a multi-pronged strategy, saying there&#39;s several behind me, having voiceless MPs, none of them wanting to show their face in caucus, jumping on board and having a petition that largely didn&#39;t, you know, get off the ground. Is Aaron O&#39;Toole perhaps in a better position here to take advantage of, you know, the House sitting tomorrow especially if he can get his caucus in line on on you know vaccinations which is going to be a big spotlight heading into tomorrow yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah we&#39;ve said this in a hundred different contexts but there&#39;s a certain fog of war in politics right whether you&#39;re an advocacy group from the outside whether you&#39;re a rebel in a caucus whatever it may be uh and there are just only certain moments where that fog lifts and you can actually see the size of the armies and and what happened here is denise batters sent satellite photos of how fucking small hers was yeah</span>

So O&#39;Toole has said that all 118 of his MPs who will be in the the House when it returns on Monday, very specifically using that phrase, will either be fully vaccinated or they have a medical exemption. He&#39;s repeatedly refused to say how many are not fully immunized. The groundwork right now for O&#39;Toole, you know, walk me through what a strategic sort of angle or framework he should be looking at to solidify his leadership is. Of course, he needs to get through tomorrow, ensure it isn&#39;t a big issue regarding vaccinations, vaccinations, but he may have added a source of strength with the batter&#39;s move. What does he need to do to solidify terrain for his leadership as questions still surround whether he&#39;s the right guy to lead the Conservatives going forward? Have an excellent</span>

The exception to that rule is the journalists. The journalists will watch and see how is your caucus responding to the questions from the leader of the opposition to the prime minister.

I suspect the caucus will be jumping up and down and banging on their desks in no small part because there&#39;s probably, I don&#39;t know how many new caucus members there are, let&#39;s say 10, that are just going to be super excited.

There&#39;s been a lot of Aaron O&#39;Toole should just go ahead and ask the question. This is now the time to do it. Put your leadership test on the line. Just fucking do it. Ask the question. You know, and there&#39;s many who are trying to say, you know, Batters is not a fringe person. She represents a larger coalition. She&#39;s not a pariah. There&#39;s a group of folks behind her. They&#39;re silent MPs. This is just what this is trying to do is have the grassroots do that leadership review. Erin O&#39;Toole should just frickin&#39; call the question. You can see the parallels here in Alberta. In that sense, what do you think kind of goes into this calculation of a leader calling the question or saying, fuck it, you know, I can&#39;t have this cut me every single day. I&#39;m just going to put my leadership to the test. We&#39;ll be done this once and for all. And do you kind of feel like this is where O&#39;Toole might be right now?</span>

It makes people reach for the dramatic moment. moment. But in reality, most governance, most politics, most business is better when it&#39;s not dramatic. And calling a question is a very dramatic moment. You are effectively asking people to stand up and stand with a side. And what do you do then? At least if somebody is moderately opposed, you have the opportunity to bring them back before you force them to stand up and be counted with the rebels. Because here&#39;s the thing, Zane.</span>

It&#39;s a dumb, dumb way that you would want to run a political party. And it&#39;s one of these things that when I hear leaders threatening it, I think, what a stupid threat. What a hollow threat. What a simple threat. And the only opportunity to use it would be if you truly knew the person standing up was standing alone. Do you know that about the conservative caucus?

Do you feel like, let&#39;s just start here from a question of perhaps prognostication. Do you feel like recent inflation woes will make itself into speech from the throne and some of those elements? You know, Trudeau has been running a very sort of spend,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know, when do people feel inflation? And I think that inflation is actually felt in what we do to cure inflation. Like there&#39;s hyperinflation that we&#39;re trying to avoid, right? And that&#39;s really devastating.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But it&#39;s the things that we use to try and control inflation, like interest rates, that people really feel. Like, sure, you&#39;ll notice that the gas price is higher. You&#39;ll notice, like for us, we&#39;re noticing fruits and vegetables are much higher. I suspect that the recent challenge in British Columbia is just going to make all of our fruits and vegetables more expensive. But this happens and we start to feel that pressure. But it&#39;s actually interest rates that are the thing that would really are devastating because all of a sudden your mortgage rate goes from – your mortgage goes from $1,000 or $1,500 or if you live in Toronto or Vancouver, a million dollars a month. And then all of a sudden now it&#39;s a million five, right? And that&#39;s a real, you certainly feel that pressure. So I think that that&#39;s a little bit further off. And I&#39;m also not, I&#39;m not, I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">expect to see some of that and of course affordability has been climbing up in concerns for a while and we did see during the election uh inflation start to to raise up the the the issue register there so i don&#39;t think you want want to leave it entirely undefended against but again it&#39;s not what you&#39;re going to want to spend your time talking about the thing about a speech from the throne right after an election though guys is it&#39;s written it&#39;s done it&#39;s your platform it&#39;s simple and if you&#39;re going to add a little bit more to deal with current events that&#39;s fine but it&#39;s not one of those things you need to think really hard about you ran on your speech from the throne yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and so on the final question on on Trudeau and inflation, because I sense from both of you that you feel like it may not be as big of a deal. Trudeau should address it, as Corey said. Is there any big strategic moves he needs to think about? You know, one of the conversations that seems to be coming up, especially around the media class, to your point, Carter, where this is perhaps more popular, is does Trudeau need some plans for the winter around gas prices? Does he need to do anything programmatic to even, I guess, for many, acknowledge that this is real, that monetary policy, something he was derided for the election that&#39;s saying that he doesn&#39;t think about is real it&#39;s affecting cost of living it&#39;s affecting affordability cory anything you want to jump in on that before we kind of round it out there and then card i&#39;ll come to you well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well so i don&#39;t entirely like i said affordability is up there inflation is climbing i think inflation is a sleeper issue here and i think it&#39;s an anxiety that people hold and it didn&#39;t take much to scratch that itch because ultimately affordability</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">affordability which has been growing as a concern for a while that that really does sort of land</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">land next to inflation anyhow. And if the conservatives can make people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people feel that part of the reason life is getting less affordable is because the conservatives are letting or the liberals are letting inflation run rampant, then all the better for them, right? And it&#39;s not a bad issue for the conservatives. That&#39;s definitely my sense at this moment here. Should he do something about it? Should he do targeted things about it? Well, look, as you were saying, I think gas prices over the winter or as you were hinting at it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s very likely gas prices are going to go way up over the winter if you haven&#39;t locked in yet folks consider locking in if you&#39;re on a floating rate plan same with electricity here and some of that is just correcting against what have been historical lows like really low lows part of why we&#39;re talking about alberta all of a sudden looking at a different economic situation is that some of those commodities are going to increase people are going to point to it and they&#39;re going to say oh my god 100 inflation 100</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">100 inflation ignoring that&#39;s only a small part of the basket similarly i do think that if the bank of canada increases rates and we&#39;re renewing our mortgage i mean actually</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">actually you would have had to have some pretty wild and awesome timing even if you go up by you know two rate increases let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s put it this way it&#39;ll be lower than my last locked-in mortgage so like i&#39;m not too too concerned about that but there are are going to be these things that people will point to, and they&#39;ll be able to say that&#39;s up way, way big. And so start thinking as a government, whether you have any policy levers to pull on that one. But the reality is, I don&#39;t think you have a ton.</span>

            <span class="text">We went through something very similar in the Redford government in 2011-2012, when we had electricity rates just going through the roof. And those electricity rates were a significant problem. We also were having brownouts, major, major electricity issues. And we punted. We froze the rates through legislation in order to keep us from having to deal with this massive increase that was occurring and this uncertainty that was occurring from not having the supply that was required to meet the demand.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s because we were facing election in the next six months. Justin Trudeau doesn&#39;t need to face election, one imagines. The difficulty is, would this cause the government to fall? And I don&#39;t think that he&#39;s at any real risk of that in the next six months, and possibly even a year. So I think he&#39;s got time. And I think and therefore, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to need to take any drastic actions this winter. But heading into next winter, if this is still an issue, I could see him taking more of an action.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, we&#39;re actually not seeing any mandate letters thus far from Justin Trudeau for his cabinet ministers. Many ministers, a few new ministries being created, many new ministers, a lot of speculation as to why it&#39;s late. Liberals even outpacing their own record from 2019 in terms of delay between announcement of cabinet and releasing the mandate letters. In your mind, mandate letters, overrated or underrated?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Underrated. I love mandate letters. I love them more when they&#39;re actual mandate letters and not just political communications vehicles. But if you are a prime minister who believes in like a cabinet that has given the autonomy to resolve its challenges the way it sees fit, mandate letters are cool. I want you to find a way to make this cheaper. I want you to find a way to make this better. I&#39;m going to measure you based on whether you can bring, you know, our productivity rate up to X or whatever it is, and then just send them off.</span>

            <span class="text">I just wish I could live in the world with the bright pink sky that Corey lives in. I mean, that&#39;s just not the reality. reality. The mandate letters are overrated because they go out and they&#39;re not actually giving a mandate to a cabinet minister. They&#39;re basically saying, do these things. Check in with me every three days. Don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t do because I&#39;m actually your cabinet minister. That&#39;s the centralization of power in the first minister&#39;s offices across the country. And I would much rather that they be the vehicle that Corey&#39;s describing. I just don&#39;t know how they they actually are.</span>

            <span class="text">On that front, maybe I&#39;ll end off with this, Carter, starting with you. Overrated or underrated, the delay in the mandate letters and the appointment of parliamentary secretaries. Many expected these, you know, functional pieces ahead of time prior to the speech from the throne. Overrated or underrated, the delay for both?</span>
