        <p>The gang use the most recent federal cabinet retreat - and its focus on housing - to talk about cabinet retreat composition, guests, and (of course) the politics of housing in Canada. </p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about cabinet retreats - and how housing experts are feeding into Justin Trudeau's cabinet get-together in Charlottetown. How and why are experts deployed in cabinet retreats? Are the Liberals poised to do something big on housing? And should we be concerned that the goal is to get to the peak of "Mount Stupid"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I do want to talk about housing. More specifically, Carter, the politics of housing. The liberals had a cabinet retreat this past week in the middle of summer. We&#39;ve talked about cabinet retreats in the past. We&#39;ve talked about why they happen, what the strategy behind them is, the reset often, who&#39;s there, how people speak up, what the jockeying for power looks like, how the media leaks work, all that sort of stuff we&#39;ve talked about on previous episodes. I don&#39;t remember which ones so people can listen to 1093 of them and figure out. But Corey, today I want to talk about a new angle of cabinet retreats. Justin Trudeau and his government let people know last week that they were going to have some experts join them from the housing sector to talk about housing, to sit on a panel in this cabinet retreat. And I want to talk about two things here today. I want to talk about this broader story of housing, but I do want to kind of ground it in this retreat, especially with how the liberals are dealing with housing, and then talk about cabinet retreats and talk about experts at cabinet retreats and what that looks like. So I&#39;ll kind of give you a bit of a roadmap. But I want to start with the housing issue, Corey.</div>

          <div class="said">And give me your top line perspective on the liberals with how fuck they are on housing right now. Because they&#39;ve had to swap ministers, it seems like they might be in the throes of swapping a strategy on housing, at least a policy direction. Perhaps we don&#39;t know yet. And for a long time, it seems to be an issue owned by Pierre Polyev in terms of how he&#39;s been speaking about housing. But let me get out of the way. How fucked are the liberals on housing, Corey?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, they&#39;ve certainly got a number of problems of their own making here. Their policy has escalated prices. It&#39;s largely been the liberal housing policy can largely be described, and maybe not entirely fairly, but I&#39;m going to do it anyways, as will help you spend more money on housing than you were otherwise able to do, which of course is not necessarily going to have the effect of creating as much housing as is needed to meet the demand. And we also have comments by the Prime Minister that, and this is recent comments, that housing is not his problem. You know, housing is a provincial jurisdiction. Now, yes, come at me. I&#39;ve taken that out of context for sure. If you think the Conservatives are not going to take it out of context, you are kidding yourselves. So, we&#39;ve got an issue very, very high on the register of issues, sky high with younger demographics, younger demographics that liberals and, you know, left and center left governments have largely relied on. And we have a prime minister who&#39;s made uncaring comments, and we have a track record of policies that have not had the effect of creating additional housing in Canada. And we have hit a bit of a crisis point here. I mean, I think we&#39;re just retreading older ground here. But the price of housing in Canada relative to the climb in the price of housing in the United States has been astronomical. And it&#39;s a problem in the United States too. So maybe I&#39;ll leave it there. But to say when you are a government and you are failing to meet kind of physiological needs, you know, the need for shelter, the need for safety, I guess, you know, we&#39;re pretty low on Maslow&#39;s period here. And the hierarchy of needs is, you</div>

But for those, to Carter&#39;s point around it impacts everyone, it impacts a lot of us around our latitude to do things like even consider moving to different places, moving to a different house, moving to a different city, moving to a different location sort of thing. So isn&#39;t there like the stratified sort of relationship that housing has with the electorate in that way?</div>

          <div class="said">yeah i look i think you might be somewhat overstating how keen everybody is to move around all of the time i mean good point yeah certainly that we are in a very mobile society and people contemplate moving to the bigger house down the street or perhaps in the other neighborhood less likely especially when you&#39;re planted with kids you&#39;re thinking i&#39;m going to move to the different city right but yeah it obviously affects all sorts of things in all sorts of ways not all of them negative by the way if you happen to have purchased a house house before everything was outrageous and now the value of that house is threefold could literally be threefold that&#39;s an awful lot of equity you have access to maybe you&#39;d like a new car maybe you&#39;d like a boat steven doesn&#39;t want you to have a boat because he thinks all pleasure crafts should be banned listen to the patreon if uh if that&#39;s news to you and i yeah i mean like that&#39;s access to money that they didn&#39;t otherwise have and so this is one of the challenges that the liberals have, I think, rather poorly juggled in the past few years is people want the value of the house they own to go up. It&#39;s the downsides of the housing crunch that really seem to stick in people&#39;s craws here. But look, before it gets too far in the rearview mirror, Carter said you bring in experts if you have to do something unpopular. That&#39;s true. There&#39;s another reason to bring in experts, to look like you&#39;re doing something. And I think that&#39;s probably more the model with the liberal cabinet retreat.

And when the schedule is being built and when you&#39;re working with your office on building it, it&#39;s quite often a conversation about what&#39;s the conversation I want to have with cabinet. What are the outcomes I want? When do I want them? What do I need to put in front of them in order to have a productive conversation like that? So like a cabinet retreat is not spring break. You don&#39;t show up with your board shorts and say, I can&#39;t wait to hit the water. Or there are pre-reads, you show up, there are experts who have conversations, there are conversations that are facilitated on particular topics. you might have a situation when you&#39;re building the agenda where you say i want that on day two after everybody&#39;s percolated on it the night of day one because there are social elements in the evenings of cabinet retreats where you are having dinner with colleagues and little clusters and everybody&#39;s hanging out and everybody&#39;s chatting and you know whatever it may be and so um like</div>

          <div class="said">And Corey, let me stick with you for one second. I&#39;m going to give you the same shake at that question. But talk to me about these experts. In this case, they brought in Mike Boffitt, Tim Richter, folks that at least the three of us know from the housing sector, some on policy, others on advocacy around homelessness and housing precarity. They broadcast this to the public that this is going to happen. These experts show up, they sit on panels within this cabinet retreat. Corey, talk to me about the mindset of being an expert and being tapped on the shoulder by government. And is there any risk calculation that you have to do? Because at the end of the day, the government is banking on your credibility and using that as an external sort of halo in some ways. Is there any like, if you were advising devising an advocacy group, or if you&#39;re devising an expert around how they should show up with government, are they actually indicating that this is a jersey color they wear now? How would you kind of be careful in a certain way? Or what rules would you have for them?</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, so not a jersey color situation. They are the government and this is not like in their partisan role. Obviously, governments do tend to invite people who are ideologically aligned with them. And certainly most of the guests at cabinet meetings are ideologically aligned. But for the simple fact that you don&#39;t want somebody that you just, A, is going to propose solutions that you disagree with, or B, you don&#39;t feel like you can trust. So, that&#39;s a reality, but lots of, you know, nonpartisan technical guests I&#39;ve seen invited over the years. It&#39;s interesting. So, the normal format is like presentation Q&amp;A from cabinet slash cabinet discussion that occurs around that. So, they usually go in and you give a little bit of a presentation. I&#39;ve also seen where multiple experts are brought in, almost like a panel themselves and when you have almost multiple presentations short ones and then a bigger conversation that you know can work and cannot work but um yeah it&#39;s um i i don&#39;t even remember what my point was at the start of this not uh not atypical for me but i guess what i would say</div>

What&#39;s their level of knowledge? What&#39;s their self-perception of their level of knowledge? Might not be necessarily what it is. What&#39;s their view of you? Do they see you as somebody who has expertise in this area are they a little skeptical that perhaps maybe they think you&#39;re a little too right wing right maybe they think your solutions have been tried and failed you&#39;ve got to know that going into that thing and what do you want them to do with the information you&#39;re providing there&#39;s that goal of yours and you&#39;ve got to be pretty focused on that you&#39;ve got to make sure you&#39;re repeating the thing that you want them to take away pretty regularly going back to it in any q a that you&#39;ve got chatting about it a bit at dinner if if you&#39;re lucky enough to be invited to the dinner, which you probably only will if you&#39;re the last speaker of the day.

Was it a strategic mistake after After telegraphing that this is going to be a housing cabinet retreat, I put housing in quotes, after having two experts that you told people are going to show up to not have a policy announced at the end of that cabinet retreat, was that a mistake on their part or was that fine for you?

And it&#39;s something Pierre Poliev, to his credit, has been raising alarm bells about for years, years, before you even cared about it. In fact, there&#39;s a lot of eye rolling by the liberals. Frankly, there was eye rolling by me when Pierre Poliev was doing all of this, right? right? So it becomes difficult for me to imagine that you&#39;re going to make it the centerpiece of your communications going forward. It seems like a very defensive</div>

I think that that is the messiness that comes out of a strategy that he&#39;s talked about where he&#39;s saying, maybe there&#39;s some strings that we put on money to municipalities. We get them to open up their development processes to allow all of things to happen a little bit better, a little bit faster. We use the federal properties that exist. We make them available. When it becomes the next level of conversation, the next day of conversation, however you want to phrase it, that is obviously where you&#39;re going to see the tensions that Stephen has identified. But what I think is maybe a bit of the brilliance of his strategy is kind of feels like that&#39;s the municipalities problem at that point right and yeah the municipality is going to say well we had to do this because the prime minister said it and he&#39;ll say no i never said you had to be doing</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">like, he&#39;s going to have a lot of sympathy on development rules being very complicated, it being bloody impossible to build things in all sorts of communities across Canada, including in Calgary, in many areas, right? But I think he&#39;s got to stay there and not get into building codes. I&#39;ve seen some sort of hints about people saying, well, it&#39;s becoming just very, very hard because of all of these rules around building something. But the thing about building codes is they are almost all reactionary. They are because something happened that required the building code to be developed. And where he runs into trouble there is if he starts suggesting taking different actions, all it takes is one tragedy in one old house where that code didn&#39;t exist for the story to turn on him in a big way. So like, don&#39;t get so specific, don&#39;t get into building codes, stick to development, and leave it with the cities, leave it with the municipalities to carry the bag. Corey,</div>

There are, I think, opportunities to point to jurisdictions where solutions that he&#39;s proposed are working.

And finally, if the Liberals do try to take the credit from you, then you&#39;ve got to make sure that everybody knew in advance that it was your solution. So you&#39;ve got to amplify your solutions out there a bit more and make sure that people know what you&#39;re proposing so that when the liberals do heed my good advice and steal your solutions, you have a fighting chance of saying they were your solutions.</div>
