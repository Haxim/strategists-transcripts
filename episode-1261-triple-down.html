But we&#39;ve never seen the minority just completely derail the majority like this. The majority of, you know, of Republicans don&#39;t want to see it go this way. But you know what, this is also what they set up. When they chose to put themselves in bed with Trump, when they chose to put themselves in bed with, with really democratic anarchists, starting with the Tea Party, you know, you could see that this is the natural end. Because ultimately, if If you don&#39;t believe in democracy and democratic processes, this is where you end up. And I don&#39;t want to get all kind of hyperbolic on this. But just to say, at the risk of sounding hyperbolic, this is how democracy dies. Why</div>

And the short version I will say for the liberals in 2012 is it was very important for us that it was like Wildrose, Tories, same thing. Because Stephen and your campaign strategy was almost the opposite. It&#39;s like Wildrose scary, PCs not, vote for us, right? right? And we weren&#39;t under illusions we were going to win, but we were trying to make sure we could carve our space. And so that&#39;s where we had things like website, Tory or Wildrose, guess the quotes. We&#39;ve talked about that one day. Great website. We made sure in all of our communications, we were sort of suggesting just like, it&#39;s parallel. It&#39;s like an internal party squabble, right? You&#39;ve got to pick somebody else for an opposition or whatever. And at the time, you got to keep in mind, it looked like the Wildrose was going to win for good chunks of it there oh</div>

Could be Alberta Health Services, it could be the doctors, it could be the nurses, it could be the local government.

How are you evoking things emotionally? And it&#39;s the combination of these elements that actually dictates the success of the campaign. The voice is super fucking important. Let me draw like an absurd example so you can understand. If you have an example where somebody says, you really should exercise more and it&#39;s your doctor, you&#39;re going to go, oh, well, my doctor, doctors think I should exercise more.

And so people do consider who the voice is, who&#39;s communicating, and they consider the biases that that voice might bring. They consider their own biases about this voice. And when you have the Prime Minister of Canada, who might be interested in making sure that you know let&#39;s like it sort of plays into danielle smith&#39;s argument like hey alberta&#39;s getting screwed because then it&#39;s like yeah see that&#39;s why they don&#39;t want us to leave because they they want all of our money right just plays right into that and if you&#39;re like a union</div>

Pensions benefit from heft. Pensions benefit from, you know, having like big sizes to them in terms of like diversity of demographics underneath them.

Quebec is a cautionary tale, not a model. You know, they&#39;ve tinkered with it. They pay more to get the same as the rest of us here. We don&#39;t want to be like that. We&#39;re Albertans.
