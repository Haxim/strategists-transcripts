And in fact, the rules were changed after 9-11 to create more kind of contingencies for this, including, as I&#39;m sure many will know, like a secret list that the speaker would have of the people who could be the speaker if the speaker were incapacitated by, you know, presumably an attack. At the time, it was thought Al-Qaeda, not, you know, not Lauren Boebert. But, you know, here we are. And so I think that... The Lauren Boebert</span>

There&#39;s not actually the stakes that there are with the speakership. But it&#39;s really underlining how broken the modern Republican movement is.

It doesn&#39;t tend to be the moderates of the Republican Party. But the moderates are pissed because you do have to keep in mind, and Stephen talked about the majority supporting somebody and that somebody becoming the Speaker. Well, the majority did.

And so he does need to find his inner chill here. You know, he&#39;s way ahead. I&#39;m not saying otherwise. I&#39;m not saying he lost the prime ministership because of this. i&#39;m saying the kind of behavior he exhibited two years of it and dialed up to 11 during an election campaign could lose him the prime ministership do</span>

And that&#39;s what he&#39;s trying to undo with the big makeover change, with the how am I being perceived by the video change, by the tonal change.

Corey, he&#39;s most likely to be the next prime minister, but not because people are voting for Pierre Polyev, but because people are voting against Justin Trudeau.

It&#39;s ignoring the, you know, the warts on it here.

And we weren&#39;t under illusions we were going to win, but we were trying to make sure we could carve our space. And so that&#39;s where we had things like website, Tory or Wildrose, guess the quotes. We&#39;ve talked about that one day. Great website. We made sure in all of our communications, we were sort of suggesting just like, it&#39;s parallel. It&#39;s like an internal party squabble, right? You&#39;ve got to pick somebody else for an opposition or whatever. And at the time, you got to keep in mind, it looked like the Wildrose was going to win for good chunks of it there oh</span>

            <span class="text">we often tested combinations of things So often we would work on issues campaigns, and often issues campaigns have coalitions of people who support them. You could have an example of being, well, actually, I&#39;m going to give an example of vaccines, because it was like early vaccine work, right? Could be Alberta Health Services, it could be the doctors, it could be the nurses, it could be the local government.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then you&#39;ve got the message. That&#39;s another piece of it. And then you&#39;ve got the creative more broadly, like which images are you using? How are you evoking things emotionally? And it&#39;s the combination of these elements that actually dictates the success of the campaign. The voice is super fucking important. Let me draw like an absurd example so you can understand. If you have an example where somebody says, you really should exercise more and it&#39;s your doctor, you&#39;re going to go, oh, well, my doctor, doctors think I should exercise more. I&#39;m going to take that seriously.</span>

And so people do consider who the voice is, who&#39;s communicating, and they consider the biases that that voice might bring. They consider their own biases about this voice. And when you have the Prime Minister of Canada, who might be interested in making sure that you know let&#39;s like it sort of plays into danielle smith&#39;s argument like hey alberta&#39;s getting screwed because then it&#39;s like yeah see that&#39;s why they don&#39;t want us to leave because they they want all of our money right just plays right into that and if you&#39;re like a union</span>

Pensions benefit from heft. Pensions benefit from, you know, having like big sizes to them in terms of like diversity of demographics underneath them. And that&#39;s what we get from the Canada pension plan. We certainly don&#39;t need to be dabbling with people&#39;s retirements in this way. It&#39;s super dangerous. Quebec is a cautionary tale, not a model. You know, they&#39;ve tinkered with it. They pay more to get the same as the rest of us here. We don&#39;t want to be like that. We&#39;re Albertans.

            <span class="text">I think the answer is yes, and he doesn&#39;t care. And he was trying to set another trap, right? Like, I mean, ultimately, he can read the polls, too. He probably understands that Albertans are very opposed to this. And he says, Oh, there is a parade, I will get in front of this. He knows that will maybe make it less popular in Alberta, but he&#39;s made the calculation that either it doesn&#39;t matter to him, or it won&#39;t have a significant impact. Or, you know, he will trade a few points of popularity for the CPP or for the APP. If he</span>
