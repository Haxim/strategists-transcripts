On whether he&#39;ll vote for Justin Trudeau&#39;s federal budget introduced last week, this, of course, is an entire episode we covered off where we talked about the highs, the lows, the strategy, the political</span>

            <span class="text">political strategy of the liberal budget trying to go public with some of their political aims and ambitions, quantitative political aims and ambitions. Well, Jagmeet Singh, who&#39;s in a supply and confidence agreement with the liberals, Corey, is saying, well, you know, we got the things we wanted. National PharmaCare, it&#39;s underway. The school lunch program, it&#39;s underway. But there&#39;s concerns that we have inadequate funding for national disability benefit. You know, you know, there&#39;s other things that we need. There&#39;s other things that we need.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_06</span>
            <span class="text">Tell me what Jagmeet Singh is doing here. I actually want to spend a fair bit of time talking about the strategy when people more than likely know the outcome of where you&#39;re going to land. Does this song and dance do anything for anybody who&#39;s at the heart of this discussion? And we&#39;ll get to it in multiple ways. But Corey, give me your sense of what Jagmeet Singh is trying to do, because this is not just a one-off, one article. This is making the headlines in multiple political newspapers, multiple political columns, talking document, oh shit, Jagmeet Singh, this guy, you know, who knows what he&#39;s going to do next. What&#39;s happening here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Well, so much for the no surprises, supply and confidence agreement that said that these kinds of games wouldn&#39;t be played, right? But what is he doing? Okay. Let&#39;s first of all, isolate what he is not doing. He is not actually bringing the government down, right? And the way I know this, if I&#39;m going to be totally frank, frank is you don&#39;t do it on the disability benefit now i&#39;m not saying that the disability benefit isn&#39;t important i&#39;m not saying that a lot of canadians wouldn&#39;t you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know find in great solace and increased disability benefit but it is not broad based enough on which to run an election it&#39;s certainly not one that you are going to use to separate from the pack as you&#39;ve got uh the conservative saying axe the tax and the liberal saying only axe the tax a little i think is that that their their i don&#39;t even know their position yeah that&#39;s correct yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_06</span>
            <span class="text">yeah it&#39;s just a little bit of axing on tax yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">ax some tax yeah you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know and so it&#39;s just it&#39;s very unlikely to me that this is actually the thing they&#39;re going to bring down because you can easily imagine people in that space and just progressive canadians more generally being like what the absolute fuck did you just do here now we have a government that&#39;s not at all aligned with our interests and and so that&#39;s what What he&#39;s not doing is trying to bring down the government.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That sort of leaves basically one thing that he is doing, which is mugging for the camera, which is trying to create that drama, trying to have people remember that he exists so that the conversation can come to him instead of it being about Justin Trudeau&#39;s budget and Pierre Poliev&#39;s response to it, right? It&#39;s his way to try to force himself into this story. And on a certain level, I don&#39;t blame the media for covering it because I guess, but But on another level, it&#39;s like, none of you are this dumb. I know you all know this is not a serious threat. So is there not a way we can bring in a little bit more critical thought and analysis here and just say, effectively, why is Singh pretending he&#39;s going to bring down the government? He&#39;s not bringing down the government.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s take the media out for a second. Let&#39;s talk about the political strategy in terms of what Singh is trying to do, media coverage or not. on um do you agree with cory just on the basics here that he is not going to take down the government like let&#39;s just let&#39;s just get some table stakes and then we&#39;ll build on top yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean how much did we hear about this disability benefit over the last three or four months i mean it just hasn&#39;t been something that&#39;s been in the public consciousness and you&#39;re not going to bring down the government on something that doesn&#39;t have significant uh existing momentum um</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s I got to say, that is the point. You are not going to have a situation where you learn of the existence of a demand for a heightened disability benefit and learn the government went down on it at the same moment, which is basically what you would have.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_06</span>
            <span class="text">Well, Carter, should he have chosen a better strategy? Should he have chosen a better topic to make this threat seem more credible if we&#39;re talking about the politics here?</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">What he could have been doing is signaling this is something that&#39;s super important to the NDP, like he did with pharma care, like he did with daycare. And if these things don&#39;t get done, then I think that we have a problem with the entire relationship. And he did signal that. He signaled that with pharma care and he got it, right? And he signaled that with the food program that we belittled out out of the budget, you know, a billion dollars for feeding children that really isn&#39;t in the federal mandate at all. Not that children shouldn&#39;t be fed, of course, but, you know, it&#39;s a provincial responsibility. It should absolutely live with the provinces. But he signaled</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

And now he&#39;s going to take down the government on something that no one&#39;s ever heard of. It&#39;s just not going to happen. It&#39;s just absolutely not going to happen.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_06</span>
            <span class="text">in some ways. Tell me why. And I guess what I&#39;m trying to get at the heart of, and I&#39;ll come back to you in a roundabout way around what would have been the topic area you as Jagmeet Singh would have chosen to make this threat more credible. But why can&#39;t you blame the guy? And is that like you softening the ground for saying that this is actually a good strategy on his part or a decent strategy on his part well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well let&#39;s start here let why i don&#39;t blame him he he needs to get into this conversation there we talked last time about how the liberals are looking for a five-point bump in the polls i went to 338 canada</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">canada you know uh philippe fournier site and just wanted to get a sense of is there any sense of any early motion on that and arguably there&#39;s a point or two that the liberals have picked up over the past month, but it seems to be entirely at the expense of the NDP. Or at least that&#39;s one way you can interpret the results when you kind of squint and look at it there. And that&#39;s funny, because it doesn&#39;t fundamentally change the math. It&#39;s still sitting there at like 98, 99% conservative majority likelihood if an election was held today. But that&#39;s a challenge if you&#39;re Jagmeet Singh. Arguably, as Stephen has said, you have managed to get a few things out of this budget and and this was steven&#39;s concern with supply and confidence all along nobody has given you any credit for it and the conversation is entirely about the liberals and the conservatives and what do you do like you almost need people like us on podcasts like this talking about how those big things in the budget that people are talking about we&#39;re actually seeing so what the hell is he doing on this other stuff like the chip like</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah sort of i mean like the uncharitable way to say it is he is um having a bit of a pout and threatening to bring down the government because everyone&#39;s forgetting about his essential role in this the more charitable way to put it is he is reminding people that he is pulling strings on this particular matter and certainly every article has mentioned the things that he has managed to get out of the budget so perhaps it is good strategy yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">hand yeah i mean i think for me this this was always a bad strategic choice you know a long-term supply agreement was was a bad strategic choice and from bad strategy comes bad tactics and so now he&#39;s done a bad strategy you know he&#39;s making a bad tactical decision that is absolutely transparent um i if i was in the trudeau government i&#39;d be like go ahead bring us down on this right it you know it is not something that the general population is going going to turn their backs on and say, oh, I&#39;m really glad that Jagmeet Singh has opened this up.</span>

Now, it might benefit the Liberals to the tune of 10 or 15 extra seats, but it certainly wouldn&#39;t. I don&#39;t think it benefits the Liberals to government.

If you believe, as I do, that this is a bluff, and if, like me, you think, well, they are just trying to get the media attention that would otherwise go to you, you can&#39;t give them the media attention. You have to make the moment as undramatic as possible. And so I think you do see the liberals trying to do this by saying, well, we think everybody should vote for this budget. Yeah, we&#39;re happy to meet with anybody on this particular moment. You don&#39;t want to provide that point of conflict that&#39;s going to drive the next three media stories you just you rob them of that you make this a not dramatic moment you make sure your caucus knows the same and then at best sing gets a day of this and there&#39;s nowhere else for it to go maybe it&#39;s this day plus some commentary the day after but there&#39;s nothing beyond that and that&#39;s probably in your interest if you&#39;re the liberals certainly you don&#39;t want to make it look like your government is actually at risk and drive all of that media conversation that might again remind people of the New Democrats role in this, you know, in</span>

If you go a week out one way, like to before this all, you can start entertaining arguments like Stevens, which is this entire process has not been great for them. They have not done a great job of capturing political credit. Now, you can argue, scored some big policy wins, probably for the next 30 years. New Democrats will point back to them, especially in 30 years, they&#39;ll point back to them. But when you point forward a little bit too, it&#39;s like, okay,</span>

You&#39;re making it that much less likely that, let&#39;s put it this way, you go this far as Singh and say, I don&#39;t know if I can follow on these carbon tax increases.

            <span class="text">normally when i&#39;m having conversations about about what&#39;s fair. Somebody is feeling like I&#39;ve done something very unfair, right? I&#39;ve taken something from somebody, I&#39;ve given it to somebody else, that somebody else is generally pretty happy, the first one generally pretty unhappy. And I would broaden that point and say, when you use fairness the way the liberals are, it does somewhat suggest winners and losers, right? And And where I am a bit challenged with that when it comes to the liberals is, and we&#39;ve talked about this, when you look at their kind of the purest form of their coalition, their 2015 coalition,</span>

            <span class="text">you get into a situation where it looks like the liberals are making decisions at the expense of older Democrats, this is always the problem with housing, by the way. We&#39;ve talked about this a hundred times, but if you get into a place where it starts to look like the liberals are making decisions at the expense of older generations, I think they&#39;re in a lot of trouble. Those generations tend to vote. Those generations are usually pretty receptive to the liberals, quite an establishment institutional party. So I can&#39;t say I love it, but again, I don&#39;t have the polling they do. I&#39;m not seeing the things they see. My gut reaction, though, is it divides in a way that is not necessarily going to increase the size of their coalition.</span>

The definitive loser was them. They&#39;re, they&#39;re going to pay more. They&#39;re going to pay into it. Generational fairness, Corey&#39;s not wrong. Children, children, fairness, fairness is one of those really interesting values that just about everybody shares fairness, but they bring their own perspective to fairness. And so if it&#39;s not my perspective of fairness then how is it actually fair right so right now we have a housing debate going on at city calgary where everybody&#39;s talking about fairness fairness fairness fairness and it&#39;s all selfishness so is</span>

And I know this is not a fair comparison. But like generational fairness, to your point, could mean anything. But also, even if it&#39;s who cares what jersey color puts it on a slogan, it probably is like a massively ambitious thing to be like, we want generational fairness versus acts one tax that has a negligible, but more than likely, likely positive impact on your life with the rebate like it&#39;s really interesting in terms of like the the honing in and the small versus large and the penalization on large versus versus narrow and once again i know that&#39;s simplistic too carter what makes axe attacks spike the hike work well</span>

But unfortunately for him, he is kind of synonymous thanks to years of conservative branding and the simple reality that his party has propped up the government on carbon tax increases ones that have actually occurred and this is not going to be an election where people are talking about hypothetical future rebates i mean yes people will talk about how they might grow but people will be talking about the actual the</span>
