        <p>The gang dive into the NDP threats to bring down the Liberals over Budget 2024, Singh's ambivalence about future carbon tax increases, the Liberals budget theme of "generational fairness" - and Poilievre's opportunity in all of the above.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter dive into Jagmeet Singh and the NDP's threats to bring down the Liberals on Budget 2024 and the Liberal appeal to "generational fairness". Is Singh's sabre rattling good strategy? Are there risks in the Liberals driving a message on "generational fairness"? And is it fair to say that - while we don't know what day Zain will start his leadership campaign - we know it will end on a Thursday? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

And the way I know this, if I&#39;m going to be totally frank, frank is you don&#39;t do it on the disability benefit now i&#39;m not saying that the disability benefit isn&#39;t important i&#39;m not saying that a lot of canadians wouldn&#39;t you</div>

It&#39;s his way to try to force himself into this story. And on a certain level, I don&#39;t blame the media for covering it because I guess, but But on another level, it&#39;s like, none of you are this dumb. I know you all know this is not a serious threat. So is there not a way we can bring in a little bit more critical thought and analysis here and just say, effectively, why is Singh pretending he&#39;s going to bring down the government?

And he signaled that with the food program that we belittled out out of the budget, you know, a billion dollars for feeding children that really isn&#39;t in the federal mandate at all. Not that children shouldn&#39;t be fed, of course, but, you know, it&#39;s a provincial responsibility. It should absolutely live with the provinces. But he signaled</div>

Or at least that&#39;s one way you can interpret the results when you kind of squint and look at it there. And that&#39;s funny, because it doesn&#39;t fundamentally change the math. It&#39;s still sitting there at like 98, 99% conservative majority likelihood if an election was held today. But that&#39;s a challenge if you&#39;re Jagmeet Singh. Arguably, as Stephen has said, you have managed to get a few things out of this budget and and this was steven&#39;s concern with supply and confidence all along nobody has given you any credit for it and the conversation is entirely about the liberals and the conservatives and what do you do like you almost need people like us on podcasts like this talking about how those big things in the budget that people are talking about we&#39;re actually seeing so what the hell is he doing on this other stuff like the chip like</div>

          <div class="said">the conservatives and the answer is yeah there&#39;s absolutely opportunity here for him but in terms of what the liberals should do, ultimately, if you know where the new Democrats are, like, let&#39;s put it this way. If you believe, as I do, that this is a bluff, and if, like me, you think, well, they are just trying to get the media attention that would otherwise go to you, you can&#39;t give them the media attention. You have to make the moment as undramatic as possible. And so I think you do see the liberals trying to do this by saying, well, we think everybody should vote for this budget. Yeah, we&#39;re happy to meet with anybody on this particular moment. You don&#39;t want to provide that point of conflict that&#39;s going to drive the next three media stories you just you rob them of that you make this a not dramatic moment you make sure your caucus knows the same and then at best sing gets a day of this and there&#39;s nowhere else for it to go maybe it&#39;s this day plus some commentary the day after but there&#39;s nothing beyond that and that&#39;s probably in your interest if you&#39;re the liberals certainly you don&#39;t want to make it look like your government is actually at risk and drive all of that media conversation that might again remind people of the New Democrats role in this, you know, in</div>

If you go a week out one way, like to before this all, you can start entertaining arguments like Stevens, which is this entire process has not been great for them. They have not done a great job of capturing political credit. Now, you can argue, scored some big policy wins, probably for the next 30 years. New Democrats will point back to them, especially in 30 years, they&#39;ll point back to them. But when you point forward a little bit too, it&#39;s like, okay,</div>

And if you are running on being the progressive government, and that seems very clear at this point based on this budget, right? Look at us, we&#39;re the government that will give you all the things the governor Pierre Polyev won&#39;t. You&#39;d need to box out the New Democrats.

It goes very much to another episode we recorded about Gen Z and millennials, but talk to me about your feelings here. the the the conservatives have had their three words acts the tax spike the hike the liberals i&#39;m not saying this is going to make it into a uh a lectern during an election but it could be one of those test cases where generational fairness uh is something that they&#39;re pushing for give me your thoughts on it here&#39;s my challenge with it so</div>

          <div class="said">normally when i&#39;m having conversations about about what&#39;s fair. Somebody is feeling like I&#39;ve done something very unfair, right? I&#39;ve taken something from somebody, I&#39;ve given it to somebody else, that somebody else is generally pretty happy, the first one generally pretty unhappy. And I would broaden that point and say, when you use fairness the way the liberals are, it does somewhat suggest winners and losers, right? And And where I am a bit challenged with that when it comes to the liberals is, and we&#39;ve talked about this, when you look at their kind of the purest form of their coalition, their 2015 coalition,</div>

          <div class="said">you get into a situation where it looks like the liberals are making decisions at the expense of older Democrats, this is always the problem with housing, by the way. We&#39;ve talked about this a hundred times, but if you get into a place where it starts to look like the liberals are making decisions at the expense of older generations, I think they&#39;re in a lot of trouble. Those generations tend to vote. Those generations are usually pretty receptive to the liberals, quite an establishment institutional party. So I can&#39;t say I love it, but again, I don&#39;t have the polling they do. I&#39;m not seeing the things they see. My gut reaction, though, is it divides in a way that is not necessarily going to increase the size of their coalition.</div>

The definitive loser was them. They&#39;re, they&#39;re going to pay more. They&#39;re going to pay into it. Generational fairness, Corey&#39;s not wrong. Children, children, fairness, fairness is one of those really interesting values that just about everybody shares fairness, but they bring their own perspective to fairness.

But also, even if it&#39;s who cares what jersey color puts it on a slogan, it probably is like a massively ambitious thing to be like, we want generational fairness versus acts one tax that has a negligible, but more than likely, likely positive impact on your life with the rebate like it&#39;s really interesting in terms of like the the honing in and the small versus large and the penalization on large versus versus narrow and once again i know that&#39;s simplistic too carter what makes axe attacks spike the hike work well</div>
