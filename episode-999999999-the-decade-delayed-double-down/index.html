        <p>The gang's all back together to talk about the UCP leadership debate and the strategy of seven-person leadership campaigns. Plus: Corey Hogan tries to imagine what Zain and Stephen talked about last time and tells them what they were probably wrong about.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the UCP leadership debate - how frontrunners are anointed, how other candidates can stop them and more. Why do we all think Danielle Smith is the frontrunner? What paths to victory are available to other candidates? And what would they have done if somebody needed that helicopter? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Because Taves is in the space in between where he knows a lot of his supporters support the Alberta Sovereignty Act and a lot of the pieces that are in it in particular, and perhaps even personally might support things like the Alberta pension plan. I can absolutely see why a minister of finance in Alberta might be seduced by something like that. And so you might say this is unworkable, this is magic, but you don&#39;t want to get into the specifics. You don&#39;t want to dwell a ton of time on these things And you don&#39;t want to have a bunch of clips of you attacking her on that because that certainly has the risk of backfiring if you&#39;re a candidate who&#39;s a little closer to where Danielle Smith is on the spectrum.
