Is it time for Joe Biden to retire? Has the Supreme Court just turned the American President into an American King? And why don't the media care about the dissolution of our country? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And if he doesn&#39;t, well, then a conversation can start. And the conversation has started, obviously, in the days since then. So that&#39;s four theories I&#39;ll throw on the table.

And Joe Biden&#39;s really delivered for us. And yeah, OK, Joe Biden&#39;s team and the overall White House has delivered on a couple of files for sure. I will absolutely concede that. That was fucking scary to see that Joe Biden, the man who controls the fate of the free world, in a sense, more real in this election than any any in my life, any in all of our lifetimes, any arguably in the history of the United States going back to at least the Civil War. That was what he brought to the game. The whole fucking job is communicating. The whole fucking job is taking in information, synthesizing it and distilling it into really impactful, strong strategies going forward. Because I&#39;ll tell you something, it&#39;s not a fucking pop quiz and you have people around you who are going to help you through those strategic decisions. What is the job of president if not to decide and communicate? And he showed no ability to even decide on the spot how he was going to respond to trump and how he was going to communicate attacks against trump that you have to imagine he was trying for a very very long time so i wasn&#39;t even going to watch this debate and steven called me or i called steven and it was about the poll results that were coming in and something i was kept in the dark on yeah for yeah because you know we wanted to we wanted to get those media strategies together yeah you&#39;re You were preparing spokespeople</div>

And of course, people are going to cast forward four years and say, if you give this guy another term, what&#39;s it going to look like? God, you don&#39;t even need to look four years ahead. You could say four months ahead when he&#39;s debating Trump again, what&#39;s this going to look like? And so people really were in their feelings on this one after it happened. And there was just no getting past it. Like, it was not spinnable. And then, of course, what happens is a day later, everybody goes to ground and it becomes spinnable.

And, and you start to think like, well, isn&#39;t this all just so very calculating and the people who actually control the DNC are now going to potentially assert themselves there. So when I say they&#39;re mutually exclusive, on one hand, I&#39;m kind of bemoaning, like this notion that they&#39;re acting like it&#39;s the weather. But on the other hand, And I&#39;m sort of bemoaning how undemocratic some of this is because Joe Biden did win all of the delegates, right? But Joe Biden won them in a pageant. He didn&#39;t win them in a contest. Nobody ran against him. And so this is how he&#39;s ended up with all of them. So people are going to have to make some choices.

But he just did not know when the curtain call came. And how do you think that guy, how do you think that last Democratic president comes off in the history books, Joe? You were thinking about this far too narrowly, given the stakes that you yourself have defined here. Nobody talks great game about Franklin clint pierce and buchanan you know these these presidents before the republic started to fall apart uh before the american civil war you want to worry about your place in the history books i would be fucking terrified about my place in the history books when you have all of the signs you need to know you shouldn&#39;t be doing this and you do this and yeah that might still be the case you might still go down as that guy but you&#39;ve got to give this republic a fighting fucking chance and that means finding somebody who can hold donald trump to account who can get that five percent more than you can get right now and you&#39;re not as good as you think you are joe you&#39;re not so it&#39;s time to start putting the republic and your legacy ahead of whatever the fuck this is right now that you&#39;re doing where you&#39;re just too proud to admit at 81 maybe it&#39;s time to retire maybe</div>

Like, if SEAL Team 6 was ordered to kill a political opponent, could they do that? As one of the footnotes said in the dissent, you know, the question becomes, is it, yeah, so an official act is firing the AG, but would it be considered an official act to poison the AG to get rid of them? Like, you know, there&#39;s just so many troubling kind of natural consequences from the ruling.
