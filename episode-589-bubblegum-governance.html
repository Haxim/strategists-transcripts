            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">This is, it&#39;s awkward. I mean, people don&#39;t understand the studio setup and how we&#39;ve been doing this for 589 episodes in basically the same spot. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, well, that wasn&#39;t even because of a lack of talent by our broadcasters, but we just didn&#39;t feel like uploading it. We recorded tons</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">tons of podcasts. Tons of other shows have been recorded. We&#39;ve had celebrities show up. But you know what? The uploading is what&#39;s really limited us. You know what, Corey? Corey, I think we need to talk about one thing that&#39;s really important, which is the Olympics are over. Because I know you cared a lot about the Olympics. That&#39;s true. Olympic basketball. Yeah. So what I have realized, Stephen, is that there is an audience of one who also cares about our basketball banter at the top of the show. So I am just appeasing to that one person.</span>

            <span class="text">please. I think the U.S. team choosing to be on the yacht was probably the best decision they possibly could have made. It really focused them and allowed them to perform.</span>

I don&#39;t pay attention to the fans. This is good. This is good. I like it. Okay. We have neglected, just like Carter neglects our fans, we have neglected federal politics, I think, for at least a few weeks now. Maybe a few months. Oh, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Guys, the federal cabinet is going to camp. They are in camp in Sudbury, Ontario. They are living in campus dorms. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s just see this. Before we get into the specifics of what a cabinet retreat looks like, you have been too organized and handled the outpouring of negativity</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The purpose of a retreat are basically the same reason why a large corporation would take their executives on a retreat. It&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s to get everybody on the same page. Because in government, even like in a corporation, at least you have one goal, which is to make money for the shareholders. That&#39;s your primary objective. But then there&#39;s all these different ways that you can do that, right? Right. You can make money selling this widget or focusing on that widget or putting more money into marketing, but more more money in R&amp;D. And every vice president wants that money. Well, in government, we&#39;re</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re even more diverse. Right. You&#39;ve got education, you&#39;ve got military, you&#39;ve got all these different things that any government is putting their attention into. And every minister knows that their stuff is the most important. So what</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">what you do in the retreat is actually just try and get everybody on the same page. you&#39;re going to do the following things for the next session or the you know here&#39;s where our legislative agenda looks like here&#39;s where we want to go and you talk about it and you actually reach an agreement where that agreement is top down the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">premier or the prime minister saying this is what&#39;s going to happen get yourselves on board or if it&#39;s a bottom-up structure where people are saying you know collectively this is how we decided that we&#39;re going to go in one one direction.</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">because the media are assholes sometimes um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um you know i mean we we ran we had a a retreat at the jasper park lodge i think we got a deal for like 120 bucks a night for for rooms right like it was it was it was off season it was between uh you know shoulder season so you&#39;re not paying a lot of money there&#39;s no one there right and we could no one wanting to be there sure it&#39;s It&#39;s in Alberta. You know, it was an Alberta cabinet. It was nice. You could go for walks. There was a nice feel to it. But we got it for like nothing. It&#39;s like $120 a night. That&#39;s cheap. Rent a hotel room somewhere. The media get pickup on it. It&#39;s at the Jasper Park Lodge, right? This is a first-class retreat. This is the top end. Corey probably shit on me on this.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">almost certainly did. Corey does not take shit. Right? How dare they do this? I&#39;ll tell you something. This is nothing. This is nothing. The whole retreat cost is something like $25,000 or something ridiculous like that. That&#39;s not real money. We pretend that&#39;s real money when we start poking holes in the government or saying, how dare they spend taxpayers&#39; funds this way. I&#39;d rather have a government that was on agenda That knew where they were going And I&#39;m pleased to invest Hell,</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

I&#39;d also point out that your corporate retreat doesn&#39;t have the national media following you around, So you&#39;re a little more free to do those stupid things. The government is actually there to get on the same page and do those things. But you&#39;re asking why the public may react to a retreat in that fashion. And that&#39;s why. Because when you think about corporate retreats, your first your first mental image isn&#39;t of shit getting done. Let&#39;s put it that way.</span>

It sucks that we all do this and we jump down each other&#39;s throats. But on the other hand, to play devil&#39;s advocate to my own point, that it sucks. It&#39;s probably a good thing that when these retreats are being organized and planned, that everybody&#39;s first thought is, how is this going to look? Are we spending too much money?

It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s like a dorm is where you go to pass out after a night of heavy drinking. It just plays into that narrative of summer camp, in my opinion. If you want these people to look like they&#39;re doing serious work, treat them like serious adults. And they are serious</span>

            <span class="text">Final question on summer camp for the Liberal cabinet. Carter, I&#39;ll go to you. I was going to ask you a two-part question. The first one is in the sense of what is the goal internally within everyone there? And I think you&#39;ve answered that for me, which is to get on the same page. So let&#39;s reverse engineer the other goal, which is if you are strategically advising them, saying you&#39;re going into this for a week, what is your goal coming out of the week for media and public consumption? Like what do you want the main thesis or takeaway to be as you leave summer camp heading into the fall? Ideally,</span>

            <span class="text">Ideally, you want a statement that says, this is what we&#39;re going to be talking about in the next four months. You want to give the media a cheat sheet that says, this is what&#39;s going to be important to you over the next little while. So tell them which ministers have got which priorities. Where are you going to go? Why are you going in that direction? What is the overarching theme that ties it all together? How are you approaching these things? You want to give them a compelling story</span>

If you read the first chapter, you pretty much got the whole thing, right? So you read the first chapter, and you understand now how it&#39;s going to go. And each chapter that unfolds subsequently is fitting within that first thing. No surprises. They know exactly what they&#39;re getting. Cabinet ministers know what they&#39;re getting. Opposition knows what they&#39;re getting. Now, the opposition&#39;s job is to rewrite the book. Sure. And we&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">quickly but well part of the question is that we live live in this 24-hour news cycle world to have a honeymoon that is, Carter, potentially extending close to a year, heading into September. The question I want to ask you is, maybe this is going to be more of a substantive part of the conversation, Corey. I&#39;m just letting you know. Oh, good. Good. Well, you&#39;re excited. Listen, does that ever stop you from giving us a monologue, whatever you feel like? Carter, we&#39;ve always thought of this honeymoon period extended as long as you can because it&#39;s this sweet fruit that you get and you don&#39;t actually have an opportunity costs on the other side what are the negative ramifications we should be aware of heading into a year of i&#39;m not going to say substance free but substance light trudeauism</span>

But he should be spending it, and he should be doing harder things than he&#39;s doing, in my opinion. He&#39;s been very popular for a while. And, you know, ultimately, government should not be a romantic comedy. We&#39;re not here to be charmed by the guy. We&#39;re here to get stuff done. So good.</span>

Number one, you want to use this capital for something. But number two, if you have the opportunity to keep on building this honeymoon phase, would you still do that if you were the one advising him today? Or would you just say, now&#39;s the time to just do something, and if we lose a ton of it, that&#39;s fine, because that&#39;s what we built it for? Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s not a hard and fast math formula on how much you can get done and how much that&#39;s going to cost you. But I do think they should be probing the edges more. They should be pushing themselves and seeing where the pushback comes. And I&#39;m not seeing that right now. I&#39;m not seeing any kind of really hard government agenda at this point.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, to Corey&#39;s point, he&#39;s talking about pushing the edges. How exactly does a government do that? we&#39;ve heard this concept of test ballooning stuff but if you were right now trying to figure out if you&#39;re trudeau what&#39;s the big spike you go after how do you test the edges in terms of what that looks like well</span>

            <span class="text">let&#39;s move away from that first bit okay and let&#39;s move away from the idea that you have to actually be successful and build capital and let&#39;s think about what what my belief for the first two years of any government yeah is that that&#39;s the two years that you can actually do something that may be less popular, right? That maybe needs to be done. So you look at the NDP government in Alberta, right? They get elected and they do things, right? Some people will be pissed off by those things, but they are done and they have put them in the bank and now they can recover from those things and take us into the next election because they believe those things were right. Do I agree that those things were right? Some of them, others not so much. But the point is they believe that they were right. What has this Trudeau government done that they believed was right that needed to be put in place to undo the previous conservative legacy or the previous government&#39;s misuse or, you know, they railed against certain things when they were in opposition. But we&#39;re not seeing them undo these things as quickly as they need to if they&#39;re actually going to have impact because our cycles are shorter and shorter and shorter. Yeah.</span>

I think that they were probably lulled by how popular they were. But this would have been an opportunity for the liberals, I think, to have gone – I mentioned this months ago.

And then pivot back towards the center to deal with the conservatives once the conservatives have a leader. I also think that you may have – and this is getting too cute by half probably – but if you were doing a more progressive agenda, that might have forced some sort of reactionary on the conservative side who was more to the right potentially, which would have set up a nice clash of civilizations for you down the road. But as it is right now, I mean this is bubblegum governance, right? This is not rocking my world and I don&#39;t think it should be rocking anybody&#39;s world. They should be doing much better, and we should be expecting a lot more from a government that came in with such a big change mandate.</span>

So academically first, right, from your point of view, what are the pieces needed to kind of stop a government in its tracks from experiencing this goodwill and this capital building phase?</span>

            <span class="text">The same as any relationship. It&#39;s when you fail to meet somebody&#39;s expectations, right? Right. When when you came in and there was an assumption you would do things one way and that&#39;s what you bought into and that&#39;s what you got excited about. And then something shatters the illusion that they are the perfect individual. It&#39;s it&#39;s like that moment when you&#39;re dating somebody and you&#39;re like, oh, wait. OK. Yeah. All right. They&#39;re not just this like character I put in my mind who&#39;s perfect. Right. And then you see if you can go from there. But the honeymoon is over at that point.</span>

We&#39;re different now. We&#39;re changed. We&#39;re a new generation in such a literal sense. I am the son of a previous prime minister. And honestly, here&#39;s a free tip for Air Canada. You want to sell more lounge passes? Don&#39;t call it a lounge pass. sell a business traveler package that gives access to the room that you no longer call a lounge how does that sound yeah</span>

What matters is that every government is entitled and they&#39;re all spending my taxation dollars badly.

They&#39;re in the midst of a leadership campaign, so the inclination sometimes is to leave the big issues for the leadership candidates. But I don&#39;t think they should play that way at all. I think they need to try and get this government out of its ridiculous honeymoon period. And the only way, I mean, I said it earlier, I&#39;ll say it again. The only way I know how to do it is to take a substantive issue and bang the shit out of it for four months until the Canadian public understand that it&#39;s important.</span>
