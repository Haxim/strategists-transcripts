            <span class="text">coming since before super tuesday well that&#39;s true and you know there were people who are saying now well did he get enough did this just ruin his legacy i would point out that the sounds like the democratic platform is going to have an awful lot of sanders-esque elements in it and i don&#39;t think that sanders cares about his legacy that much beyond that uh i definitely don&#39;t believe he wants to be the reason we have president donald trump this was inevitable and he got out of it an awful lot of pretty cool things if you&#39;re a sanders supporter i mean we&#39;ve got some some language it sounds like around marijuana we&#39;ve We&#39;ve got some around $15 minimum wage. We&#39;ve got some around universal health care. The thing that he didn&#39;t get that he kind of swung and whiffed on was free trade, which I think does leave a bit of an opening to Donald Trump and his special brand of economic populism. But he</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he is sitting there and in his hand is not even cards. He&#39;s accidentally picked up coasters and he&#39;s managed to turn that into things in the Democratic platform. She could say no to all of this. This is actually a fairly low cost. And the fact that she&#39;s giving so much up on the platform, in my opinion, I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think that means we&#39;re going to see a more traditional VP pick. We&#39;re not going to see an Elizabeth Warren because she&#39;s already paid her price at this point. Maybe I&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think so because I think there was a time when Hillary really needed him. and he wasn&#39;t there so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">hillary&#39;s putting up uh the best policy platforms that uh i mean most of the things that she&#39;s talking about she&#39;d already done not like universal health care is outside of her uh her desires this is something that she campaigned on 25 years ago when her when her husband was the president this is not you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, are you willing to acknowledge at all that the time between Sanders technically losing this thing and today that there was an opportunity lost? Is that fair to say to some degree? I think there was an opportunity</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think it was the opportunity you&#39;re talking about. I think the party needed to come together better and faster, but because of the way things rolled out and laid out, it didn&#39;t happen until relatively recently and it happened around the platform.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">wasn&#39;t that some of that in his control though? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, yeah. And it was even more so in the control of Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz. So I think that we have to look at this kind of holistically and say, if you take Bernie Sanders at his word, that this was never about him and that this was about the ideas, this was his first and final opportunity to get those ideas forward, right? This is the platform of the Democrats. And he has obviously had a big impact on that even beyond what is in the platform the way he moved hillary clinton to the left yeah nobody&#39;s denying that at this point right now where i think there was probably an opportunity that was lost was that he never stopped any of his rhetoric about hillary clinton until much later than i thought was appropriate you can play the tapes you can go back i was pretty clear that i thought he was going to stay in until convention right that effectively until that strategy to attack</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>

            <span class="text">the minute he says and she&#39;s taking donations from wall street after it&#39;s clear he&#39;s lost is a waste and damage to the democrats because it&#39;s over it&#39;s done it&#39;s not really wrong of him to talk about the issues and frankly it&#39;s not wrong of him to talk about hillary clinton&#39;s duplicity on these issues but it was a lost opportunity for the democrats and it was a lost opportunity for progressives if we&#39;re now looking</span>

This is four months that they&#39;d have to sustain this until election day. That is a long time to carry a single scandal. Now, we&#39;ve seen a single scandal get legs and go for a very long period of time. I&#39;m thinking of Swift Boat and</span>

I think that Hillary&#39;s team is more on top of the email scandal. I don&#39;t think it will matter. I think that by the time we get to September and we&#39;re reporting the podcast, we&#39;re talking about different scandals because Lord knows that Hillary Clinton being in public life as long as she has, there&#39;s going to be skeletons in closets.

And we&#39;ll see when it all comes down, how much can actually be attributed to his campaign and his campaign&#39;s cash on hand.

They don&#39;t get more seats for winning by 30 points instead of one point. Meanwhile, the suburbs, which again are contiguous, but have a much more of a blend and a melange of like political views tend to be slightly Republican. And it&#39;s not because of gerrymandering. It&#39;s because Republicans don&#39;t congregate in such small areas as Democrats do. Democrats love cities, and it kind of kills them when it comes to contiguous ridings in the middle of urban areas, right? So, you</span>

And depending on where you are, you might want to consider reminding people that Gary Johnson&#39;s a thing, right? If they show up and vote Libertarian for president, but vote vote GOP down ticket. That&#39;s okay. I think that those are options depending on the state you&#39;re in. Maybe not in every state. It really depends on where Gary Johnson has drawn the votes. An interesting study showed that he may be drawing more right now from Hillary Clinton and kind of that Sanders hard column. But there&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And to Stephen&#39;s point, there are ways you can put your thumb on the scale more. But just like if you were at the butcher and all of a sudden that meat suddenly looked like it was twice as much weight as you expected, you would notice. People can be more subtle with this than you expect and still get the result that they want. it is not democracy at its finest if the person who chooses the question can swing the outcome i don&#39;t care how many times you ask your elected representatives the answer to the question of should we change from first past the post to pr and yes i know i kept it simple for the purposes of this this proof of concept right no matter how many times you ask that question they are going to give you the same answer and in fact beyond that if there is disagreement and a bridge that needs to be made they can work on a compromise yeah let&#39;s try this but let&#39;s vote you later yeah yeah, let&#39;s do this for one house, but let&#39;s not do it for the other house, or 50% of the seats. Those are options available to representatives working something out. It turns complicated questions into binary yeses and noes that are ultimately incredibly gameable by the political class in a way that votes in the House of Commons. Your representatives cannot be gamed. So don&#39;t tell me this bullshit that Canadians deserve a referendum on this. Canadians deserve better than a referendum on this. Canadians deserve the best thought of our elected representatives. And by God, I&#39;ll tell you something, I&#39;m not even convinced that we should change from first past the post, but I don&#39;t want to hear this referendum bullshit anymore. This is nonsense. And we need to move past that and be more thoughtful about this as a country.</span>

I actually thought change would be the most neutral of them, should you change, and I thought eliminate because of its pejorative nature would have been the most negative. That didn&#39;t really turn out to be the case. I sort of did some backfilling of my knowledge after the fact, and the more prolix a referendum question is, the more you have to think about it, the more you can kind of get past those short circuits that we use on things like agree and change. so</span>

Referenda are best on a situation where everybody sort of understands it and it&#39;s a root moral judgment, right?
