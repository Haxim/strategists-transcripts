        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan check in on the US political system before dropping some truth bombs about referenda. Did Bernie Sanders maximize his exit from the race? Can Donald Trump win with his current fundraising totals? And just how badly do Corey and Stephen manipulate poll results? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

So I think that we have to look at this kind of holistically and say, if you take Bernie Sanders at his word, that this was never about him and that this was about the ideas, this was his first and final opportunity to get those ideas forward, right? This is the platform of the Democrats. And he has obviously had a big impact on that even beyond what is in the platform the way he moved hillary clinton to the left yeah nobody&#39;s denying that at this point right now where i think there was probably an opportunity that was lost was that he never stopped any of his rhetoric about hillary clinton until much later than i thought was appropriate you can play the tapes you can go back i was pretty clear that i thought he was going to stay in until convention right that effectively until that strategy to attack</div>

That&#39;s okay. I think that those are options depending on the state you&#39;re in. Maybe not in every state. It really depends on where Gary Johnson has drawn the votes.

          <div class="said">Yeah. And to Stephen&#39;s point, there are ways you can put your thumb on the scale more. But just like if you were at the butcher and all of a sudden that meat suddenly looked like it was twice as much weight as you expected, you would notice. People can be more subtle with this than you expect and still get the result that they want. it is not democracy at its finest if the person who chooses the question can swing the outcome i don&#39;t care how many times you ask your elected representatives the answer to the question of should we change from first past the post to pr and yes i know i kept it simple for the purposes of this this proof of concept right no matter how many times you ask that question they are going to give you the same answer and in fact beyond that if there is disagreement and a bridge that needs to be made they can work on a compromise yeah let&#39;s try this but let&#39;s vote you later yeah yeah, let&#39;s do this for one house, but let&#39;s not do it for the other house, or 50% of the seats. Those are options available to representatives working something out. It turns complicated questions into binary yeses and noes that are ultimately incredibly gameable by the political class in a way that votes in the House of Commons. Your representatives cannot be gamed. So don&#39;t tell me this bullshit that Canadians deserve a referendum on this. Canadians deserve better than a referendum on this. Canadians deserve the best thought of our elected representatives. And by God, I&#39;ll tell you something, I&#39;m not even convinced that we should change from first past the post, but I don&#39;t want to hear this referendum bullshit anymore. This is nonsense. And we need to move past that and be more thoughtful about this as a country.</div>
