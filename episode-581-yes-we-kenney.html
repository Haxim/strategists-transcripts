          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about Jason Kenney's jump to provincial politics. Can he win the Alberta PC leadership? Is this the political equivalent of a hostile takeover? And where can you buy a bunch of tiny Alberta flags? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

He was considered the best alternative that wasn&#39;t the guy they hated by most people. Right, right. It became a war between Ignatiev and Bob Ray, and ultimately everything else was just battle damage that led to people going to Dion. And that will happen as well in this race. It&#39;s going to be all about Kenny, and everybody else will be the also-rans and the not-Kenny&#39;s, and the strongest of that pack, in my estimation today, probably has the best opportunity to win.</div>

Because we just came back from the Jason Kenny launch right now. now, the announcement that he made at noon here in Calgary. And I want to talk first, generally, what are the elements that go into a very successful launch, and then Judge Kenny on that, and then we&#39;ll get back to how he does this.

And there would be almost no alignment at the end of that exercise. sides the fact of the matter is people are not so so base and so simple as to not understand that they can elect different governments at different levels okay but beyond that the problem for me is you took a federal election where we had a prime minister from calgary and you&#39;re trying to interpret that as the situation when you have a much more uh practical not even practical you have a much more relevant example in an election that happened just a few months or we&#39;re not even talking years earlier on the provincial level right</div>

Which kicks off in the UK the leadership race for the conservatives. Now, their rules are different than ours, and they&#39;re kind of cool. Basically, it comes to the caucus to settle on a final field of two, ensuring that the final person has the support of the caucus So you don&#39;t get situations like, well, I would say like Allison Redford here in Alberta or or even like, you know, more more apropos to them, German Corbyn in the Labour Party was not he barely got the signatures needed to go forward. And they were like pity signatures from his caucus. Right. You need the support of your caucus. And the idea is it&#39;s the final two who go on and they hold multiple ballots until it&#39;s down to two.

So he&#39;s the leader of the party, but he doesn&#39;t sit in the parliament that he believes should be sovereign over the European Union. So, you know, he essentially got rid of his own job.
