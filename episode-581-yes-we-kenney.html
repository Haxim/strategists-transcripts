            <span class="text">Oh, my God. There is so much to talk about. It&#39;s been a while since our last episode. We had our midnight Brexit episode. A lot has happened. And then everything that we wanted to talk about around Brexit is going to be pushed second to talk about this. Because Jason Kenney has come out today and he has announced that he is running under a Unite the Right movement to make Alberta great again. Again, Corey.</span>

            <span class="text">cory i want to get your opinion on that carter we&#39;ll go back to the fact of the event today because you and i were both there we want to talk about the staging and how he announced it we&#39;ll get into that in a second cory top line jason kenney what are your thoughts do</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah you can absolutely do it uh the audacity of it is is pretty remarkable but it really depends on how much interest is in this campaign and the thing about delegated conventions that people often forget is it&#39;s as much as it does put power more in the hands of the quote-unquote party elite you still have a fundamentally uh that same process running and what&#39;s going to come down to is intensity and the reason why the party elite usually carry the day in a delegated at a convention is because they have intensity on their side they care about the party that&#39;s why they show up to vote that&#39;s why they go to convention maybe</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe jason kenney has the intensity on his side maybe the people who are most passionate are the ones who feel most robbed the ones who think if only we united the right we wouldn&#39;t have the new democrats so can he do it he can absolutely do it uh but make no bones about it this is not a precedented situation this is weird right this is a guy who has campaigned for the wild rose for the past several elections now running for the leadership of another party right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">the mandate to effectively merge those two parties well he&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he&#39;s asking well okay and let&#39;s let&#39;s the audacity of it doesn&#39;t just end at the pcs it&#39;s not like</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">like audacity actually well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well he he&#39;s running now to be leader of a party that he ran against and that but forcefully saying now i want to unite the right with a party that has has actually not shown that they want to unite with him so there&#39;s quite a few hurdles he&#39;s got to overcome here uh you know he may end up leader of the pcs and find himself without a dance partner on the other side of all of this absolutely</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh but the boldness again i think the swing for the fences i do wonder if jason kenney&#39;s not being kind of allured by the legend of it like what his status would be in the if he could do it yeah yeah if he could do it because what he&#39;s doing is is pretty wild if he manages to pull it off now</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">could he do it is not the same as will he do it i still think he&#39;s got to overcome a lot of institutional hostility i also think the more candidates are in this pc race the worse it is for him because he is the 800 pound gorilla in the room and delegated conventions uh involve an intensity of feelings as we&#39;ve already talked about and in In 2006, when Stéphane Dion became the leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, that didn&#39;t happen because he was considered the best by most people. He was considered the best alternative that wasn&#39;t the guy they hated by most people. Right, right. It became a war between Ignatiev and Bob Ray, and ultimately everything else was just battle damage that led to people going to Dion. And that will happen as well in this race. It&#39;s going to be all about Kenny, and everybody else will be the also-rans and the not-Kenny&#39;s, and the strongest of that pack, in my estimation today, probably has the best opportunity to win.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, I want to run almost two parallel sort of streams within this segment. The first is, let&#39;s talk about Kenny. You guys have both given me your top-line thoughts. But, Carter, let&#39;s get back and let&#39;s start with, on our second sort of stream here, which is, how do you stage a launch? Because we just came back from the Jason Kenny launch right now. now, the announcement that he made at noon here in Calgary. And I want to talk first, generally, what are the elements that go into a very successful launch, and then Judge Kenny on that, and then we&#39;ll get back to how he does this. So talk to me about what&#39;s needed in a successful political launch. First, you have</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

And as the president and likely chair of your meeting, you&#39;re going to have an awful lot of authority in that.

Now, it hasn&#39;t been in this style and format, but if Jason Kenney was your cup of tea and if the problem you have identified for him, let&#39;s say four easy or five easy writing associations that come along, you&#39;re having a meeting after this launch today. You say, Jason, that went largely well. I wish you hadn&#39;t buried the lead. Here&#39;s our strategy. What&#39;s that? What&#39;s like the first two pages of that game book that you hand to him? What does he need to do today to move this forward based on the problem you&#39;ve identified? Find the orphan constituencies.

And there would be almost no alignment at the end of that exercise. sides the fact of the matter is people are not so so base and so simple as to not understand that they can elect different governments at different levels okay but beyond that the problem for me is you took a federal election where we had a prime minister from calgary and you&#39;re trying to interpret that as the situation when you have a much more uh practical not even practical you have a much more relevant example in an election that happened just a few months or we&#39;re not even talking years earlier on the provincial level right</span>

I would expect that if there&#39;s this sense that Kenny is running away with it, you&#39;re going to start seeing the punches, because they want him to be hobbled going into those negotiations with Brian Jane. You certainly do not want to get some sort of runaway Kenny train. Carter,</span>

Which kicks off in the UK the leadership race for the conservatives. Now, their rules are different than ours, and they&#39;re kind of cool. Basically, it comes to the caucus to settle on a final field of two, ensuring that the final person has the support of the caucus So you don&#39;t get situations like, well, I would say like Allison Redford here in Alberta or or even like, you know, more more apropos to them, German Corbyn in the Labour Party was not he barely got the signatures needed to go forward. And they were like pity signatures from his caucus. Right. You need the support of your caucus. And the idea is it&#39;s the final two who go on and they hold multiple ballots until it&#39;s down to two. What&#39;s kind of neat about it is it&#39;s like even if one of them gets over 50%, they just keep moving because the second position is important as well, right?

There&#39;s a couple of reasons for that. For starters, a certain amount of proportionality is required for European Union elections. First past the post is the system that gets you elected as an MP. So he&#39;s the leader of the party, but he doesn&#39;t sit in the parliament that he believes should be sovereign over the European Union. So, you know, he essentially got rid of his own job.
