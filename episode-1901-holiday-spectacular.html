Anyways, look at the unity in our political discourse. The Novice Standing Clause, that definitely wasn&#39;t used to override your basic rights this year. Nope, not even once. It just You&#39;re sat there on the shelf, dusty, forgotten. And more importantly, you. Look at you. Your blood pressure, it&#39;s great. It&#39;s resting at a cool 110 over 70, I imagine. You haven&#39;t clenched your jaw in a while reading a post-media op-ed in six months. And your wallet, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s bursting. Your oil sand stocks are probably doing so well. You&#39;re welcome. Probably also doing fine with those tariffs. And wait, is that you by a fire? You look rested. Probably saying to yourself, wow, things are great before the water wars start. What a lovely, stress-free life you lead. It&#39;d be a shame if it really, you know, set in. So grab your kids, grab your lukewarm, inflation-adjusted, no-name eggnog, and grab whatever hope you briefly felt when Mark Carney rolled up his sleeves, and now burn it all. Because it&#39;s time for the Better Late Than Never Strategist Holiday Spectacular, brought to you by Flair Airlines. And welcome, Shannon Phillips, Annalise Klingbeil, and Stephen Carter.

This has been the single most accurate way to predict the weather and how white we&#39;re going to have this winter.

They got that back after the success of Mr. Carney. And now they have the bat phone into the prime minister&#39;s office. And that&#39;s a win for them.</span>
