            <span class="text">who are conventions for? Let&#39;s start with that. Who are</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They&#39;re for your key supporters. They&#39;re for the 800 people across the country that keep the party running. We&#39;ve talked about how few people it actually takes to keep a party running. I mean, obviously, donors are there and volunteers during an election. But between elections, there&#39;s a very small number of people who actually keep the lights on, make sure that all the forms are filed with Elections Canada. And this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this group of people goes to conventions. And they&#39;ve known each other since they were in the Young Conservatives together or the Young Liberals together. Um, everybody&#39;s a young NDP, so you don&#39;t need to have a young NDP group, but that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s how, you know, parties are formed. These relationships exist over years. Uh, I&#39;ve gone in as kind of an outsider to that. Um, and I&#39;ve also gone in as, as an insider and, you know, it&#39;s an amazing, it&#39;s, it&#39;s like going to a college reunion, uh, more than it is like going to a political event because these people, you know, they, they&#39;re friends, they&#39;ve known each other forever. And they&#39;re held together a little bit by ideology, but a lot by this common core experience that they&#39;ve got that they just love.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Is it college reunion-y or is it cult-y? And I ask that like very sincerely. I&#39;ve been to one party convention in my life. So is it, I don&#39;t know, Corey, do you want to jump in there?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it can be either. For most people, at least in my opinion, historically, it&#39;s been more college reunion-y. Carter&#39;s point is an important one. Political parties, especially I think in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, they were held together by this core of people who were elected delegates because they were the most active in the party, because they were the most committed to the party. they took on the presidencies of things. And really what keeps them there as much as anything else are the bonds to each other. And those bonds are formed at moments like this, and they&#39;re reinforced at moments like this. It&#39;s not entirely different now, but you tend to get a bit more of the true believer crowd, in my opinion, nowadays, with it a little bit more open and a little bit more of a transient crowd in the sense that they might come to one or two conventions and not come again. Whereas I feel like before, if you hadn&#39;t been going for the last 30 years of conventions, You were missing out on half the stories that people were telling to each other.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The other thing I&#39;ll say is the convention, the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the convention in the sense that Stephen described, like the one that bonds people together, really happens in the halls outside of the main rooms as much as it happens in the main rooms. But political parties do think, well, we&#39;re all here. Why not create a media event and why not try to propel our story out to Canadians? Canadians. And I think this is a good example of that this weekend with Pierre Polyev having a bit of momentum. Sure, he&#39;s getting the faithful together, but he&#39;s also trying to tell a story to Canadians. And a convention can be more than one thing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Do you want to talk about, I&#39;m glad you brought up that media aspect. Do you want to talk about both of you, that balance? Like, how do you balance, you know, putting on a good memorable bonding time for these key people that are integral to the party with creating those media moments and with things not going off the rails. And I think we can get into kind of the policy debates. But what does that balancing act like?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, the two moments don&#39;t happen really at the same times of day, right? So we do know the big set pieces of convention are these major keynote speeches, usually in the evening at the same time or in the middle of the day on the weekend. And those are the things that the media come and set up for and react to and the pundits are on the scene and they&#39;re giving the commentary. Terry. The bonding happens at all times up to and including four in the morning, you know, as the hospitality suite has absolutely wound down. And you&#39;re still talking to the person you haven&#39;t talked to in 10 years who you were really close with in the past. And so you don&#39;t have to worry too much about one colliding with the other because they&#39;re not competing for the same airspace. Anybody who is going to be involved in that bonding exercise also knows their role is to go to the main hall and fill it and clap like hell when the leader says the things you you want to clap like hell for so they&#39;re not really in competition at all i you know they become like think of it like if you were on say a cruise or you were part of like a tour group and you know there&#39;s the things that you just have to do and then there&#39;s free time to do whatever you want at a convention the things you have to do are those big speeches and those big moments that make the party look good have</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">to these things as well, as well as also being an organizer on leadership campaigns before. So I&#39;ve worn different hats and done different conventions in different ways. More recently, I&#39;ve also gone as an observer, you know, where I just sort of take in stock of all of these things, see some of my old friends from the party days, but don&#39;t necessarily have to, you know, be wearing like the cape or anything like that. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And, you know, there&#39;s not very many versions of the convention I don&#39;t like. But the reason I was coming down kind of hard on you is it is very different when you&#39;re working a convention.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that is when you&#39;re sort of expected to be at certain places and do certain things. And you&#39;re being stage managed because the stage manager is trying to get certain outcomes. And that kind of pulls us back to the, you know, the government, the party of the day, using it as a media event. And so while a lot of us are running around having fun, getting free drinks in the Laurier Lounge, whatever it may be, there&#39;s a lot of other people who are trying to make sure that to the outside world, this looks like a group with its shit together, that is saying something desirable to Canadians that is going to then provide benefits moving forward. And the two activities are not entirely unrelated, because you&#39;ve got your faithful together, they&#39;re seeing the most recent version of the story with the new logos of the day, perhaps, and all of that. And then they then go back and they carry that story to their various regions and the volunteers they&#39;re working with. And so like, I do want to come back to the point of a convention can be many things to many people, right? It doesn&#39;t have one objective. And it serves many of them quite well, and quite admirably. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">So talk to me about that, kind of what you&#39;re speaking about, Corey, but in the context of policy resolutions. And I think the media piece, right, in the kind of preview stories about this convention and the ones about the UCP convention, like that&#39;s what media focused on. You know, here are some controversial policy things that will be debated. And I don&#39;t recall specifics of the one I was at, but that was where it&#39;s like, hey, get to these rooms because we need these votes because this needs to be defeated because it&#39;s going to be bad in media. Like, talk to me about that. yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean policy from a staffer point of view from an organizer from a party point of view is just a threat like that&#39;s it there is not any upside to policy because if you want to do something and you&#39;re the leader you just fucking do it you don&#39;t need a resolution of your of your party where it becomes newsworthy and by challenging by default is when the party does something controversial or contentious or even takes up a matter that&#39;s controversial or contentious We&#39;ve talked about this, I&#39;m sure, in the past, although I can&#39;t remember why. The first line of defense is sort of the party organizers arranging the schedule. So these things basically come up never or come up at times that are advantageous to the organizers. And so they can be voted down easily. And then the second line of defense is, you know, just whipping it, having the votes, making sure that there&#39;s enough people that you can drag from the halls. And I can&#39;t count the number of conventions I&#39;ve been at, even as one of those kind of like standby delegates, where somebody has just basically yanked me, who knows me, and said, like, we need you in here right now to vote. And I can think of multiple times I&#39;ve been in a hall, chatting with somebody, drinking, had that tap on the shoulder, gone in, raised my card, not even knowing what I&#39;m raising my card for. This is back in the day of cards before electronic voting. And then just gone back out and finished my drink. I mean, there&#39;s a lot of things going on at a convention at any given time.</span>

And Dan Arnold, who was the pollster for Justin Trudeau for many years, very good friend of ours, he and I used to often go to conventions together and he would often be my convention roommate back in the day. And we had this general joke about the policy, like it&#39;s passed. And if this policy is passed, that means it will be put in a binder and put on the shelf in an office somewhere that a leader has, right? right? Like, leaders have been pretty clear for a long time that they will disregard policies that are unpopular. You know, the leader will outright just say, no, we&#39;re not doing that. And I think that happened as recently as this most recent, Jason Kenney did it with the UCP at one point. And so the policy process is not, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, any convention is going to have a major youth contingent. Traditionally, they have lower convention fees. Traditionally, their constituency associations will fundraise for them, pay their fees, maybe even pay their flights out, maybe even and help pay for their hotels. And so there are always many, many young people at a convention. And I am firmly of the opinion that that&#39;s where a lot of the energy comes from in any political party, right? And these are the up and comers. These are the people who are going to be running that party at some point. And you get a lot of old people who have the time and the ability to go to the class reunion, right? What you don&#39;t see a lot of necessarily at a convention, you see a dip, right? You don&#39;t see a lot of people my age. You don&#39;t see a bunch of 40 year olds with a job and three kids that they&#39;re trying to get through school because it&#39;s a big time commitment we&#39;re talking on a thursday evening this convention started today so you&#39;re missing thursday you&#39;re missing friday you&#39;re missing saturday you&#39;re missing sunday and there you go you&#39;ve been murdered by your spouse because you&#39;ve been gone for four days drinking with your buddies right yeah and and so uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably and you know when i&#39;m older maybe i&#39;ll be back at conventions like that right but the um you know the gap is not the young people</span>

            <span class="text">quasi true. There are different flavors of conventions with different emphasis. And conventions before elections are often in important places where you&#39;re trying to showcase strength and build organization. Conventions after elections or in the doldrums are often just in Ottawa, right? You know, it&#39;s like it&#39;s there. it&#39;s easy for the party to put on it&#39;s logistically not very taxing you go there you go to toronto you go to vancouver simple you know turnkey big convention montreal for the liberals always a very popular location and um and and so really i think that is one of the considerations like it is it is showy to get everybody to a place like uh say winnipeg if you think you&#39;re going going to make a splash in winnipeg it</span>

            <span class="text">I guarantee you, if you were to have this podcast with three strategists from any province, they would have like the idiosyncrasies of their province. And certainly in Alberta, our big one is the convention is in Calgary, it&#39;s in Edmonton, or if they want to make everybody miserable, it&#39;s in Red Deer. Like that&#39;s the choice, basically. basically. And very rarely they&#39;ll go to Lethbridge or Medicine Hat. That&#39;s kind of it. It&#39;s really tough to get people up to Grand Prairie or Fort McMurray. I&#39;m sure if you talk to BC organizers, they&#39;d be like, it&#39;s almost always in Vancouver, and then we&#39;d go to these places. They&#39;re all going to have those idiosyncrasies, and they&#39;re all going to have kind of those shibboleths, right? And the things that they need to consider. But the simple reality is, when you&#39;re talking about a province, as much as we talk about regions when we talk about about alberta provincial politics region just matters so much less in a provincial context than it does in a national bilingual context yeah</span>

            <span class="text">here&#39;s the thing about that i mean okay so the conservatives have a new logo it&#39;s not not materially different it&#39;s still a sea with a maple leaf in it the maple leaf is no longer kind of at a 45 degree angle there&#39;s this little almost like hill in front of the maple leaf in the concerted thing the sea is a little bit uh daintier like it&#39;s not as thick uh it just you know the the original logo or not the original the logo last time was created by Aaron O&#39;Toole it was supposed to kind of you know hearken back to the military the air force the roundel right right? So it&#39;s like kind of a variation on it. It&#39;s a modification of it. Does it matter? No, not really. I think that political parties obsess about logos to an unhealthy degree. This is my version of the complaint that Stephen has about convention themes. For most Canadians, when they think of the brand of a political party, it&#39;s not defined by the logo. It&#39;s defined by the policies that they have. It&#39;s defined, if you want to get more into kind of the aesthetics of it, it&#39;s the color you know you could ask a hundred people on the street what&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">if you ask them what are the what&#39;s the color of the conservative party red or blue or orange almost 100 will say it&#39;s blue right so like even kind of from an aesthetic point of view i think they they sort of forget at what their actual real brand is.</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to use an example I&#39;ve used in other contexts, I don&#39;t think ever on the podcast, right? But when you work in marketing, one of the first things that you want to do is you want to establish very firmly a market position. And a market position is not a slogan. A market position is not the thing that&#39;s going to be in the ad. A market position is a very succinct way to speak to your value proposition in a way that you can then communicate it internally so that everybody knows what the hell you&#39;re doing and you want like a hundred percent clarity across all stakeholders this is what we do here right and so famously snickers has one i&#39;m going from memory here so it might not be 100 accurate amongst you know among snackers snickers is uh you know is the um is the one on the go because it&#39;s full of peanuts it&#39;s packed with peanuts it gives you energy right so they basically said our our market position is that we are going to be like high energy caloric for snackers on the go move. And when you have something like that defined, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it answers kind of all of your other communications questions for you in ways that you probably don&#39;t even appreciate, right? You think about Snickers. Well, Snickers sells like more King size candy bars than most because it&#39;s, it&#39;s actually marketed towards people who are looking for energy on the go, right? right? You think about Snickers, and you think about its logo. It&#39;s a shitty logo, objectively, but it really reinforces the idea that it&#39;s really crammed in, and it&#39;s tough. It&#39;s packed with something, and it answers the questions even of product packaging. Of course, it answers the questions of where you sell the thing, because it&#39;s on the go. You don&#39;t sit down and buy a Snickers, like, I&#39;m just going to have one of those at home. No, you have them at convenience You have them at the places where people are looking for those high calorie foods. And it seems obvious, but it only seems obvious because they made those decisions and it feels natural. Political parties are not very different. So they go through all of this work, they understand their market position, and then they do a bunch of things that underwhelm us, like say their convention is called Common Sense. Their logo is a fairly staid blue C with a red maple leaf in it. But these are coming from a place of market position if they&#39;re done well. And I actually think the conservative case, there&#39;s some evidence that that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re saying that we are the sensible middle-of-the-road people. This is the market position they are now trying to carve out for themselves. Not a wild logo, super boring.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I think in many ways, the delegates there are not the audience for a primetime leader&#39;s speech. They are a prop. They are the people who applaud when they&#39;re supposed to applaud. applaud and they applaud louder than any reasonable human being ever would. It&#39;s also a truism that a political party speech is basically the only type of speech you can go to where they give you a standing ovation at the start of a speech, right? Like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s a different crowd. The crowd knows what they&#39;re there to do and they&#39;re going to do it. The speech itself is part of the communications exercise of it all. The only real exceptions would be like at a a leadership convention where you&#39;re actually trying to win over the crowd and your speech is actually designed to get the crowd to do something. But otherwise, the leader rightly is not focused on trying to win a room that they&#39;ve already won. They&#39;re trying to win a province. They&#39;re trying to win a country. They&#39;re trying to win elections. And so it&#39;s the opportunity again to get the messages out in a tentpole sense. It&#39;s usually the new stump speech, right? You will have the new brand behind it. You&#39;ll have the glasses-free Pierre Polyev up there. He&#39;s going to say the messages they&#39;ve tested over the summer, the ways that they are going to make Justin Trudeau look small and Pierre Polyev look big. And it&#39;s not for the people in the room. If it was for the people in the room, it&#39;d</span>

So it&#39;s as much for the media to say, oh, this is the new Pierre Polyev and reinforce enforce that message of he&#39;s had a great summer and he&#39;s rebranded and look who he is and carry and form inform their views of what pierre pauliev has become as it is the general public like the general public has been reintroduced to pierre pauliev not through a convention speech but through the advertisements and and through some of the media that they&#39;ve earned over the summer so um like i don&#39;t want to overstate it either and say like oh this is like this is not Not like an inaugural speech, a commencement, an acceptance speech, anything like that, which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not important.</span>

And on the final day, Dion, his whole team shows up in green shirts for the first time. Everyone&#39;s been wearing red the entire weekend. It was quite a play. It was quite a throw.</span>
