        <div class="desc"><p>The gang talk conventions. Carter and Hogan drift down memory lane. Annalise barely conceals her contempt for them. Is the "them" in the last sentence conventions or Carter/Hogan? Tune in to find out but also yes.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about political party conventions - who they're for, their value and what Pierre Poilievre can expect to get out of his this weekend in Quebec City. Are conventions for the faithful or the public? Why do political parties put so much effort into the communications surrounding conventions? And will Dan Arnold appreciate all three of his name checks this episode? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think it can be either. For most people, at least in my opinion, historically, it&#39;s been more college reunion-y. Carter&#39;s point is an important one. Political parties, especially I think in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s, they were held together by this core of people who were elected delegates because they were the most active in the party, because they were the most committed to the party. they took on the presidencies of things. And really what keeps them there as much as anything else are the bonds to each other. And those bonds are formed at moments like this, and they&#39;re reinforced at moments like this. It&#39;s not entirely different now, but you tend to get a bit more of the true believer crowd, in my opinion, nowadays, with it a little bit more open and a little bit more of a transient crowd in the sense that they might come to one or two conventions and not come again. Whereas I feel like before, if you hadn&#39;t been going for the last 30 years of conventions, You were missing out on half the stories that people were telling to each other.</div>

          <div class="said">the convention in the sense that Stephen described, like the one that bonds people together, really happens in the halls outside of the main rooms as much as it happens in the main rooms. But political parties do think, well, we&#39;re all here. Why not create a media event and why not try to propel our story out to Canadians? Canadians. And I think this is a good example of that this weekend with Pierre Polyev having a bit of momentum. Sure, he&#39;s getting the faithful together, but he&#39;s also trying to tell a story to Canadians. And a convention can be more than one thing.</div>

          <div class="said">Do you want to talk about, I&#39;m glad you brought up that media aspect. Do you want to talk about both of you, that balance? Like, how do you balance, you know, putting on a good memorable bonding time for these key people that are integral to the party with creating those media moments and with things not going off the rails. And I think we can get into kind of the policy debates. But what does that balancing act like?</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, well, the two moments don&#39;t happen really at the same times of day, right? So we do know the big set pieces of convention are these major keynote speeches, usually in the evening at the same time or in the middle of the day on the weekend. And those are the things that the media come and set up for and react to and the pundits are on the scene and they&#39;re giving the commentary. Terry. The bonding happens at all times up to and including four in the morning, you know, as the hospitality suite has absolutely wound down. And you&#39;re still talking to the person you haven&#39;t talked to in 10 years who you were really close with in the past. And so you don&#39;t have to worry too much about one colliding with the other because they&#39;re not competing for the same airspace. Anybody who is going to be involved in that bonding exercise also knows their role is to go to the main hall and fill it and clap like hell when the leader says the things you you want to clap like hell for so they&#39;re not really in competition at all i you know they become like think of it like if you were on say a cruise or you were part of like a tour group and you know there&#39;s the things that you just have to do and then there&#39;s free time to do whatever you want at a convention the things you have to do are those big speeches and those big moments that make the party look good have</div>

          <div class="said">to these things as well, as well as also being an organizer on leadership campaigns before. So I&#39;ve worn different hats and done different conventions in different ways. More recently, I&#39;ve also gone as an observer, you know, where I just sort of take in stock of all of these things, see some of my old friends from the party days, but don&#39;t necessarily have to, you know, be wearing like the cape or anything like that. Yeah.</div>

          <div class="said">And that is when you&#39;re sort of expected to be at certain places and do certain things. And you&#39;re being stage managed because the stage manager is trying to get certain outcomes. And that kind of pulls us back to the, you know, the government, the party of the day, using it as a media event. And so while a lot of us are running around having fun, getting free drinks in the Laurier Lounge, whatever it may be, there&#39;s a lot of other people who are trying to make sure that to the outside world, this looks like a group with its shit together, that is saying something desirable to Canadians that is going to then provide benefits moving forward. And the two activities are not entirely unrelated, because you&#39;ve got your faithful together, they&#39;re seeing the most recent version of the story with the new logos of the day, perhaps, and all of that. And then they then go back and they carry that story to their various regions and the volunteers they&#39;re working with. And so like, I do want to come back to the point of a convention can be many things to many people, right? It doesn&#39;t have one objective. And it serves many of them quite well, and quite admirably. So</div>

          <div class="said">So talk to me about that, kind of what you&#39;re speaking about, Corey, but in the context of policy resolutions. And I think the media piece, right, in the kind of preview stories about this convention and the ones about the UCP convention, like that&#39;s what media focused on. You know, here are some controversial policy things that will be debated. And I don&#39;t recall specifics of the one I was at, but that was where it&#39;s like, hey, get to these rooms because we need these votes because this needs to be defeated because it&#39;s going to be bad in media. Like, talk to me about that. yeah</div>

          <div class="said">yeah i mean policy from a staffer point of view from an organizer from a party point of view is just a threat like that&#39;s it there is not any upside to policy because if you want to do something and you&#39;re the leader you just fucking do it you don&#39;t need a resolution of your of your party where it becomes newsworthy and by challenging by default is when the party does something controversial or contentious or even takes up a matter that&#39;s controversial or contentious We&#39;ve talked about this, I&#39;m sure, in the past, although I can&#39;t remember why. The first line of defense is sort of the party organizers arranging the schedule. So these things basically come up never or come up at times that are advantageous to the organizers. And so they can be voted down easily. And then the second line of defense is, you know, just whipping it, having the votes, making sure that there&#39;s enough people that you can drag from the halls. And I can&#39;t count the number of conventions I&#39;ve been at, even as one of those kind of like standby delegates, where somebody has just basically yanked me, who knows me, and said, like, we need you in here right now to vote. And I can think of multiple times I&#39;ve been in a hall, chatting with somebody, drinking, had that tap on the shoulder, gone in, raised my card, not even knowing what I&#39;m raising my card for. This is back in the day of cards before electronic voting. And then just gone back out and finished my drink. I mean, there&#39;s a lot of things going on at a convention at any given time.</div>

And we had this general joke about the policy, like it&#39;s passed. And if this policy is passed, that means it will be put in a binder and put on the shelf in an office somewhere that a leader has, right? right? Like, leaders have been pretty clear for a long time that they will disregard policies that are unpopular. You know, the leader will outright just say, no, we&#39;re not doing that.

And so there are always many, many young people at a convention. And I am firmly of the opinion that that&#39;s where a lot of the energy comes from in any political party, right? And these are the up and comers. These are the people who are going to be running that party at some point. And you get a lot of old people who have the time and the ability to go to the class reunion, right? What you don&#39;t see a lot of necessarily at a convention, you see a dip, right? You don&#39;t see a lot of people my age. You don&#39;t see a bunch of 40 year olds with a job and three kids that they&#39;re trying to get through school because it&#39;s a big time commitment we&#39;re talking on a thursday evening this convention started today so you&#39;re missing thursday you&#39;re missing friday you&#39;re missing saturday you&#39;re missing sunday and there you go you&#39;ve been murdered by your spouse because you&#39;ve been gone for four days drinking with your buddies right yeah and and so uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s probably and you know when i&#39;m older maybe i&#39;ll be back at conventions like that right but the um you know the gap is not the young people</div>

And certainly in Alberta, our big one is the convention is in Calgary, it&#39;s in Edmonton, or if they want to make everybody miserable, it&#39;s in Red Deer. Like that&#39;s the choice, basically. basically. And very rarely they&#39;ll go to Lethbridge or Medicine Hat. That&#39;s kind of it. It&#39;s really tough to get people up to Grand Prairie or Fort McMurray. I&#39;m sure if you talk to BC organizers, they&#39;d be like, it&#39;s almost always in Vancouver, and then we&#39;d go to these places. They&#39;re all going to have those idiosyncrasies, and they&#39;re all going to have kind of those shibboleths, right? And the things that they need to consider. But the simple reality is, when you&#39;re talking about a province, as much as we talk about regions when we talk about about alberta provincial politics region just matters so much less in a provincial context than it does in a national bilingual context yeah</div>

So it&#39;s like kind of a variation on it. It&#39;s a modification of it. Does it matter? No, not really. I think that political parties obsess about logos to an unhealthy degree. This is my version of the complaint that Stephen has about convention themes. For most Canadians, when they think of the brand of a political party, it&#39;s not defined by the logo. It&#39;s defined by the policies that they have. It&#39;s defined, if you want to get more into kind of the aesthetics of it, it&#39;s the color you know you could ask a hundred people on the street what&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">I&#39;m going to use an example I&#39;ve used in other contexts, I don&#39;t think ever on the podcast, right? But when you work in marketing, one of the first things that you want to do is you want to establish very firmly a market position. And a market position is not a slogan. A market position is not the thing that&#39;s going to be in the ad. A market position is a very succinct way to speak to your value proposition in a way that you can then communicate it internally so that everybody knows what the hell you&#39;re doing and you want like a hundred percent clarity across all stakeholders this is what we do here right and so famously snickers has one i&#39;m going from memory here so it might not be 100 accurate amongst you know among snackers snickers is uh you know is the um is the one on the go because it&#39;s full of peanuts it&#39;s packed with peanuts it gives you energy right so they basically said our our market position is that we are going to be like high energy caloric for snackers on the go move. And when you have something like that defined, it</div>

        <div class="turn" data-start="2682">
          <div class="who">

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">it answers kind of all of your other communications questions for you in ways that you probably don&#39;t even appreciate, right? You think about Snickers. Well, Snickers sells like more King size candy bars than most because it&#39;s, it&#39;s actually marketed towards people who are looking for energy on the go, right? right? You think about Snickers, and you think about its logo. It&#39;s a shitty logo, objectively, but it really reinforces the idea that it&#39;s really crammed in, and it&#39;s tough. It&#39;s packed with something, and it answers the questions even of product packaging. Of course, it answers the questions of where you sell the thing, because it&#39;s on the go. You don&#39;t sit down and buy a Snickers, like, I&#39;m just going to have one of those at home. No, you have them at convenience You have them at the places where people are looking for those high calorie foods. And it seems obvious, but it only seems obvious because they made those decisions and it feels natural. Political parties are not very different. So they go through all of this work, they understand their market position, and then they do a bunch of things that underwhelm us, like say their convention is called Common Sense. Their logo is a fairly staid blue C with a red maple leaf in it. But these are coming from a place of market position if they&#39;re done well. And I actually think the conservative case, there&#39;s some evidence that that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing. They&#39;re saying that we are the sensible middle-of-the-road people. This is the market position they are now trying to carve out for themselves. Not a wild logo, super boring.</div>

They are the people who applaud when they&#39;re supposed to applaud. applaud and they applaud louder than any reasonable human being ever would. It&#39;s also a truism that a political party speech is basically the only type of speech you can go to where they give you a standing ovation at the start of a speech, right? Like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s a different crowd. The crowd knows what they&#39;re there to do and they&#39;re going to do it. The speech itself is part of the communications exercise of it all. The only real exceptions would be like at a a leadership convention where you&#39;re actually trying to win over the crowd and your speech is actually designed to get the crowd to do something. But otherwise, the leader rightly is not focused on trying to win a room that they&#39;ve already won. They&#39;re trying to win a province. They&#39;re trying to win a country. They&#39;re trying to win elections. And so it&#39;s the opportunity again to get the messages out in a tentpole sense. It&#39;s usually the new stump speech, right? You will have the new brand behind it. You&#39;ll have the glasses-free Pierre Polyev up there. He&#39;s going to say the messages they&#39;ve tested over the summer, the ways that they are going to make Justin Trudeau look small and Pierre Polyev look big.

And on the final day, Dion, his whole team shows up in green shirts for the first time. Everyone&#39;s been wearing red the entire weekend. It was quite a play. It was quite a throw.</div>
