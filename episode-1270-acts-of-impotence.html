          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for those who have uh what are our thoughts gracefully remained unaware of this or from outside of the province you could just put that in a box to say that&#39;s alberta&#39;s problem a bit of a reminder the sovereignty act when when Danielle Smith was running to be leader of the United Conservative Party here in Alberta, was supposed to be this thing that essentially allowed us to ignore,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">ignore, override federal... It was never really clear, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But then what ultimately the Sovereignty Act became was a very fancy way of stating that if the government didn&#39;t like something, they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they were going to use provincial powers to make that not happen, which is something they always had the authority to do, at least in theory so the sovereignty act doesn&#39;t say you have the ability to ignore federal law it doesn&#39;t say in fact it very explicitly says it&#39;s kind of like bordered by the courts and the constitution and all of this it gives cabinet ministers the power to let me check my notes here uh exercise their power as cabinet ministers and um and at one</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one point there was a very kind of weird thing where it allowed cabinet only that power essentially write laws without going to the legislature but even that was pulled out so it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it doesn&#39;t say a ton just to begin right so to invoke the sovereignty act at least in theory doesn&#39;t mean a lot but again this would mean um you know that analysis would mean kind of applying this act that doesn&#39;t mean very much in a way that is consistent and consistency hasn&#39;t been a strong suit of this government so i mean we&#39;re all just waiting to see like we&#39;re waiting to see what possibly this government could do that would allow it to get out of federal law which is again not something the government has the power to do so um wait and see maybe they&#39;ll try to push things further maybe</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe it&#39;ll be like the sovereignty act of yore or the dream of the sovereignty act of yore where they attempt to accomplish things that the provincial government does not have the power to accomplish or maybe it&#39;ll just be more nothing you know but once again we can wake up in alberta and say oh it&#39;s this we&#39;re dealing with uh instead of i don&#39;t know education hospitals roads making life better you</span>

Part of why I think this is a pretty good thing for Danielle Smith to stake a fight, sovereignty act style on, is I think there&#39;s a pretty good chance she wins, if not at the courts with the federal government backing down because it&#39;s not fundamentally possible, right? And so if that happens, then it doesn&#39;t carry that impotence that Stephen Sagan... Listen, for all we know, they got wind that the federal government was was going to soften these regulations next week and they decided well we&#39;re going to do this and then when they do it it looks like a sovereignty act when</span>

            <span class="text">was an awful lot of negotiation that was going to incur to change these things and because it was likely to result in a change anyhow they don&#39;t need to worry about it as much being an act of impotence Now it actually could be something where for two months she saber rattles on this. The government changes it anyways, because they were probably always going to because these regulations were not going to work without changes in Alberta. And there&#39;s there you go. There&#39;s your win if you&#39;re Danielle Smith and your Markey Sovereignty Act has a win. It&#39;s the only win it will ever get. And it gets they get to move on and say that was a success.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yes, because it&#39;s not that compelling of a case. I mean, basically, he&#39;s saying that a new government could do away with this legislation and therefore Daniel Smith could win. Yeah, a new government could do away with this legislation. That&#39;s not Daniel Smith&#39;s win. That&#39;s Pierre Polyev&#39;s win. in pierre paulievs would be the one who would be doing that not daniel smith so this you know this the problem with bringing in the the the act the problem that you can&#39;t he he&#39;s trying to get away from the first movement problem and that first movement problem is that as soon as you bring in the act people are going to expect something to change and it&#39;s not going to change nothing changes in this scenario uh until such time as there&#39;s a new government and then you know what there&#39;s a new government and something changes i mean if the courts rule i mean what are the courts ruling on right</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, why do you think, and you&#39;ve, you&#39;ve mentioned this, you and I&#39;ve talked about this, like media has obviously changed a lot in recent years. Like why do we still do, why do we still hold on to some of these old traditions? Why do we still even do, do the sit down just because the content is needed?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think, I think that that&#39;s just it. I mean, it&#39;s super hard to fill pages sometimes. Like there&#39;s times when you don&#39;t have enough inches and you don&#39;t have enough time on the television to, to run all the stories because there&#39;s so many stories all happening at once. And then there are times on the calendar where you couldn&#39;t, you know, you couldn&#39;t force a story to appear if you tried. Right. right and on top of that people aren&#39;t paying attention so you&#39;re not going to invest like if you&#39;ve got a really interesting story that you&#39;re working on you&#39;re not going to unfold it on the 23rd of december right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right so you you you you take something you gotta still fill the minutes you still gotta put you know stories in the newspaper um so you take the year ender and You take these these old ideas and you still do them because not</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">not because they&#39;re great journalism, but because they fill the need of the of the newspapers, of the of the journalists. And to a degree, I guess, of the actual politicians, because the politicians ultimately believe, rightly or wrongly, that their currency is being seen and being heard as much as possible, even in these times when there&#39;s a little bit of a downtime. time it&#39;s a free story to to kind of steal cory&#39;s language and totally morph it into something that actually mattered um but it</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">news is the length that the news is going to be on television you know it&#39;s always going to be 30 minutes no matter how much or how little is going on the newspaper maybe you can make it a little longer a little shorter but like in four page increments effectively and so it&#39;s only going going to be what it&#39;s going to be as well and so but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s not true in a lot of digital media like you don&#39;t actually need to to fill the news in the same way you&#39;ve obviously got advertisers you got to satisfy eyeballs you need to get but it is kind of funny like i i would just i would love to see a newscast end one day at like the 14 minute mark and be like that&#39;s all the real news we have today uh so we&#39;ll see you next time and or you know alternatively just kind of say and we&#39;re to go another 30 minutes a lot happened today but you can do that online you can do that with podcasts you can do that with all of the digital media you can&#39;t do that with the traditional media so it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s an interesting question like are some of these things at some point just hanging out there because of tradition and is somebody gonna just rebalance</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">well that&#39;s what i&#39;m i&#39;m curious to say especially carter&#39;s point about how much prep i mean i do a lot of media training in my job now but i haven&#39;t done media training or prep for a year ender so if it&#39;s like this is going to take hours of prep there&#39;s no real benefit yes we&#39;re getting our message across but we&#39;ve done that any like at what point did the politician start saying no we&#39;re not doing year enders we&#39;re not offering them well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well here&#39;s the other thing you got to keep in mind though it&#39;s quiet around that time for politicians too and so they actually have the time to do that prep for the year enders if they so choose to do so and some politicians will want to go on vacation but some don&#39;t you know some never want to go on vacation and it actually is an opportunity for them to fill the time as well. And if there is a kind of a more material value for political staff and politicians, the year-ender, it is probably that prep. It&#39;s going back through everything in a big sense, instead of living in the moment and reminding yourself of the major narratives, the macro narratives. I&#39;m not saying, remember event that happened February 2nd week. I&#39;m saying, what is the story we&#39;re trying to tell? You&#39;ve got a year-ender. You&#39;ve always got to pull it back to that story and you just have a you have a good session where you&#39;re talking not just about that story confirming that it&#39;s still valid and useful but you&#39;re updating all of your proof points using the things of the past year to allow you to tell that story in a way that becomes more credible and so that would be the value for politicians if there is one beyond the actual kind of low</span>

In fact, I think we should be grateful for the service that Preston Manning did by just sort of laying bare just how partisan of an exercise this was.

They&#39;re going to try to figure it out, and they&#39;re going to try to work together until the polls rebound for one of them to a point of advantage, or we hit that deadline in 2025.
