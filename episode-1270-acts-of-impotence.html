        <div class="desc"><p>'Twas the night before the Alberta Sovereignty Act and all through the Pod, Carter was stirring while Annalise played god. Hogan's arguments laid out in brief and with care, with the hope unlike Stephen he wouldn't lose his hair.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a looming use of the Alberta Sovereignty Act, the year-end interview and a grab bag of topics in an extended lightning round. Is the Sovereignty Act a "temper tantrum masquerading as law"? Who gets more out of the political year-end interview - the media or the politician? And who will join us on our walk to Ottawa? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

Part of why I think this is a pretty good thing for Danielle Smith to stake a fight, sovereignty act style on, is I think there&#39;s a pretty good chance she wins, if not at the courts with the federal government backing down because it&#39;s not fundamentally possible, right? And so if that happens, then it doesn&#39;t carry that impotence that Stephen Sagan... Listen, for all we know, they got wind that the federal government was was going to soften these regulations next week and they decided well we&#39;re going to do this and then when they do it it looks like a sovereignty act when</div>

And then there are times on the calendar where you couldn&#39;t, you know, you couldn&#39;t force a story to appear if you tried. Right. right and on top of that people aren&#39;t paying attention so you&#39;re not going to invest like if you&#39;ve got a really interesting story that you&#39;re working on you&#39;re not going to unfold it on the 23rd of december right</div>

          <div class="said">well that&#39;s what i&#39;m i&#39;m curious to say especially carter&#39;s point about how much prep i mean i do a lot of media training in my job now but i haven&#39;t done media training or prep for a year ender so if it&#39;s like this is going to take hours of prep there&#39;s no real benefit yes we&#39;re getting our message across but we&#39;ve done that any like at what point did the politician start saying no we&#39;re not doing year enders we&#39;re not offering them well</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">well here&#39;s the other thing you got to keep in mind though it&#39;s quiet around that time for politicians too and so they actually have the time to do that prep for the year enders if they so choose to do so and some politicians will want to go on vacation but some don&#39;t you know some never want to go on vacation and it actually is an opportunity for them to fill the time as well. And if there is a kind of a more material value for political staff and politicians, the year-ender, it is probably that prep. It&#39;s going back through everything in a big sense, instead of living in the moment and reminding yourself of the major narratives, the macro narratives. I&#39;m not saying, remember event that happened February 2nd week. I&#39;m saying, what is the story we&#39;re trying to tell? You&#39;ve got a year-ender. You&#39;ve always got to pull it back to that story and you just have a you have a good session where you&#39;re talking not just about that story confirming that it&#39;s still valid and useful but you&#39;re updating all of your proof points using the things of the past year to allow you to tell that story in a way that becomes more credible and so that would be the value for politicians if there is one beyond the actual kind of low</div>
