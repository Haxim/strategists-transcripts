          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Of course, this segment was brought to us by Flair Airlines. We don&#39;t know what our point is either. Corey, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, me and my 24 closest friends. Daniel Smith has announced her new cabinet. cabinet we&#39;ve we&#39;ve we&#39;ve uh delayed recording this episode to a friday so we can react to that cabinet cory and now we have it 24 people 24 over 49 member caucus are now going to be serving as cabinet ministers uh the majority the vast majority of them being men the previous cabinet was 27 and we are seeing some pretty interesting names on the list everyone who was a cabinet minister minister before, retains a cabinet seat, although not the same one in actually, I&#39;d say, most cases. Five women on the cabinet, Danielle Smith herself, Rebecca Schultz, Tanya Furr, Rajen Sani, Adriana Lagrange. Remember that last name? I&#39;m sure many of you know it. I want to discuss her new role in health. We are also seeing the first Muslim minister of justice in Mickey Amory, Lebanese-Canadian. We&#39;re also seeing Mohamed Yassin, South Asian descent. He&#39;s going to be our new Minister of Immigration, if I&#39;m not mistaken. It&#39;s a longer title than that, certainly. Corey, there&#39;s a lot that goes into making a cabinet, and I know we&#39;ve done episodes in the past strictly at length about cabinet making, the triangulation of all the factors. Can we pare that down to a two-minute version before we jump into the specifics of this new cabinet by Danielle Smith? What are some of the considerations that a government and a premier has to make into cabinet making? And then, Carter, I&#39;ll get you to yes and some some of the things Corey puts on the table just for a couple of minutes here before we jump into the specifics.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so historically, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was really just what the Premier or the First Minister wanted, right? But what&#39;s happened over time is there&#39;s been an increasing number of considerations put on the table in terms of regional diversity. That&#39;s always been fairly important. But then there became gender diversity, ethnic diversity, diversity of different backgrounds of all sorts. And you ultimately wanted your cabinet to have a broad composition feel that reflected a lot of areas and from there i think we&#39;ve seen a bit of a receding i think we saw that with the kenny cabinet that was much more calgary centric than you would otherwise expect and i think certainly that is also the case with the smith cabinet but those considerations are still there in a big way are you covering off your geography are you covering off your diversity and so far as you can from the components you have from your caucus uh but from there an important part to keep in mind is you do tend to like it&#39;s not like you put a doctor in health you put an educator in education that&#39;s not generally what you do but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but a minister or a first minister looks at it and says who are my rocks who are the people i want in certain positions and then they build their cabinet around that so the example i think i used maybe even as recently as last episode or two episodes ago was actually pretty prescient because i said hey for example if you want brian gene in energy synergy that means brian jean&#39;s not in justice and you only have so many choices there and i you know then you have to put amory in justice i think was even the example i used and it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it ended up being</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">being the case i didn&#39;t have any foreknowledge at that point but that was an example of how dominoes fall so that&#39;s the that&#39;s kind of the nature of cabinet making you you have your rocks you try to make it broadly look like the composition of the province depending on how you want to consider province and um and you go from there uh the size of it has always been a a big consideration. There are people who expect to be in cabinet, and if they&#39;re not in there, they get grumpy. There are people that if they&#39;re not in cabinet will be idle hands that could make your life miserable. And so on the flip side, having lots of ministers is kind of a pain in the ass sometimes. And so the size of it, the composition of it, who your rocks are, these are the things that you got to take into account.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, in addition to that, there&#39;s some what we call big ministries, quote unquote, right, right? Especially as they relate here in Alberta, many call the finance ministry a big one or health or energy. And a few others can be kind of big ministries or senior ministries that require a little bit more experience, so to speak. Corey&#39;s kind of talked about it through your rocks and then the stones that kind of come thereafter. People you&#39;re taking a bit of a flyer on, people that maybe necessarily haven&#39;t proven themselves or are brand new to the caucus that you&#39;re going to take a bit of a chance on. Maybe you&#39;re just strictly reading their resume in a couple of conversations, even by proxy, if you&#39;re the premier around their competencies and capacities, you&#39;ve had to make cabinets. So in addition to what Corey has said, give me what your 2012 ish, right? Or 2011 ish version of a cabinet making look like, give me some of the other factors you had to consider. And once again, not at length, but give me some of the other factors that you got, you had to consider back then. And I actually want to then fast forward it to today. We&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">You know, there&#39;s a few things that have been put on the table. Let me kind of round up as many as I can, right? So previous cabinet experience or caucus experience, loyalty, as Carter mentioned. We&#39;ve talked about geography. We already talked about gender. We&#39;ve talked about race. um we we&#39;ve talked about competency through the perspective less about the the role of the ministry but more so if i can call it general managerial or executive competency if that&#39;s fair to say um so to speak cory you know one carter talks to us about a 2011 experience i want to fast forward to 2023 there&#39;s one thing i&#39;ve seen the last half decade more and you guys may correct me if you&#39;ve actually seen it more if it&#39;s always happened but it&#39;s been the mapping of the ministries. Like we&#39;ve just seemed to like have ministries created out of thin air these days. And then we&#39;ve seen this on the federal side as well. I think the best example live wire right now is Bill Blair&#39;s ministry of emergency preparedness. He actually doesn&#39;t have a department that rolls up to him. He actually doesn&#39;t have DMs and bureaucrats and public service staff that report up to him. And we&#39;re seeing a bit of that today as well, right? Where where some ministries have been either remapped or renamed slightly to kind of meet the moment. So I&#39;m just going to put that one on there. But any sort of new changes, last half decade changes that you&#39;ve started to see? You&#39;ve already mentioned perhaps in Alberta, the deprioritizing of gender in some ways. Like we have, you know, Kenny kind of stopped caring about that in some ways or started to even get rid of the status of women ministry as its own standing ministry. But talk to me about any recent changes you may have seen. And then we&#39;ll jump into what we&#39;re seeing today put on the table by Danielle Smith.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, first of all, Status of Women only became a ministry, like a standalone ministry under the NDP. So that in itself was a change. I&#39;ll tell you, it&#39;s interesting to me because when we were working on transition materials in 2019, in advance of that election, when I was in the public service, I remember there was this chart and it went back to like the 70s of every single ministry that had existed, You know, and it kind of had bars like,</span>

            <span class="text">these ones existed, these ones didn&#39;t all the way through. And certainly, there was a standard stable that sometimes got new names, but ultimately always went through. And it really did seem like in the last decade at that point, all of a sudden, there were all sorts of random new ones and random new combinations. combinations and i think that&#39;s even more so uh in the past four years right since jason kenney came in we got like things like the ministry of red tape reduction obviously we have a whole whole assortment of these boutique ministries that have occurred in the last bit and these boutiques that&#39;s a good way but boutique</span>

            <span class="text">think so i i think that she needs to call him some horses here it was a tense election it was a tough election it was a divisive election for the province and in many ways this election or this cabinet is consistent with the first half of her election night speech of like okay we&#39;re all just going to kind of work together and she&#39;s not introducing a lot of new variables arguably the lagrange one is is the newest variable in that there&#39;s a new minister But I want you to consider this for a minute. When we talk about stability, and maybe in her mind, that was also a continuation of stability.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But number two, in both dollars and complexity is probably education, right? right? You could make some arguments for some of the other ones. You could talk about the power of the purse that exists at TBF. I would entertain those conversations. But arguably, if you&#39;re going to say, all right, we&#39;re not going to rock the boat and we&#39;re going to keep the relative seniorities in place. Let&#39;s just move her to health. That&#39;s one that&#39;s kind of easy. You know, you&#39;re just getting the minister who had the second most complex, the second biggest dollars, and you&#39;re moving them into the first most. And one of the interesting things here is that when</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when you think Think about the people that Daniel Smith lost going into and coming out of the election. They were the people in those senior ministries, right? You lost your minister of finance. You lost your minister of health. You lost your minister of energy. And so that does allow you to kind of keep this general pecking order, but just sort of slot everybody up. And the minute you start jumping people over and giving them to different ministries, that&#39;s when you have the potential of creating those real hurt feelings. siblings and so i i actually don&#39;t think that that&#39;s crazy and i would also point out that nicoletti is moving from advanced education which is the fourth biggest in terms of dollars to education or the third biggest maybe i i don&#39;t know i&#39;m lost now but it&#39;s not a huge step to go to education if you want to look at it through that lens too and so there is kind of a look you can squint and sort of say she just didn&#39;t want to change things a lot in the creation of this cabinet. And that was probably right, knowing that she&#39;s got to calm some horses in a societal sense, as well as calm horses internally looking towards a leadership review.</span>

And I think you guys both impressed upon me at the end of that episode that that&#39;s just the way it should be. Talk to me to Carter&#39;s earlier point where he talked about the loyalty element of it. What does this cabinet say about loyalty to you? Does it have a bit of a keep your enemies close, keep your former rivals close element to it? Does it not? Talk to me about it through that lens, and then I want to get into individual ministers.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, 100%. And I think one of the benefits of a large cabinet is it does allow you to keep your quote unquote enemies close while still rewarding your quote-unquote friends. And listen, it&#39;s always shifting alliances in these things, which is why I&#39;m giving a bit of that quote-unquote treatment to it here. But there&#39;s a thing about cabinet that&#39;s pretty basic, but pretty important, which is cabinet solidarity. When you make a decision as cabinet, you go outside of cabinet and you support it 100%, no matter what&#39;s collectively been decided. And as we&#39;ve talked about in the past, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s votes at cabinet. It&#39;s the premier reading the consensus</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">room and saying, this is what we&#39;re going to do. So effectively, by putting somebody in cabinet, The premier has, for the price of, you know, loyalty, said, you have to support everything I do. Absolutely. 100% no hedge. And she now has- Do you think that conversation happened? That&#39;s interesting to me. It doesn&#39;t happen like that, but aversion does happen. And it&#39;s maybe delivered not so much by the premier, so much as the chief of staff or some of the people around as you&#39;re onboarding people to cabinet roles. And by the way, not a lot of new cabinet ministers, so most of them already know this, but they will for sure talk about the importance of cabinet solidarity. And they will say things and, you know, there&#39;s this, you know, there&#39;s this old thing in communications where nothing matters before the word but, right? So they will say, in this room, we have robust discussion, we disagree, we fight, we are going to have the tough conversations, but the minute we leave this room, we are united behind the decisions that have been made. And that is so foundational to the cabinet experience that one of the real advantages of a big cabinet is you have created, by having half of your team in cabinet, an</span>

Bad for me in that I said he wasn&#39;t going to resign.

A couple of days ago, Johnson announced through his staff that he&#39;d fired Navigator effectively, not because there was anything wrong with them, but because this was, you know, an optics challenge.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">take credit for it in a statement? I would take credit for it. And I would say, you know, it was because we kept the pressure up and we pointed out the conflicts that were here, and we continue to keep the light on this particular matter, that we have gotten this, you know, adequate, however, very late resolution to this. And now, absolutely, the Prime Minister needs to call the inquiry. Enough screwing about, it&#39;s time to call the inquiry. And the beauty of the strategy from your point of view, if you&#39;re Pierre Poilievre, is if David Johnson defends himself, he&#39;s validating that you were right. He&#39;s too partisan. See, now he&#39;s fighting with us, the Conservative Party. And so you just continue continue going down that road. The NDP do have the option of saying, oh, this is all very unfortunate. Very, very unfortunate. Now is the time for the inquiry. And just striking a bit more of a balanced tone, if you&#39;re the NDP, right now there is blood in the water with the Liberals. You obviously have the complexity of your supply deal with them and you&#39;ve got to be careful that it doesn&#39;t become a situation where that becomes untenable and you feel forced to do the thing that you don&#39;t want to do. But if the Liberals are just taking body blows and it&#39;s just shaking things up to your advantage, why not let the conservatives continue to be the heavy on this particular one and move forward? If I were them, I would just keep my options open. For me, it&#39;s about optionality. It&#39;s not making definitive statements. It&#39;s allowing this thing to unfold in a way that lets me pick off liberals, allows me to support the liberals if I decide I need to down the road, and try not to get pinned in by either party or by my leader&#39;s absolute statements. And I think it was a real mistake of Singh, just to take a shot at Singh on the way here, when he said, for example i&#39;m not going to call an election until this is resolved because he&#39;s he&#39;s causing himself future problems if he decides no actually i wouldn&#39;t mind an election at this particular moment if you&#39;re the liberals i think you say shame on the conservatives for besmirching this public servant this is just embarrassing for all i am going to continue to take johnson&#39;s advice his very good advice at the end to find somebody who is adequate so i would reverse the onus and i would say okay it&#39;s time for you to come to the table in a serious way pierre poliev you need to put some names forward that are acceptable to you let&#39;s have a conversation about this and yeah i mean he&#39;s gonna pick some like total assholes but let&#39;s let&#39;s let him be the one who&#39;s having to put some things forward for once instead of just throwing rocks from the side let&#39;s have some of his names come forward and be open to criticism instead of the liberal names coming forward and being open to criticism and let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get out of this in a different fashion the</span>

            <span class="text">let&#39;s actually zoom out for the liberals, right? Because in some ways, I fell into the mistake that the liberals make daily, which is trying to win on tactics daily without a clue of where the fuck they&#39;re going on this particular matter. They need to zoom out. This has been our advice for literally months on this particular matter. They are being dragged, bloodied to an inevitable conclusion. They should have gotten there many months ago. The public inquiry, shape it, get out of it as soon as possible. Instead, we have gotten to the precipice of this in the most painful fucking way possible. And the outcome is not in doubt. The outcome has never been in doubt. And they should have gotten to that painful outcome sooner rather than dragging themselves through a more painful journey to that outcome so if i am the liberals yeah i am inoculating myself against the initial immediate charge by the conservatives of we were right because david johnson&#39;s leaving and saying no you&#39;ve actually done a very bad thing here and you&#39;ve caused some uh you know chaos where no chaos was necessary but i am thinking about how i get myself to that inevitable conclusion in a way with as little additional damage as possible at this point because this is too this too much like you&#39;re going to have the next rapporteur the next rapporteur will either agree with johnson or not if that next rapporteur disagrees with johnson it just sort of reinforces the idea johnson was maybe partisan and reading it wrong if that next rapporteur agrees with johnson well you haven&#39;t actually managed to do anything except get back to where you were a month ago and you&#39;re going to continue to be taking the hits and as soon as something comes up on china again that&#39;s going going to be called into question again. I mean, to me, this is very frustrating to watch because it&#39;s very obvious how this is all going to play out.

One of the things that might lead the Prime Minister&#39;s office away from responding is is if this was preemptive of another shoe to drop, right? Like if there is some other reason David Johnson resigned, and so you don&#39;t want to say, Johnson resigned, shame on Pierre Polyev. Oops, actually, we didn&#39;t know this thing about David Johnson or something to that effect there. And also, if you are thinking about changing strategy and zooming out and saying, okay, what do we actually need to do to extract ourselves from this for the benefit of the country and for the benefit of our party? You know, when thinking about those as two independent things and hopefully lean on the country one first, but let&#39;s be real, they&#39;ll be thinking about the party too. Let&#39;s, you know, maybe that requires a bit of an assessment of the reaction to all of this as well and seeing where things go. And frankly, it&#39;s a real good chance based on his actions along the way that Pierre Poliev goes too far, right?</span>

I maybe just want to say it a slightly different way, which is you have somebody besides the Premier who speaks for the government as a whole on the political side, right? Otherwise, you&#39;re almost picking the lens that they&#39;re talking through. Like, are they talking as Minister of Health? Are they talking as Minister of Public Safety? No. I mean, at this point, Mike Ellis, he&#39;s here with his Deputy Premier hat on, and he&#39;s going to talk on behalf of the government. And it&#39;s just kind of a cleaner way to do that. And it allows you to do the things that Stephen&#39;s talked about. But it also allows you to provide just a different voice than the premier has so if the premier for example is very light on details and you need a very detail oriented person you could pick a deputy premier like that whatever works for you it just allows you to kind of fill out your communications calendar the other benefit of course is that external view of it all and if you know the the prominent thing about mike ellis is he is from calgary and i think that&#39;s the main reason he is deputy premier you had to pick somebody from calgary to be deputy premier because calgary remains the battleground calgary remains very very important in terms of assembling a government in this province. And so that just made great sense.</span>

Because the NDP have, and I&#39;ll lay out a few things that they&#39;ve tried to criticize, the lack of diversity, the premier for not appointing ministers directly in charge of housing, labor, climate change, change uh and and also as as quoted in the cbc article that i&#39;m reading that right now also criticizing that no one is responsible for representing the concerns of francophone albertans um and and the quote here is the point is very little has changed and i fear what that means for our province under this government yeah if you were the opposition ndp you you formed the largest uh opposition in alberta history you look at this cabinet what would the soft tissue be to you for you and would you be attacking it at the same this i mean</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m challenged. I was about to say like, you know, reflects a modern Alberta, but I feel that would be taken as an assault against the rural representation there. So I wouldn&#39;t necessarily use those words, but I&#39;d say like, hey, listen, we really need a cabinet that&#39;s going to be thinking about how we build opportunities for everybody in this province. And we&#39;re just not seeing that. We&#39;re seeing the same people who were afraid of opportunity for the last four years, and And we&#39;re going to hold them to account, and we&#39;re going to be talking to them daily in the legislature about what they&#39;re doing to make sure that everybody in Alberta can succeed and be pulled forward. Because you look at this cabinet, and it doesn&#39;t necessarily look like a we-want-everybody-to-succeed cabinet. I think that&#39;s the way you can make a kind of foundationally similar attack, but in a way that tells the story that expands the NDP brand.</span>

            <span class="text">Let me leave it here. I&#39;ll get to this cabinet in the lightning round. But Corey, advice to the NDP as they build their shadow cabinet. We&#39;ve talked about the varying importance of shadow cabinets. Sometimes they&#39;re irrelevant. Other times they add a bit of structure to your side. Advice you&#39;d give to the NDP as they build their shadow cabinet. It could be about how you map those, how you elevate certain folks, new people, old people, messaging. Talk to me about it. In the past, Carter, we&#39;ve even discussed, do you give your shadow cabinet ministers mandate letters of their own. But talk to me about some advice you&#39;d give Cory Carter. These are just options I&#39;m just putting on the table. Feel free to take none of them. Right? And question to you, Carter, coming up right after Cory.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think it does still fundamentally go back to story. So you&#39;re trying to say this is what an NDP government would have looked like. And you want to leave Albertans almost wanting in that sense, like, oh, that would have been better. You know, that would have been cool. And it&#39;s a challenge because and we have talked about this. Do you match them person person for person, like they picked the ministers. So we&#39;re going to pick shadow ministers to be the same. Or do you, do you go a little off script and you say like, well, you didn&#39;t have a standalone status of women. We think that&#39;s important. So we&#39;re going to have status of women, but you&#39;ve got to, you&#39;ve got to be very mindful of the story that you&#39;re going to be bringing forward here. And that&#39;s what should be reflected. And you also do have the advantage like in hockey, where you&#39;re setting your line second. So you should also think about who&#39;s actually going to be a good matchup against these people in the legislature. Uh, if you&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s got a incredibly thorough understanding of the details on one side you might not want to have somebody who&#39;s only going to blob platitudes in question period towards them right like they&#39;re going to have to be able to spar and think on their feet and go back and forth and so there&#39;s considerations like that as well you&#39;re setting up the communications moment which is saying this is what the cabinet could have looked like and wouldn&#39;t that have been cool but you&#39;re also setting up the exchanges in the legislature day by day and we&#39;ve talked so much about how not important important question period is generally. But we&#39;ve also talked about how that can set the tone overall for the media and the tone overall in the house, and how that can bleed out into things. And you&#39;ve got to be thinking about that as well. Because you don&#39;t want to set up the communications moment of the shadow cabinet, only to have it be totally useless for you on a day to day basis in terms of QP and going forward.</span>

But the main role you think about it is kind of in the house. And yes, they&#39;re going to meet with stakeholders there and they&#39;re going to talk about all of these things. but you could you could have almost anybody do that in almost any setting one of the cool things though is that you&#39;re on the attack you&#39;re looking for the soft underbelly and having domain expertise really helps in that sense when you&#39;re a minister you&#39;re looking to duck and weave and that&#39;s just being good on your feet that&#39;s just good communications expertise that&#39;s being able to take a brief so it is a bit of a different job when you think about it in the confines of the house plus</span>

But I&#39;ll go back to the point I made about psychological safety. Canadians right now, they want to have this inquiry because they want to get to the bottom of some very concerning things. So they, you know, they&#39;ve got time. They&#39;ve got time to turn it all around, but they&#39;ve got to stop. They can&#39;t run the last four months or the next four months like the last four months.</span>
