I think it is effective insofar as more people know about it. And that&#39;s often one of the biggest challenges in selling anything is making sure that there&#39;s enough people who actually know about the sale.

You&#39;re, you&#39;re advancing your personal interest through that. But I do want to stress, I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s so clear cut because I think it&#39;s a little trickier to prove intent in that case. However, whether she had that intent or not, I think it&#39;s still a matter that should concern Albertans greatly because it really calls into question judgment. If you know that you&#39;re listing this thing on Monday, why are you as the premier tweeting about it on Saturday? You are opening yourself to those charges. And, you know, you should have a little bit more judgment there and say, okay, that&#39;s not my intent, but I understand how this could be read. Certainly don&#39;t want to go there. And certainly when people start writing news stories about it, as happened, you might want to assess and say, maybe Monday&#39;s not the day to sell this. Maybe we need to rethink this a little bit. Maybe we need a little bit of space because this now looks really badly. So there&#39;s both the judgment of the tweet and there&#39;s the judgment of proceeding with the sale on Monday, which I think, even</div>

Facebook said, no, that&#39;s just not true. It&#39;s not your account. It&#39;s just one of the managers of your account. We have flagged them, and they don&#39;t have posting abilities. Corey, are these two stories related, first of all? Like, you mentioned there&#39;s the relationship aspect.

            <div class="said">I think it was an extraordinarily effective channel changer. And one of the things about channel changers that people need to know, well, let&#39;s just talk about this. There are lots of different channel changers. There are some issues if you&#39;re the government, you&#39;re like, I can do this any day and I&#39;m going to use this next time I need a channel changer. Lots of times you&#39;ll keep things in your back pocket because you know they have a shelf life of three months. Anytime you need it, government always has reasons to change the channel. Sure. Can come up on much more innocuous issues along the way. The second type of channel changer is where I think almost you&#39;re just drowning and you&#39;ll reach for anything and you&#39;ll say, well, I&#39;m going to make this the thing we&#39;re talking about here. And it is still related to events that are out there. And this, this I think would be that version of that. Like, I don&#39;t think they had, they obviously didn&#39;t have this forever. It was based on an event. And then you just try to blow it up. And then the third type of channel changer is the more generic kind of grievance one where you just create something that is, you know, just culture war stuff that comes out of nowhere. And that usually is tied to the issue, but like taking the issue, zooming in a different way, blaming a different group, whatever. And then all of a sudden you&#39;re off and you&#39;re talking about the blame of the group or whatever the issue might be. But this, to me, seems like the one where it&#39;s, hey, this is there, we can yell about this, and we can change the channel. And I think it was an effective one, because I don&#39;t see an awful lot of people talking about, like, I actually didn&#39;t see that story really even take life. It looked like it was about to, and then all of a sudden, everybody&#39;s running off on the Facebook.</div>

Like let&#39;s make sure we&#39;re keeping track of this ball and we&#39;re able to move it forward in ways that are advantageous to us. I like Steven&#39;s idea about tying them together. It would be super easy in this case to do it with, you know, a flip comment like, well, now we know the premier lost access to the account because the admin who lost access had 300 other Facebook pages.

And so they act nimbly, they incorporate these things. And Zane, really importantly, they&#39;re aggregating that information across hundreds of channels. Different accounts. That&#39;s right. So, you know, that meme is working in these 30 groups that have this sort of approach, and it&#39;s not working in these 10 groups that have this sort of approach in this audience. And that allows me, in aggregate, to kind of take this all together and say, I think this is going to work here. and it gives them just a better hit ratio than uh than people who don&#39;t have access to all of those channels and aren&#39;t constantly posting social media all of the time so it&#39;s just it&#39;s a very smart economy of scale and it makes a ton of sense that you would get experts in this space and like most things in life there&#39;s the sectoral expertise which they bring and then there&#39;s kind of the the expertise that&#39;s context aware which is what you would get from working with a premier&#39;s office or working with a political party in</div>

Do you think we&#39;re the era of community management and using social media as a tool to kind of get back to the electorate or get back to voters is just gone. And we just care about the straight up knife fighter meme culture, creep, keep creating the content, because that&#39;s what seems like and I and once again, I&#39;m making a bit of a leap, but just for for the purposes of having this conversation. But that&#39;s what seems like this may be the bailiwick of this administrator in terms of the knowledge that they have gleaned through all these accounts and through this expertise work.

            <div class="said">was that ever an issue because if if you were to let&#39;s say target demos that are let&#39;s just say more likely to support your message as a minister let&#39;s just use this example of the minister of health hosting a town hall let&#39;s say you get through the you navigate to a conclusion that allows that person to post it on digital put some money behind it for advertising would Would you, as in your formal role, have any issues with the targeting if they said, you don&#39;t want to actually want to put this out to Calgary more so than to Edmonton for whatever reason, if that&#39;s the next battleground or to a specific age demo versus not? I&#39;m kind of curious about that because it&#39;s not just the message and the messenger, the social media dimension that&#39;s also added to this, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s several others, is also the targeting, which I find quite interesting.</div>

I want to underline national because it&#39;s not data out of New Brunswick. where 57% of respondents to this Leger poll say they agree that schools should have to tell parents about their child&#39;s desire to change their gender or pronouns versus only 18% saying that schools shouldn&#39;t tell parents.

            <div class="said">well this does go back to something we always say which is beware of novel concepts in polling, right? And the question framing matters so, so much. Stephen talked about this. I have no doubt if you ask a question, I&#39;ll tell you as a parent, like, should you know about what&#39;s going on in your child&#39;s life when they&#39;re at school? You know, the instinctive answer of parents is going to be, yeah, absolutely. You ask that same question, do schools have an obligation to protect children from harm that could occur at home? You&#39;re going to see percents that go pretty similar the other way. Like, you know, you&#39;re not going to have a lot of people say, say, oh, no, actually, I think it&#39;s parents&#39; right to harm children, right?</div>

What is the kind of the community vibe about all of these issues? You know, there&#39;s questions of safety, both physical and psychological, that need to be unpacked by people who know them and understand them and can support them.
