So I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll be effective in creating the outcome of the actual sale, but I think that it is effective. What&#39;s going on with my dogs tonight? I think it is effective insofar as more people know about it. And that&#39;s often one of the biggest challenges in selling anything is making sure that there&#39;s enough people who actually know about the sale. So I would say that it was very effective. more people we know about it the fact that we know about it is astounding because none of us are in the market for uh buying a restaurant i</span>

You are not supposed to use your elected office to advance your private interests or the private interests of your family or friends. And using the office of the premier to sell something you own would be a pretty clear ethics violation if that&#39;s what was going on, right? Right.

But we are in unprecedented times. And I mean that not just in the sense of what we all know with like Donald Trump and all of those, you know, very clear self dealings that he was involved with when he was president of the United States.

That&#39;s, that&#39;s pretty clearly, including the use of the word premier in this context, that&#39;s a violations of the ethics law, right? You&#39;re, you&#39;re advancing your personal interest through that. But I do want to stress, I don&#39;t necessarily think it&#39;s so clear cut because I think it&#39;s a little trickier to prove intent in that case. However, whether she had that intent or not, I think it&#39;s still a matter that should concern Albertans greatly because it really calls into question judgment. If you know that you&#39;re listing this thing on Monday, why are you as the premier tweeting about it on Saturday? You are opening yourself to those charges. And, you know, you should have a little bit more judgment there and say, okay, that&#39;s not my intent, but I understand how this could be read. Certainly don&#39;t want to go there. And certainly when people start writing news stories about it, as happened, you might want to assess and say, maybe Monday&#39;s not the day to sell this. Maybe we need to rethink this a little bit. Maybe we need a little bit of space because this now looks really badly. So there&#39;s both the judgment of the tweet and there&#39;s the judgment of proceeding with the sale on Monday, which I think, even</span>

Facebook said, no, that&#39;s just not true. It&#39;s not your account. It&#39;s just one of the managers of your account. We have flagged them, and they don&#39;t have posting abilities. Corey, are these two stories related, first of all? Like, you mentioned there&#39;s the relationship aspect. I didn&#39;t actually go there initially, but I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on that first before we kind of dive a little bit deeper into some of the nuances of this particular story.

            <span class="text">This is an onto something else. And it might have been, you had this problem, and maybe you would have made noise about it regardless. But maybe in a world where you weren&#39;t trying to change the channel, you would have tried to work it out with meta first, right? But instead, you&#39;re like, oh, let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s not look at the facts. Let&#39;s fucking go. Let&#39;s get it all out there. Let&#39;s change the channel. and maybe that&#39;s why you end up if you&#39;re daniel smith in the premier&#39;s office at this point with a little of egg on your face because it doesn&#39;t look like the facts were quite as you originally presented and maybe you knew that maybe you didn&#39;t maybe you didn&#39;t care because you were in such a rush to get something out the door to stamp on the other story that you didn&#39;t want to give any life to carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it was an extraordinarily effective channel changer. And one of the things about channel changers that people need to know, well, let&#39;s just talk about this. There are lots of different channel changers. There are some issues if you&#39;re the government, you&#39;re like, I can do this any day and I&#39;m going to use this next time I need a channel changer. Lots of times you&#39;ll keep things in your back pocket because you know they have a shelf life of three months. Anytime you need it, government always has reasons to change the channel. Sure. Can come up on much more innocuous issues along the way. The second type of channel changer is where I think almost you&#39;re just drowning and you&#39;ll reach for anything and you&#39;ll say, well, I&#39;m going to make this the thing we&#39;re talking about here. And it is still related to events that are out there. And this, this I think would be that version of that. Like, I don&#39;t think they had, they obviously didn&#39;t have this forever. It was based on an event. And then you just try to blow it up. And then the third type of channel changer is the more generic kind of grievance one where you just create something that is, you know, just culture war stuff that comes out of nowhere. And that usually is tied to the issue, but like taking the issue, zooming in a different way, blaming a different group, whatever. And then all of a sudden you&#39;re off and you&#39;re talking about the blame of the group or whatever the issue might be. But this, to me, seems like the one where it&#39;s, hey, this is there, we can yell about this, and we can change the channel. And I think it was an effective one, because I don&#39;t see an awful lot of people talking about, like, I actually didn&#39;t see that story really even take life. It looked like it was about to, and then all of a sudden, everybody&#39;s running off on the Facebook.</span>

            <span class="text">the the first thing you want to do is resist the channel change but once the channel change has occurred um then yeah then you try to tie the issues together or you say let&#39;s make sure we we have a way to go back to this and we don&#39;t get channel change. Like let&#39;s make sure we&#39;re keeping track of this ball and we&#39;re able to move it forward in ways that are advantageous to us. I like Steven&#39;s idea about tying them together. It would be super easy in this case to do it with, you know, a flip comment like, well, now we know the premier lost access to the account because the admin who lost access had 300 other Facebook pages. I&#39;m told they were all putting reviews on her rail car diner because she was was about to list it and she wanted to make sure they were super positive oh</span>

These folks just have a good sense of like, this is in vogue, this is not, the algos love this, the algos don&#39;t.

And so they act nimbly, they incorporate these things. And Zane, really importantly, they&#39;re aggregating that information across hundreds of channels. Different accounts. That&#39;s right. So, you know, that meme is working in these 30 groups that have this sort of approach, and it&#39;s not working in these 10 groups that have this sort of approach in this audience. And that allows me, in aggregate, to kind of take this all together and say, I think this is going to work here. and it gives them just a better hit ratio than uh than people who don&#39;t have access to all of those channels and aren&#39;t constantly posting social media all of the time so it&#39;s just it&#39;s a very smart economy of scale and it makes a ton of sense that you would get experts in this space and like most things in life there&#39;s the sectoral expertise which they bring and then there&#39;s kind of the the expertise that&#39;s context aware which is what you would get from working with a premier&#39;s office or working with a political party in</span>

Do you think we&#39;re the era of community management and using social media as a tool to kind of get back to the electorate or get back to voters is just gone. And we just care about the straight up knife fighter meme culture, creep, keep creating the content, because that&#39;s what seems like and I and once again, I&#39;m making a bit of a leap, but just for for the purposes of having this conversation. But that&#39;s what seems like this may be the bailiwick of this administrator in terms of the knowledge that they have gleaned through all these accounts and through this expertise work. Is the era of community management and actually using social media for governance purely gone right now?</span>

I mean, you have, because you could have multiple accounts, because you could, you know, there were, back in the good old days, I mean, these were these were all wild, wild west. And then at some point you kind of had to register, you know, your social media accounts so that people knew which which accounts were yours and and you weren&#39;t, you know, using government resources to to prop up your own your own accounts and those types of things. things um but right now i i would say pretty cleanly um that there are uh</span>

But I&#39;m curious about your thoughts, because you often talk about a government or a politician&#39;s sort of duty to communicate.

We need to get this information out. Please get this information out there. But it creates this network effect. And all of a sudden, the government releasing information via these channels, even if being done concurrently on other more official channels, is going to increase the reach of their social media account, right? And that&#39;s reach all of a sudden that they&#39;re going to be bringing back into the game of politics, reach that was created by government. And that&#39;s an organic version, but there were paid versions of this as well. and there are all sorts of gray in between right so say the government creates what we&#39;d call in government land like boards you know so social media boards that would talk about a program that was coming out okay</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">was that ever an issue because if if you were to let&#39;s say target demos that are let&#39;s just say more likely to support your message as a minister let&#39;s just use this example of the minister of health hosting a town hall let&#39;s say you get through the you navigate to a conclusion that allows that person to post it on digital put some money behind it for advertising would Would you, as in your formal role, have any issues with the targeting if they said, you don&#39;t want to actually want to put this out to Calgary more so than to Edmonton for whatever reason, if that&#39;s the next battleground or to a specific age demo versus not? I&#39;m kind of curious about that because it&#39;s not just the message and the messenger, the social media dimension that&#39;s also added to this, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s several others, is also the targeting, which I find quite interesting.</span>

            <span class="text">radio all of this and generally speaking as long as there&#39;s a legitimate government reason why you would want to talk to one group rather than the other like does the audience suggest that there&#39;s do we know from government polling there are more people concerned with health care in calgary or is there a bigger concentration of health care workers who are going to be interested in this issue in calgary then yeah that targeting is going to be totally fair ball and let&#39;s be really frank there&#39;s a lot lot of different ways that you can cut the pie and there&#39;s a lot of different justifications that our political masters would have for us why something should go one way or the other that they could cherry pick the results from and you</span>

You know, that&#39;s probably where we start drawing some pretty hard lines and saying, no, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really what we&#39;re going to do here, Minister. And it&#39;s important that you have a strong, independent public service that can actually put those lines out there. And again, I want to give credit to both the NDP and the UCP.</span>

            <span class="text">The premier, Higgs, has lost another cabinet minister. This is all based on the premier&#39;s sort of commitment that schools should have to tell parents about their children&#39;s desire to change their gender pronouns. The premier is arguing that that is what it should be. This particular bill has been extremely controversial. The premier is saying, I&#39;m willing to wage an election on this. And Carter, there might be some national data that supports this. I want to underline national because it&#39;s not data out of New Brunswick. where 57% of respondents to this Leger poll say they agree that schools should have to tell parents about their child&#39;s desire to change their gender or pronouns versus only 18% saying that schools shouldn&#39;t tell parents. From your perspective, Carter, maybe even, I shouldn&#39;t say park the issue because the issue is a sensitive and it&#39;s an important and a personal one, but I&#39;d say focusing on the political strategy here, do</span>

            <span class="text">Oh, I suspect that if the election question was, should this be disclosed to parents, then yeah, I think that that would probably be very good. If the election issue is, why is Premier Higgs running against children? Why is he using children as pawns? Why is he putting children at risk even further at risk i don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to look he&#39;s going to come out looking well um i think that uh you know it&#39;s all well and good to to come up with these things in theory that say you know in</span>

Is that what we want here? I mean, there&#39;s a there&#39;s a whole bunch of different attacks that the opposition can take. Plus, he&#39;s he&#39;s bleeding support from his from his own, not from his caucus from his cabinet. You know, this is I think this is the third cabinet minister to step down from his cabinet so far. There are two more cabinet ministers in the wings waiting to step down, potentially step down, I should say, because they just simply didn&#39;t vote today they didn&#39;t go in and take the vote uh instead they stayed away from from the legislature um because you know you can&#39;t we talked about this a little bit uh in the last episode you can&#39;t take a position in someone&#39;s cabinet and then vote against them that&#39;s that&#39;s just not done you can&#39;t you know you have</span>

            <span class="text">well this does go back to something we always say which is beware of novel concepts in polling, right? And the question framing matters so, so much. Stephen talked about this. I have no doubt if you ask a question, I&#39;ll tell you as a parent, like, should you know about what&#39;s going on in your child&#39;s life when they&#39;re at school? You know, the instinctive answer of parents is going to be, yeah, absolutely. You ask that same question, do schools have an obligation to protect children from harm that could occur at home? You&#39;re going to see percents that go pretty similar the other way. Like, you know, you&#39;re not going to have a lot of people say, say, oh, no, actually, I think it&#39;s parents&#39; right to harm children, right?</span>

What is the kind of the community vibe about all of these issues? You know, there&#39;s questions of safety, both physical and psychological, that need to be unpacked by people who know them and understand them and can support them.
