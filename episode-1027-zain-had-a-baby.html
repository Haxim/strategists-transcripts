            <div class="said">But I think this is what we learned from the Abacus poll in mid-December. The Abacus poll says that where they walk away to is nowhere. They walk away from the UCP. they walk away from the NDP, and they just simply don&#39;t participate in the next election. And in Alberta, we have that history. Well, I think in more than just Alberta, we have that history. There are many provinces, many, you know, even the federal government have seen lower turnout elections, when the electorate is not thrilled about the choices that they&#39;re presented with. In Alberta, the 2008 election had the lowest turnout ever. And it was primarily primarily because no one wanted Kevin Taft with the Liberals or Ed Stelmack with the Conservatives to be the Premier, and they didn&#39;t vote for them. So the risk to Danielle is to demotivate her existing base, and if she demotivates it enough, there is a risk that potentially she&#39;s unable to get them to come out and vote for her in May.</div>
