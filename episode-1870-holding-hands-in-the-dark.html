            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">I have moments of self-reflection whenever I do listen to this show. Why am I doing this?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I want to tap into Shannon&#39;s, Shannon, I want to tap into your unique Alberta-based insights. Carter, I want to spend the next 45 talking about separatism in this province, but not in the way that other podcasts are, which is the piecemeal of what&#39;s happening, you know, what Danielle Smith has done, et cetera. Can the two of us, can the two of you and the three of us, by extension, can we work together over the next 45 and carve out maybe some of the key elements of what a successful opposition to this needs to look like? We&#39;ve talked about this in piecemeal. And what&#39;s sparking this is that Thomas Lukasik, former deputy premier of Alberta, has now registered his question and has been doing the media waves this past week, suggesting</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">suggesting that his version of the separatist question has been filed first with Elections Alberta. And therefore, perhaps, maybe, it might be the question, should it get approved. And his question is very much about Alberta should and forever remain part of Canada and any separatist notion will be and forever rejected. I&#39;m paraphrasing, but that&#39;s the element of it. And so that got me thinking, is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is that the right call, like acutely what Lukaszek is doing? And then more specifically, what do we need to be doing? What does an ideal like not even like as activists and people, let&#39;s structure what the actual opposition to this thing needs to look like. And I think to me, it begins with a very simple question that I&#39;d like to throw at the two of you, which is, do</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">do we need one unified singular campaign or do we need multiple campaigns across the board saying their own distinct thing about why separatism in this province is not a good idea? Shannon, can I give you the first sort of kick at this in terms of like just the top line? What do you think when I throw that out to you?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">I honestly think that there needs to be one campaign needs to be no. No,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s where my gut is taking me right now. I mean, I&#39;m open to new information and I&#39;m open to other perspectives. But when I see the Lukasik thing, I think, OK, like that is that is driving things into one place, which is no, never. And you&#39;re not going to kind of get some of those persuadable people in the middle to go, you know, well, maybe not ever. Right. And that&#39;s that is the way people think. So I think we&#39;re better off with a no to Danielle Smith, no to separatism and keep the campaign around no, rather</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">rather than like no to whatever their question is, right? Instead of putting a separate, like a no to separation question on the ballot. I think there&#39;s a risk. which is what he&#39;s done</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">yeah exactly and there&#39;s just there&#39;s a risk of having too much going on and there&#39;s a risk of splitting resources right because you got to think that these these republican guys like somebody is funding this shit uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">uh there&#39;s you know there&#39;s leaflets on the doorsteps in the in the by-elections there&#39;s uh there&#39;s already a campaign going on out there on the ground uh for them and and so and and it&#39;s not clear to me how much money is behind behind the Lukaszek effort. It&#39;s not clear to me how much money might be around other efforts. It scares the shit out of me, actually, to have, you know, everybody running off madly in all directions and you&#39;re going to kind of accomplish nothing because it&#39;s not going to coalesce around one thing. That there&#39;s not going to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">to be one... I&#39;m glad you mentioned this on two points in particular. Number one, like your criticism of what Lukaszek and team as being all noble in their ambition have put out on the table is very similar to mine, which is it&#39;s a bit of a risk play. But Carter, can I get you on what Lukaszek is doing first before I ask you to give me a should there be a singular venture that props all of this up? What do you think about what he&#39;s trying to do? File first, get it to be a positive question. So unearth the positive sentiments of Alberta and remaining within Canada and using that as a wedge and potentially, we don&#39;t know this just yet because it&#39;s been untested, potentially roadblocking the separatists in terms of them getting their question on the referendum ballot.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s an interesting gambit. I&#39;m not sure that, I mean, I think that both Premier Smith and Thomas Lukasik are playing a little bit with fire just by</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">by recognizing the legitimacy of this. my view would be uh take a longer view try not to uh try not to take the legitimacy and add to it um if you put forth a positive framed question uh you&#39;re now the yes side um i&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s necessarily where you want to be to echo shannon&#39;s point but i think more to the point like he&#39;s trying to make it so that his question is the only question that can be asked for five years correct that&#39;s actually exactly what</span>

You got to throw open the doors and make it a singular no effort because the singular no effort is far more important than any of the questions that you&#39;re going to get on them.

How do you make room for the Alberta NDP who will probably want to take the mantle on their own and become the default no on this question? Perils of that opportunity of that. How do you create the tent, as Shannon has talked about, as wide as the person who&#39;s created the circumstances to allow us to get here, Jason Kenney, and someone like Shannon Phillips?

And that&#39;ll be the piece that like is tougher ideologically, like across this sort of, you know, as yet notional, broad coalition of people. As for the NDP, I mean, they should definitely go out there and gin up their members and figure out how to re-up their sign locations and all of those kinds of things and, you know, get people interested and excited. But, you know, should they be leading it? No, because then automatically you end up in the Hogan-esque construct of negative partisanship. 50-50 partisan jump</span>

            <span class="text">So my concern about this from a money perspective, and I&#39;m going to stick with Shannon for a second, Carter, is that amongst the like if status quo remains the same with all conditions organizers the challenges that you guys have both very astutely laid on the table the ndp is the group with the names the numbers the money and they kind of end up doing it if if if everyone else is looking at someone else to lead it and we&#39;re creating this massive big tent where we&#39;re looking for the first 2000 and it&#39;s and we&#39;re almost running a no campaign primary like we&#39;re very good at this right bunch of no campaigns or versions of a no campaign will sprout up and then they&#39;re going to compete with one another which is something i want to talk about carter how do you win the no campaign primary um then the ndp just becomes the party and the institution i shouldn&#39;t say the party the institution that exists that has time money resource capacity to fight this thing maybe not in the most strategic way because they&#39;re a political party on the other side of of a question but just by default how much of a concern is that to to you shannon</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s kind of a concern because it uh what it does is it kind of closes off some of the persuadable voters in the you know kind of in the middle who are like i don&#39;t know i need more information right uh you know about like uh what kind what what would this uh allow us to do a yes vote in terms of leverage what we might get out of the federal government all these questions you hear from the public when you when you look at polling on the separatism question right a lot of albertans are like oh well we could threaten and then maybe we would not have to pay equalization anymore which of course none of that is real but um but that is the risk there and it also it does take the new democrat like certainly they have the infrastructure but it does also take them off of like separatism still isn&#39;t a lived experience this is another one of the things that i bang on all the time it&#39;s</span>

And at the time when you actually need them, when the no campaign is starting up, because the timeline on this that I see is three months to organize organizers, three months to collect signatures, 2026 is the actual campaign. So when you get to the actual campaign, you&#39;re going to have all the tall foreheads being invited in in January in February. And that&#39;s when you&#39;re going to need to do your primary fundraising. And by primary fundraising, I&#39;m talking about a three to $5 million campaign on the no side.</span>

He&#39;s beginning, his middle, and his end. Every campaign has that. And as long as you&#39;ve got some view of that, like having one strategy is better than having 10. And so, good. I do think there&#39;s a missing piece here, though, and that&#39;s the air cover. And there does need to be some coordination of air cover through the organizing period.

That all being said, we have seen that when you mock groups like this they actually come out even stronger you&#39;re actually building them giving more airtime so it&#39;s in the heart of it it&#39;s actually it&#39;s an acute sort of like what should we be doing with our hands anchorman question but there&#39;s also a strategy element to it like how would you take this group that is so memeable that is so able to go viral to show their ridiculousness carter</span>
