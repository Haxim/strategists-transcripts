          <p>Shannon Phillips joins Stephen Carter to discuss the logistics and strategy behind mounting an effective opposition to the Alberta separation question. Who should be organizing, and how should they be doing it? What voices need to be involved, and what should they be saying? And how many tall foreheads does it take to screw in a lightbulb? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

Carter, I want to spend the next 45 talking about separatism in this province, but not in the way that other podcasts are, which is the piecemeal of what&#39;s happening, you know, what Danielle Smith has done, et cetera. Can the two of us, can the two of you and the three of us, by extension, can we work together over the next 45 and carve out maybe some of the key elements of what a successful opposition to this needs to look like? We&#39;ve talked about this in piecemeal. And what&#39;s sparking this is that Thomas Lukasik, former deputy premier of Alberta, has now registered his question and has been doing the media waves this past week, suggesting</div>

But Carter, can I get you on what Lukaszek is doing first before I ask you to give me a should there be a singular venture that props all of this up? What do you think about what he&#39;s trying to do? File first, get it to be a positive question.

And that&#39;ll be the piece that like is tougher ideologically, like across this sort of, you know, as yet notional, broad coalition of people. As for the NDP, I mean, they should definitely go out there and gin up their members and figure out how to re-up their sign locations and all of those kinds of things and, you know, get people interested and excited. But, you know, should they be leading it? No, because then automatically you end up in the Hogan-esque construct of negative partisanship. 50-50 partisan jump</div>

            <div class="said">So my concern about this from a money perspective, and I&#39;m going to stick with Shannon for a second, Carter, is that amongst the like if status quo remains the same with all conditions organizers the challenges that you guys have both very astutely laid on the table the ndp is the group with the names the numbers the money and they kind of end up doing it if if if everyone else is looking at someone else to lead it and we&#39;re creating this massive big tent where we&#39;re looking for the first 2000 and it&#39;s and we&#39;re almost running a no campaign primary like we&#39;re very good at this right bunch of no campaigns or versions of a no campaign will sprout up and then they&#39;re going to compete with one another which is something i want to talk about carter how do you win the no campaign primary um then the ndp just becomes the party and the institution i shouldn&#39;t say the party the institution that exists that has time money resource capacity to fight this thing maybe not in the most strategic way because they&#39;re a political party on the other side of of a question but just by default how much of a concern is that to to you shannon</div>

And at the time when you actually need them, when the no campaign is starting up, because the timeline on this that I see is three months to organize organizers, three months to collect signatures, 2026 is the actual campaign. So when you get to the actual campaign, you&#39;re going to have all the tall foreheads being invited in in January in February. And that&#39;s when you&#39;re going to need to do your primary fundraising. And by primary fundraising, I&#39;m talking about a three to $5 million campaign on the no side.</div>

He&#39;s beginning, his middle, and his end. Every campaign has that. And as long as you&#39;ve got some view of that, like having one strategy is better than having 10. And so, good. I do think there&#39;s a missing piece here, though, and that&#39;s the air cover. And there does need to be some coordination of air cover through the organizing period.

There&#39;s a ridiculousness to this. There&#39;s a mocking, there&#39;s just almost a desire to mock. That all being said, we have seen that when you mock groups like this they actually come out even stronger you&#39;re actually building them giving more airtime so it&#39;s in the heart of it it&#39;s actually it&#39;s an acute sort of like what should we be doing with our hands anchorman question but there&#39;s also a strategy element to it like how would you take this group that is so memeable that is so able to go viral to show their ridiculousness carter</div>

Political communicators are something different. And if we want our institutions to work and not to get too high-minded about it, but if we want all of this rules-based order of political institutions and democracy to work, then we have to take ourselves seriously. And so I would say that keep it serious because it is. Stay out of the memoirs. Don&#39;t become that Brantford boomer or whatever that thing was that the conservatives were riding the horse of in the federal campaign. And other people will do the work for you on that.</div>
