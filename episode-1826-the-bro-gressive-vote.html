Here&#39;s one of the reasons why I didn&#39;t love it. Is there a real consideration, and I&#39;m being totally serious with this question, of the progressive politician, the most progressive mainstream politician, leaning into elements of what you would call toxic masculinity, of challenging someone to a fistfight, of leaning into that machismo? Moe. That&#39;s one of the reasons I didn&#39;t love it. But when I look at Jagmeet Singh, I know his background. I see it&#39;s kind of authentic to the guy that I know.

I would argue that the liberals who are seen as the most progressive and the NDP still want to fight for, you know, want to present a fighting chance to union workers and those types. I think that this is right on brand. And I don&#39;t agree with the characterization as the most progressive party in the House. else. Do</span>

And you know, it could lead to some weird situations down the road because some people are just going to look for that. And it&#39;s not too hard for me to imagine a situation where some loser comes, does the same thing to Jagmeet Singh. Jagmeet Singh takes the the exact same approach, the guy swings at him. And all of a sudden, we&#39;re having a discussion about whether he brought this on by taunting him or saying he wanted to fight him, right? And ultimately, this is just not how we&#39;re supposed to settle differences in this country. This is not how we&#39;re supposed to settle differences in politics. And I think it&#39;s unfortunate that the leader of the third party would lean into it. Although I think that he He has gotten a very positive response.

What does that actually prove? What does it actually mean in our culture, Carter? Or have times actually changed in some way? Or was it a different time 10 years ago? Or is it the exact same, that if a politician tomorrow were able to kind of outdo expectations physically, that we would kind of celebrate them? them?

Can we give a quick sort of strategy ranking in analysis, Carter and Corey, on each of the players involved? Let&#39;s remove the liberals for a second. Conservatives, Carter, did they overcorrect or do they have to do this? And now have they set a precedent?

They&#39;ve both committed to it. Give me their sort of strategic markings on how they&#39;ve dealt with things, what they&#39;ve done by kind of deflating this motion.

In terms of the Bloc Québécois, I give them an 8 out of 10 as well. I think that they were told that this was going to happen, and it doesn&#39;t serve their advantage at all. And they&#39;re happy to support Trudeau at this moment in time. The NDP is the one that strikes me as weird. They didn&#39;t need to shift over to protecting the liberals. liberals. They certainly didn&#39;t need to announce it in advance. There was a whole number of ways they could have managed it.

            <span class="text">Right. So first, let me give you my tactical analysis. My tactical analysis is the Conservatives gave too much lead time. So they get like a six out of 10. They gave their opponents an awful lot of time to think about what they were going to do. They&#39;ve been talking about this vote since the summer. Well, we always knew the Conservatives were going to continue to bang this drum.

I think in particular, the threat of a new liberal leader to the NDP is somebody comes in and pretends to be a progressive and says, we need a strong opposition and we&#39;re the government right now.

You desperately need us in opposition. And that&#39;s just a historical threat that the NDP have had to deal with forever. One of the interesting things about polling is the NDP have not gained at the liberal decline, right? Yes. And under the surface, we don&#39;t know if there&#39;s votes shifting around like liberal to NDP, other NDP just disappearing or going to PPC or whatever, right? I don&#39;t have that level of sophistication to the polling I&#39;ve got. although i suspect it&#39;s just the ndp are holding on to their people and the liberals are losing theirs to the conservatives right but</span>

Let&#39;s find a way we can bring them down on an issue that matters to Quebec and let&#39;s go. And for the conservatives, I think that the risk becomes that the liberals actually do manage to find their footing over this next bit with the block and the NDP tying themselves in knots to not bring them down, right? Like all of the drama moves from what the fuck&#39;s going on with Trudeau&#39;s liberals to holy cow, the opposition continues to say they don&#39;t support him, but they&#39;re supporting him.

The BC election is on. We&#39;re on day three already, Stephen Carter. And the conservatives are leaning policy heavy. heavy there&#39;s two interesting things happening right now in in the bc election and and uh and this is i don&#39;t mean to kind of give a story of the day update but i find both of these to be potentially impactful and they have strategic questions associated with them thing number one stephen carter the bc conservatives and john rustad their leader are proposing a three thousand dollar a month rustad rebate named after himself that&#39;s what the the sign says at the podium On rent and mortgages, this is a $1,500 a month tax rebate on your provincial taxes starting in January of 26, I should say, and then increasing by $500 a month, so $2,000, $2,500, $3,000, up to a maximum of $3,000 a month. the BC rent and mortgage rebate would apply to both renters and homeowners and would be administered as a tax credit worth 5.06% of eligible housing costs equivalent to the rate of BC&#39;s base tax bracket in the conservative set in a press release.</span>

I read some of the coverage of it, but to me, I&#39;m not at all clear how much money the average person is actually going to see. I guess if I interpret it one way, it&#39;s 5.06% or whatever you were saying of your mortgage. Let&#39;s say your mortgage was $5,000 a month. So it&#39;s 5% of $5,000 a month. Well, that&#39;s nowhere near $3,000, right? I&#39;m confused. Exactly.</span>

And I honestly don&#39;t know. I might just be entirely misinterpreting the policy, but it&#39;s curious to me that we have this policy and it&#39;s designed in such a way to leave such a strong impression.

Because the big splashy number here that we&#39;ve repeated a few times is 3,000. And what the conservatives are doing is putting it up against the smaller, less flashy number that the NDP are promising, which is 400, a $400 rent rebate for all renters. Now, this is a previous 2017 policy. The NDP haven&#39;t come up with their housing number. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re going down the same path, if they&#39;re proposing something different. But it&#39;s a tough $3,000 to ultimately read, but a clear number and a $400. And of course, these are not apples to apples. These are apples to oranges. But Carter, from a branding perspective, from a voter sort of absorption perspective, does that even matter? Your take on that question as well as what the conservatives are putting in the window with this policy? Well,</span>

So in general, rule, if I have to pay an extra $3,000, I&#39;m unhappy. If I&#39;m getting $3,000 back, then I&#39;m happy. What I don&#39;t understand with this, is it like the Stephen Harper $3,000, you know, where you could write off $3,000 of your kid&#39;s sports and you save $412? Or is it like a</span>

This was a video that is resurfaced of Rustead, I believe in June of this calendar year of 24, speaking to a group of individuals on a Zoom call saying he regrets taking the so-called vaccine against COVID-19. He had many comments around, you know, herd immunity and what they&#39;re actually trying to do, etc. The NDP packaging on this is that this is a guy that doesn&#39;t believe in healthcare and this guy doesn&#39;t believe in health policy. It&#39;s conspiracy theories from the internet. I&#39;m paraphrasing EB, but he said something like that today.</span>

The same day this proposal comes out, the one that we&#39;re just talking about, video resurfaces of Rustad earlier this year, 2024 in June, where he says he regrets getting the so-called vaccine. My question is very simple. And the NDP framed this as this is a guy who believes conspiracy theories on the internet, not health data. Didn&#39;t we forgive everything related to COVID?

I find this really interesting how they make strategic calculations. Thing number one, tonight we record on Monday. Justin Trudeau is going to be on Stephen Colbert. Thing number two, Daniel Smith is attending the Rebel News Live conference in Calgary alongside some of the hosts from Rebel News, Tamara Lisch from The Convoy. Really interesting. And for two of them, they&#39;re not equivalent in some ways. They are in others. others. Carter, I want to get your initial reactions, strategic reactions to good strategy, bad strategy on both of those questions for each of those politicians. What do you think for each of them? And then I want to have a broader discussion on has the strategic sort of decision-making shifted in our modern politics around what politicians do and how they do it from a media and events perspective?

Or is there a greater, grander, more insightful, perhaps, Carter, explanation that you may have around the rebel news story in particular?

People are more persuaded by these things than I think they should be, but I think that you&#39;re the leader of a G7 nation. I think it&#39;s a year or two in election. I think the audience is not Canadian by and large, and I think that people already think that you&#39;re not interested enough in the job and you&#39;re in your own world. And this is reinforcing of all of that.</span>

He will be not speaking to another human being. So as he recharges and refreshes for anywhere between 8 to 16 hours, what advice do you want to give this young man? So,</span>

Because that&#39;s just a feeling that&#39;s going to grow throughout the night. It&#39;s not going to be like when you sit down, you&#39;re going to want to go to the bathroom less. So, just go. That&#39;s my advice to you. That&#39;s so good.</span>
