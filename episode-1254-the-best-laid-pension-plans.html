And, you know, as you&#39;ve sort of identified, I do feel as a middle-aged white person, my opinions are out to the world. So I talked a bit about the fact that this was kind of a mean thing to do to the rest of our Canadians. I talked about the math not working.</span>

            <span class="text">Guys, I want to spend a bit of time on this one. This week, Danielle Smith stood up with Jim Dinning to give the results of a study on Alberta pulling out of the Canada pension plan. This is, of course, after a campaign where she said the pension would not and should not be an issue. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">do we trust Danielle Smith at all, Zane? Like, Danielle Smith says one thing and then does something completely different. It&#39;s not like she campaigned on a renewables ban for six months, right? She didn&#39;t go up and say, you know what, we really have to stop the renewables, Zane.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Jason Kenney had a box. And Corey, you might even know this. You know, there&#39;s probably a book somewhere where</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, 100%. That&#39;s exactly how he did it. The platform that I think most Albertans gave a bit of a glance to, he considered canon. This feels totally different.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_03</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not sure where to start with this one. There&#39;s lots of angles. But let&#39;s start here. The report suggested that Alberta was entitled to more than half the total value of the Canadian pension plan, and that between that and our young population, we&#39;re promised an Alberta pension that means more retirement income, lower contributions. Lots of people immediately said that&#39;s bullshit. Corey, lay this out for us. What the hell is going on? And why are people suggesting this is total nonsense?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, we&#39;ve already sort of dived into it here. So let&#39;s just talk about it. The panel came out with this announcement. It was leaked the day before. It was supported by a Jack Mintz column the day before. Hold that thought, watch that space, because one of the things I think is super interesting is this land, sea, and air attack that the government is going to be using on the citizens of Alberta to try to sell this to everybody here but i</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">mean one of the reasons why people immediately reacted and said this is kind of bullshit is because on its face it&#39;s bullshit like you you don&#39;t need to be super good at math to understand that alberta is not 53 of the canada pension plan you know we&#39;re not 53 of the people in there even with there being a separate quebec pension plan we&#39;re we&#39;re like 20</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a whole bunch of math on this cory it&#39;s not just that one piece of math in terms of our population I mean, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">contributions. It does not necessarily mean, oh, we&#39;ve got a higher income. Ergo, we&#39;ve given so much more. Fifty three percent. Like what kind of cocktail napkin math was this that Jim Denning was doing when this report was being created? I mean, it&#39;s I thought Steve Allen debased himself. I&#39;m just in shock that anybody would allow their name to be put onto this. But it&#39;s just it&#39;s absolutely not. We got an email from a guy named John. We actually have subscribers.</span>

It&#39;s this idea that when people say, oh, Alberta has paid more into CPP than it&#39;s received. It&#39;s a net contributor. That&#39;s nonsense.

            <span class="text">do you have a top line take? I mean, our top line take is that it&#39;s not good for Alberta. It makes us look bad within Confederation. We&#39;re already the ones out there whining about equalization. Now we&#39;re whining about APP. The stuff that has been created around all of this, It&#39;s based on a on a on a falsehood. And that falsehood is that Alberta is in some fashion being taken advantage of. You&#39;ve made it very clear this is about equal in equal out type of plan that isn&#39;t there to protect us as we age. This is not some sort of tax grab by Ottawa where they&#39;re stealing money from us and redistributing it to others. My top line is that we look like fucking assholes. Thanks, Sam. Corey</span>

            <span class="text">yeah, I mean, it&#39;s kind of hard to argue that he&#39;s wrong on this point. And actually, this is kind of the fundamental challenge I have with this. Look, you can go through and you can make an argument on the merits of whether it makes sense for there to be a Canada pension plan or an Alberta pension plan in the province of Alberta. I think that the argument&#39;s pretty one-sided, personally. I think it lands on Canada pension plan making sense for a bunch of reasons maybe we&#39;ll get into. They largely have to do with scale being so important in this space, The idea that they&#39;re de-risked by larger population pools. Both of those things would be lessened with an Alberta pension plan. But at the end of the day, you&#39;re kind of telling on yourself that you&#39;re a giant asshole. If you&#39;re sitting there and you&#39;re saying, hey, look at this pension plan. I found this one neat trick that the federal government doesn&#39;t want you to know. The way this formula was written in this one way. If we pull out, we think we could get half of the pension, half of the pension. like you&#39;re talking about ruining the the retirement of tens of millions of canadians like that is your clever strategy that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">it just doesn&#39;t even make sense like what are you going to do with that money like what are we going to do with that capital right and that that&#39;s the other side of this coin the capital is going to be invested in a dying industry that&#39;s kind of the promise of this the promise of this is we need more capital to invest in our oil sands because china&#39;s not doing it anymore because the united states isn&#39;t investing in our oil oil sands anymore. No one else is investing in our oil sands. And because of that, we need to have more investment.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s an interesting one, because at the end of the day, if you really want to kind of strip away all the bullshit, and I think the notion that we would get 53% of CPP is part of of the bullshit. But there are arguments for and against us being in our own pension, as I was saying. And actually, Trevor Toome wrote a really good paper about this that got released yesterday as well. I mean, I think it&#39;s a great primer for anybody who wants to understand the language of the pension, the nature of pensions, some of the considerations here. And I&#39;m going to summarize his work, and I hope I don&#39;t do it too poorly. But what it comes down to is, yeah, at this moment, moment, maybe Albertans could have lower premiums or higher money on the back end here when you retire at this moment. But it&#39;s riskier, right? So it increases risk. And that&#39;s something that Albertans need to sort of consider here. So yeah, that&#39;s one of the things that would be in theory of benefit, this idea that you would have, at the moment, potentially lower contributions or higher outputs. The other thing, though, is exactly what Stephen&#39;s talking about here. It&#39;s this notion that you then have an enormous pot of money that the government can direct towards alberta industries and in fact in this nonsense survey that was put out uh that was one of the things that was listed right like this idea of hey couldn&#39;t this be a benefit that we invest in all the</span>

            <span class="text">this is a pretty wild survey. And I think it goes back to something that I was putting on the table earlier, which is the government seems absolutely hellbent on using everything at its power to try to make this a thing. And so if you look back, there were polls in the spring. And in those polls, Albertans were somewhere between 20 and 30% supportive of leaving the Canada pension plan, like rock bottom numbers, which is why it didn&#39;t come up in the election. It&#39;s why Danielle Smith said during the election, we&#39;re not going to do this. But now, you know, between this kind of miracle math that&#39;s allegedly going to give us half of the pension plan, all of the benefits, they just love you to know, to the point that the survey is like, which of these awesome things do you want to do first with all of the great money we&#39;re going to have available if we just fuck the rest of the country this way? You know, the reality is there&#39;s no handbrakes here. They are going all in and all out on this. I can&#39;t tell you the number of Government of Alberta ads I&#39;ve run across today. As a result, I suspect of either during the survey or just living in Alberta. Yeah,</span>

We already know that Danielle Smith and Rob Anderson, her policy whisperer, have had these beliefs forever. Danielle Smith wrote about it literally decades ago for the Calgary Herald. Rob Anderson was writing about it much more recently, just before he ran Danielle Smith&#39;s campaign. pain. And so they do seem to be true believers on this file. They went silent just</span>

There would for sure be a conversation with Albertans before it happened. Kind of left out the fact that she was going to use every little bit of the $60 billion organization that is your government to try to convince you that it&#39;s a good idea. And now we&#39;re going to go to a referendum on it and on what it is remains incredibly murky because we obviously don&#39;t know how much money Alberta would actually get. Alberta does have the right to pull out of the CPP, but we don&#39;t know how much money Alberta would actually get. We don&#39;t know what that pension plan would look like.

You know, whether I come out ahead or quote unquote behind on that particular bargain, but c&#39;est la vie, right? And it&#39;s not personal. It&#39;s not about me being in Albertan. And it&#39;s not even frankly about my income. One of the interesting things about Trevor&#39;s paper was that it says when you adjust for age, it has almost no redistributive effect. There&#39;s that $3,500 at the start, like you don&#39;t pay CPP on the first $3,500.</span>

And so I think it becomes a little bit easier for the CPP to say, you know, sure, yeah, people from Alberta contributed more money than they withdrew over this period of time. But over the longer horizon that is the CPP, here&#39;s where that just falls apart for you. And actually, they were in Nanaimo, or they were back in Ontario or New Brunswick or Newfoundland or wherever they ended up going back to. And that&#39;s where they made the withdrawals. So, you know what, Alberta, it actually nets out pretty close to your share of the population in CPP, which is like 16, 17%. Like, that&#39;s what I suspect is probably going to happen. I don&#39;t have any insight into that. But it seems like it&#39;s pretty likely that with more information, and let&#39;s be super clear, there&#39;s a massive asymmetry in information between, I don&#39;t know, the Alberta government&#39;s panel that effectively did this on a cocktail napkin and CPPIB and the robust information they have there.

It&#39;s going to be low turnout potentially. But I think this is going to look like the housing debate that just happened in Calgary. everybody&#39;s going to get upset about it because this is the, you</span>

            <span class="text">Hogan? Boy, I mean, it feels risky following up with an agreement of Stephen, but look, here&#39;s the reality. We know the starting point was pretty low in terms of support for leaving the CPP. Yes, they&#39;ve come out hard with their big three arguments. I think all All of them are very assailable. And I don&#39;t believe fundamentally that that&#39;s even where people are going to get hung up. They&#39;re going to get hung up on the notion that we&#39;re talking about trying to get more than half the pension. Like, I don&#39;t know that people are going to get past that in their analysis. They&#39;re going to say, well, this is all bullshit. That&#39;s obviously not the case. And then when you start having other more serious conversations behind it, like, okay, well, the management of this plan would cost, what, a billion dollars that the panel report report said? I can&#39;t</span>

            <span class="text">de-risk it because, look, just because Alberta&#39;s young today doesn&#39;t mean Alberta will be young tomorrow. That&#39;s a reality. That&#39;s actually just how these things generally tend to work, right? We have these demographic bubbles. It&#39;s It&#39;s part of why the pension looked so much under threat in the 90s before the major reforms that kind of resolved that challenge here. And then there&#39;s the simple reality that bigger pensions get better returns. The more money you have to play around with, the more deals are available to you, the more you actually make the market in different ways. And we are way better off working</span>

And while it has the same benefits, it has a higher contribution rate. So at the end of the day, their smaller size and dealing with their demographic pressures meant ultimately that people have to pay more to get the same as those of us who are in the CPP. Because the CPP is bigger which</span>
