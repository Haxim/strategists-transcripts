So there&#39;ll be tests where they will test the candidate to ensure they can get it out when the topic isn&#39;t the exact topic that the line was prepared for. And then there will be tests where they will try and get the candidate to do, you know, the line on the actual topic.

And it doesn&#39;t hit that level. But there is a bit of an interesting one-two punch of these holidays. And you&#39;ve already alluded to it because next weekend is May long. And that&#39;s a different kind of holiday too. That&#39;s a holiday where you tend to get together with friends. Maybe you go camping, you&#39;re outdoors, right? You&#39;re at the bar, you&#39;re celebrating, you&#39;re enjoying yourself with peer groups. And again, again, not maybe the same bringing together people who have different worldviews at the extent that Thanksgiving is. But the combination of Mother&#39;s Day plus May long, I think does start to approximate like these two weeks are</div>

Although it&#39;s not a way, like even this weekend, there were some weird fights over it. There were some boards on social media the NDP put up about literally taking Danielle Smith quoting saying that she wouldn&#39;t wear a poppy. Then for whatever reason, Rob Anderson quote tweeted it don&#39;t know why he&#39;s amplifying his opponent&#39;s attack and says like oh this is disgusting and then got jumped on by a million other quote tweeters because he&#39;s got his replies off which is neither here nor there sometimes i think that&#39;s a sensible approach but uh but it&#39;s still in the conversation i guess it just seems like people are trying really hard to put other things in the conversation and i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know if you need five really bad things when you have one absolutely damning thing and it probably it could have just been left to be universally reviled for a little bit longer before going on to some of these things that actually get back into the space of ideology like how much privatization do you want in health care</div>

You don&#39;t have this kind of ping-ponging randomness of what might come out of the woodwork about Rachel Notley that you would with another candidate who perhaps is quote-unquote peaking too early. That&#39;s a simple reality. And it&#39;s also why we don&#39;t tend to sweat it when the government is peaking too early, because you know the government. It&#39;s not a challenge. Peaking too early is something you say about a third party that comes out of nowhere, a second party that comes out of nowhere. It&#39;s not something that you generally have to worry about when it&#39;s a known commodity. Then the other thing when people worry about peaking too early is this idea that it will demotivate your base. Does anybody get get the sense that the ndp base is unmotivated right now yeah</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">so here&#39;s here&#39;s the answer um and i&#39;ll do it in relatively short form there are two primary reasons number one is that they may not have appropriate clothing at that particular time so by giving them and always having clothing for them they&#39;re not showing up like they&#39;re wearing a uh a suit when they shouldn&#39;t be or they&#39;re wearing a golf shirt when that you you&#39;ll You&#39;ll remember Stephen Harper&#39;s tragic press conference when he was wearing a golf shirt. It wasn&#39;t good. You don&#39;t want that to be the talk of the town when you&#39;re trying to update people on a fire situation. So you make sure that there&#39;s a costume, if you will, for that set aside because you don&#39;t, you know, you need to make sure that people are dressed appropriately. The second thing is, and I&#39;m not sure that this applies necessarily at this particular it a juncture uh but it often does and that is that often the leaders are staying there sleeping there and are unable to change into uh their clothes they aren&#39;t sending people to get them clothes they are just taking the clothes that are there and wearing them so it is very very standard uh to have clothing for them to wear um and they you know it and it becomes something of a of a pride thing and i think that cory&#39;s got a little bit more info on that too or was that nenshi that talked about how everybody was giving him different clothes for different situations from the city departments because they wanted to have their department highlighted</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">yeah so steven is absolutely right let&#39;s let&#39;s start with why this started and that is that you as a premier are not always going to be equipped with tactical gear appropriate for the situation and you don&#39;t want to be going out in a three-piece suit or something like that when you&#39;ve got to survey a wildfire go down to a flooded area you&#39;ve got to dress appropriate to the situation and so you pick a couple of kind of staples like yeah throw on some jeans or whatnot some slacks and we&#39;ll give you the jacket you&#39;ll be ready for anything there that makes an awful lot of sense and that&#39;s why it started and that is by and large still why these these gears exist Right. Let&#39;s let&#39;s start there. I do think we have to acknowledge, though, that there has been a bit of a realization that because</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">because they represent somebody who&#39;s sleeping at the command center, because they represent somebody who&#39;s down there getting, you know, involved in the particular thing, overseeing it, talking to officials, getting their finger on the pulse, that that there is some advantage. there&#39;s some upside to wear in those particular pieces of gear too and even when i want to be really like super laudable so</div>

Occasionally, it flares up into a thing like, how dare he not wear a suit to the U.S. Congress, but by and large, it represents a wartime leader doing wartime things, and his attire is basically, if we&#39;re going to call it, let&#39;s call a spade a spade, it&#39;s a costume, right?

            <div class="said">yeah. We&#39;ve just got to sort of say that. And we have seen a lot of versions of that recently. And we&#39;ve seen people really gear up that attire and make it a bit more marketing-wise than it has historically been. I think a lot of people were kind of chuckling about the premier of Alberta in big text. I actually don&#39;t think that&#39;s worth chuckling about. I think in those situations, clarity of command is really important. Clarity as to who&#39;s who is really important. You think that these people are people everybody should recognize.

But you see now almost this branded attire. DeSantis famously did this in Florida. People now put it on. And it&#39;s not about trying to make people realize the situation is serious.
