We are going to do our classic fine, fabulous or fucked. If you are new to the podcast, welcome. If you&#39;re new to the segment, it is very easy. I read a story headline or something that happened this week. If necessary, I give Stephen and Corey the frame of a particular person to view it through. It could be a political leader, a political party. And then I ask him, was it fine? Was it fabulous or was it fucked? fucked. And as I always say, the best way to get started is to get started. And Stephen Carter, we do this for you. We start with you. Justin Trudeau said it is absolutely right to call Russia&#39;s actions in Ukraine a genocide.</span>

            <span class="text">I want to say it&#39;s fabulous. I want to say that that&#39;s exactly the type of language that we should be using. But I think that when you start to use language like a genocide, and you&#39;re not putting troops on the ground to stop it, you have to ask yourselves what you&#39;re doing.</span>

            <span class="text">almost requires action. But I want to say it&#39;s fabulous because I want to say that we should call it what it is, that we shouldn&#39;t be worried about the political ramifications. But this is a political podcast, so I think I have to say that it&#39;s probably pretty fucked. Imagine being in a situation where you call something a genocide, you can see the evidence of a genocide, but you aren&#39;t prepared to intervene.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, Corey, what&#39;s interesting about this is in the moment, Trudeau said it&#39;s absolutely right for more people to describe this as a genocide, but then would not repeat the word himself, trying to straddle this line of saying it&#39;s absolutely right to call the actions a genocide.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, how can you come to those conclusions and not take these actions? But I hate to say it from a political point of view, it&#39;s probably fine. And there&#39;s a couple of different ways you can look at this. One is that there&#39;s kind of the conventional sense of genocide, and people immediately jump to the Holocaust, right? Systematic execution, millions of people.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Genocide defined, you know, legally is a little bit broader than that. so genocide means i&#39;m quoting here any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group and then it goes on to list them killing causing serious bodily harm uh inflicting group conditions calculated to bring about physical destruction in whole and part imposing measures to prevent births forcibly transferring children so that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty big and essentially if you go to war with a country And you&#39;re going to war in part because you want to destroy that country, as is the case with Russia and Ukraine. Vladimir Putin&#39;s been very specific about that. Of course, it&#39;s a genocide. It&#39;s very specifically, very concretely a genocide.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so he&#39;s using the term. It&#39;s funny because he&#39;s using the term in a legal sense. I think he&#39;s afraid to use it in the conventional sense, if that makes any sense at all. But all told, I</span>

Roughly one-third of liberal cabinet ministers own rental or investment real estate. On the heels of, of course, housing becoming a national issue, housing affordability and affordable housing become a massive national issue. Roughly one-third of ministers sitting around the liberal cabinet table own rental or invest in real estate assets while fully legal. Real estate experts say the holdings reflect the degree to which Canadians are increasingly viewing real estate as a financial asset rather than a place to live. For the liberals who are championing housing, who have come across aggressively leaning into federal leadership on housing, fine, fabulous, or fucked, Corey, that roughly one third of their cabinet ministers own rental or investment real estate.</span>

Renting is a perfectly viable option for people who want to live somewhere and they can rent their homes. And the trick is, are they, you know, are they slumlords? Are they are they renting out substandard homes or substandard properties to people who have no options? Then that would be pretty fucked. But the reality is that we&#39;re going to see, you know, 10 to 20 percent of the population rent their homes, rent their places of living. And that&#39;s fine. It shouldn&#39;t be outside of the liberal cabinet to to rent or to own a second home and rent it out to someone. one personally i think that if it&#39;s vacant they should be paying extra taxes to incentivize renting out additional spaces but this doesn&#39;t get to these liberal cabinet ministers are owning vacant homes i mean i used to live in canmore i can tell you that there are there is so many vacant homes in canmore that it&#39;s almost ridiculous but also a canmore town council that prohibits short-term rentals it makes it hard for longer-term rentals renting isn&#39;t a sin renting isn&#39;t a crime and owning a rental place isn&#39;t a sin nor is it a crime and</span>

The cost of housing has gotten way out of hand and all you need to do is look at how how it&#39;s risen in this country relative to basically every other country in the world in the last 20 years and the fact that some people who would wish to own are not able to own is a problem people want to be able to own their own houses now you can argue is owning that much better than renting i would say it it gets overblown as a homeowner obviously uh you know you get the random thousand dollar bills out of nowhere that would be your landlord&#39;s problem in a lot of cases but the reason why this financialization has become so bloody popular is because the price of housing goes up 10% a year, right?</span>

Anybody who spends a lot of time on social media, I can tell you, like when I put out a tweet, Sometimes I put it out. I&#39;m like, there are going to be four people who engage with this, but I want to say it anyways. And there&#39;s other times where I think it&#39;s really dumb, but I know that immediately it&#39;s going to get 500 likes because it just, it plays to that kind of audience. So he&#39;s got a good sense of that. He knows how to build those things, including how you&#39;ve got to hook them in the first six seconds or so, which he did here, right? With the big shock value of the Vancouver reveal. And then the pivot, the quick pivot that made it clear what the issue was all about. But</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But let&#39;s be really clear. There&#39;s also some substantive stuff behind it that makes it more likely that he&#39;ll be successful as well. And the first is, he didn&#39;t just take this issue. He&#39;s been talking about inflation forever. For the past two years on this podcast, we&#39;ve been talking about him reading the drum about inflation, right? He&#39;s been talking about housing forever. And also, he is presenting actual solutions here. you talked about why is this working instead of the progressive technocratic way that makes it sound like there are actually thoughtful progressive solutions to this problem and i don&#39;t see them i don&#39;t see how putting more money into housing makes housing cheaper it&#39;s pretty fucking simple when you get right down to it you increase supply or you reduce demand right and uh the government of the day the liberals have no desire to increase supply to a point where it&#39;s going to reduce reduce prices for people to be able to enter the market. And they have no desire to reduce demand because they see owning a home as part of that middle-class dream they&#39;ve been selling since 2015.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, combine the last two items for me. So Pierre-Paul, you&#39;re talking about housing this week, expanding perhaps his tent of praise. People like us were not on board with what he&#39;s about, if I can fairly say. Others saying, yeah, you know what? I think he nailed this. And it is his problem definition. Solutions, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re the right ones, but I think he&#39;s doing this in a way that connects and resonates, and it&#39;s showing that it does. Combine that with the liberal story right here, Carter. If you were in the Polyev war room today, if you were sitting next to Jenny Byrne, if you were advising her, saying, you just had a great week on housing, and now this story comes about the liberals, and your whole housing thing is that there&#39;s elite gatekeepers to you being able to afford a home, what are you saying? What is your message about the liberal, the one-third of liberal ministers owning investment property, Carter, if you&#39;re in the Pierre Pagliar form room tonight.</span>

He will jump on any populist train. Sometimes the populist train I may agree with because I do agree with affordable housing being a right for everybody. But I don&#39;t agree with him advocating for the overthrow of of, you know, the democratically elected government. And I also don&#39;t like where it went. Right. The dictator comments that are coming out of even his caucus, his supporters are saying that, you know, Trudeau is a dictator. dictator. You know, Charest is right. This should be disqualifying.

This reaction by Justin Trudeau today on the news that the Bank of Canada&#39;s benchmark interest rate was raised by half a percentage point to 1% on Wednesday in its latest move to rate and inflation. Trudeau said, in our budget 2022, we&#39;d put forward a plan to address the housing crisis that too many families are living through. He also said, we know that there isn&#39;t any one thing that government can do about the high cost of living. Every family is a different situation. The approach we have taken has been multifaceted. Trudeau said that his government is investing billions on partnering with cities to accelerate housing. And that starts with, instead of talking about it, as some conservatives are doing, it&#39;s good to see other parties agreeing with us that this is the best path forward. This kind of triangulates some of the housing conversation, but this also kind of speaks to the big news of the Bank of Canada hiking the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point.

They&#39;re making money more expensive, which means you&#39;re less likely to borrow and buy things, which means you&#39;re less likely to, to borrow and invest.
