        <div class="desc"><p>The gang's first ever <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-982-live-65106090">Thursday live-streaming of recording</a> occurred with relatively few hitches - the end result is this fine episode where Zain asks, among other things: Is it OK to call something a genocide and then not put troops up? Is it a problem a third of the Liberal cabinet owns rental properties? Why is the soundboard applause so long?</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about one hundred issues (ninety-nine of which are related to the price of housing) in a supersized version of "Fine, fabulous or f--ked". Why has the price of housing absolutely consumed Canadian politics? Can Charest course correct and beat Poilievre? And why does anybody live in a place where it gets down to -10C in mid-April? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

On the heels of, of course, housing becoming a national issue, housing affordability and affordable housing become a massive national issue. Roughly one-third of ministers sitting around the liberal cabinet table own rental or invest in real estate assets while fully legal. Real estate experts say the holdings reflect the degree to which Canadians are increasingly viewing real estate as a financial asset rather than a place to live.

It shouldn&#39;t be outside of the liberal cabinet to to rent or to own a second home and rent it out to someone. one personally i think that if it&#39;s vacant they should be paying extra taxes to incentivize renting out additional spaces but this doesn&#39;t get to these liberal cabinet ministers are owning vacant homes i mean i used to live in canmore i can tell you that there are there is so many vacant homes in canmore that it&#39;s almost ridiculous but also a canmore town council that prohibits short-term rentals it makes it hard for longer-term rentals renting isn&#39;t a sin renting isn&#39;t a crime and owning a rental place isn&#39;t a sin nor is it a crime and</div>

The cost of housing has gotten way out of hand and all you need to do is look at how how it&#39;s risen in this country relative to basically every other country in the world in the last 20 years and the fact that some people who would wish to own are not able to own is a problem people want to be able to own their own houses now you can argue is owning that much better than renting i would say it it gets overblown as a homeowner obviously uh you know you get the random thousand dollar bills out of nowhere that would be your landlord&#39;s problem in a lot of cases but the reason why this financialization has become so bloody popular is because the price of housing goes up 10% a year, right?</div>

And there&#39;s other times where I think it&#39;s really dumb, but I know that immediately it&#39;s going to get 500 likes because it just, it plays to that kind of audience. So he&#39;s got a good sense of that. He knows how to build those things, including how you&#39;ve got to hook them in the first six seconds or so, which he did here, right?

And the first is, he didn&#39;t just take this issue. He&#39;s been talking about inflation forever. For the past two years on this podcast, we&#39;ve been talking about him reading the drum about inflation, right? He&#39;s been talking about housing forever. And also, he is presenting actual solutions here. you talked about why is this working instead of the progressive technocratic way that makes it sound like there are actually thoughtful progressive solutions to this problem and i don&#39;t see them i don&#39;t see how putting more money into housing makes housing cheaper it&#39;s pretty fucking simple when you get right down to it you increase supply or you reduce demand right and uh the government of the day the liberals have no desire to increase supply to a point where it&#39;s going to reduce reduce prices for people to be able to enter the market. And they have no desire to reduce demand because they see owning a home as part of that middle-class dream they&#39;ve been selling since 2015.</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, combine the last two items for me. So Pierre-Paul, you&#39;re talking about housing this week, expanding perhaps his tent of praise. People like us were not on board with what he&#39;s about, if I can fairly say. Others saying, yeah, you know what? I think he nailed this. And it is his problem definition. Solutions, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re the right ones, but I think he&#39;s doing this in a way that connects and resonates, and it&#39;s showing that it does. Combine that with the liberal story right here, Carter. If you were in the Polyev war room today, if you were sitting next to Jenny Byrne, if you were advising her, saying, you just had a great week on housing, and now this story comes about the liberals, and your whole housing thing is that there&#39;s elite gatekeepers to you being able to afford a home, what are you saying?

The dictator comments that are coming out of even his caucus, his supporters are saying that, you know, Trudeau is a dictator. dictator. You know, Charest is right. This should be disqualifying.

This reaction by Justin Trudeau today on the news that the Bank of Canada&#39;s benchmark interest rate was raised by half a percentage point to 1% on Wednesday in its latest move to rate and inflation. Trudeau said, in our budget 2022, we&#39;d put forward a plan to address the housing crisis that too many families are living through. He also said, we know that there isn&#39;t any one thing that government can do about the high cost of living. Every family is a different situation. The approach we have taken has been multifaceted. Trudeau said that his government is investing billions on partnering with cities to accelerate housing. And that starts with, instead of talking about it, as some conservatives are doing, it&#39;s good to see other parties agreeing with us that this is the best path forward. This kind of triangulates some of the housing conversation, but this also kind of speaks to the big news of the Bank of Canada hiking the benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point.

They&#39;re making money more expensive, which means you&#39;re less likely to borrow and buy things, which means you&#39;re less likely to, to borrow and invest.
