And if we don&#39;t recognize the hole that we&#39;re in, we&#39;re not in a position where we can we can perform and if the subtext of what i&#39;m hearing from that uh we were going to lose it&#39;s not just that they&#39;re going to lose it&#39;s not just the l it&#39;s that no one around me is hearing me when i say you&#39;re going to lose no one is listening to me when i say if we do not change certain things we are losing this government and we are losing it to pierre polyev so there is a consequence to this that is beyond taking an l right when When you&#39;re a campaign strategist or you&#39;re devising, you know, campaign director, you are responsible in some fashion for the fate of the nation.

They needed to have this split so they could spend time to define themselves so they can win the progressive primary, so to speak. Grapple on that thought. It&#39;s similar to the first one that I threw at Corey, which is that this had an expiry date. But grapple on that thought, Carter, and then I&#39;ll go to Corey on it, which is that the NDP needed a runway in order to be their own thing so that they could beat the liberals in a progressive primary so they could become opposition and then have a chance to take down Pierre.</div>

You keep the NDP away from that goal. You stop growing discontent in the liberal caucus, like it can&#39;t grow anymore. All of a sudden you&#39;ve got an election.

            <div class="said">so uh because you know this government&#39;s not there for you Now you&#39;ve got the NDP saying the same thing. They&#39;ve jumped right on board that particular message, but for the actual calling of the election. But they validated so much of what Pierre Polyev said. Justin Trudeau&#39;s not in it for you. He&#39;s beholden to these interests. Sure, it&#39;s corporate interests to the NDP, but it&#39;s interests that are not your interests for the conservatives. Conservatives, this is not a government that deserves your support or credibility. Even the fucking NDP have walked away from them now. Let&#39;s call this election. Let&#39;s go. Everything&#39;s changed. And so that seems great, if you&#39;re him, because instead of just being the guy saying the same thing over and over again, you now get to point to this new proof point that even the NDP are not there anymore. I don&#39;t really think that this is going to hurt him that much. Carter,</div>

The Nenshi message today that got clipped and put out was about investor confidence, was about no one&#39;s going to want to invest here in Alberta anymore. There&#39;s a premium that&#39;s going to be applied to Alberta projects for political uncertainty, that this really shatters investor confidence. There&#39;s proof points available to that. Construction Association or Alliance today kind of coming out, others kind of talking through that. What do you think of that message track? I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a singular one, to be fair to them, but it is one that was highlighted today.
