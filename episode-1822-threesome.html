However, I am surprised that there was no immediate replacement, that this thing is a vehicle bigger than Jeremy Broadhurst, we&#39;ve got someone in the seat right away, like, don&#39;t even worry about it, like, this thing is humming along.

I want us to do things and I want us to recognize the hole that we&#39;re in. And if we don&#39;t recognize the hole that we&#39;re in, we&#39;re not in a position where we can we can perform and if the subtext of what i&#39;m hearing from that uh we were going to lose it&#39;s not just that they&#39;re going to lose it&#39;s not just the l it&#39;s that no one around me is hearing me when i say you&#39;re going to lose no one is listening to me when i say if we do not change certain things we are losing this government and we are losing it to pierre polyev so there is a consequence to this that is beyond taking an l right when When you&#39;re a campaign strategist or you&#39;re devising, you know, campaign director, you are responsible in some fashion for the fate of the nation.

Maybe you make sure that the Bloc Quebecois doesn&#39;t bring down the government on Tuesday instead of you not bringing down the government on tuesday but you make sure that you&#39;ve got fucking power and this is where we where we&#39;re really pushing because he doesn&#39;t actually have any power um</span>

            <span class="text">Another sort of strategic thought that&#39;s been out there is that the NDP needed to do this at some point. They needed to have this split so they could spend time to define themselves so they can win the progressive primary, so to speak. Grapple on that thought. It&#39;s similar to the first one that I threw at Corey, which is that this had an expiry date. But grapple on that thought, Carter, and then I&#39;ll go to Corey on it, which is that the NDP needed a runway in order to be their own thing so that they could beat the liberals in a progressive primary so they could become opposition and then have a chance to take down Pierre.</span>

You keep the NDP away from that goal. You stop growing discontent in the liberal caucus, like it can&#39;t grow anymore. All of a sudden you&#39;ve got an election. And it&#39;s not like time has increased your polling performance. So you do this, you call an election for mid late October, you get a nice turkey dinner where everybody can talk about whether they think Pierre Polyev is a weirdo just before it. and um and you just fucking let it ride no obviously that didn&#39;t really work well in the uk or france but but</span>

They&#39;ve jumped right on board that particular message, but for the actual calling of the election. But they validated so much of what Pierre Polyev said. Justin Trudeau&#39;s not in it for you. He&#39;s beholden to these interests. Sure, it&#39;s corporate interests to the NDP, but it&#39;s interests that are not your interests for the conservatives. Conservatives, this is not a government that deserves your support or credibility. Even the fucking NDP have walked away from them now. Let&#39;s call this election. Let&#39;s go. Everything&#39;s changed. And so that seems great, if you&#39;re him, because instead of just being the guy saying the same thing over and over again, you now get to point to this new proof point that even the NDP are not there anymore.

And I say that as a proud Calgarian who&#39;s lived here, you know, basically my whole life, love this town. But the idea that we&#39;re going to get that money taken from us. Meanwhile, money is being spent on LRT projects in Edmonton. What the fuck are you talking about? Edmonton&#39;s going to have a larger LRT system than Calgary soon? What the fuck are you talking about? This is unfair. This is unright. Let&#39;s just get moving here. This is bullshit.
