            <span class="text">this was different uh first of all in the old old days um we we didn&#39;t let women do the debates with us right because oh jesus it was a we were a sexist society in the 1970s corey i don&#39;t know if you know that but we&#39;ve grown out out of it now so uh it was different and also we&#39;ve</span>

            <span class="text">sexism&#39;s over racism&#39;s done i mean all society&#39;s ills have basically been solved and that&#39;s why i watched today&#39;s debate with just nothing but optimism cory today was nothing but optimism so it&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And we have much truth to talk about this evening. Guys, we&#39;re going to talk about the debate. We&#39;ve got a lot of things to talk about debate-wise. First question, and we&#39;ll start with you, Corey Hogan.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Initial impressions. questions. Where is your head at? It ended not long ago. You look a little confused. What are you thinking?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m a little confused. It&#39;s interesting. There&#39;s a lot of ways you can look at a debate and you can try to put on the hat of an undecided voter and how they might be reacting to it. You can put it on the professional hat and how you kind of score the communications points, the policy points. And I don&#39;t know, the different hats I can wear, I have different reactions depending on which one I decide to put on at the moment. And I guess I&#39;ll just throw a couple of them on the table here. I kind of feel like Danielle Smith was the most polished and her delivery was very strong. And that almost suggests to me that a low information voter is going to give it to Danielle Smith. And I kind of think Rachel Notley did a pretty good job of maybe not necessarily delivering the lines, but presenting the lines, the lines that you think can be repackaged and used in the commentary after and clipped for television and all of that and and ultimately i think so much of what happens in a debate actually happens after the debate and i think there&#39;s reason for rachel notley to you know maybe get a higher score than my initial you know neutral smith wins uh comments might offer and then there&#39;s the third part of me which i like to think is the me me who is is thinking what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what the fuck are we doing here i mean This is not a normal day. This is a day where the premier was charged effectively by the ethics commissioner as having broken ethics laws. And there&#39;s a certain surreality that is floating over all of this that makes any kind of scoring of points seem kind of weird, frankly. And I think that&#39;s the thing that I am – that&#39;s the source of the confusion you see on my face, Annalise. I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;m supposed to think about today. day. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Well, lots, lots to unpack there, Corey, many questions, including is a low information voter watching the debate? Did your expectations tank your thoughts? But before we get into all that, Stephen Carter, what are your what are your initial impressions after sitting in your living room, eating your dinner watching the debate?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think I think the first thing is that Danielle Smith, someone who&#39;s been on television for 20 years, is good on television. She she presents really well on tv um i i think it&#39;s a little bit tricky that her script is entirely fiction um instead of non-fiction but you know you call me a stickler um but i you know i i was very frustrated by the lies right and it&#39;s interesting to me watching the media already jump onto her especially cory brought up the the the uh ethics commissioner report today where you know she very very much concluded that Smith had broken the law. And the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the very first question for the media is, why are you lying about that in the debate? Because Smith did what she did with almost the entire debate, and that is lie about it. And she said that basically she was cleared by the ethics commissioner. And she very clearly was not, right? And the ethics commissioner has reserved sanction for when Smith comes back. That&#39;s not a usual practice for those following along at home, home reserving sanction for the end of an election is not a usual practice um but here we are and and danielle smith was so casual with her lies so comfortable with her lies that i i really struggled to watch it like cory had all those different people watching it uh and by the way let&#39;s put a note that we should be probably investing in some mental health services for the strategists writ large um cory&#39;s obviously got multiple personality disorder and i&#39;m going going to be so depressed by the end of this thing um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um so not appropriate but go on we&#39;re very</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">hidden with him carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">guys don&#39;t understand me uh i&#39;m very sympathetic here&#39;s the thing um i didn&#39;t like the debate i did not enjoy watching the debate because i don&#39;t like what some one person um lying and winning and another other person telling the truth and losing and that just makes me it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">makes me angry because how do you win a debate with someone who is just committed to the lies and i&#39;ve got a list of them because i was taking notes and we can go through them uh later in the in the episode yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">yeah we can go through them later cory it looks like you want to say something important well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well look it&#39;s funny because again i mean if i can shut off different parts of my brain either intentionally or accidentally here in some ways this was a wonderful debate like a really great debate</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you had you had people talking quickly thinking sharply and they were responding to each other back and forth in a way that you often lose in the three four or five person debates that we&#39;re usually used to in this country here and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and steven&#39;s not wrong like i i mean there is not a rapid instant pop-up video style fact-checking in a debate like this. And I think the more you&#39;re willing to play with the boundaries of truth, the more you can get away with, because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because you know that a lot of people will just never bother going to the fact-checking. And so that is problematic, but it gets back to what debates are good at telling you and what debates are not good at telling you. And ultimately, man,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">man, I don&#39;t want to editorialize too much. And I don&#39;t think I feel as strongly as Stephen does on some of this, but But debates are not great displays of character. They&#39;re just simply not. And, you know, what they are good at is telling you if somebody has a command of files, if they&#39;re quick-witted. And in this case, I think both candidates came off as fairly quick-witted in different ways. You know, Danielle Smith, very polished. Rachel Notley is very wonkish. And, you know, sometimes you could tell that her mouth was or her thoughts were ahead of her mouth. Or I don&#39;t know what you want to say, but like there seemed to be a disconnect there. But, yeah, I mean, it&#39;s tough to say that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that it was a good debate when you have kind of foundational challenges with it. And Stephen has a foundational challenge around truth. I have a foundational challenge around why are we pretending this is a normal day, right? Like, this is not a normal day. yeah so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">so on on that note though cory what what the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">the news came out this morning from the ethic commissioner with strong language by the way like words like threat to democracy um very strong language and we can get into that but that comes out this morning debate is scheduled for tonight thursday before a long weekend yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re saying it&#39;s treated as a normal day how do you suggest it should have been treated when the debate was scheduled yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and i get it like you&#39;re on a track And it&#39;s the safe play to treat it like a normal thing. But I think ultimately, even if today hadn&#39;t happened, even if we didn&#39;t have the ethics commissioner, I think in a way, one of Rachel Notley&#39;s challenges</span>

Because that&#39;s not how she&#39;s treated anything else about this election in terms of her party&#39;s response, her responses to the various things that Daniel Smith has done. The comparisons to Nazis, the healthcare comments, the, you know, as recently as today, the candidate of the UCP who, boy, like just in the last couple days, this has happened too, where, you know, compared transgender children to feces and cookie batter. Like, holy shit, I actually can&#39;t think of like a grosser thing there. But here&#39;s what I got to say.</span>

And sorry, let me just read you the conclusion. In my opinion, Premier Smith contravened Section 3 of the Conflicts of Interest Act. Well, that really doesn&#39;t sound like cleared to me.

            <span class="text">Yeah, to expand on Stephen&#39;s point, one of the challenges with looking at other people in the room is it is fundamentally, it&#39;s mistargeting who your audience is. Your audience is not the moderator. Your audience is not Danielle Smith, and you should be speaking to your audience. And Danielle Smith did a great job of this. Stephen&#39;s exactly right. She seemed to know exactly what camera was on. Again, not that hard because there is a red light on it, and she focused on the camera accordingly. Stephen Harper did this all of the time, too. Everybody else in those five-person debates would be looking at each other, talking to each other, and he would just straight at the camera, I am talking to Canadians. Very powerful when done right. Can look a little weird when done wrong, but Danielle Smith did it right. She figured it out, and she managed it very, very well. Well, the other thing about body language, though, is, and again, I don&#39;t know if I would put this in body language, but I&#39;m going to throw it on the table here, is they both started with, and I get it, it&#39;s a debate, I would be the same, but like with such a nervous energy, and</span>

And just as she got on in the debate, as she got slower, she got better. And it&#39;s something that she could have found a little bit sooner, I think. And unfortunately, she stepped on a couple of her good lines just by not getting them out perfectly because she had those nerves and she</span>

            <span class="text">there&#39;s ways to diminish those, right? Like a pitcher doesn&#39;t just walk onto the mound and start pitching baseballs, right? Like they do a warm up in the bullpen. And my fear is that in the green room, you know, they did not get the appropriate, the appropriate warm up. I&#39;m sure they were doing things like, like, what are the top lines? Let&#39;s focus on the lines. They weren&#39;t doing breath work. They weren&#39;t doing timing speech, right? right? They weren&#39;t, you know, you can do things to actually control how many words come out per minute. You can do things to make sure that you are, your diaphragm is working so that your language comes out better. You can do things to make sure that you were, you know, you don&#39;t sweat about the words. The words don&#39;t matter on your speech. What matters is your confidence. But she got lost on a single word. And when you lose a single word, the whole thing goes off track.</span>

And the no talking over was fantastic. And just for the record, that can also be done in multi person debates. And I hope that people watching tonight in other parts of the country recognize that this is just better, better TV, better, better for democracy than the shit show that we&#39;ve gotten used to recently.</span>

But instead, she didn&#39;t do that. she doesn&#39;t listen to the podcast enough you know all these times we&#39;ve been referring to rachel and lou she&#39;s not actually listening it&#39;s very upsetting because if she&#39;d listened uh she could listen to me destroy you essentially in a in a debate over and over and over again three</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Well, when we last talked about it, I thought it was two hours because one of the newscasts was running two hours, but apparently only one hour of debate. That really actually almost made me anxious how much people felt like they were both talking fast. They were both trying to get their words in. And it probably would have benefited just to have a little bit more time for a little bit more back and forth along those lines there. And I get why it was an hour because there was only two of them but in a funny way it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been complaining about how little time everybody gets at the hour and a half debate two hour debates when there&#39;s five and when there&#39;s not we just divide the time in two like why wouldn&#39;t we have resolved the challenge we used to have yeah</span>

            <span class="text">yeah but this isn&#39;t necessarily just because you know of the performers it&#39;s not just because of the the method all you know like uh this is actually a deeper question and that is is the news consortium didn&#39;t want to lose an hour of primetime. They didn&#39;t want to lose Wheel of Fortune or whatever comes on at 7 o&#39;clock that advertisers pay for, and that&#39;s how they make their money. They&#39;re not making their money on airing a debate. There&#39;s no money in a debate, and two hours of a debate means they lose two hours of revenue. One hour of a debate means they only lose one hour of revenue, and</span>

I think that the problem with the opening and the closing is that those are the opportunities to set what your actual agenda is going to be as you talk about it. I thought both of them were well written. But what I actually my problem is that there weren&#39;t enough stories and the story could have been so easily set up in the in the opening and closing. And instead of doing stories, they spoke of policy and policies, boring and stories are interesting. The one story that that Notley</span>

And in a way, it&#39;s a bit of a metaphor for one of the challenges the NDP campaign has, which is there are so many things to say, you never stop talking and you don&#39;t let the things land.

            <span class="text">Well, for me, the positioning was Smith saying, I don&#39;t have an actual record because I haven&#39;t been here long enough. But you do, and your record sucks. That was the subtext of so much of what Smith was talking about today. You know, like your record was really horrible. when i&#39;m when i&#39;ve been premier for as long as you have my record will be so much better and she was kind of allowed to get away with that um so that positioning of this upstart that that um doesn&#39;t have the history that that that is is dogging um notley that that was good because it actually worked now again is it truthful not really but on the other hand she&#39;s only been been there for a few months um but a few months still a premier makes so we&#39;re you&#39;re she should have been more responsible also for kenny&#39;s fuck-ups um and you know she was allowed to slide on a lot of that yeah</span>

            <span class="text">acting as though they were opposition leader yeah fighting against the record of the other person you didn&#39;t have a lot of standing up and saying and i did this right by either side. And both did at different points. Both said they were proud of it. But the main thrust for both of them was, you know, to summarize very simply, it&#39;s look at the four years of NDP government. You don&#39;t want that. Ignore my term that&#39;s been more recent. Look at the four years of the NDP government. And then look at Danielle Smith&#39;s comments here. And that&#39;s a strange one for me. So there&#39;s kind of this cliche in Canadian politics, Paul Wells rules rules for canadian politics you familiar with these yeah you tweeted</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well I think this does go back to the expectation game and I know an awful lot of people were watching it on both sides waiting and wanting a knockout blow and I think in particular there were NDP supporters who thought this is the moment this is where it&#39;s all going to unravel for Danielle Smith she&#39;s just going to be this wreck of a human being just falling apart under the hot lights. That was never going to happen. Danielle Smith is a stage performer. She knows how to hold herself together. That&#39;s just a reality of it here. But there&#39;s almost this letdown that you don&#39;t have the big dramatic moment. And in part, one of the reasons why people were conditioned to hope for and almost get to a point of expectation for the dramatic moment is that is so much part of the story of Rachel Notley&#39;s rise in the first place. And we talked about this last episode. But in 2015, you know, the math is hard line, which is actually math is difficult, I will say as a pedant. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that was such that debate, that debate was an elevating moment for Rachel Notley. And it was a really consequential moment in politics. But think for a minute, how many hundreds or thousands of debates you have have you&#39;ve seen or seen pass by you in the decades that you&#39;ve been alive how many actually have moments like this we talked about five yeah</span>

            <span class="text">last episode right like the reality is the vast majority of debates don&#39;t have the knockout the vast you&#39;re much more likely to have a debate that ends with people critiquing the format of the debate than saying wow that debate really changed things here can debates change things you bet we&#39;ve seen it for</span>

So all of the things that happened today are going to get tied up into the reporting of the debate. And there is no way that all those things don&#39;t color the outcome of the debate. So I think that by Tuesday, Wednesday, it looks like Notley won the debate. But realistically, and when we start to rewrite this history, I hope that we&#39;re not saying, saying, Ooh, you know, not least the best debate performer in the history of mankind. She wasn&#39;t in 2015. She wasn&#39;t in 2019. And she isn&#39;t in 2023.</span>

I mean, I guess she expected Danielle to at least resort to some truth. So we struggled a bit with that. But as the fact checks come out over this weekend and as the you know, especially on that ethics commissioner report, I mean, we&#39;re really going to be seeing a whole bunch of change because people know that Danielle Smith, every word that came out of her mouth was a lie. And I think that that&#39;s ultimately the story that&#39;s going to be told. Isn&#39;t that the story you&#39;re going to tell? I mean, that&#39;s that seems to be the story that people want to hear is, you know, how how how come Danielle Smith could be so brazen? in the lies that she told.</span>

Like, don&#39;t take this spaghetti approach of, well, maybe we&#39;ll say Rachel was the best. Maybe we&#39;ll say the problem was Danielle Smith was just able to lie. Well, because that doesn&#39;t really jive. So was she the best? Or did she lose because the person? You just got to sort of pick a lane. And so I think the angle of can&#39;t be trusted, that was a lie a minute, that was a wild time on a wild day is probably the NDP&#39;s best particular line. God, you could have a list of all of the lies as you see them. Like, I want to take a bit of a jaundiced look at this and say, there are some things that were outright lies. There were some things that are more natural kind of conventional truth stretches. stretches and by the way it&#39;s not as though rachel notley didn&#39;t stretch the truth with things like about her platform costing right but the preponderance for sure was on the the misstatements and the mistruths being on the on the ucp side so start with a list create a pop-up video of the whole debate of boop here&#39;s another lie that she said and here&#39;s the actual fact maybe that you release at some point on the weekend to share nobody&#39;s actually</span>

            <span class="text">course well the ucp just have to clip the things where danielle smith looks absolutely in command and contrast them with the with the various flubs of of uh of rachel notley like it&#39;s it&#39;s actually not too hard it&#39;s a more conventional way to do that and you just flood the zone with as much of that as possible and have everybody say yeah they won now don&#39;t get me wrong you&#39;re not going to get your ko there you&#39;re not going to get a knockout punch but if you combine that and you sustain that with people already sort of saying in the moment daniel smith was the smooth deliverer and whatnot the secret for both of these is to latch on to something that is organically floating to the top anyhow and my personal favorite way to look at this is to see like the disappointed supporters what are they saying on on your side on their side use that like use that as your attack and i think disappointed supporters on the ndp are saying oh you know daniel smith was just smoother than rachel notley so use that if you&#39;re daniel smith and the disappointed supporters maybe</span>

            <span class="text">Full stop. That is what this election hinges on here. The audience of this debate will include some people who are persuadable voters from suburban Calgary. That&#39;s a reality. Debates actually do still have pretty good viewership when you compare it to a lot of other things here. But by and large, most of that group will not have watched the debate in any kind of meaningful way, right? If they&#39;re persuadable, they&#39;re probably not that partisan. That means they&#39;re not deeply invested in politics in either either kind of either flavor that we offer here in the province of alberta sorry</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is why the post debate matters so much too because it&#39;s about how that group who maybe didn&#39;t even watch the debate or maybe just watched it for 15 minutes and said i gotta i gotta feed my kids. I got stuff to do. It&#39;s six o&#39;clock. This is supper hour, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s the small bits that they captured. It&#39;s the way it&#39;s packaged. It&#39;s the way their peer groups are talking about the debate. It&#39;s the things they&#39;re seeing in the Calgary Herald. It&#39;s the things they&#39;re seeing on CTV. It&#39;s the things they&#39;re seeing on social media that will all kind of create a flavor of the debate. And there&#39;s a really fascinating phenomenon that you will note. Stephen has seen this too. Anybody who&#39;s worked in a party which has polling as to who won the debate will see this. You&#39;ll do a poll. Did you watch the debate? What did you think of the debate? You will always have like five times as many people claim they watched the debate as</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as you know watched the debate and they all have opinions about it. And so the four times of the people who actually watched the debate, who are undecided, who are persuadable in suburban Calgary, that&#39;s what matters. And you want to craft a view of the debate for them, even if they didn&#39;t watch a minute of it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. And the other thing is if you&#39;re doing three days of polling, if you&#39;re doing rolling polls which a lot of them will be doing at this stage um you will see one response on the first night another response on the second and the third night will be different again so this it it really does evolve over time um yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well part of why it evolves so much in in our context in alberta and canada is we don&#39;t have have by and large public dial groups like they do in the United States. Like in a sense, like when there&#39;s a presidential debate down there, the decision, like I think it kind of ossifies a little faster because it just goes through the cycle so much quicker, right? Before you go to bed that night, you&#39;ve seen how the dial groups react. So you know how, you know, the undecideds that were pulled together saw it. You see, you know, CNN</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">CNN will have their group of undecided voters who do you think won the debate they&#39;ll put their hand up who do you think yeah like you get all of that immediately in the united states and it flips through it quicker and knowing</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i still struggle with debate processes that do not rely on some sort of agreed to facts agreed to truths uh when someone has decided that they&#39;re not going to speak to truth and instead are going to insert their own lies or their own alternative facts, it fundamentally changes the playing field for both of the debating partners. So in this particular case, the debating partnership wasn&#39;t even. It was not set up for both partners to come at the same task at the same time. And that requires that you think on your feet and you do a counterpunch much faster than Rachel Notley did. Danielle Smith should have have been taken down a lot further and a lot faster by by only one person in this debate and as the that is rachel notley some people will look and say well we should have you know the moderator should have stepped in and all of that that&#39;s just not true uh rachel notley if if this debate does turn against notley it will be her issue it will be her people her people the people who prepared her uh and uh that&#39;s going to be tough for them to stomach if it goes back to smith um then it&#39;s just the baggage that she&#39;s carrying with her if if smith loses today it&#39;s not about today it&#39;s about the shit that happened before okay</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah um you can have good quick or cheap choose two there&#39;s similar logic in a debate right and one of the things steven talked about was rachel notley maybe responding more directly to the charges that were there and she didn&#39;t by and large she just went to the lines that were clearly prepared. These were the messages she wanted to get out.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That doesn&#39;t mean that was the wrong strategy. Stephen didn&#39;t get the responses he wanted, but I would argue they might have gotten the packaged clips that they wanted with the attacks on Danielle Smith. And the standout line in many ways for me was when the comments that were made about Danielle Smith arguing with herself. Frankly, it&#39;s exhausting, right? These were good lines, and she did manage to get them out here. So you have to make those trade-offs in your debate prep. Do you want to be loose and nimble and just react to what the other person says? Well, there&#39;s a school of thought that says, no, then you lose the ability to control the agenda. And again, you&#39;re not playing for the audience in the room. You&#39;re playing for the audience at home. What does your research tell you they need to hear? I have no doubt, just because of the way it was presented and the words I heard and how it was delivered, that the NDP had a very honed, very data-driven approach to making sure that the messages were put out that they wanted to put out. And probably they were assuming people would see this as much or more in packaging, at least the voters that they care about, those persuadable and suburban Calgary, as anything else here. so like don&#39;t be don&#39;t be i guess i would say whether you support the ucp or you support the ndp and you&#39;re critiquing this performance just remember that you don&#39;t have all of the data that they have and they&#39;re making decisions about the approaches that they want to take and part of why the different campaigns start to feel good and they can both feel they want is they have different goals with the campaign and we&#39;re going to see where everything lands it&#39;s one of the interesting things about the debate like we uh we get to see parts of it we get to participate in the aftermath aftermath, but you know, there&#39;s, there&#39;s a bigger game going on and the players know an awful lot about what&#39;s happening out there. The final thing I want to say is that, uh, you know, the power, when their club was founded in 1870, they had an awful lot of spirit. They had that South Australian spirit and that&#39;s why you should have picked them. And it should never have been a question. You know, they have carried that to their core, the pies, they know where they&#39;re going. They know what&#39;s happening.</span>
