            <div class="said">I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m a little confused. It&#39;s interesting. There&#39;s a lot of ways you can look at a debate and you can try to put on the hat of an undecided voter and how they might be reacting to it. You can put it on the professional hat and how you kind of score the communications points, the policy points. And I don&#39;t know, the different hats I can wear, I have different reactions depending on which one I decide to put on at the moment. And I guess I&#39;ll just throw a couple of them on the table here. I kind of feel like Danielle Smith was the most polished and her delivery was very strong. And that almost suggests to me that a low information voter is going to give it to Danielle Smith. And I kind of think Rachel Notley did a pretty good job of maybe not necessarily delivering the lines, but presenting the lines, the lines that you think can be repackaged and used in the commentary after and clipped for television and all of that and and ultimately i think so much of what happens in a debate actually happens after the debate and i think there&#39;s reason for rachel notley to you know maybe get a higher score than my initial you know neutral smith wins uh comments might offer and then there&#39;s the third part of me which i like to think is the me me who is is thinking what</div>

This is a day where the premier was charged effectively by the ethics commissioner as having broken ethics laws. And there&#39;s a certain surreality that is floating over all of this that makes any kind of scoring of points seem kind of weird, frankly. And I think that&#39;s the thing that I am – that&#39;s the source of the confusion you see on my face, Annalise. I&#39;m not quite sure what I&#39;m supposed to think about today. day. Well,</div>

She she presents really well on tv um i i think it&#39;s a little bit tricky that her script is entirely fiction um instead of non-fiction but you know you call me a stickler um but i you know i i was very frustrated by the lies right and it&#39;s interesting to me watching the media already jump onto her especially cory brought up the the the uh ethics commissioner report today where you know she very very much concluded that Smith had broken the law. And the</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">the very first question for the media is, why are you lying about that in the debate? Because Smith did what she did with almost the entire debate, and that is lie about it. And she said that basically she was cleared by the ethics commissioner. And she very clearly was not, right? And the ethics commissioner has reserved sanction for when Smith comes back. That&#39;s not a usual practice for those following along at home, home reserving sanction for the end of an election is not a usual practice um but here we are and and danielle smith was so casual with her lies so comfortable with her lies that i i really struggled to watch it like cory had all those different people watching it uh and by the way let&#39;s put a note that we should be probably investing in some mental health services for the strategists writ large um cory&#39;s obviously got multiple personality disorder and i&#39;m going going to be so depressed by the end of this thing um</div>

And, you know, what they are good at is telling you if somebody has a command of files, if they&#39;re quick-witted. And in this case, I think both candidates came off as fairly quick-witted in different ways. You know, Danielle Smith, very polished. Rachel Notley is very wonkish. And, you know, sometimes you could tell that her mouth was or her thoughts were ahead of her mouth. Or I don&#39;t know what you want to say, but like there seemed to be a disconnect there.

The comparisons to Nazis, the healthcare comments, the, you know, as recently as today, the candidate of the UCP who, boy, like just in the last couple days, this has happened too, where, you know, compared transgender children to feces and cookie batter.

            <div class="said">Yeah, to expand on Stephen&#39;s point, one of the challenges with looking at other people in the room is it is fundamentally, it&#39;s mistargeting who your audience is. Your audience is not the moderator. Your audience is not Danielle Smith, and you should be speaking to your audience. And Danielle Smith did a great job of this. Stephen&#39;s exactly right. She seemed to know exactly what camera was on. Again, not that hard because there is a red light on it, and she focused on the camera accordingly. Stephen Harper did this all of the time, too. Everybody else in those five-person debates would be looking at each other, talking to each other, and he would just straight at the camera, I am talking to Canadians. Very powerful when done right. Can look a little weird when done wrong, but Danielle Smith did it right. She figured it out, and she managed it very, very well. Well, the other thing about body language, though, is, and again, I don&#39;t know if I would put this in body language, but I&#39;m going to throw it on the table here, is they both started with, and I get it, it&#39;s a debate, I would be the same, but like with such a nervous energy, and</div>

I&#39;m sure they were doing things like, like, what are the top lines? Let&#39;s focus on the lines. They weren&#39;t doing breath work. They weren&#39;t doing timing speech, right? right? They weren&#39;t, you know, you can do things to actually control how many words come out per minute.

And the no talking over was fantastic. And just for the record, that can also be done in multi person debates. And I hope that people watching tonight in other parts of the country recognize that this is just better, better TV, better, better for democracy than the shit show that we&#39;ve gotten used to recently.</div>

That really actually almost made me anxious how much people felt like they were both talking fast. They were both trying to get their words in. And it probably would have benefited just to have a little bit more time for a little bit more back and forth along those lines there. And I get why it was an hour because there was only two of them but in a funny way it&#39;s like we&#39;ve been complaining about how little time everybody gets at the hour and a half debate two hour debates when there&#39;s five and when there&#39;s not we just divide the time in two like why wouldn&#39;t we have resolved the challenge we used to have yeah</div>

            <div class="said">yeah but this isn&#39;t necessarily just because you know of the performers it&#39;s not just because of the the method all you know like uh this is actually a deeper question and that is is the news consortium didn&#39;t want to lose an hour of primetime. They didn&#39;t want to lose Wheel of Fortune or whatever comes on at 7 o&#39;clock that advertisers pay for, and that&#39;s how they make their money. They&#39;re not making their money on airing a debate. There&#39;s no money in a debate, and two hours of a debate means they lose two hours of revenue.

It was frustrating for her and frustrating for me. But, you know, it&#39;s kind of, it was mostly forgotten. I think that the problem with the opening and the closing is that those are the opportunities to set what your actual agenda is going to be as you talk about it. I thought both of them were well written. But what I actually my problem is that there weren&#39;t enough stories and the story could have been so easily set up in the in the opening and closing.

That was the subtext of so much of what Smith was talking about today. You know, like your record was really horrible. when i&#39;m when i&#39;ve been premier for as long as you have my record will be so much better and she was kind of allowed to get away with that um so that positioning of this upstart that that um doesn&#39;t have the history that that that is is dogging um notley that that was good because it actually worked now again is it truthful not really but on the other hand she&#39;s only been been there for a few months um but a few months still a premier makes so we&#39;re you&#39;re she should have been more responsible also for kenny&#39;s fuck-ups um and you know she was allowed to slide on a lot of that yeah</div>

            <div class="said">well I think this does go back to the expectation game and I know an awful lot of people were watching it on both sides waiting and wanting a knockout blow and I think in particular there were NDP supporters who thought this is the moment this is where it&#39;s all going to unravel for Danielle Smith she&#39;s just going to be this wreck of a human being just falling apart under the hot lights. That was never going to happen. Danielle Smith is a stage performer. She knows how to hold herself together. That&#39;s just a reality of it here. But there&#39;s almost this letdown that you don&#39;t have the big dramatic moment. And in part, one of the reasons why people were conditioned to hope for and almost get to a point of expectation for the dramatic moment is that is so much part of the story of Rachel Notley&#39;s rise in the first place. And we talked about this last episode. But in 2015, you know, the math is hard line, which is actually math is difficult, I will say as a pedant. And</div>

            <div class="said">And that was such that debate, that debate was an elevating moment for Rachel Notley. And it was a really consequential moment in politics.

So all of the things that happened today are going to get tied up into the reporting of the debate. And there is no way that all those things don&#39;t color the outcome of the debate. So I think that by Tuesday, Wednesday, it looks like Notley won the debate. But realistically, and when we start to rewrite this history, I hope that we&#39;re not saying, saying, Ooh, you know, not least the best debate performer in the history of mankind. She wasn&#39;t in 2015. She wasn&#39;t in 2019. And she isn&#39;t in 2023.</div>

            <div class="said">Rachel really did struggle under the weight of some of the, of just the sheer volume of lies that Danielle put forward. I mean, I guess she expected Danielle to at least resort to some truth. So we struggled a bit with that. But as the fact checks come out over this weekend and as the you know, especially on that ethics commissioner report, I mean, we&#39;re really going to be seeing a whole bunch of change because people know that Danielle Smith, every word that came out of her mouth was a lie. And I think that that&#39;s ultimately the story that&#39;s going to be told. Isn&#39;t that the story you&#39;re going to tell? I mean, that&#39;s that seems to be the story that people want to hear is, you know, how how how come Danielle Smith could be so brazen? in the lies that she told.</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, I really want to underline that. The first thing to winning a debate after is to pick an angle and stick with it. Like, don&#39;t take this spaghetti approach of, well, maybe we&#39;ll say Rachel was the best. Maybe we&#39;ll say the problem was Danielle Smith was just able to lie. Well, because that doesn&#39;t really jive. So was she the best? Or did she lose because the person? You just got to sort of pick a lane. And so I think the angle of can&#39;t be trusted, that was a lie a minute, that was a wild time on a wild day is probably the NDP&#39;s best particular line. God, you could have a list of all of the lies as you see them. Like, I want to take a bit of a jaundiced look at this and say, there are some things that were outright lies. There were some things that are more natural kind of conventional truth stretches. stretches and by the way it&#39;s not as though rachel notley didn&#39;t stretch the truth with things like about her platform costing right but the preponderance for sure was on the the misstatements and the mistruths being on the on the ucp side so start with a list create a pop-up video of the whole debate of boop here&#39;s another lie that she said and here&#39;s the actual fact maybe that you release at some point on the weekend to share nobody&#39;s actually</div>

But by and large, most of that group will not have watched the debate in any kind of meaningful way, right? If they&#39;re persuadable, they&#39;re probably not that partisan.

It&#39;s the things they&#39;re seeing in the Calgary Herald. It&#39;s the things they&#39;re seeing on CTV. It&#39;s the things they&#39;re seeing on social media that will all kind of create a flavor of the debate. And there&#39;s a really fascinating phenomenon that you will note. Stephen has seen this too. Anybody who&#39;s worked in a party which has polling as to who won the debate will see this. You&#39;ll do a poll. Did you watch the debate? What did you think of the debate? You will always have like five times as many people claim they watched the debate as</div>

            <div class="said">as you know watched the debate and they all have opinions about it. And so the four times of the people who actually watched the debate, who are undecided, who are persuadable in suburban Calgary, that&#39;s what matters.

            <div class="said">Yeah. And the other thing is if you&#39;re doing three days of polling, if you&#39;re doing rolling polls which a lot of them will be doing at this stage um you will see one response on the first night another response on the second and the third night will be different again so this it it really does evolve over time um yeah</div>

            <div class="said">well part of why it evolves so much in in our context in alberta and canada is we don&#39;t have have by and large public dial groups like they do in the United States.

Before you go to bed that night, you&#39;ve seen how the dial groups react. So you know how, you know, the undecideds that were pulled together saw it. You see, you know, CNN</div>

So in this particular case, the debating partnership wasn&#39;t even. It was not set up for both partners to come at the same task at the same time. And that requires that you think on your feet and you do a counterpunch much faster than Rachel Notley did. Danielle Smith should have have been taken down a lot further and a lot faster by by only one person in this debate and as the that is rachel notley some people will look and say well we should have you know the moderator should have stepped in and all of that that&#39;s just not true uh rachel notley if if this debate does turn against notley it will be her issue it will be her people her people the people who prepared her uh and uh that&#39;s going to be tough for them to stomach if it goes back to smith um then it&#39;s just the baggage that she&#39;s carrying with her if if smith loses today it&#39;s not about today it&#39;s about the shit that happened before okay</div>

            <div class="said">yeah um you can have good quick or cheap choose two there&#39;s similar logic in a debate right and one of the things steven talked about was rachel notley maybe responding more directly to the charges that were there and she didn&#39;t by and large she just went to the lines that were clearly prepared. These were the messages she wanted to get out.</div>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn" data-start="4112">
            <div class="who">
              <span class="spk">Corey</span>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">That doesn&#39;t mean that was the wrong strategy. Stephen didn&#39;t get the responses he wanted, but I would argue they might have gotten the packaged clips that they wanted with the attacks on Danielle Smith. And the standout line in many ways for me was when the comments that were made about Danielle Smith arguing with herself. Frankly, it&#39;s exhausting, right? These were good lines, and she did manage to get them out here. So you have to make those trade-offs in your debate prep. Do you want to be loose and nimble and just react to what the other person says? Well, there&#39;s a school of thought that says, no, then you lose the ability to control the agenda. And again, you&#39;re not playing for the audience in the room. You&#39;re playing for the audience at home. What does your research tell you they need to hear? I have no doubt, just because of the way it was presented and the words I heard and how it was delivered, that the NDP had a very honed, very data-driven approach to making sure that the messages were put out that they wanted to put out. And probably they were assuming people would see this as much or more in packaging, at least the voters that they care about, those persuadable and suburban Calgary, as anything else here. so like don&#39;t be don&#39;t be i guess i would say whether you support the ucp or you support the ndp and you&#39;re critiquing this performance just remember that you don&#39;t have all of the data that they have and they&#39;re making decisions about the approaches that they want to take and part of why the different campaigns start to feel good and they can both feel they want is they have different goals with the campaign and we&#39;re going to see where everything lands it&#39;s one of the interesting things about the debate like we uh we get to see parts of it we get to participate in the aftermath aftermath, but you know, there&#39;s, there&#39;s a bigger game going on and the players know an awful lot about what&#39;s happening out there. The final thing I want to say is that, uh, you know, the power, when their club was founded in 1870, they had an awful lot of spirit. They had that South Australian spirit and that&#39;s why you should have picked them. And it should never have been a question. You know, they have carried that to their core, the pies, they know where they&#39;re going. They know what&#39;s happening.</div>
