And I would say these are charged, perhaps even editorial words on my part. There they are, as they relate to the war in Gaza. And now, Corey, he&#39;s considering his options. This is on the heels of that motion, that non-binding NDP motion we talked about last episode. We called it the status quo motion. Well, for Anthony Housefather, it is perhaps the last straw in in that sense. Corey, are</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">are we talking about floor crossings correctly? Like, you know, we talk about the intrigue, the excitement when someone says, I&#39;m going to cross the floor. In such polarized times, should we be looking at it through the same lens we were of perhaps yesteryear, where you were crossing from parties that may have had slight differences in policy or minor adjustments in how we looked at it, but maybe have, you know, seen the world in a similar way? Am I wrong? Was Was the past wrong? Why the fuck do we still care about this?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s an interesting question, because of course, certainly whenever somebody talks about crossing the floor in this day and age, I do immediately think about like, all of the things they&#39;ve probably said in the last 24 hours about what piles of garbage their opponents are. I do like to think that that&#39;s largely rhetoric, and they see their opponents as more human and nuanced than that. But it certainly feeds and fosters this general cynicism in politics. Now, Anthony Housefather did not see it as status quo. And to be fair, we gave a lot of head. Well, it sounds like it&#39;s status quo, but what else might be in there? There is some language in there that suggests there can be no arms sales to Israel. Now, I don&#39;t know what the material effects are, you know, of Canada selling arms or providing arms to Israel, but that seems to be the thing that has Housefather particularly incensed. You know, if your view, well, and listen, it&#39;s my view, Israel was attacked on October 7th. Certainly events have spiraled since there in many different directions, massive loss of life. But, you know, if that&#39;s the fundamental core, I can understand that that might be something that really affects you, and you might feel that that&#39;s a fundamental issue of fairness. And, um, well, I don&#39;t share Anthony Housefather&#39;s view at this particular matter. Um, yeah, I mean, I think it&#39;s, it&#39;s not entirely fair to suggest that he&#39;s leaving because of the status quo. I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say here. um</span>

And the reason I ask that is because he&#39;s made the rounds. He hasn&#39;t been accountability interviewed, really, right? You know, the furthest he&#39;s gotten, like, how much in contact are you with them? And he admits he&#39;s not in direct contact, but conservative friends. He&#39;s become the man of the hour. He&#39;s had his 15 minutes on this particular issue. And my question is really at the heart of, do we need to have an automatic cynicism to floor crossings? Corey?</span>

It&#39;s kind of the heart of my question. Carter&#39;s now exposing his bed to us, and he&#39;s in a near lie-flat position, which is a seat type that is not offered by our sponsor. They have upright like a broom, and that is it. And, Coach, Corey, back to you. Look,</span>

I just don&#39;t feel comfortable doing that at all. But if you want to talk about different floor crossings that have occurred in other jurisdictions and at other levels in the last bit, yeah, I absolutely look at them. And I think, okay, right, you know, often it happens to be in somebody who&#39;s a swing riding. I think if you want to talk about a moral floor crossing, you&#39;re probably looking for sort of, let&#39;s just say, there&#39;s certain signals that maybe this floor crossing is about more than getting elected. Like, if they were in, say, an NDP safe seat, and they&#39;ve decided to go to the conservatives, that&#39;s probably not a politically smart move for them. You know, that would be a more cynical floor crossing. Or sorry, a less cynical floor crossing. Less cynical. Yeah, right. And so I do think you&#39;ve got to sort of look at, would this actually be politically advantageous as sort of a first gate on whether you&#39;re assessing if a floor crossing is sincere or not?</span>

So I do think that this is a bit of a, This is a bit of a, hey, listen, you got to take me seriously and I&#39;m upset kind of conversation here. But if you are talking to him and you&#39;re saying, hey, here&#39;s how you manage things going forward, at the end of the day, he needs to be a liberal to be reelected in that riding. So if his interest is politics, he needs to be a liberal. If his interest is a bigger cause, if his interest is, I don&#39;t care, fuck all of that. I think this is morally wrong and I&#39;m upset. Well, then he will go to the conservatives or do something different. But if I was the conservatives, I just wouldn&#39;t trust them to be much of a team player at this point.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I do think Carter&#39;s onto something with a bit of almost like a Margaret Thatcher energy. This lady&#39;s not for turning, you know, like that&#39;s fine. They can try to scare me from doing the right thing that council needs to do, but I&#39;m going to keep doing it. And that seems to be a more obvious avenue. When we talked about this last time, I think we talked about contrition potentially being an avenue available to saying like, you know, I think, you know, it disappoints me that I&#39;ve let down people and that they&#39;re going to do this. And you have to make tough decisions in this job. And I want people at the end of four years to measure me based on the sum of those decisions, not based on, you know, whatever take back Alberta decides to put on the window today. And yeah, am I happy that there are people that are this animated in a negative way about my mayoralty? No, I&#39;m not. And I always strive to be better day after day, one foot after to the other. That&#39;s always been true. I strive for constant improvement. And I will always be reflecting on what I hear from people around me. But I got a job to do. And I&#39;m not going to be scared off doing that job, simply because, you know, some people don&#39;t want me to be doing this one.</span>

Would you lean into this respect element at all? Would you try to engineer or manufacture any of that as a counter narrative to what you&#39;re seeing? Would you add any,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, absolutely not. I mean, the only way you could do respect is you at least have to have respect for the office. But let&#39;s be honest, respect is earned, not assumed. And if there&#39;s some people who respect you, that&#39;s great. And if there&#39;s a lot of people who don&#39;t respect you and don&#39;t act with respect, then it is not for you to defend yourself. It is for others. And I&#39;m not talking about the white women painting the signs. I&#39;m talking about people standing up and saying, no, I&#39;m with Joe Tegandek. And I&#39;m not seeing a lot of people do that because there hasn&#39;t been the respect earned. So I wouldn&#39;t go into the respect element. I would just get back into the way to earn back the respect, Zane, is to do the job. And to do the job, we&#39;ve talked about how you have to reflect leadership or you have to reflect the will of the people sometimes. times and sometimes you have to lead. My thinking with Jyoti Gondek at this time is that her mayor&#39;s office needs to reflect the will of the people. And that&#39;s what she needs to be doing more than being angry or frustrated by the lack of respect being shown by, I suspect, a relatively small percentage of the Calgary population.</span>

I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t really have a problem with, you know, left-wing politics generally.

I mentioned that CBC interview over the lunch hour. CBC radio at noon also did like an hour on recall, which I know because I was on half of it. And it&#39;s just, it&#39;s the conversation in the city right now. Like this has really kind of seized the, you know, the discourse. And that&#39;s not great. Like when you&#39;re the mayor and everyone&#39;s talking for days and days on end about how people are coming to get you and how there&#39;s this recall effort against you the best you can say is it&#39;s an absolute distraction the worst is it&#39;s actually damaging your brand fairly badly and and all of a sudden you are so unpopular that tens of thousands of people are rising up even in this improbable recall environment to try to get rid of you so if</span>

I literally saw people with t-shirts, you know, in West Hillhurst, like at a community association trying to, like across the street, trying to like rally the troops for something like this.

It would be better if there was a sunshine component where the donors to the organization were posted. It would be better if the organizers weren&#39;t using essentially a useful idiot as their front guy. But that&#39;s not nefarious.</span>

And it doesn&#39;t require bogus fucking recall legislation that is stacked so high no one can actually do it. this is a bullshit piece of legislation that purports to to put democracy back in the hands of the people but really all it does is give people who are whiny little bitches some sort of opportunity to uh put you know to to make life miserable for people who&#39;ve stepped up to fucking serve if you don&#39;t like the person who&#39;s in office you know what i got a solution for you run you fucking lazy bastards run cory</span>

And because they want to run again, we will be able to hold them to account at that particular moment, particularly, particularly with nonpartisan elections like mayoral elections, where there&#39;s not like a party you can hold to account afterwards here. There&#39;s also the reality that sometimes people do deeply egregious things and need to be removed. And the decision to remove them, we can give it to a bunch of different groups, but the one that is the most democratic is to give it to the voters. So I repeat, recall should be possible, but it should be hard. And that is the system that we have.</span>

And that&#39;s fine. And that&#39;s good. And it&#39;s certainly not undemocratic, as I&#39;ve seen some people suggest. And for everybody complaining about the cost of a recall, let me introduce you to my friend, cost of a general election. Democracy costs money. Democracy is worth it. And we should be looking at ways that we can support and strengthen our democracy and reduce the cynicism and democracy of, oh, they&#39;re just going to do whatever the fuck they want. Well, they can&#39;t, because we can recall them. That&#39;s a good thing.</span>

Unfortunately, that&#39;s an opaque set of data that we don&#39;t get to see because it&#39;s hidden behind a nonprofit society that&#39;s not going to be reporting how much money they raised and from whom. So shady influencer groups get to come in and bring in all this money from places not even in Alberta necessarily. From organizations, not necessarily in Alberta, and it&#39;s unlimited dollars. Unlimited dollars to unseat a politician when you&#39;ve got limited dollars to actually manage the politician. Great</span>

I mean, that&#39;s just a reality. It&#39;s overrated if you think it&#39;s going to get rid of Mayor Gondek. But it&#39;s also underrated in the sense that this little experiment is likely to change our recall legislation. People have seen this. People have said the bar is both too high and too low. It is too low to sort of start the recall process. And it is too high to get to this next phase. Because one thing we haven&#39;t really talked about, the petition doesn&#39;t remove the mayor. The petition then forces a vote, where if a majority decide to vote that way, they can remove the mayor. So it seems like just a thing, but it&#39;s not just a thing. It&#39;s a thing that is going to change the legislation going forward, I believe, because they&#39;ve already said they&#39;re going to bring in adjustments to recall as a result of our experience here and the experiences of other municipalities.</span>
