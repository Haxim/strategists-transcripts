But does anybody think that there was going to be this big Joyce Murray faction, this counterinsurgency against Justin Trudeau? That&#39;s just not realistic. That&#39;s not practical.

Like all of a sudden, a finance minister is the deputy prime minister in anything but name. The guy has to pick a pair of shoes in a clever fashion to make a point and then make a speech. The job is to sell the budget. In a situation like this where we&#39;re not having to pour through line items and say, my God, how are we going to balance, a la Paul Martin, who do you really need as finance minister? I think Treasury Board is a much more important position in this case.</span>

So give me your grade. And I&#39;m not trying to put a thumb on the scale by giving that comment. Well, you kind of did. But I&#39;m pointing out the fact in a sense.

You had Joe Sisi, social worker, sure, but elected official. What&#39;s happened is the liberals have decided the elected official thing&#39;s not their problem. They&#39;re not worried about political expertise. They&#39;re worried about expertise, expertise, and they went the other way on that.
