Look, I mean, you can look back and you can say, did Stéphane Dion err by putting Michael Ignatieff in such a prominent position in his shadow cabinet? Okay, that&#39;s legitimate. But does anybody think that there was going to be this big Joyce Murray faction, this counterinsurgency against Justin Trudeau? That&#39;s just not realistic. That&#39;s not practical. Either there was a lot of bad blood that came out of that. And, you know, maybe there was because this looked like it was a coronation and these guys decided to stay in anyhow, right? Right. Or</div>

The job is to sell the budget. In a situation like this where we&#39;re not having to pour through line items and say, my God, how are we going to balance, a la Paul Martin, who do you really need as finance minister? I think Treasury Board is a much more important position in this case.</div>
