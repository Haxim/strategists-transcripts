            <span class="text">you did it it all right zane&#39;s drinking from his bottle okay guys news today all week news has been happening i&#39;m going to start with the most recent news uh a topic that is near and dear to your heart the alberta pension plan um today province announced they are pausing consultations including in-person town halls on the app why are they pausing them they&#39;re waiting until the feds give them the number of the share of assets and then they can continue on with the consultations So the province is saying this comes as the panel has consulted more than 76,000 Albertans in five telephone town hall sessions.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">And yeah, there&#39;s a pause. Corey, did you see this coming?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know if I saw it coming at this particular moment. It probably makes sense before they go into these in-person town halls and get absolutely crushed and get the visuals of being absolutely crushed, right? It makes sense for them to retreat at this particular moment, at least for the time being.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">One of the things that did surprise me was that in announcing this pause, Jim Denning was saying that half of the people they&#39;ve talked to were opposed with about 20 to 25% supportive. Here&#39;s the thing. When you say 20 to 25%, you mean 20% in that particular instance. And when you say about half, you mean a little more than half. So this thing is just getting crushed, even in the channels that the government controls, even the channels that heavily have their thumb on the scale. People who are engaged are engaged in a way against it. And so they had to do something. They had to shake out of this. And one of the things they&#39;re getting killed on is that nobody believes their fantasy numbers. So we&#39;ve talked a bit about this. But their best chance to get this back on the rails, if they want an Alberta pension plan, their best chance is</span>

Because if you follow Corey&#39;s logic, the real number is the best way that they actually boost support. support you ultimately don&#39;t want them to boost support for the app you actually don&#39;t want to give them any sort of political lifeline when it looks like they&#39;re already hanging so and frankly from a pure policy perspective if you don&#39;t want them to leave don&#39;t give them a you know a real number delay that as much as it can before this thing dies on its own so that&#39;s my instinct is that you you just don&#39;t play ball why why fucking play ball uh with them this is this is perhaps perhaps, helpful to you in your own way as the federal liberals where you are looking for your own political lifeline of finding something that the vast majority of folks are on your side on and looking to hit Alberta with. So don&#39;t give them a number.</span>

Hey, feds, where&#39;s the number? They say, like, we&#39;re still waiting. Hey, province, what&#39;s happening? we&#39;re waiting for the feds like how long can that reasonably go on for well</span>

            <span class="text">well it can&#39;t go on very long if all they do is have it live in kind of the actuarial world of the finance department in ottawa um they would need to somewhat expand it and say like oh you know there&#39;s some ambiguity we need to consult with the provinces so we&#39;ve set a series of meetings for march april may um that&#39;s as soon as everybody could sort of get their calendars together based on those meetings we&#39;re going to have to do some stuff that&#39;s going to take us june july august we think in september after a final round of consultations to make sure we&#39;ve reconciled everybody&#39;s views those might bleed into october then we&#39;ll probably be in a position by maybe november to give a bit of a number on here however that number we want to be really sure on so we might also go to the courts for a reference once we have yes see if they agree with our interpretation that&#39;s</span>

That&#39;ll be just in time for you to have that number for your referendums attached to the municipal elections, right, Alberta? So that should be a timeline that works for everybody there. Nobody loses any time. And that means that the province doesn&#39;t have like a year to respond to the number. So I guess, I mean, like, I could see a world where that&#39;s possible that might be pushing it for a bunch of reasons but um you know it&#39;s actually if you break out the steps probably not the most outrageous timeline either the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the question though is if you really want to be dealing with that problem for that length of time now i would argue if you&#39;re a cppib that might actually and they&#39;re not the ones who get to make this call the government be the finance department right</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um it&#39;s it&#39;s okay right it&#39;s it&#39;s not gonna you don&#39;t really want to be fighting this for two years with the government of alberta out consulting and try to change all of these things but there is a universe where you are the liberals and you say i want to resolve this before the next election and because i want to resolve this for the next election we&#39;re going to give them a number quick we&#39;re going to hope that that the numbers still show that Albertans are very opposed to this, or perhaps even more so once the number is out, and then we can all move on with our lives, right? So there is a bit of a risk-reward argument probably to be made, you know, some game theory going on in terms of maybe it&#39;s a little bit riskier to give them a number early, but the payout could be this gets resolved very fast. Before the next election, we don&#39;t have this over our heads.</span>

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know if you do have that opportunity to, like, get it done relatively quickly. I mean, to me, I almost have the opposite instinct of Corey, which is that this is not a terrible election issue for you if you&#39;re heading to the polls soon thereafter in October, which is that you make this a conversation about a province trying to screw the rest of the country out of their pension. This is not so much on Alberta beating down on Ottawa as much as Alberta beating down on the rest of the country. And to me, that frame is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">as useful to them is because I really don&#39;t know what else the liberals can win their next election on. Unless they&#39;re looking to forge together a coalition on climate, which we could discuss the cap shortly, they&#39;re going to have to have events happen and have a series of things that can generate more momentum and aren&#39;t already capped out in terms of their political advantage for them based on either polling. So to me, there is a there is a school of thought to say that Corey&#39;s timeline, while it does make sense, and I&#39;m glad he added the court aspect to it, because I suspect they&#39;re going to if they want to drag their heels on it further, depending on where they want to land the plane before or after, or for during this election campaign, so to speak, for them, I talk about federally, all things going planned for for the next federal election in 25. five, then I do see some advantageous value of a political campaign that liberals run that is based on broader unity, that is based on keeping the country together, that is based on, you know, what conservatism in action looks like, look at Danielle Smith and what she&#39;s trying to do to fuck all of you over, alongside Pierre Polyev. I mean, it&#39;s not a great argument, but it&#39;s better than most of the other ones available to them on the table right now.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right now so you might as well you might as well take this off the table uh and once again when we speak about motivations we actually fundamentally don&#39;t know the motivation here like we we have ideas like all of us like posit ideas around what her motivation is is it just that this was something along the tracks and she just wanted to see it to completion is the right flank of her base pushing it does she actually in her bones want this thing to happen there&#39;s a lot of speculations this is rob anderson another one of the grand ideas that stitches together their overarching philosophy of the Alberta universe. Who knows, right? A bit of all, maybe, sure. One of them deeply, possibly, right? Okay. But if this is something that you&#39;re okay to get rid of, if getting rid of this is on the table, of political options being like, fuck it, it didn&#39;t work, early is good, right? And you&#39;ve also got other victories in your broader sort of frame against the feds that can still keep keep that narrative track going. So you don&#39;t really, if this is being viewed through the lens of shit that we&#39;re blaming the feds for, in its broadest terms, you already got multiple proof points in that bucket. You actually don&#39;t need another one from pure rhetoric. Let&#39;s park policy for a second. From a pure rhetorical perspective, there&#39;s diminishing returns to add APP to that list, because you already have other things that are active for you. And you&#39;ve also had some victories with the courts coming back to you and saying, you know what, you know, you might be be right. So she&#39;s probably adding things like the Sovereignty Act and others in that sort of bucket of things we&#39;re going to fuck the feds over with. You don&#39;t need this from a rhetorical perspective. And if it&#39;s a policy loser, and getting rid of it is one of the options on the table, you know, once again, I&#39;ll make mention of speculation around how deep in her bones this is, then you lose it early, lose a little bit less early, which is what I&#39;d add to Corey&#39;s point.</span>

            <span class="text">haven&#39;t confirmed, but I&#39;ll tell you, I think there&#39;s been a pause on ads for at least a week, week or two. And one of the reasons is one of the ads that they ran fairly regularly, it was about the survey and I&#39;d reply to it with some snarky comment. It doesn&#39;t really matter what, but whenever they were running ads every now and then I would just get another random like to this thing because of course they&#39;re pushing it up and it was one of the top comments underneath.

They&#39;ve had Dinning say it&#39;s simply a consultation, not a persuasion exercise. exercise. They&#39;ve had Daniel Smith say this is multiple years away. They&#39;ve had her telegraph this fact that we&#39;re just finding ourselves in right now, which is the fact that we&#39;re not going to do anything without a number months ago. So they&#39;ve built in natural political off-ramps to this thing, right? But once again, this kind of comes back to the core question of motivation. How much political capital is she going to spend on pushing this through and making this a reality? The fact is, when they jam through a bill that says this has to go to a referendum, non-binding, as the legislation dictates, to me, it suggests, and this is a huge assumption, that this was something that they want to try, want to try early, see if they&#39;ve got the political capital that they don&#39;t have to necessarily burn to spend and try to push it through if they can. If it isn&#39;t there, they get rid of it. And I think the timing on them, I would suggest the timing isn&#39;t an accident, because number</span>

Like the usage of the Sovereignty Act as a rhetorical tool, despite the fact it&#39;s an unconstitutional piece of shit, actually kind of makes sense now in some way, weird, twisted, pretzel-y way. You then add the two sort of court victories sort of thing. You know, there&#39;s some Ws that you&#39;ve had. So killing this thing while kind of still maximizing on the federal fight and keeping the rhetorical channel amped up to 11 is not a terrible idea, if this was fundamentally about, you know, getting rid of this thing or minimizing its scars that it would give to you as a government.</span>

            <span class="text">know one of the things about ads even if they&#39;re like in support of you is they can also entrench public opinion right because there is this sense that you just you reject the message and you get angrier about it as you see it and i&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what&#39;s happened in this case but they might have started to say we&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;re not moving anything perhaps they even saw opinions getting firmer and they said okay we better stop and we better regroup and we better rethink our approaches here and if they were doing their jobs they were probably identifying why people had challenges with things and i suspect they were and i suspect what they found was ultimately the number was too big a hurdle for many many people right maybe those same people would have had other reasons they would have complained or not liked it but the number was the thing people were sticking on so they said well let&#39;s let&#39;s maybe reassess let&#39;s maybe reconsider maybe the fact that our ads were running so much that said a pension could provide this what you know could people were often noting was doing a hell of a lift uh because we just didn&#39;t know the world and so maybe they just felt they needed to get into a place of more concreteness and and that the ads were just entrenching people on one view because they weren&#39;t able to provide what people wanted so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">think secretly like industry is gonna be like fine with this if not even like celebratory that it&#39;s not as onerous or that it&#39;s actually like i think one of the most interesting things is that it&#39;s not a carbon price it&#39;s this cap and trade system right so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so i think that&#39;s where they might be at their external voice is clearly more like muted we&#39;ll see what what they&#39;re, you know, you&#39;ll see where Pathways comes out next week and how aggressive they are, for example. Clearly, you&#39;ve got the premier of the province being the most, like, rhetorically extreme, like, out, like, outright winging the corporations in terms of, like, what&#39;s justifiable. But the fact is that many of these oil and gas companies have said kind of the ballpark of where these regulations have, or this framework has landed is doable. So, you know, know, for them, they&#39;re going to never be, they might be happy, but they&#39;ll say that they won&#39;t. For the Premier, she&#39;s never going to be happy. The question I have is, is where does the larger environmental movement kind of fit on this? I suspect that they have right-sized their expectations with this new version of the Trudeau government post-pandemic and what it means and the political pressures that they face. So, you know, this is not as ambitious as many of the environmental groups wanted it to be. But it seems like, from what I&#39;m seeing, either they&#39;re muted and are waiting to unload unload their response next week and take some time but from what i&#39;ve heard it seems like from for them this is fine so but the fact is pleasing everyone this political environment definitely not possible cory</span>

We have a carbon tax. The whole idea is we&#39;re supposed to have this market force where people will look to reduce the price or, you know, their activity that produces carbon based on that price mechanism. But now we also have this ceiling and we&#39;re trying to work these two systems together. There are some disparities between provinces. It&#39;s all gotten just</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">ideal solution is. This to me seems like one of the, okay, let&#39;s like right size this with the cost of living or the fact that we&#39;ve fucked ourselves on the carbon tax. So that&#39;s not every time we mentioned that word anymore, we&#39;re just going to have another all nighter debate findings that let&#39;s just do it this or whatever. Like, I feel like they&#39;ve kind of like thrown in the towel from a pure sort of like, here&#39;s what we can do with the power of government, and have now really leaned into the here&#39;s just what&#39;s possible in the moment. And I feel like to me, to be honest, like as reductive and as dismissive as I sound, that may not actually be too far from the truth in terms of like how a policy like this finds itself. Like, I feel like if they had not done the carve out on carbon tax, that would still very much be the system that we could have seen if it wasn&#39;t just so politically toxic right now in this moment.</span>

            <span class="text">Secondly, I think that different ministers in this government are trying to carve out different legacies for themselves as they see a sinking ship. So for Gilbo to announce this at COP like he did, maybe it was always part of the plan, but I think it especially became part of the plan as he defines who he is in the broader sort of climate movement. Going forward, you see different ministers, different folks in this government trying to figure out what their next gig is. And I don&#39;t mean that directly. I mean that indirectly about how they&#39;re positioning certain things, running victory laps on certain wins, becoming even more clip chasing and how they&#39;re trying to present themselves. I feel like that&#39;s also going on. None of these are great signs, but I feel like they&#39;re kind of sub to a broader point that they&#39;re just trying to survive and find their footing before they have an opportunity to even take a shot at thriving or figuring out what&#39;s next. next.</span>

            <span class="text">Jesus, really dangerous. One of the things that I&#39;ll often tell people is never mistake action for direction, right? Like there&#39;s this desire when you know that your back is against the wall, that you&#39;re going to get clobbered the next day the person you&#39;re going to talk to is going to give it to you just to do stuff right like just to show your acting just to get out there and and put something out there right but that&#39;s that&#39;s usually the the thing that precedes your demise because you&#39;re no longer being strategic you&#39;re no longer being thoughtful and you&#39;re no longer trying to tell a story which is ultimately what this business is about this business of politics it&#39;s telling a story and yeah i guess i can squint and say it&#39;s about i wouldn&#39;t even say art of the possible but they&#39;re doing things on climate right like clearly they want to be able to say we&#39;re doing things in this particular area but that&#39;s not enough and i think that the more they make it inexplicable to people like god it&#39;s hard enough with the carbon tax to say yeah we&#39;re taking money we&#39;re giving it back to you but this will still affect behavior because of these price mechanisms and all of this right now we&#39;re saying oh but we also have this system that will also limit how much carbon can be and you can trade it and you can offset it and all of the things that just make it inscrutable to the the average voter. And it just starts to feel like, what the fuck&#39;s going on here? How is this going to work? If I run a business, I&#39;m probably just frustrated and confused, even if it doesn&#39;t really affect me, because I&#39;m worried it might affect me, because I don&#39;t understand this bloody system that the government&#39;s brought in. So, you know, I think it&#39;s really, really dangerous, to your point. They&#39;ve got to step back, and they&#39;ve got to say, okay, it&#39;s election day, it&#39;s 2025. We are trying to tell them the story of what the liberals have been, and what we&#39;re going to be going forward and that includes these three components and here&#39;s all of the activity we&#39;ve done in the last three years that tell that story and reinforce it and reinforce our brand versus the brand that pierre polliev has tried to create here setting up those ballot questions we talk about it they&#39;ve got time to do it still do they they&#39;re in a hell of a hole oh well look they&#39;re in a hell of a hole but governments have come back from holes like this dalton mcginty uh Christy Clark immediately come to mind on the provincial level.</span>

Have they taken all the daggers that have been effectively hurting them for the last number of months, including on things like housing and the carbon tax itself and removed all those objections, they need to get back to neutral before they figure out actually how much runway they have. I think that&#39;s part of it, right? It&#39;s like, as you try to survive, you need to kind of like find a territory to be like, okay, like we now have used to be two years, 16 months, 12 months, eight months, but like they&#39;re slowly running out of time. It may seem like two years. It&#39;s not two years. You need to get out of a hole and then figure out how to equalize. And then from there, figure out how to have some sort of advantage that maybe if you&#39;re Christy Clark, surprises everyone and peaks on election day.

The other way to look at that is that people have only gotten one side of the argument on who Pierre-Paul Lievre is, so you have some opportunity on the negative. But Corey makes a good point. Like, I called it the art of the possible. you could call it just saying conflating action with progress. But we see that with tired governments. We see that with tired people, right?

            <span class="text">here&#39;s the thing you know what i worry about i worry about three things for the liberals in in the in in this order number one with the third being the most important in my mind number one their communications communications policy to policy. We&#39;ve talked about their inability to have their rhetoric or their story from policy to policy, action to action tie together. Number two, I am worried about, as we&#39;ve talked about, what they&#39;re going to run the next election on or what suite of issues they&#39;re going to run the next election on that is going to be a winner. I mean, climate is still available to them. Like, if you still poll this particular sort of emissions conversation in places they need to win, it is a winner. But can they ultimately make it supersede other things that also seem to be a winner, but are not in their current sort of strengths, natural strengths, so to speak? Housing should have been a natural strength. I think they&#39;ve given that one up months ago, just by fungally inaction and Polyev just snatching it away for them, to be honest. They had the power of government, they had the pandemic, they had the ability to spend, they had the ability to both tell a story policy-wise and actually spend government money on fixing and putting putting housing on a trajectory. Polly has just taken that away from you. And we&#39;ve talked about that. But you know what I have a larger issue with beyond those two things is I&#39;m actually fundamentally concerned because that they&#39;re going to actually land on a suite of issues. They&#39;ll get better on the policy communications, that they&#39;re actually going to have political opportunity and figure out what they want to run the election on. But their inability to tell a cohesive story, the top line story, the visionary story without without being so technocratic that they&#39;ve been like over the last three to four years, that&#39;s my biggest concern, that they&#39;re not able to stitch together one policy to the next. They&#39;re not able to cross stitch environment to housing, to economy, to you as a person, to your pocketbook. My concern is that they&#39;re going to get better at what they need to get better on, but it&#39;s not going to be enough because they&#39;ve lost their core muscle of telling us any any sort of story that matters or resonates with us about this place, this country, my place in it, in this country, my life, my children&#39;s life in a meaningful way, what I am for, vision-related stuff. And that sounds simple, like, oh, why can&#39;t they just stitch together 15 different things and put a 30-second elevator speech together? But Corey and I will both attest, and I&#39;m sure you can too, Annalise, as a communicator, that&#39;s sometimes the hardest stuff and takes the most amount of skill. So I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">think with their recent hires, perhaps if they get a bit of a break, as Polyev starts getting defined on perhaps some less sort of charitable terms, they&#39;ll get better and they&#39;ll find their lane on what a good election issue is or series of issues is, they&#39;ll be better at the comms. But I think my biggest concern is that they don&#39;t have the big vision storytelling ability that I think they will need.</span>

            <span class="text">no no no no no no no no i guess what i&#39;m saying is like they should probably be looking at the last time they were and you can make the argument so here&#39;s my theory of 2015 and look it&#39;s been a long time since the 2015 election but poll after poll after poll showed that canadians wanted to change it was a change election and stephen harper went into that election not leading right uh i i depending on when you want to sort of count when the election began.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">All kicked off. It was Mulcair in the lead, and then it was, you know, for a while. But his whole path to victory for Stephen Harper was to keep the liberals and the NDP somewhat balanced, right? You couldn&#39;t have one too hard ahead of the other. And so he tried to calibrate his actions to make sure that they wouldn&#39;t support one party over the other very much, right? And he was actually fairly consistent at maintaining that balance until the first French language debate.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then things got a little bit weird. And there There was, you know, there was all sorts of, like, look, you can get into it, you can talk about what moved it or not, but ultimately, inexplicably, the Liberals, well, not inexplicably, it was a lot of hard work by a lot of people, but the Liberals presented themselves as a party of change, real change. The party that governed Canada for 70 of the last 100 years at that time became the Change Party somehow. And they did that on a platform full of things that were changed, things like promising there was going to be electoral reform. The way they approached various topics was very different. And meanwhile, you had Tom Mulcair trying to look like the establishment because</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because he wanted to show that you can trust the NDP. And I think ultimately that might have been a tactical mistake. But nonetheless, everybody is kind of balanced until ultimately the Liberals got a little bit of daylight ahead of the NDP. You can argue why. And Canadians collectively said, well, if we want change, they seem to be the party that&#39;s best positioned to give it. And then the Liberals won.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And I don&#39;t think anything I&#39;ve just described was a lucky accident for the Liberals. I think that they worked really hard to get themselves in that position.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But it was a cohesive story that was backed by a bunch of points. And they&#39;re just in a different place now, right? They&#39;re in a different place for a bunch of reasons. Their promises have changed now. First of all, we&#39;re back in a change election, but now they&#39;re the government. Second of all, any promises have changed by them.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This is what happens. And so they just don&#39;t have that available to them at this particular moment. They&#39;re going to have to find a different path.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they&#39;ve got to pick a path. They just can&#39;t run the path they did before. And I&#39;ll just say like kind of as a bit of a wrap on this rambling here, political parties get to government by communicating like political parties.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But then they start communicating like governments, and they lose government. It is the way of things in communications here. They start to be too nuanced, they start to be too hedgy, they start to be too dense. And the liberals are very much in that. Oh,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, they&#39;ve experienced the limitations of government as much as they&#39;ve experienced the power. What&#39;s funny about government is that you&#39;ve got all the possibility, because you literally control the purse strings, you control the power, you have the ability to do real things. But you also, I think it&#39;s part of like the human psychology, also remember and are guarded by the limitations. And the limitations of running as a political party or opposition are never really imposed upon you. That hasn&#39;t tasted what power looks like. You have your imagination runs wild. You have an ability to talk about things. But you often see governments, especially running to be reelected for successive terms, are generally doing expansion pacts on what&#39;s already worked, right? Modest expansion pacts on, you know, maybe a bit more of this and a bit more of that, but the track remains the same. And I think for the liberals that they&#39;re going to have to grind a victory out should they be in a position to even be competitive this next election. But it is going to take some sort of story. And I&#39;m not talking just purely positive, aspirational, visionary story, like, without having the sharp, crisp attack on the other side against the other guy. But they don&#39;t have that muscle right now, Corey.</span>

Gondek did. She spoke to media. Conservative MPs put out a statement. Calgary Jewish Foundation, several others. Like lots of people had statements, had opinions. There&#39;s been a lot of columns about this. Again, lightning round. I don&#39;t want to get super in the weeds. I think there are many higher level kind of strategy and comms questions on this one.

You were the mayor of the city, after all. You can make that statement. I think there&#39;d be many people celebrating. I think there&#39;d be many people not celebrating you, but there&#39;d be clarity. If your intention was to actually fundamentally change</span>

If you still want to have it at City Hall, I&#39;m really uncomfortable with this one particular tenant. For example, I&#39;m uncomfortable with the sale of Israel bonds, so to speak. I know it&#39;s happened in the past. We live in a different political time. If you could remove that, I&#39;ll be there. I&#39;m happy to be there, etc. etc.</span>

            <span class="text">Third option would have been to show up at the event and make some of the comments that she did in the spirit of bridge building, whatever, in her letter on site. I think all three of those, and fourth option, just not show up, right? Just not show up, sort of thing. I would once again ask her what the political goal is, because it&#39;s a little bit muddied, I think, so to speak, for me in terms of trying to dissect it. I got a sense of it, and I believe I have a sense of sympathy around it, especially around ceasefire, as we&#39;ve talked about on this show, especially around uh not not you know uh fully supporting um uh the the the stance that the israel government is saying but i think the conflation here doesn&#39;t help the fact that the goals seem you know uh conflating both the israel and and and um the the jewish people of calgary uh they would argue that that that she would argue potentially that the event did that she didn&#39;t do that but once again i think the fact is that leadership here um could be um perhaps flexed in a few different ways i I have a lot of sympathy for the mayor, to be totally honest, around what she tried to do. I just don&#39;t know if she was able to land the plane with a clear set of goals here.</span>

Nobody gets to entirely own and define, including the organizers for any particular year. And I think that&#39;s an important point. So this all hinged on a poster that said support Israel on it, which got the mayor to say, well, I&#39;m not going to show up. Well, the reality is, it&#39;s</span>

It is not an event that is about supporting Israel, you can show up and you can make the event what you want to make it. And nobody can really stop you from doing that, because there&#39;s an inertia to that event well beyond what anybody decides to put on a particular poster. So I think Zane&#39;s point is a good one. Like you could have shown up and you could have made whatever comments you want about like the spirit of, I don&#39;t know, the spirit of Hanukkah, but like how you&#39;re hoping for peace and that there&#39;s, you know, there&#39;s be no more deaths of any innocents anywhere.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and and the point there is you know like hey if you wanted to ask for a ceasefire and and you know we&#39;ve been as a collective group uh marching on the streets for weeks now, please feel free to join us, right? If that was your goal, like I&#39;m trying to, I&#39;m being crass to make a point, right? Like if that was what you wanted to communicate, this letter was not the way to do it. And so, you know, you&#39;re able to do that. But let me take it out of this particular context. What I have been struggling with and probably even struck with, it very much is in line with Corey&#39;s concept of like making things small, this concept of smoothing things over, making people feel that even if the delta is big, that it actually is surmountable, that it is actually more common ground, etc. That as a political tool skill, unbelievably</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">unbelievably underrated political skill,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right? Like unbelievably underrated for people to have this skill of just people making feel like they&#39;re heard, and that the cleavages are smaller. But I also I&#39;ve been even struggling with this concept of power. And I think this this like notion that that many in leadership positions have perhaps a wealth of experience, academic, maybe even lived around what leadership looks like, very few have been able to fully understand what power is and how to use it. And I think we&#39;ve often thought of power as like, to Corey&#39;s point, the loud voice, the like, let me put up a statement here because I can, versus the soft voice, versus the phone call, versus the behind the scenes, underneath the sort of, you know, using the cliched, uh you know iceberg example the things we never see and i think this concept of power of of being able to persuade of being able to change tweak torque um just through a couple of words phone calls etc that if you fully experienced it and seen how it&#39;s done is its real use of power and i wonder that and and and this is now me getting into speculative territory and i will for a second, because this is actually a concept I&#39;ve struggled well beyond with, even this mayor, that those who have historically not had access to power, perhaps racialized people, perhaps women, perhaps folks that have been in minority communities, have perhaps a cliche understanding of what power is. And once again, I&#39;m not charging this to the mayor, I&#39;m just kind of making this broader concept. I struggle with this, right? Having an ability to chair a few organizations and boards fully trying to appreciate, you know, owning up to what power looks like, like how to use it appropriately, when to use it, when not to use it. And to me, there&#39;s this broader conversation that is just so worthy having around the delta between leadership and what using power in pure political circumstances actually means versus its cliche of what we think it means or versus its caricature of what we think it means. And I think to me, the ability to avoid issues as much as confronting them is power in its own right, so to speak. So it&#39;s a really interesting case study. I, you know, and personally, I have a lot of sympathy for what the mayor was trying to do and trying to say. I just think that it opened up a world of hurt, unfortunately, that is now maybe going to haunt her for at least a little bit here. And hopefully there&#39;s some course correction that can be done.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, it&#39;s part of our political culture. I guess I&#39;d start there. And in the broadest sense, we look at things like Mr. Smith goes to Washington, this idea of the filibuster, the idea of somebody standing up to a government off the rails and, and doing the thing that&#39;s inconvenient and our system allowing those voices to be heard, right? Not just about the majority, but it&#39;s about making sure that everybody can be represented and taking the bold stand. And frankly, it&#39;s beyond our political culture. It&#39;s kind of just our culture, like the idea of like, you see it everywhere. You see it in the movie 300. You see the idea of the doomed stand against the thing that you perceive as tyranny, right? That&#39;s just people like to see that sometimes. times so on on one hand i&#39;m like yeah why not it&#39;s what always happens it is kind of the theater of politics it&#39;s it makes sense that you would be trying to write yourself as a movie character in these particular moments so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the kind of like cultural lens on it the operational lens the old bureaucrat is like what the fuck is the point of all of this right what a waste of time we&#39;ve got real problems in the world that we need to be wasting our time on all of these agenda items that are just not particularly compelling, like 135 amendments. There&#39;s other things people could be doing. And let&#39;s be clear, he does not have the ability to sort of drag everything through the Christmas season. He can drag them to Friday night. That&#39;s the most he can manage to do under our particular system. So exhausting. But when I try to reconcile those to it&#39;s like whatever it&#39;s a day and a half it&#39;s politics it is what it is it&#39;s dumb politics is sometimes dumb and that&#39;s just my bottom line on it here so but i will say maybe</span>
