          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">We did bring them to Dave. I want to talk more about that. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find a way to shoehorn it into this podcast. But let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. our first segment i see dead people uh cory steven oh let&#39;s ouch it&#39;s what is it two on the nose is it two on the nose that we have a picture of 25 people in the rose garden and mathematically if the circle is large enough that at least one of them might die cory uh let&#39;s talk about this because you&#39;re right where we had trump&#39;s tax returns last week and uh you know in between Between that, we had a debate, let&#39;s not forget about that, that we covered on You the People, a chaotic, insane debate. And now Donald Trump is diagnosed with COVID. So many ramifications, political, policy, governance. But let&#39;s start here. And Stephen, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first. Where is Trump getting COVID landing for you? How is that registering for you? Where are you kind of sitting on the dial right now in terms of what that kind of feels? Are you enraged? Are you upset? sets are you just like yelling at him for hypocrisy i just want to kind of know where you&#39;re at with this before we jump into all the political stuff that we usually get into i</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i i&#39;m actually at the what&#39;s next stage like it&#39;s it it just moves on it&#39;s you know like the leaked tax returns were so big right and uh you know everything everything that has happened along the way is so huge and now we&#39;re like the debate the debate was a gong show right like it it was horrible and and it&#39;s like it never happened it&#39;s like it never happened at all and i&#39;m focused 24</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">who the next republican is that&#39;s going to get diagnosed with with covid um you know how many of them have comorbidities i mean almost all of them do i mean chris christie i mean good god God, man. And how is Rudy Giuliani not gotten it? But, you know, these are the things that I&#39;m watching. This is this is the biggest thing that has happened this season of let&#39;s elect a president. And I can&#39;t imagine anything topping it. But we&#39;re still 30 days away from the finale. So you got to know that they&#39;re going to ramp it up. And this is actually how I&#39;m feeling. I feel like something</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">something else has to drop because this is what has happened. Every three days there is something new. And, you know, we&#39;ve talked about it in the podcast a whole bunch. I&#39;ve said the only way that Trump gets out of a negative news cycle is starting a new negative news cycle. How does he like this has to be a thing because recovery isn&#39;t necessarily complete. Right. Like I&#39;m in the pool. I&#39;m officially predicting that Donald Trump will not die. He&#39;s going to survive this. So what does that mean in the future? Right. What does that mean? Well, now it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">You guys got to stop making it out like every prediction I make is not true. It&#39;s not. He&#39;s going to survive this. I&#39;ve said it. Write it down. Write it down, as I&#39;ve said many times.</span>

            <span class="text">We will hold your feet to the fire if you&#39;re wrong, by the way, just to let you know. We&#39;ll do an entire episode on that. There&#39;s no way.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You know what&#39;s interesting, Carter? You&#39;re talking about this in reality television terms. Have you finally bought into the fact that this is like election 2020 produced by Mark Burnett? Like, have you actually bought in that this is this is how what you&#39;re what we&#39;re going to be witnessing? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s be honest. I mean, elections for quite some time have been many reality television shows where, you know, the media play their role. The candidates each play their role and the voter watches it with some sort of entertainment,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">entertainment, benign entertainment value. I think, you know, it&#39;s not very exciting, but they watch it anyways because, you know, people could hurt each other. this is totally different this is real reality tv it is entertaining it has uh life and death stakes in a way that we&#39;ve never seen you know like you know the survivor episode that ends with someone stepping on a jellyfish will he or she make it i mean that&#39;s where we are right now donald trump stepped on the jellyfish and now we&#39;re wondering will he or will he not make it and what happens then i mean who&#39;s not following this who&#39;s not interested in this who doesn&#39;t think this is the best reality television that Mark Burnett has ever produced, because that&#39;s what it feels like. It doesn&#39;t have anything vaguely resembling normal ebbs and flows of electoral politics. The debate was a great example. And now this COVID diagnosis, also a great example. This is not real. This is reality television.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, same question to you that I asked Carter, where have you landed? Because like, just before we get into the ramifications of the political strategy. Where have you landed on Trump getting COVID? Are you like, like I teed up with Carter enraged? Are you are you pissed off at his hypocrisy? Are you? Are you kind of feeling bad for the guy? Where do you kind of land so far?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, no, look, my first reaction was schadenfreude. I was I was feeling like good this this guy sort of deserves it. And I knew I should feel bad about a human being getting sick. But if I&#39;m being honest, I didn&#39;t feel bad that he was being sick i think he&#39;s a monster and i think he has wrecked a lot of lives and he&#39;s resulted in a lot of people dying and he&#39;s kind of threatened the very fabric of our society but you know as it&#39;s gone on my my kind of you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know schadenfreude has been sort of replaced with incredulity um this this is managed in just the most bizarre way a way that&#39;s left me just exhausted every day they tell us he&#39;s great and doing better than the day before when he had problems x y and z except</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">every day it&#39;s the first time we&#39;re hearing about the problems the day before and the day before they told us he was doing great so it becomes basically impossible to know what is real right now i don&#39;t even trust so he went on a little joy ride in his car i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ll talk about that but i don&#39;t even trust that he was feeling better than like none of what they&#39;re telling us is adding up, as many, many physicians have noted. And at this point, I think that my overriding sense is just like confusion and lost. One</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">One of the plot devices in this story is not truth, Corey. I mean, they have lied to us every day. Why would we expect them to start telling the truth today? And so they cleaned up a couple of things because a physician shouldn&#39;t stand in front of the uh the the nation&#39;s press and lie to them directly and i think that he figured that out but you know here&#39;s here&#39;s where we are um truth</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">truth is not in the in the script of this story so let&#39;s not expect that the truth is going to be one of the elements that we should be seeing so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so let&#39;s carry your metaphor forward because if every day there&#39;s a reveal that the</span>

Wake me up when the season&#39;s over, so to speak. Because none of the plot points matter because none of them actually travel from day to day. And I think that&#39;s where I feel right now. It&#39;s just like I can see in macro what a huge deal this is. I can imagine the ramifications of scenario A, Trump dies. Scenario B, Trump&#39;s very sick. Scenario C, no problem at all. But I can&#39;t actually see moment to moment what scenario we&#39;re in. And I don&#39;t actually trust any of my senses about reading where we are, because it&#39;s just it&#39;s misinformation to a degree that even for them is deeply irresponsible.</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m glad we started here, because I think it&#39;s quite revealing that underneath the surface of another political saga, in this long arc of this election, there is so many complicated emotional feelings that people are having so many complicated outcomes. I don&#39;t want to get into an episode of scenario planning, but how about we talk about some of the strategic outcomes and strategic choices that have been made. And let&#39;s start with what Corey mentioned, which is the medical team. And what do you guys make of this medical team coming out, almost playing to the audience of one? We&#39;ve talked about the audience of one so many times. Dr. Conley playing to the audience of one. And then having Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, going off the record saying, of course, then being outed by The New York Times for doing it so poorly, but then saying that, you know, he&#39;s actually quite concerned about the health. Carter, give us your strategic comments of like what they&#39;ve done. And do you think it&#39;s a strategic choice they have made as to how they&#39;re playing this? Or do you feel like this is something different? Let&#39;s talk about the actual sort of medical communications at first. first</span>

The rest of the population hasn&#39;t got that because and they didn&#39;t put they didn&#39;t put themselves at risk. Donald Trump put them at risk.

Let&#39;s talk about that, the lack of clarity. These are, at the end of the day, medical professionals. So maybe let&#39;s deviate from where we&#39;re talking about the size of the team and the type of care to what they&#39;ve been saying and how they&#39;ve been saying it.

This is my suspicion. This is my hypothesis, is that Trump&#39;s doctors are playing for Trump and people around Donald Trump are saying, okay, well, we can&#39;t just let everybody sleepwalk through this gobsmacked if this guy dies in five days. I mean, I&#39;ve never quite seen communications done in this fashion for a crisis like this, but I guess I sort of understand how they got there. No,</span>

Most politically optimal choice here for how they communicate. Is it to play to an audience of one or is it to temper it down a bit? Knowing, let&#39;s also keep in mind, I mean, this is not just happening in any time horizon. This is happening T minus 29 days from an election. So the most politically calculating strategy here for how the doctors communicate, what would that be in your mind? Well,</span>

You know, what happens in that scenario? The Republican Party is bigger than one man. I mean, not really at this particular moment, but it is in general.

Well, spinning truth is totally different in my mind than just telling a bald-faced lie, you know, or something so unbelievably see-through as he&#39;s not receiving oxygen currently, right now, right? Like that&#39;s so unbelievably easy to see through the spin. You know, if he wasn&#39;t receiving oxygen now and he&#39;d been receiving oxygen earlier, that&#39;s actually a good story.

And I&#39;m going to put these three strategies, if you can call them, that Trump deployed over the last couple of days into one package and ask you guys to dissect them and give me a score as to what you kind of think they what you kind of think the strategy meant and perhaps how you would perhaps improve it. So it was that photo session. You saw the photo session with Trump at Walter Reed Medical Center saying that he&#39;s good, signing his autograph on a blank sheet of paper. You then saw that four-minute video where he communicated directly to his supporters saying he&#39;s fine. And then today you saw him in the Beast doing a little bit of a victory lap in this hermetically sealed car where he&#39;s got COVID and there&#39;s a Secret Service agent inside. So let me just add that context. Well, he waves and thanks his supporters. Let&#39;s package those three things together. And maybe, Stephen, I&#39;ll start with you. What did you make of Trump&#39;s what I&#39;d call PR 101 exercise to show that he&#39;s still the strong man that his supporters think he is? Would you give it high marks? What would you kind of dissect from that strategy? And where&#39;s your head at on what you saw?</span>

And the beast lap was was just a strongman move that, you know, so the objective is right, right? What he&#39;s trying to achieve of showing normalcy and showing the the continuation of the office. Totally right. What&#39;s wrong are this are two of the three specific tactics In a perfect world, he should have gone for a walk, right? Even if it&#39;s just a walk through the grounds of Walter Reed Hospital. He needs to get – he needed to be showing that he had – you know, he could act. It could be a closed, secured environment. It could be, you know, whatever. But it would show a normalcy. Even if he was eating a fucking McDonald&#39;s burger, it would show a degree of normalcy, right? And that&#39;s what he needed to do. And that&#39;s one of the things that he missed. The other thing that he missed is empathy. You know, he did talk now. All of a sudden he understands the plague.

And in fact, it&#39;s arguably even responsible presidential behavior to a point, as long as it&#39;s not entirely fictional. the way he is going about it is is incredibly callous and it does reinforce a lot of the negatives that uh americans have of president trump in this moment and we are starting to see polling come forward that shows that americans even not quite the majority but what 45 plus percent of republicans think he fucked up right and um he&#39;s he&#39;s reinforcing a lot of that throughout his actions steven&#39;s point about it&#39;s all i statement still really really solid hadn&#39;t really thought about the fact that that was the core of his language but he&#39;s absolutely right and the selfishness plays through in a lot of those other actions as well you know unless the secret service agent and driver have already had covid that i mean that&#39;s the only scenario in which i can see this not being a truly monstrous act exposing them to it and people are talking about this an attending physician at walter reed tweeted about this that&#39;s not exactly something you would expect to see from an attending physician at the hospital the president is being treated unless temperatures were very high about it my understanding from washington</span>

Let me talk about, before I get into Biden and the Dems strategy here, I want to talk about one more thing on the Republican side, which is Mike Pence. So Pence was at that same Amy Coney Barrett Rose Garden celebration. He has been tested negative three days in a row. Medical professionals across the United States are pounding their desks saying that he needs to isolate. He needs to be in isolation and quarantine himself. He&#39;s refused. He said he&#39;s going to debate on Wednesday against Kamala Harris, which we&#39;ll talk about in our upcoming segment. But he&#39;s also said that he&#39;s going to hold rallies going forward. If you&#39;re the Republicans, Corey, let me stick with you here. Is Mike Pence doing you any favors with his strategic choice here or no?</span>

            <span class="text">Oh, listen, Mike Pence would never breathe air breathed by a woman other than his wife. I&#39;m sure he just held his breath the whole time. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t have COVID. No, I mean, this is nuts. I mean, like, this is the notion of putting down bets that seem suspect at one point, but are at this point, you&#39;re almost just chasing your losses. And now, just imagine from a reputational point of view that Pence does get COVID. Maybe not even from this event. Let&#39;s say he gets COVID from something entirely different two days later, but it looks close enough. People start going, hmm,</span>

            <span class="text">you can&#39;t just sort of hand wave it away and say, well, we didn&#39;t know the risks. Yeah, you knew the risks. I mean, you&#39;ve just gotten your ass kicked for the risks that the president took. So I just don&#39;t think that the risk-benefit calculation is there. And I do understand that they&#39;re probably a little panicked. They don&#39;t have their candidate right now. And to lose their candidate&#39;s backup is probably,</span>

            <span class="text">know, worse. But on the other hand, he&#39;s the vice president. He was still not the candidate. And you have other options. You don&#39;t want to do what Joe Biden&#39;s been doing. But you know what? But Joe Biden&#39;s more remote events, individual events, stuff like that, was done for a reason. And it might be worth just cooling your heels for a couple of weeks. By the way, advice I might give to Biden as well right now with the exact same logic.</span>

And we&#39;re going to say that mask wearing is, you know, we&#39;re going to make our side be the non mask wearers and we&#39;re going to make our side be the non social distancers and the conspiracy theorists around it. And there&#39;s not enough people. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s chaos in all the campaigns. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re trying to figure out what the hell to do with this.

            <span class="text">I want to talk about a few more strategic choices here. Before I get to Biden, let&#39;s talk about Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. An interesting sidewind of this thing has been that a couple of the GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee have also been diagnosed with COVID. This has then led Pelosi and Schumer to say that we should not be having a hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, that a vote on a lifetime appointment needs to happen in person. Corey, what do you kind of make of this? I shouldn&#39;t call it Hail Mary, but it is resembling one, trying to take advantage of an opportunity of what Schumer and Pelosi are trying to do right now, because we still have a promise by Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump that they want to get Amy Coney Barrett to become a justice prior to the election. So let&#39;s talk about that strategic choice, what you make of it and what you perhaps may have proposed as an alternative if you didn&#39;t like it well</span>

We&#39;ve always and you guys have especially always said Biden&#39;s strategy here needs to be to not go down Trump&#39;s rabbit holes to not, you know, necessarily pick scabs, so to speak, to appear presidential to peer above the fray. Today, an NBC poll comes out saying Biden has a 14 point edge over Trump, volatile polling for sure. But I want to use it to talk about this item we just mentioned, which is the Supreme Court nominee. Should Biden be spending political capital right now to making an emphasis on this particular issue? Should he be donating some of his political capital behind Chuck Schumer and others, perhaps even burning it to be able to try to make this not happen, knowing that he&#39;s got, whether it&#39;s a 14 or eight or six, whatever you want to say, point lead heading into November? Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you first.</span>

It will either die because the Republicans don&#39;t have the votes or it will live because Republicans do have the votes. And nothing Joe Biden does at this point can change that. So my advice to Joe Biden does not change in this matter. Keep above it. Keep beyond it. In a funny way, you managed to avoid talking</span>

            <span class="text">up at the doors, not really registering new voters. So the campaign has officially declared that they&#39;re going to go out now start doing more of that ground game. Let&#39;s talk about those two strategic choices. The first one was to pause the negative ads. The second one was to now do more voter mobilization, voter registration, unearthing that supporter base. What do you make of both of those under this cover, if I can call it that, of Trump getting COVID? And Corey, perhaps I&#39;ll start with you.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m of two minds about the negative ads, because on one hand, you will will get a lot of angry people if you have one of these ads out and donald trump takes a turn for the worst right like you are such an insensitive bastard the man is waiting for his life why can&#39;t you just let go um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um but in that scenario donald trump is probably not going to win the election anyhow so i um i part the larger part of me thinks they should have continued the ads because what is a negative ad ultimately right are we talking contrast ads donald trump says x i say y this This is a man whose record is deplorable. And if you are Joe Biden, your campaign is largely a campaign against Donald Trump. And to pull that arrow out of your quiver, that&#39;s a big move. The other thing is, when do you put it back? When do you put it back? When is the trigger that allows you then to say, okay, I&#39;m going to run negative ads again? Is it when he returns to the White House? Is it when he himself resumes his campaign? You&#39;re going to take the hit that you would have taken about the negative ads. You&#39;ve drawn attention to it. You&#39;ve implied there&#39;s something wrong about negative ads all at the same time. like it gets so complicated i guess is my</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so i probably would have continued the ads i would have maybe even reached out and said hey listen donald if you&#39;re willing to pull your ads for a bit i&#39;m willing to pull my ads for a bit let&#39;s just call a ad truce for a week like you know have something that was time bound and literally tied to the other side also putting their gun down but because the trump campaign has not put their gun down and you have and now you&#39;ve got all that awkwardness i&#39;ve just described on the whole i have to say it was a mistake now</span>

I mean, first of all, if we believe that he&#39;s he&#39;s 14 points up, it doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s 14 points up or 10 points up. The negative ads can only do so much lifting. You</span>

There&#39;s a certain point when piling on to an aggrieved party is no longer sportsmanlike. and it actually turns on you and becomes the negative so pulling the ads is fine i think that&#39;s exactly right and especially when you can run was essentially devastating contrast ads as public as as as simply straight up positive ads i&#39;m going to put in a health care plan for you i&#39;m going to protect your health care is that a negative ad i</span>

Let&#39;s assume Trump survives this thing. Let&#39;s assume he beats it. Is there any upside to that? Let&#39;s say it takes the standard 10 to 12 days. Let&#39;s do political math here.

            <span class="text">Look, it seems really unlikely. It&#39;s not impossible. I thought it was more probable before. So before he went to the hospital, I thought if Trump is just got the sniffles for three days, and then he&#39;s back, and he&#39;s the same guy he was, and he&#39;s out on the campaign trail in 10 days, that&#39;s very reinforcing of his overall narratives, which are very counter to Joe Biden&#39;s narratives. Joe Biden is saying, this is really serious. You got to take this serious. You&#39;ve got to do more. And if Donald Trump sort of walks through and kind of dusts his shoulder and says, yeah, no big, then I think if you&#39;re Joe Biden, you&#39;ve got a problem. If you&#39;re Donald Trump, you&#39;ve got an opportunity. But now that he has actually had to go to the hospital, he&#39;s been put on experimental drugs, he has been given oxygen, he&#39;s been given a steroid treatment that is only supposed to be used in severe situations. conversations, I think it is a bit of a stretch to suggest he&#39;s going to be able to walk out and say, yeah, no, like COVID is not a big deal. Like every time he talks about COVID for the rest of the election, which will be the rest of the election because the fucker got COVID, it&#39;s going to be just a reminder of the weaknesses of Donald Trump. So I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a significant risk, at least with the bulk of the electorate. Obviously, Donald Trump&#39;s diehards, They will see him as that messiah that Carter talked about.</span>

And he&#39;s clearly been, you know, in close connection at that Rose Garden ceremony, as we talked about. And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. What is Kamala Harris&#39;s strategy heading into this debate? Should she outright refuse to debate knowing, you know, that Mike Pence is not taking into perspective the medical guidance here. Maybe that isn&#39;t the strategy, but maybe let&#39;s start with Kamala.

You&#39;ve been exposed to people with covid. You&#39;ve been talking in close quarters with people with covid. You are not isolating and quarantining yourself. I am not going to debate you. you i am not going to be in inside with you uh you know spitting at each other uh from from two and a half meters apart um that feels to me like that should be the normal response um but i don&#39;t think that she&#39;s got that opportunity first of all we&#39;re all looking forward to this debate remember from the day that she was chosen uh to be joe biden&#39;s running mate it has been expected that she would be the star of the debates she would stand in there against mike pence and wipe the floor with that poor motherfucker and and that is what we want from her so i&#39;m really like i think that on the medical side she should say no on the political side she should say yes and walk into that room and do as we&#39;ve been hoping for uh from the day she was named and just take take um him him down.</span>

This is, you literally have a president who&#39;s in the hospital, and you have another one who is is also very old. So it&#39;s important that this go forward. I will say that if I&#39;m the Democrats, however, that doesn&#39;t preclude me from doing things like demanding the commission put plexiglass between myself and Mike Pence, which will just visually reinforce the whole Donald Trump is a walking vector of disease thing throughout the debate. So there are ways you can play with it. And there&#39;s no way that Pence can reasonably say no to such a demand. And so a bit of a game of chicken can happen there. And you can have a setup that will essentially reinforce that. And the</span>

            <span class="text">other thing I&#39;m doing, if I&#39;m Kamala Harris, is I&#39;m playing a bit of expectations game. What worries me about this debate for the Democrats is exactly what Stephen said, which is, oh, she&#39;s going to mop the floor with him. It&#39;s going to be a rout. It&#39;s just going to be an ass kicking.</span>

            <span class="text">Maybe not. You know, it&#39;s a vice presidential debate and these things can can take on a weird energy so um you&#39;ve got to be careful that you don&#39;t over commit to it i think you actually play up this oddity of the moment and say this is a vice presidential debate like like we&#39;ve never have many are saying this shouldn&#39;t even go forward it&#39;s going to take on a different tone a more somber tone this is not kamala harris&#39;s sweet spot you know normally it&#39;s when she&#39;s going and taking the fight to them but that would be a little inappropriate at this point like i&#39;m seeding those messages out there if i&#39;m the democrats um and i&#39;m uh uh, walking in and I am in some ways more than I expected her to have to be. I have to be the extension of that presidential feeling, you know, like we are different from these guys. And so, um, those expectations need to be set ahead of time, but you got to do it. You absolutely have to do it.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, to you, what should the Pence strategy be heading into this debate? So he wants to do it. How should he position himself? Should he try to add some distance between him and Trump? Should he try to be his own thing? How is he positioning himself? Because Corey brings up a really important point, a president in the hospital, and if Biden wins the oldest president to ever take office, this could be a preview of maybe not even four years from now, but much sooner in either direction. So how is Pence perhaps positioning this debate and perhaps himself in the context of being Trump&#39;s VP pick?</span>

I know that the expectation game at this point is so high for Harris that if she doesn&#39;t destroy him, it may look like a loss. So I&#39;ll be interested to see that. And if that happens, she could win by 25% and still have it be a loss. And maybe that&#39;s Pence&#39;s game. Maybe that&#39;s what Pence plays for. Not quite a draw, but just if I don&#39;t get absolutely slaughtered, if I lose by one, then I&#39;m the winner in this debate.</span>

That&#39;s what Donald Trump&#39;s supporters will expect. And if he starts to show daylight, he&#39;s going to get killed.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s talk about the final sort of element to this in my mind, which is the impact. What do you think the impact of the vice presidential debate will be? Normally, it&#39;s you survive, you kind of pump up your person, you show competency. The general wisdom is no one&#39;s voting for the bottom of the ticket. Is that changed this time around? Do you think it&#39;s different? Do you feel like the impact in this COVID world, Trump world, 2020 world is going to be perhaps different for what we might see as the outcome of this debate yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean this pence could be the candidate you know obviously i&#39;ve predicted otherwise uh so this isn&#39;t going to be the case but um pence could be the candidate uh on november the third um covid&#39;s real it&#39;s serious uh it has a 32 mortality rate for obese men and over in their 70s uh you know draw whatever conclusions you want from that um you know 64 percent of of men in their 70s who get covid are hospitalized uh so trump has already put himself into that category uh so we&#39;re seeing a a we</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we could be seeing a you know as as has been pointed out biden is the oldest candidate to ever it would be the oldest person ever assumed the office uh there&#39;s a more than reasonable chance that either Either one of these two people could be president. And so it will take on a totally different meaning than we would see in the Dan Quayle style vice presidential debates when we were mostly concerned about whether or not he could spell potato.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s further than that. It&#39;s not that one of them could become president. They both could be president. Pence could finish Trump&#39;s term. Biden could fail to finish his. And Kamala Harris could do that for him. I mean, this is an interesting presidential or vice presidential debate in that sense.</span>

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s move it to this final sort of question on this vice presidential debate, which is, what should both of the campaigns be trying to make of this debate? Should they be putting emphasis on it? Should they not be putting an emphasis on it? Carter, if you are Team Biden right now, you know, despite your expectation lowering, do you want to showcase that you&#39;ve got a star here that can literally run the country if you need to? Or is this all about Biden in the 11th hour? And then same with Team Trump, like what sort of emphasis are you we talked about impact, but now let&#39;s talk about emphasis. Are you putting on on this debate if you are both of those teams?</span>

If Joe Biden just absolutely bombed in the debate, you You had Kamala Harris to be there to reassure rattled voters and still show some real heft. That didn&#39;t appear to be the case.

Are you in or out on her running in the Toronto Centre by-election? So as you know, Bill Morneau has vacated that seat. The Liberals have found their quote-unquote star candidate, parachuted her into that race.

She&#39;s expecting to get her face out there and really introduce herself to the people of Canada in a way that we&#39;ve come to expect. You know, we all know who Elizabeth May is.

There&#39;s a chance you might be torpedoing your entire organization or at least setting it back a step or two. Nobody was asking you to do this. There was no need to do this. And doing it just exposes yourself to a lot of risk at a time when, I mean, the Green Party is not the NDP even. It is not the Liberals. It is not the Conservatives. It&#39;s not an organization that immediately is just turnkey. you take it over and by the way uh here&#39;s your seat you get to run an election now that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to be happening you are going to be distracted on the campaign trail for uh you know for the next month and uh and to what end like to what benefit i just um i don&#39;t know maybe i mean to me it&#39;s one of these things where it&#39;s high risk high reward but i just don&#39;t think the calculations there somebody always wins the lottery doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a smart money move to buy a lottery ticket.</span>

We talked about week one, him taking a bit of a beating for calling the election, a bit of a gamble, rolling the dice as numbers for COVID do go up. Well, they are going up, but now it&#39;s starting to seem like his leader and Dr. Wilkinson are being defined a bit more. From what you&#39;ve seen in week two, are you in or out? in the week that he&#39;s having, not on the overall campaign, but in the week that NDP leader and Premier John Horgan is having this week?</span>

You know, he has benefited from, I think, a few missteps by Wilkinson. And also, let&#39;s be really real, the entire world being distracted by the same things things we&#39;ve been distracted on in this podcast. It could very well be British Columbia is going to get to election day and say, oh, shit, it&#39;s election day. I&#39;ve been watching this American thing the entire time.

            <span class="text">Yes or no, are we talking about Trump and his COVID diagnosis this time next week when we record? Is that the headline story in the United States again one week later? We talked about the week-to-week taxes debate, COVID, but does this particular story have the staying power week-to-week? What do you say, yes or no?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely, we are. But we&#39;re talking about how his release from hospital has immediately been superseded by him running into more super spreader events. As soon as the man starts feeling good, he&#39;s going to start going into events and we&#39;re all going to be like shaking our head and wondering what the hell is going on. So I&#39;m quite convinced that we&#39;ll still be talking about his COVID diagnosis. diagnosis carter</span>

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s not just even knowing the general trajectory of this disease. It seems really unlikely that this is in the rear view mirror. Carter&#39;s notion of super spreader events that he may or may not get involved with the minute that he&#39;s cleared from his COVID diagnosis, which I&#39;m not at all convinced or think is even close to likely that we&#39;ll be in that position next week. But when he gets out there, we know Donald Trump&#39;s very selfish. He&#39;ll say, I&#39;m safe now. I can&#39;t get COVID again, or at least it&#39;s very unlikely based on all of the evidence that we have. So he&#39;s just going to go out there and put together all sorts of very questionable events, it would be my suspicion, if he recovers well enough to get back onto the campaign trail. So yeah, we&#39;ll be talking about this one way or the other. This is going to drag for a while. It&#39;s hard to imagine this campaign not closing closing out on COVID after Donald Trump&#39;s diagnosis.</span>

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s end it with a listener question, guys, and a listener question coming to us from Mia Holick, the subject of this review, a five-star review, of course, on iTunes. That&#39;s how you ask a listener question. No, there is no other way, people on Twitter. Here we go. Five stars, the subject heading, poor Zane, of course. The podcast is a brilliant example of an extremely put-upon host doing the best with what he&#39;s given. Don&#39;t disagree. agree. Zayn Velji deserves a Gemini Award for dealing with those other two. Agreed. Here&#39;s the question. Since the throne speech featured little in the way of massive expensed items, do you think the fissure between Trudeau and Morneau was purely about the latter falling on his sword over the We Charity scandal? So we&#39;ll go back to some Canadian politics with this question by Mihalik. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you. So the question is, Was the Trudeau-Morneau rift purely about the fissures of we that led to Morneau being ousted?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Not entirely. I think that after the throne speech, it&#39;s hard not to think it was more about that than we were led to believe in the lead up to the throne speech. But let&#39;s just put a couple of things out there. No new expense items does not mean that there is peace in the valley when it comes to our finances. And it&#39;s quite possible, if not even probable, Morneau was arguing for, how are we going to get back? What is the path? And obviously, the extension of CERB is a very expensive line item. And I could see Morneau not being that enamored with that, right? The other thing is it is also possible, if not probable, that just based on the reporting that was out there, that the Liberals got, if not cold feet, they lost their enthusiasm for spending at the nth degree because a combination of the polls, some anxiety that was out there, and maybe even just a stern talking to from the public service who said, Sir,</span>

            <span class="text">it would be real nice if you didn&#39;t bankrupt this country in the next two years. So, you know, it is very likely that the balance was more towards we than we originally thought. But that does not mean that the financial component was not a component. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">I think that the rift between Morneau and Trudeau begins at the being surprised level. You know, the $42,000 expense, I think, surprised Trudeau. And that rift kind of began there. and it just didn&#39;t go away. So that&#39;s kind of how I look at it. And people overlaid the financial thing. I always just thought it was the thing that was actually in front of us, not the thing that people were speculating about.</span>
