You&#39;ve got dinners, apparently, that the leader of the opposition isn&#39;t invited to, but is invited to, but isn&#39;t invited to. you&#39;ve got uh the the pageantry of all of these state events you&#39;ve got the the perfunctory meetings of the families all of that stuff and it is um in some ways it&#39;s like putting the entire city in a penalty box or a cooling off period and for me the the most notable thing about joe biden&#39;s visit was nothing that he said which is like every u.s president says a version of this except for maybe the shot at the leafs which was entirely deserved because it&#39;s the it&#39;s the leafs it&#39;s that it came in the middle of a very tense moment in Ottawa with everything going on with you know foreign interference accusations resignations from caucuses suggestions that you know national security sources perhaps have torqued things all sorts of rumors going around and it&#39;s it&#39;s a bit like saying okay everybody go to your corner for a bit and I do wonder what what it&#39;s going to do to change the tone and change the course of this story come Monday. Because there&#39;s not that many things in Ottawa. I mean, Ottawa is a small town in many ways, and you do run into the same people all the time. But there</span>

You know, there was kind of a petulance and childishness that I always seem to equate to to Pierre Pelletier. Now, that might just be my bias. I might just be biased against Pierre because I&#39;ve known him, you know, since he was a petulant child and he still is a petulant child in my mind. But I honestly think that Pierre doesn&#39;t play by those same rules that would see the softening that Corey describes, especially given that I still think that the liberals or the conservatives are trying to make points on foreign affairs. And I am, maybe I&#39;m just too old, old fashioned, but I just don&#39;t think that you don&#39;t, I just don&#39;t think you make points on foreign affairs. I think that foreign affairs and things like that are supposed to be off limits for making points because it&#39;s about the country as a whole. But, but that just might be me being old, old school.

And so I&#39;m super intrigued to see how that unfolds, because I feel like that took us a much closer step to the inquiry. And I was very much against the idea that there was going to be an inquiry.

It is basically treason. Right. And it is pretty nuts to me that, like, I agree, like the bar to publish that better have been very high, right, given the nature of the accusations. and and yeah to carter to your point like the it was supposed to be a one-on-one conversation there&#39;s basically two ways that this this</span>

And here&#39;s why I think you almost, why this story drives us closer to an inquiry regardless. And it&#39;s a point many many have made online.

So I think we&#39;re there. I mean, to me, the big question is, when are the liberals going to realize it? Because if the liberals are being entirely forthright with us, and that they did not do these things, they should be the first pounding on the table for a public inquiry. Because the other solution, the other answer to that question is your national security apparatus is in the cloak of darkness trying to take you down.

So they have to hand it to an independent third party if they&#39;re going to get any benefit from this at all.

You have to get this type of stuff off to an independent third party. Now, you can devise guardrails that are so strong that the inquiry doesn&#39;t get to look at certain things that you may find challenging as a government. I think that we did that with the health care inquiry in 2011, 2012. We put guardrails around it. It didn&#39;t look at certain things in the past. It only looked kind of what&#39;s happening now. Those guardrails were put up, you</span>

The Gomer inquiry is identified particularly by a lot of people who have ended up in what is the current Trudeau camp as one of the things that brought down the liberals in the early 2000s, right? There&#39;s this sense amongst many liberals, and you&#39;ve got to keep in mind, for a long time, the liberals were this two-solitude party. You were either a Critchinite or a Martinite, and before that, you were a Critchinite or a Turnerite, and before that, you were a Turnerite. It goes back forever. And there&#39;s a sense that Martin, by running against his own party, by calling an inquiry that became the Gomery inquiry, he damaged the liberal brand so badly that that&#39;s what sank the liberals. And I think that there&#39;s some truth to that. I really do. I think his approach to the inquiry, once he called it, really is reflective of that critique. that critique there&#39;s</span>

So as much as it might be like the Michaels, yes, they&#39;re in the news right now, but why are they otherwise coming? It&#39;s now 2023. You got to keep in mind this dinner was probably originally going to happen in 2020 before COVID and everything that kicked on. And that was very shortly after the Michaels were released. So it&#39;s quite possible. It&#39;s like when Joe Biden comes for a state dinner, we want to invite you as well. That invitation remained current, even though two and a half years have passed.

            <span class="text">yeah i mean confidential sources anonymous sources they&#39;re troubling right uh in many ways but they i understand entirely why newsrooms use them and i think that there&#39;s still for me it&#39;s always even when there&#39;s a leaker and i&#39;m a former government government bureaucrat. And I loathe leakers, just loathe them, especially as the guy who ran communications. It was difficult. It was difficult to have to deal with that when somebody would put that out and it would break trust in the public service. And it was just a deeply unpleasant time. I never held it against the media for taking what was newsworthy content and publishing that.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, it&#39;s an interesting point because I think when we hear about an anonymous source or a confidential source or whatever you want to call it, we get this assumption that we&#39;re going to know, right? Like that there will be some sort of conclusion. Like we&#39;re going to get to the end of the book and on the last page it will tell us, yes, there was a source or no, there wasn&#39;t a source or yes, the source was right and no, the source was wrong. Real life is not that clean, right? And I think that we don&#39;t always get the conclusions we hope for. on the cbc story they did do a follow-up saying here are the 10 questions we asked the premier&#39;s office about their quote-unquote search for uh this email we never got a response back here&#39;s what security experts say here&#39;s ways they could have searched for it that doesn&#39;t sound like they did but no we didn&#39;t get anything there and frankly we may never get anything there doesn&#39;t mean the story wasn&#39;t newsworthy doesn&#39;t mean cbc was wrong doesn&#39;t mean danielle smith was wrong either if we&#39;re going to be fair and charitable about it it means we have a certain amount of context that we&#39;re going to have to weigh as discerning readers of news, and we&#39;re going to have to determine what we want with it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But to your point, how many people are actually discerning readers of news? How many people are actually going to live in that gray and say, I&#39;m okay with it? Like, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s not 100% clear either way.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You know, I mean, people can be very frustrated. And there&#39;s also this assumption that you don&#39;t publish it unless you&#39;re 100% sure. But I don&#39;t think 100% is the bar. You know, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the bar for the media. It&#39;s like, do we we have reason to believe this is true. Is there newsworthiness to it? Are we acting in good faith? And, but that&#39;s not everybody&#39;s perception of it. A lot of people think that it should be absolutely ironclad, like court of law, you know, not a single juror is going to say they&#39;ve got a question with it kind of proof. And maybe that is what&#39;s partially driving the view of media more negatively is the sense that the media can act with impunity on these things. And, and and we&#39;re just supposed to trust them but the reality is it&#39;s their job so i don&#39;t i don&#39;t have a big problem with it and</span>

And I did, I did note what you were alluding to there in the, in the Taves resignation letter, supports the UCP, doesn&#39;t say anything about Danielle Smith, right? And Sonia Savage went a different way. Sonja Savic had a much longer note that thanked Jason Kenney, thanked Daniel Smith, said she was going to support Daniel Smith. Can&#39;t remember the exact words, but it was rooting for her in the next election, basically. Words noticeably absent from Travis Taves&#39; email.</span>

            <span class="text">this time just this one time but the the other pieces of it the good pieces of it we saw character development we saw a storyline we saw um easy to understand uh allegory where people were able to understand what was actually happening with this story now cory&#39;s made a good point that it should have come up you know it would be better if there was some hook at the beginning or uh something along those lines but because even with there not being a particularly strong hook at the beginning this was something that had legs this was something that was shared um it is the the number one video video on my social media feeds, it&#39;s doing very, very well for them in getting the story told. And I think that it&#39;s a big step forward for the NDP to be using some of these kind of storytelling mechanisms that we&#39;ve been begging them to use. So I&#39;m not going to rag on them about the specifics of it. I think that in general, it was a much better use of the mediums than they have been doing. Are there areas to improve? Yes, of course. No one&#39;s done the perfect ad. It always is something that needs to be worked on. But this was a great step towards character development, especially using someone other than Rachel Notley. That was probably, in my opinion, the best part about the spot. They used Kathleen Ganley, who was heretofore been basically a non-entity in the Calgary caucus, and they have made her a character that could help carry some of this Calgary election, a Calgary voice that we want to listen to.</span>

And I&#39;m not suggesting that&#39;s actually what the NDP is after at this particular moment. But if it is in any way, shape or form, the UCP is just walking into it like Sideshow Bob walks into a rake, right? right uh for you simpsons heads out there you you have things like r star where they&#39;re they&#39;re shoveling money towards an oil and gas industry to do something that they already should be doing right you have comments that the premier makes about solar deeply skeptical comments about solar power she made this week saying like well why you know i see snow on those panels sometimes or why isn&#39;t that good agricultural land being used i mean let&#39;s just set aside the fact it&#39;s the the winter right now you know and uh probably not a lot you could do there and</span>
