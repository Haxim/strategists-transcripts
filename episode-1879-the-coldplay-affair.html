Stephen Carter, Shannon Phillips Phillips, there&#39;s a few dumpster fires, a varying degree. And I want you to rank them first for me, and we&#39;ll dive into each of them in our own special strategist way. But I&#39;ll ask you, which one of these political dumpster fires of the past week is the worst for a particular political figure in our country or province? And as a operative strategist, former elected official, person who knows this space, people who know this space, which one would you want to work on? Does that make sense? Yep. Right? So we&#39;ve got the Alberta Next panels, which are going splendidly thus far in Alberta. That, of course, is paired alongside the survey scandal of Daniel Smith, where they have to kind of go back and edit some surveys. You&#39;ve got Mark Carney and C5, which is now facing some Indigenous backlash after his one-day meeting today. We can dive into that. We&#39;ve got this by-election for Pierre Pauliev, which is, it&#39;s</span>

So and, you know, sort of and we&#39;ll test Carter&#39;s theory of whether Gen Pop is down with this or not, based on some of what the New Democrats do and what kind of, you know, soil they can till. That is why the New Democrats probably need to round out this Better Together campaign, which I really liked and I think is effective, with some other ways that people can plug in, survey stuff, whatever, right, to kind of slipstream behind the government&#39;s bullshit process and demonstrate a, you know, a more good faith approach</span>
