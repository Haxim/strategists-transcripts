            <div class="said">I&#39;ll tell you something, getting a mortgage is in some ways one of the easier pieces of credit to get because houses tend to be an appreciating asset. People do tend to pay those things off first and automatically. And ultimately, you can&#39;t leave with your house in the dead of the night. The bank knows where it is. So it&#39;s not exactly risky credit to begin with. The problem is people can&#39;t afford the down payments. People can&#39;t afford the payments. We&#39;ve gotten to a place where, you know, the average house price in Vancouver is astronomical. The average house price in Toronto, the same. Calgary, getting there, you know, giving it an old college try in the last couple of years. And people just are priced out of the market. It&#39;s not that their credit&#39;s bad. It&#39;s that they can&#39;t buy a fucking house. The house is just not affordable to them.</div>

And one of them is, well, one of the challenges is you don&#39;t know what the house cost before that you&#39;re renting. So, oh, no problem. We can change that. We can force the disclosure. Well, we&#39;ll see. We&#39;ll see what the courts say about that. It does feel kind of squarely in provincial jurisdiction, but we&#39;ll see. Then there&#39;s this idea that, yeah, you&#39;ll positively affect your credit if you pay things on time, and maybe that&#39;ll make things more affordable.

To me, the question is, does this undercut some of the rhetoric and perhaps even the action that Minister Fraser, for example, when he talks about his wartime measures of building homes, does something like this just undercut the real work, to your point, that they&#39;re doing on supply? And what&#39;s the political lesson here? Because to me, this was a tweet and an announcement and a throw in for something that&#39;s a $0 announcement.

If you just release 10 really meaningful things on budget day, it&#39;s tough to know where the story is going to go at that particular moment. So rather than just hoping you get the headline you want on budget day, breaking it out so you get the headline you want because there&#39;s literally nothing else to talk about is not such a bad idea. And why do you care if it&#39;s on April 1st or April 16th in the final summation?

And just a few weeks ago, we were saying, man, just land a few of these planes that are circling, right? And it&#39;s hard on a public service to develop constructive and thoughtful plans when you&#39;ve got to do 8 million of them. And God, just last week, we had a renter&#39;s bill of rights, which really felt like it was in the provincial government&#39;s backyard. I still firmly believe that. I think there are federal levers. This didn&#39;t seem like one of them. And now this, this does not seem like a thing that in Canada is a federal program. I understand that in the States, they have SNAP, right? I understand that a lot of other jurisdictions that have much closer to unicameral legislatures, they have these programs. But in Canada, pretty firmly, these are matters of a local or education, and that is a provincial jurisdiction here. And unlike a lot of other federal programs that come around, like, say, pensions or healthcare, right, where they use kind of the federal convening power or they use, you know, federal rules that then are given, you know, money is attached to them and it goes out to – there&#39;s kind of a portability argument there.

And you&#39;re going to see the federal government say, no, no, no, no, no, we&#39;re just going to spend the money and get it done and fly in right over the provinces and do all of these provincial jurisdiction things.

Elect a different government if you don&#39;t like it next time.

He was in a data mining operation. You know, being the leader of that parade probably wasn&#39;t outright negative for him. Those folks were probably not already within the current conservative movement. They became his supporters. Now one can argue, and I&#39;m generalizing here and being reductive on purpose purpose to make a point, that these are his supporters in some way, or at least very close to him in terms of that perspective. So there&#39;s a bit of difference here. He may have needed them in the tent, and now they may be in the tent. How do you control these folks? How do you put a message out to them?

He mentioned on Sunday morning on one of the Sunday shows that, yep, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to try to do in our next budget. We&#39;re going to say no to the consumer carbon tax and we&#39;ll try to come up with our own alternative. He didn&#39;t exactly tease apart what that was going to look like.

I think that makes a ton of sense. There&#39;s a reason why, you know, after Racky Pancholi put out her, like, we should get away from a consumer carbon tax, literally, like, every domino fell across the bloody country. You had Ontario, you had progressive leaders everywhere say, actually, that sounds fine. Let&#39;s do that. that people were just waiting for this particular moment and frankly it was invited when justin trudeau started undermining it with the various carve-outs you know even today there was a reminder that quebec functionally plays a or pays a much lower carbon tax through cap and trade and the feds sort of turn a blind eye to that you&#39;ve got all of the various heating oil exemptions and so yeah</div>

She has dropped out of the Alberta NDP leadership race. She&#39;s endorsing Nahid Nenshi. Full disclosure, I&#39;m helping Nahid Nenshi on his campaign. The question I have is less so about the specifics of the Alberta NDP leadership race and her endorsement, but early endorsements. I&#39;m curious if you folks, or the two of you, you folks, as if I&#39;m dressing a crowd, if the two of you have a rule about early endorsements, any thoughts about early endorsements, dropping out relatively early or being the first to drop out foolish or golden in your mind carter i&#39;m curious to get your take and the corey i&#39;ll come to you with the same question to round us out on fool&#39;s gold i</div>

Well, you support the leader, and maybe you just get there faster than other people do. And so that is sort of my dime store analysis on this particular one. There are ways though, as Stephen was alluding to, where you can support the leader, not by literally supporting the leader, but by doing things that support the party that the leader is going to then be taking over, right? And so that I think is really the only question. I think pretending otherwise is just silly uh there is one source of memberships that it is not head nancy this race is fucking over uh they now have to sit in the bed that they made which was having a very long contest in terms of between various deadlines like if you had taken sort of the advice that steven was drumming very hard on which is a membership cut off on april 22nd and then a pretty instantaneous vote right yeah hey well then i don&#39;t think you really have a problem the problem you now have of zane is that you&#39;ve got to drum up interest and make sure people don&#39;t three months from now say oh yeah i didn&#39;t vote because i thought the thing was fucking over right because it&#39;s over but it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally</div>
