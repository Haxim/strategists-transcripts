I&#39;m not going to put my thumb on the scale on this one at all. Young Canadians who put a lot of their hard-earned money towards rent. Well, the Liberals now are saying that that should count for something. It should count towards your credit score.</span>

            <span class="text">looking for a place to actually live this means nothing to the average renter you know what would be great if you really wanted to impact rental markets and make uh make things more affordable allow people to deduct their rent payments from their income tax. Make it so that it&#39;s actually more affordable instead of having a credit score. That&#39;s just one idea that just popped into my little brain. I mean, I&#39;m sure I could come up with more if I actually applied myself, which does make me wonder what&#39;s going on with the Liberals where they can&#39;t seem to come up with anything</span>

And look, it&#39;s true that this could always have dinged your credit in the past, but most landlords do not have their shit together enough to do that outside of like the big ones.

            <span class="text">I&#39;ll tell you something, getting a mortgage is in some ways one of the easier pieces of credit to get because houses tend to be an appreciating asset. People do tend to pay those things off first and automatically. And ultimately, you can&#39;t leave with your house in the dead of the night. The bank knows where it is. So it&#39;s not exactly risky credit to begin with. The problem is people can&#39;t afford the down payments. People can&#39;t afford the payments. We&#39;ve gotten to a place where, you know, the average house price in Vancouver is astronomical. The average house price in Toronto, the same. Calgary, getting there, you know, giving it an old college try in the last couple of years. And people just are priced out of the market. It&#39;s not that their credit&#39;s bad. It&#39;s that they can&#39;t buy a fucking house. The house is just not affordable to them.</span>

I think it&#39;s better than the NDP&#39;s, but it&#39;s still, yeah, yeah, it will be inflationary. What&#39;s actually going to push down the cost of housing?

And one of them is, well, one of the challenges is you don&#39;t know what the house cost before that you&#39;re renting. So, oh, no problem. We can change that. We can force the disclosure. Well, we&#39;ll see. We&#39;ll see what the courts say about that. It does feel kind of squarely in provincial jurisdiction, but we&#39;ll see. Then there&#39;s this idea that, yeah, you&#39;ll positively affect your credit if you pay things on time, and maybe that&#39;ll make things more affordable.

To me, the question is, does this undercut some of the rhetoric and perhaps even the action that Minister Fraser, for example, when he talks about his wartime measures of building homes, does something like this just undercut the real work, to your point, that they&#39;re doing on supply? And what&#39;s the political lesson here? Because to me, this was a tweet and an announcement and a throw in for something that&#39;s a $0 announcement. Does Does it undercut a lot of the capital, good work, and perhaps even trajectory you might be on with the actual solutions on the file?

And at the time, you know, we talked a bit about the deficiencies of budget, which is that it is a technical process. There&#39;s a lot of numbers. It&#39;s the finance minister who speaks, you know, even though you&#39;ve got the throne speech around there, that&#39;s the lieutenant governor or governor general who speaks.

            <span class="text">it&#39;s not really a thing where the principal can come in and own it in either case. And so it makes an awful lot of sense that you look for ways that you can maximize the communications and also see previous point about things can get lost if you have too many. If you just release 10 really meaningful things on budget day, it&#39;s tough to know where the story is going to go at that particular moment. So rather than just hoping you get the headline you want on budget day, breaking it out so you get the headline you want because there&#39;s literally nothing else to talk about is not such a bad idea. And why do you care if it&#39;s on April 1st or April 16th in the final summation? And especially nowadays where you don&#39;t have kind of the big media moment around budget because media is just so diffused. And so this makes perfect sense. Yes,</span>

But yeah, I mean, that&#39;s also a tale as old as time and something that you hear an awful lot about. I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be complaints about it, especially if the government continues to use it so aggressively.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, it&#39;s really hard for me to look at this one individually, like independent of all of the other things that the federal government&#39;s been doing. And just a few weeks ago, we were saying, man, just land a few of these planes that are circling, right? And it&#39;s hard on a public service to develop constructive and thoughtful plans when you&#39;ve got to do 8 million of them. And God, just last week, we had a renter&#39;s bill of rights, which really felt like it was in the provincial government&#39;s backyard. I still firmly believe that. I think there are federal levers. This didn&#39;t seem like one of them. And now this, this does not seem like a thing that in Canada is a federal program. I understand that in the States, they have SNAP, right? I understand that a lot of other jurisdictions that have much closer to unicameral legislatures, they have these programs. But in Canada, pretty firmly, these are matters of a local or education, and that is a provincial jurisdiction here. And unlike a lot of other federal programs that come around, like, say, pensions or healthcare, right, where they use kind of the federal convening power or they use, you know, federal rules that then are given, you know, money is attached to them and it goes out to – there&#39;s kind of a portability argument there. Like, I want my healthcare to work. I just came back from vacation in BC. I want my Alberta healthcare to work in BC, right?</span>

I just don&#39;t know if those same arguments apply with school nutrition. So that&#39;s kind of the, I have trouble getting over that. And I have trouble getting past the constitutional challenges I have with it. Because it really does seem like it&#39;s provincial jurisdiction. And a lot of people would rightly scream blue murder if the provinces were trying to get into federal jurisdiction.</span>

One is, you&#39;re going to sit there talking to a guy like me who&#39;s like, yeah, but the jurisdiction, and you&#39;ll say, fuck you, don&#39;t you want kids to eat? And it&#39;s really, really hard to have that conversation and not sound like an asshole, right? When you&#39;re like, well, you know, you got to consider X, Y, and Z.

And you&#39;re going to see the federal government say, no, no, no, no, no, we&#39;re just going to spend the money and get it done and fly in right over the provinces and do all of these provincial jurisdiction things. And it just doesn&#39;t seem like a great or orderly way to run a country or hold people to account, including ourselves. Like, yeah, you fucking elected a government that makes certain decisions. Elect a different government if you don&#39;t like it next time.

And it&#39;s hard to argue now a couple of years out that that was a net negative for Pierre Polyev. And these things tend to move into mythology in ways that we can&#39;t fully appreciate or understand. So, I mean, I think it&#39;s nothing but downside because they basically have what they want. They&#39;re about to have Pierre Polyev as prime minister, right? And they could screw that all up and they could force the Alberta government to go against them and they could force all sorts of weird stuff. But I do want to acknowledge that this has worked for them, which is part of why they&#39;re going back to this will. This is the kind of behavior that we for fucking sure should not have encouraged.

In the convoy era, he almost probably, and I&#39;m not making excuses for him, but I&#39;m maybe trying to explain the history a bit from my perspective. He may have needed those people. He was in a data mining operation. You know, being the leader of that parade probably wasn&#39;t outright negative for him. Those folks were probably not already within the current conservative movement. They became his supporters. Now one can argue, and I&#39;m generalizing here and being reductive on purpose purpose to make a point, that these are his supporters in some way, or at least very close to him in terms of that perspective. So there&#39;s a bit of difference here. He may have needed them in the tent, and now they may be in the tent. How do you control these folks? How do you put a message out to them?

I think that makes a ton of sense. There&#39;s a reason why, you know, after Racky Pancholi put out her, like, we should get away from a consumer carbon tax, literally, like, every domino fell across the bloody country. You had Ontario, you had progressive leaders everywhere say, actually, that sounds fine. Let&#39;s do that. that people were just waiting for this particular moment and frankly it was invited when justin trudeau started undermining it with the various carve-outs you know even today there was a reminder that quebec functionally plays a or pays a much lower carbon tax through cap and trade and the feds sort of turn a blind eye to that you&#39;ve got all of the various heating oil exemptions and so yeah</span>

If I was in corporations today, I&#39;d be investing in advertising campaigns, trying to keep the tax, because it&#39;s the only way that you&#39;re not going to be absolutely hamstrung and the focal point of regulation moving forward. well</span>

She has dropped out of the Alberta NDP leadership race. She&#39;s endorsing Nahid Nenshi. Full disclosure, I&#39;m helping Nahid Nenshi on his campaign. The question I have is less so about the specifics of the Alberta NDP leadership race and her endorsement, but early endorsements. I&#39;m curious if you folks, or the two of you, you folks, as if I&#39;m dressing a crowd, if the two of you have a rule about early endorsements, any thoughts about early endorsements, dropping out relatively early or being the first to drop out foolish or golden in your mind carter i&#39;m curious to get your take and the corey i&#39;ll come to you with the same question to round us out on fool&#39;s gold i</span>

Well, you support the leader, and maybe you just get there faster than other people do. And so that is sort of my dime store analysis on this particular one. There are ways though, as Stephen was alluding to, where you can support the leader, not by literally supporting the leader, but by doing things that support the party that the leader is going to then be taking over, right? And so that I think is really the only question. I think pretending otherwise is just silly uh there is one source of memberships that it is not head nancy this race is fucking over uh they now have to sit in the bed that they made which was having a very long contest in terms of between various deadlines like if you had taken sort of the advice that steven was drumming very hard on which is a membership cut off on april 22nd and then a pretty instantaneous vote right yeah hey well then i don&#39;t think you really have a problem the problem you now have of zane is that you&#39;ve got to drum up interest and make sure people don&#39;t three months from now say oh yeah i didn&#39;t vote because i thought the thing was fucking over right because it&#39;s over but it&#39;s not it&#39;s totally</span>
