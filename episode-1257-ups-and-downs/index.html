        <p>Zain takes the gang through the sometimes undiscussed consequences of politics - the consequences of people seeing your strategy process, of staff deciding to stay in the game by running for office, and the expectation burden that comes with historic candidacies.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the "cost of living politically", unpacking Pierre Poilievre's equivocating on "parental rights", Chrystia Freeland's chief of staff announcing her MP candidacy and the opportunity and burden of historic candidacies such as Wab Kinew's. Why are we seeing process stories about the Conservatives debating support for transgender youth? Is moving from senior staffer to (aspiring) MP really a promotion? And did you know you can get a four bedroom house in downtown Winnipeg for less than $400,000? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">have Pierre Pauliev now, through sources and reporting by Radio Canada, they&#39;ve talked to multiple conservative sources that are saying Pierre Pauliev is going to be temporarily mealy-mouthed on the entire gender identity parental rights issue. They really don&#39;t know where to go with this particular file. Do they take the lead of some of the conservative premiers and follow their step on defending parental rights? some premiers defending it to the nth degree, perhaps even bringing out that notwithstanding clause? Or do they have a more tame response on it, per se? But Carter, the question I have in this segment called The Cost of Living Politically is, what is the political cost of the public seeing your calculus, or the public seeing you calculate this, of this leak coming out Now, through multiple sources saying you&#39;re actually not just engaging in conviction, which was the Pierre Polyev brand, or one of the brands that he said he was going to bring, but that you actually have calculus in you and that you are calculating on this particular file. So the question around cost, Carter, political cost, is around what cost do you pay when people see you making political calculus open in public and see that sausage being made?</div>

          <div class="said">You&#39;re talking about the cost. I&#39;m going to suggest to you there&#39;s also a benefit. I think they want to show the calculation on this one. I think where they&#39;re going to end up is a situation where they say something to the effect of the conflict we feel is the conflict Canadians feel. We are unsure about this issue. It makes us deeply uncomfortable how far this has pushed against parents&#39; rights to be involved in their children&#39;s lives, but it also makes us deeply uncomfortable to do anything heavy-handed when we know there are children involved and we know there are legitimate reasons for better and stronger protections in this space. And yes, you saw that conflict at our convention. You probably have seen that conflict at your Thanksgiving table as people come to this well-meaning with very different views. So as conservatives, we&#39;re not sure. So let&#39;s talk a bit about principles. Let&#39;s talk about the things that we believe in. We believe in protecting children. We believe that parents know better how to raise their children as a general rule than anybody else does. does. And, you know, I could easily see Pierre Polyev actually spinning out a message track from that conflict. I don&#39;t think the conflict hurts him. I don&#39;t think the idea that he&#39;s going to rag the puck and flip-flop and be mealy-mouthed hurts him if everybody thinks that&#39;s the strategy. And so, you know, there are some benefit to the calculation being exposed bare there. So the next round of, you know, articles about Pierre Polyev giving deeply unsatisfactory answers about this they&#39;ll say oh yes but that&#39;s his internal strategy to manage these forces look how clever the man is right like it&#39;s like meta yeah it is it&#39;s a game upon a game but i actually don&#39;t believe for a minute they don&#39;t want us to know but a game upon</div>

That was much more common in my view in the NDP and it was far, far less common with the liberals in my view. And I&#39;m sure people can find counterexamples all over the place. But generally speaking, if you wanted to have a liberal nomination be taken seriously, you wanted to go and do something. And maybe it was just, I say just, but maybe it was be a lawyer. Maybe it was be a business person. Maybe, maybe, maybe. But you&#39;d go do things and you&#39;d come back and you&#39;d get a liberal nomination.

Being a humble elected person, you&#39;re kind of seen as, oh, like, you know, the third-ranked PMO staffer, fifth-ranked PMO staffer ranks significantly higher than you, you know, so to speak, in the ecosystem. So the reason I phrase it that way was to try to get a reaction, but I don&#39;t come here with preconceived notions.

You can wear the other parts of your resume or your three-dimensionality after you get labeled as a political staffer. Because Leslie Church, I don&#39;t even know what she did prior to this. She&#39;s had a whole life prior to 2015. I&#39;d even even bother looking at it. Because I&#39;m like, well, she&#39;s Krista Freeland&#39;s Chief of Staff.
