But on the other hand, it also means that there&#39;s no we to be a poster child for malfeasance going forward. So I could go either way. What I will say is they left as weird as they lived, putting a full-page ad to announce that they were done. I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before.

            <div class="said">remember when you talked to us at our thing last time and you&#39;re from a different party so like that helps make our case i think i remember you saying that that actually was was the opposite which is to say that they&#39;re too familiar with with some of the players uh regardless of this color of their jersey that that those players wore in the political arena. Carter, maybe this kind of is the transition then to talk about some of the tactics on the way out. Because I think while we can speculate about the strategy of why they left, we can certainly start strategizing about their communications exit. And let&#39;s first analyze before we strategize, which is to say, there&#39;s two big prongs to it, or three, I should say. A release, a two-on-one interview with Lisa Laflamme, an exclusive, and then a Globe and Mail ad that said, we&#39;re shutting down doors, is turning it into a bit of an endowment for some future work.</div>

And so part strategy, part sort of hypothesizing, what do you think happens to the Kielberger brothers as it relates to their foray into Canadian life? Do you think they have to take a cooling off period? Would you advise that before they ever reenter? Does it have to be another banner? Does it have to be another area of interest?

They seem to be people who want to put things together and make things happen. So why wouldn&#39;t they go to Bay Street and and try their luck in some sort of deals.

            <div class="said">provincially, I can&#39;t say that I am familiar with what goes on in a federal cabinet retreat. I&#39;ve never been invited to one. But on the provincial side, you will usually have a day that&#39;s all about politics, and you will usually then follow that up with a day that&#39;s about government. So you bring in the public servants. What you&#39;re looking for there is really clear alignment between political plans and government plans, so like public service plans. And usually after a cabinet retreat, you&#39;ll follow it up with some sort of caucus retreat so that you make everybody on the same page going forward. And really, it&#39;s about alignment, Zane. It&#39;s about alignment and being one team going forward. Carter,</div>

Because as you know, there&#39;s this interesting tension between the premier&#39;s office or the leader&#39;s office or the principal&#39;s office in this case, and the ministers who also think they&#39;re powerful, but then also this dynamic of the staff, right? People like the chief of staff, the principal secretary, who we&#39;ve discussed on the show, actually wield a lot of power.

But effectively, what happens is there&#39;s, you know, there&#39;s two parts of the cabinet agenda. There&#39;s the part that is euphemistically termed executive discussion, right? Right. And that&#39;s that&#39;s when all of the public servants are not in the room and there&#39;ll be at least at least half a day, but probably a whole day of that where people will talk about political priorities. And that&#39;s when you&#39;re going to get those political presentations, the the idea of, OK, this is how we&#39;re going to stick it to the opposition. This is how we&#39;re going to prepare ourselves for the next election. Here&#39;s you know, they&#39;ll they&#39;ll probably have snuck through the side door.

At the end of the day, though, do you see this as being an exercise, at least in your experience, that has been dominant by the first minister and his or her staff, and that cabinet is really there to agree and come out with a cheering and, you know, sort of tone out of it? Talk to me about that element of the power dynamics, especially when you&#39;re being downloaded something as a minister, rather than actually saying, this is my idea, I&#39;m incubating it from my ministry, and we&#39;re going to go do it.

But this floating of five big ideas is relatively unusual. I&#39;m surprised by that because it now puts the prime minister&#39;s office in a place where they&#39;re saying no to, let&#39;s just say half, like let&#39;s just say they say no to three. So you&#39;ve got proponents of three really big ideas who are now pissed off even though you did two massive So I&#39;m surprised by it. I suspect that we will see some tightening of the ideas in the next couple of days, some strategic leaks out of the cabinet discussions that start to put the framework on the direction that the Liberal government is going to take this</div>

It is tied, as we see in the public opinion polls, between the PCs and the liberals, between Blaine Higgs and Kevin Vickers. Corey, over to you first. First, what are you thinking of what&#39;s happening in Canada&#39;s most bilingual province, is what I&#39;ve heard. I know that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard as a stat that I can use for New Brunswick.

Obviously, they&#39;re looking at AISH. This history around AISH, I&#39;m very close to. We want a leadership by promising to bring AISH payments into a livable state. um and they were indexed in 2018 um which was very important to make sure that uh people in alberta was who can&#39;t work with severe handicaps are able uh to survive uh so anytime you you mess with this you have to understand that most every individual in this category has about seven to ten people who care for them and care about them and so you&#39;re not dealing with 45 000 people who receive H.

You know, we haven&#39;t discussed a lot of American politics here, which, by the way, people can find on You the People, our other podcast where we discuss all things America. But I want to leave it on this one, which is, are you in or out on this strategy by the Trump campaign? They&#39;ve come out today and have started to en masse say, don&#39;t worry, Donald Trump will trail in the polls until he wins on Election Day. And they&#39;re going en masse about this particular strategy. Are you in or out on that strategy for the Trump campaign?</div>

            <div class="said">I have to be in. Is there another strategy? Are the polls suddenly going to shift? Are we going to start to see something? First of all, again, it plays to what people are inclined to believe. His supporters believe that the polls were all wrong before. And frankly, I think a couple of us, I don&#39;t know, maybe me, I was burned by buying the polls. Right. But I</div>

Because he&#39;s going to say the polls are wrong, the polls are wrong, the polls are wrong, I lost. Well, that&#39;s crazy. I was always going to win because the polls were wrong. I mean, like what he&#39;s doing is essentially creating an environment where you can trust none of your senses, or at least if you&#39;re one of his supporters. And so you don&#39;t have that to fall back on and say like, well, well, the polls said he was going to lose and then he lost. You&#39;re like, well, we</div>

            <div class="said">but people wrap themselves into these contortions all of the time. And the example I&#39;ll give you is here in Alberta in 2015, the poll or the election that Rachel Notley won. People talk about the 2015 election as Rachel Notley winning and it being a big surprise and a big polling miss well the conservatives the progressive conservatives at the time didn&#39;t lead in a single public poll all election and rachel notley&#39;s ndp didn&#39;t trail in a single public poll for the last two weeks of the election they were leading in every single one of those polls but people still look back and say well we can&#39;t trust polling because in 2015 rachel notley won and we didn&#39;t see it coming and the polls didn&#39;t see it forgetting they just ignored the polls so there&#39;s like a human psychology thing here that trump benefits from if he can just get his voters to discount the polls writ large, even if he loses.</div>
