            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is... Well, I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t actually pay the $30 for it. So, you know, it was in many ways an act of protest by you.</span>

            <span class="text">Also, another major development of the week, as listeners of this show, frequent listeners will recall, Stephen Carter last week made a excellent prediction that Max Fawcett did not have the reach on social media to really justify any trial ballooning. How about reach enough to get Ryan Reynolds to respond, Stephen? How was that? Listen,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Listen, he was lifted up by Ryan Reynolds. That&#39;s all it was. Max was just lifted. i think that they go back i think they&#39;re old friends max heard the podcast and he called his buddy and said uh lift me up lift me up ryan and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">damn it yeah okay great well i hopefully that&#39;s not a side of things to come after a hot start steven that&#39;s Let&#39;s get we start</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">at this. OK, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, we&#39;re bouncing off of this motherfucker. Guys, the Kielberger brothers, they&#39;re leaving the the the final chapter before the final chapter has emerged. Let&#39;s talk about we for a bit, because I want to talk about the fact that that one of the largest charities in the country is now leaving Canada. But first, let&#39;s start here. Corey, does their departure from Canada change anything as it relates to the investigation or its trajectory? What do you think?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ve been wondering about this myself. I don&#39;t really know, because in some ways, the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fact that they went under as a result of this makes everybody seem a little bit guiltier. And that&#39;s not to say they are, but it kind of creates this error of, well, something was wrong. They went out of business as a result of all of this. But on the other hand, it also means that there&#39;s no we to be a poster child for malfeasance going forward. So I could go either way. What I will say is they left as weird as they lived, putting a full-page ad to announce that they were done. I&#39;ve never seen anything like that before. Talk about a strange way to burn your bankroll on the way out the door.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I do want to get into a discussion of analyzing and strategizing their communications tactics, both from the announcement to the interview to the full page release. But Carter, I&#39;m going to go with the same question that I asked Corey. What do you think in terms of the trajectory of this investigation? Does their departure from Canada change that in your mind?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I was shocked. I mean, I think that we had provided, you know, oodles</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">oodles of advice that was ignored. And it almost felt like you have an organization that wants to do a billion dollars worth of charitable work in the country. And then when it doesn&#39;t get the billion dollars, it just folds up its tent and goes home. like to me it just it doesn&#39;t feel like they were i&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i&#39;m going to say this a true charity right like a true charity uh wants to help and wants to you know has defined a reason uh to help um and these guys you know the reason to help didn&#39;t go away the reason why the wee charity uh existed isn&#39;t over um so it just struck struck me as weird uh that they would just quickly bail um it made me wonder if some of the investigative journalism that had been done into We that I kind of casually dismissed maybe had some more truth to it than perhaps I was willing to believe.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, you know, you say that tongue-in-cheek that they didn&#39;t take our advice, and you were surprised about that, that they didn&#39;t take our advice buried at the 37-minute mark of a podcast. But were you genuinely actually surprised that this was their move? I just want to make sure I get that clear, that they actually took their ball and went home versus a paring down or a refocusing, et cetera. And what does that kind of say to you? Like, give me a bit of conjecture. What does it perhaps say to you that they decided on their own terms to perhaps shock the system and get out?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, why do businesses go out of business? I mean, and let us move the idea that they&#39;re a charity aside just for a moment, because charities are ultimately just businesses that don&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t pay tax. Kind of like how</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">they had for a while, but with the fact that they&#39;re a charity.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But they&#39;re a business, right? And so businesses are formed to serve a need in the community, and people make money at them, and that&#39;s how they pay their own bills, right? So most businesses don&#39;t go under just on a whim. Most businesses disappear because the founders can&#39;t keep it going any longer. There&#39;s all kinds of, you know, there&#39;s financial pressures, there&#39;s a loss in revenue.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That doesn&#39;t appear to be the case with WE, right? WE is not an insolvent charity. It just decided that it couldn&#39;t handle the unknown, frankly, reputation damage that has been brought upon it through trying to help at COVID. And I still don&#39;t think that it necessarily had to be a huge reputation damage. I do think that they made it worse at almost every step. So, yes, I am surprised because most of the time, not a lot of charities go out of business. Most charities are handed down generation to generation and they continue on or they, you know, they fold up when the last dollar has been handed out the door. This is not this is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is not the regular trajectory for a charity to go out in a blaze of glory, nor is it a regular trajectory for a business. Oh, we didn&#39;t get the one billion dollar contract. We&#39;re out of here. that&#39;s generally speaking not how how uh</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, you know, on that point regarding their message, one of the elements that they highlighted in their release as to their departure was that they just weren&#39;t tooled or prepared for the fact that they were to become this proverbial political football. Are you buying that, that a group so sophisticated in terms of its dealings with officials who&#39;ve courted government contracts in the past didn&#39;t necessarily have the tools or the infrastructure or the resources, bandwidth, etc., whatever is required to kind of deal with a fallout in the political world?</span>

Now, the question is, do they really believe those words? Or was this just a nice way to wrap it up? And that to me is less clear. They may have thought that they were unfairly targeted, that this was just bullshit. it uh it wasn&#39;t going to work for them so it was time to leave now to regroup and think about their next moves as individuals i mean now not as well uh not as a charity not as we the charity but um</span>

            <span class="text">remember when you talked to us at our thing last time and you&#39;re from a different party so like that helps make our case i think i remember you saying that that actually was was the opposite which is to say that they&#39;re too familiar with with some of the players uh regardless of this color of their jersey that that those players wore in the political arena. Carter, maybe this kind of is the transition then to talk about some of the tactics on the way out. Because I think while we can speculate about the strategy of why they left, we can certainly start strategizing about their communications exit. And let&#39;s first analyze before we strategize, which is to say, there&#39;s two big prongs to it, or three, I should say. A release, a two-on-one interview with Lisa Laflamme, an exclusive, and then a Globe and Mail ad that said, we&#39;re shutting down doors, is turning it into a bit of an endowment for some future work.</span>

And this is probably the biggest criticism of the We Charity. Did it actually exist for the people that it was serving or did it more exist for the the kielburgers and there&#39;s a case to be made of the latter especially on the exit if all of your communication tactics are</span>

To go through Lisa Laflamme to talk about the loss that this meant for youth rather than going directly to the youth on a platform that they would be on and saying here&#39;s what the loss is and here&#39;s why we&#39;re sorry it&#39;s two very different things so i think it&#39;s a very astute point cory same thing same thing to you give me an analysis of the suite of tactics that they used on their way out and uh kind of what&#39;s your take well</span>

            <span class="text">uh the uh the tactics are um are not towards a but you got to keep in mind one thing like well well young canadians and youth may have been an audience for things like we day the overall we charity uh it had you know its target markets were corporations the c-suite people who were were donating to them they were doing an awful lot of work in africa uh across uh asia as well at certain points although i think they had kind of narrowed down to africa in a large part that my point being i</span>

            <span class="text">don&#39;t think that they needed to let the youths know that they were rolling up they needed um they needed bay street to know and so the globe and mail is not a crazy choice for that but um but on on top of that just to be deeply cynical if i&#39;m the kielbergers if i&#39;m anyone involved with the we charity i don&#39;t want my demise frankly even if i&#39;m just a line employee at we i think if i am let&#39;s just say that i&#39;m kielberger and i am totally altruistic on my way out the door if i am not going out in such a way that i can&#39;t even afford to do it the fact that he can try to frame the demise of we not being about malfeasance is doing a good for the people who work there and the people who are involved in the we charity so i i mean it&#39;s not a crazy easy thing that he would do this now the cynical part of me says that</span>

And that will drive your strategy going forward obviously you are a charity and you need to act in a charitable fashion but within that bandwidth there&#39;s there&#39;s an awful lot of room so i you know it really really depends a communication strategy we pick them apart from the outside all of the time but but this one i have less sense of their motivations and what&#39;s going on in the background to truly tell you i don&#39;t think that anything they did was guaranteed dumb nor do i think anything they did was guaranteed smart it really depends on on those things i was just talking about carter jumping well</span>

We love it. We&#39;re not going to listen, but we love it. Give us some advice for what our future trajectory looks like. And so part strategy, part sort of hypothesizing, what do you think happens to the Kielberger brothers as it relates to their foray into Canadian life? Do you think they have to take a cooling off period? Would you advise that before they ever reenter? Does it have to be another banner? Does it have to be another area of interest? And it does not have to be philanthropy? I&#39;m kind of curious to get your sense as to if those questions are asked, what you would think about as a comms and a strategist?</span>

Let&#39;s accept that as the primary audience for this hypothetical that you&#39;re asking me. Because if their audience was Bay Street, as Corey has theorized, then they&#39;re aiming for something in Bay Street. I mean, these two guys seem to be real strong dealmakers. They seem to be people who want to put things together and make things happen. So why wouldn&#39;t they go to Bay Street and and try their luck in some sort of deals. Apparently, they&#39;re big in real estate. So why wouldn&#39;t they?</span>

So when those reports come back, you can start to see a pattern, and that pattern is what O&#39;Toole should be grabbing onto. The specifics of this particular case don&#39;t matter that much.

Cabinet retreats, why?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s a couple of reasons why. The main one is really to get everybody on the same page as you move forward, whatever</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is usually a bit of, okay, let&#39;s everybody decide here. But for the most part, the PMO or the minister&#39;s or premier&#39;s office will already know what the outcomes of most of these discussions are. And it&#39;s about alignment.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">provincially, I can&#39;t say that I am familiar with what goes on in a federal cabinet retreat. I&#39;ve never been invited to one. But on the provincial side, you will usually have a day that&#39;s all about politics, and you will usually then follow that up with a day that&#39;s about government. So you bring in the public servants. What you&#39;re looking for there is really clear alignment between political plans and government plans, so like public service plans. And usually after a cabinet retreat, you&#39;ll follow it up with some sort of caucus retreat so that you make everybody on the same page going forward. And really, it&#39;s about alignment, Zane. It&#39;s about alignment and being one team going forward. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, you were the chief of staff to a premier. I want to get your take. How is the agenda set for a cabinet retreat? Because as you know, there&#39;s this interesting tension between the premier&#39;s office or the leader&#39;s office or the principal&#39;s office in this case, and the ministers who also think they&#39;re powerful, but then also this dynamic of the staff, right? People like the chief of staff, the principal secretary, who we&#39;ve discussed on the show, actually wield a lot of power. So give me both from the agenda setting and power angle, Who actually retains power to set the agenda and drive the conversation?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">at least in Alberta, what happens is generally and by convention, I suspect it was the same in your day, Stephen, because a lot of the trains on tracks part of a cabinet retreat are managed by the public service and the public services, you know, we like to do things a certain way and then we do those things the same way regardless of who&#39;s in power. But effectively, what happens is there&#39;s, you know, there&#39;s two parts of the cabinet agenda. There&#39;s the part that is euphemistically termed executive discussion, right? Right. And that&#39;s that&#39;s when all of the public servants are not in the room and there&#39;ll be at least at least half a day, but probably a whole day of that where people will talk about political priorities. And that&#39;s when you&#39;re going to get those political presentations, the the idea of, OK, this is how we&#39;re going to stick it to the opposition. This is how we&#39;re going to prepare ourselves for the next election. Here&#39;s you know, they&#39;ll they&#39;ll probably have snuck through the side door. Or, you know, here&#39;s the executive director of the party who&#39;s going to give us an update on, you know, how prepared we are for the next election. All of those things happen on one day with no public servants in the room.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">kind of in parallel. And that&#39;s being managed largely by the public service, still certainly overseen by the chief of staff and senior political staff. But, you know, it&#39;s going to be things like, okay, if it&#39;s the start of a session, we know we need legislation. So what needs to happen and, you know, the head of policy coordination for, you know, we&#39;ll run through all of those things. And what&#39;s this going to look like? And what&#39;s that going to look like? And hey, why don&#39;t we just put a nice thing on where everybody feels good about themselves, where it&#39;s this highlight reel of everything they did as a minister? Because you can get the</span>

            <span class="text">the public service to do that because it&#39;s in their role as minister. And that agenda is often at least proposed and refined and executed by the public service. But again, it&#39;s all at the behest of the boss. It occurs because the boss says so. And then</span>

It&#39;s sometimes, but almost never in my experience, an actual cabinet meeting where people do things like let&#39;s sign OCs and all of that.

            <span class="text">Carter, tell me about the role of cabinet ministers, right? In the external public, they hold these titles that they&#39;re overseeing massive portfolios in our, you know, whether the provincial or federal governments. At the end of the day, though, do you see this as being an exercise, at least in your experience, that has been dominant by the first minister and his or her staff, and that cabinet is really there to agree and come out with a cheering and, you know, sort of tone out of it? Talk to me about that element of the power dynamics, especially when you&#39;re being downloaded something as a minister, rather than actually saying, this is my idea, I&#39;m incubating it from my ministry, and we&#39;re going to go do it. So maybe get your thoughts from that.</span>

            <span class="text">But if it gets closer to 50-50 or worse yet, if it is 60-40 the other way, those decisions are primarily coming out of the premier&#39;s office and sometimes within kind of a decision-making committee. So you might see an operations committee. They can be titled all kinds of different things, but a smaller subset of ministers who are weighing out the political cost of all the decisions. We had a political committee. We had an operations committee. Those committees would sometimes hash out some of the more challenging issues. issues so it&#39;s not quite a dictatorship i don&#39;t mean it to sound like every decision is made entirely by the premier but it has dictatorial elements to it and it is hard for some cabinet ministers to bring any decisions to the table some things</span>

Ministers of major initiatives will likely have presentations, especially if they&#39;re chairing cabinet committees and they&#39;re almost doing reportings for the cabinet retreat. And ministers put things forward. Sometimes the first minister asks for them. Sometimes they are not what the first minister asked for, but the first minister is willing to entertain the conversation.

So tell me, from everything you have heard and all the rules and considerations we just talked about more generally, who do you think has kind of set this agenda for this retreat? And what sort of flex and what do you think we might be seeing coming out of it, considering all the trial ballooning and ground softening, which we covered last week, that&#39;s been going on as to what the liberals have been telegraphing about what to expect from this throne speech? speech</span>

But this floating of five big ideas is relatively unusual. I&#39;m surprised by that because it now puts the prime minister&#39;s office in a place where they&#39;re saying no to, let&#39;s just say half, like let&#39;s just say they say no to three. So you&#39;ve got proponents of three really big ideas who are now pissed off even though you did two massive So I&#39;m surprised by it. I suspect that we will see some tightening of the ideas in the next couple of days, some strategic leaks out of the cabinet discussions that start to put the framework on the direction that the Liberal government is going to take this</span>

I&#39;m thinking about not doing this or somebody in the prime minister&#39;s office in more likelihood because federal cabinets are pretty effing big. That&#39;s a lot of people to manage. So look, you&#39;re going to go in there as a – just as the first minister is going in with like a range they are willing to entertain, you</span>

If you&#39;re a smart minister, you&#39;re going to argue within that range. You&#39;re not going to argue outside of that range because that&#39;s a waste of time unless you&#39;re going for an out-and-out mutiny.

You definitely don&#39;t expect leaks. I would go through the fucking roof if there was a leak from a cabinet retreat that I did not have sanctioned.

            <span class="text">Carter, same questions for you. What do you kind of expect? And maybe I&#39;ll phrase it this way. You know, suppose we talked about the five or six things, and the sixth one, which they&#39;re walking back now is this whole greening concept. Let us not forget that as what was floated. But let&#39;s say you&#39;re a cabinet minister that would be possibly responsible for one of these big policy areas or these massive policy shifts. Are you in that room on the defensive? Are you on the offensive? What is a smart sort of strategy, if I can say, in a cabinet retreat for a minister who is responsible for one of these files, so to speak?</span>

There is no one policy that exists without significant trade-offs and other issues that arise. So, you know, pharmacare, how is that going to impact the other ministries? Well, you know, what&#39;s it doing with seniors, you know, where we already cover a large number of drugs? What are we doing with other departments? Where are we drawing lines? How is this impacting young people? How is this impacting older people? What&#39;s this going to do for the revenue situation? All of these trade-offs need to be discussed, and you have to be a</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I know this is taking on a very granular approach, but I like it because I think we&#39;re unearthing a lot of interesting things from it, which is same question to you again, if you&#39;ve got anything to add around the strategy for a cabinet minister whose file might show up as being on the hot seat for some of the things that the first minister might be considering.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, you don&#39;t want to be defensive because people will, you know, That&#39;s showing a certain weakness. You certainly don&#39;t want to be offensive and say, no, we&#39;re just going to effing do it this way because when you&#39;re a minister and not the first minister, you have to keep in mind that you are in a group of</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and where things can really grind to a halt in government at the cabinet level is when a minister says, well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, that touches my area and I haven&#39;t been consulted because</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">then it becomes like, oh, I don&#39;t know about this. Is this ready to go forward? And it implies a certain sort of tearing that, well, we all know there were ministers in the no and ministers not. It&#39;s a bad look, right? And it&#39;s embarrassing for the first minister as well. So you&#39;ve got to walk a bit of a line here. And if you know, for example, in Carter&#39;s Pharmacare example, seniors hasn&#39;t been talked to about universal pharmacare, you&#39;ve</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;ve got to say things like, now, I know there&#39;s a lot of details to work out in particular with, say, our seniors programs over here. But this is our current stance. And if you come in guns blazing, this is going to fucking happen, you&#39;re going to make enemies. And by the way, if you&#39;re a minister who has ambitions to be more than a minister, that&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s also pretty dumb, because you&#39;re also trying to show that you&#39;ve got a command of files here. So let&#39;s use Pharmacare as an example to go a little bit further here.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Right? If you come in and you say, universal Pharmacare is going to look like this, and then the Minister of Veterans Affairs walks up and says, well, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, veterans get better Pharmacare than that. Like, how are we going to, how are we going to frame, how&#39;s this going to work?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s where you probably run into trouble, and you probably have not gotten the okay from the prime minister to talk about your universal pharmacare with the minister of veterans affairs. It&#39;s just reality. They&#39;re not somebody who&#39;s in there. So you&#39;ve got to, in the moment, sort of be able to adapt to new information that&#39;s going to be coming in, in a way that parking lots it where appropriate, but doesn&#39;t get it killed. Because that&#39;s when the first minister is going to look at you and say, what</span>

            <span class="text">the hell, man? I had you carrying pharmacare and there were so many ambiguities that I, as first minister, felt I had to say, well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? Right. So your your expectation, the expectation of the first minister is you deal with that stuff, both in the way you present it ahead of time and how you deal with those things as they&#39;re coming forward in a way that doesn&#39;t wreck his agenda. So that&#39;s that&#39;s the real challenge for you as a minister who&#39;s been given one of these hot potatoes. I</span>

It is tied, as we see in the public opinion polls, between the PCs and the liberals, between Blaine Higgs and Kevin Vickers. Corey, over to you first. First, what are you thinking of what&#39;s happening in Canada&#39;s most bilingual province, is what I&#39;ve heard. I know that&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard as a stat that I can use for New Brunswick.

So, you know, and it&#39;s not like Pierre Palliev hasn&#39;t been caught breaking the exact same act. So, you know what, you know, this is the way the world works.

            <span class="text">Well, the minister was very clear in what she said, was she wasn&#39;t going to be cutting recipients&#39; benefits, but it was shrouded in opaque statements about what she was going to do. Obviously, they&#39;re looking at AISH. This history around AISH, I&#39;m very close to. We want a leadership by promising to bring AISH payments into a livable state. um and they were indexed in 2018 um which was very important to make sure that uh people in alberta was who can&#39;t work with severe handicaps are able uh to survive uh so anytime you you mess with this you have to understand that most every individual in this category has about seven to ten people who care for them and care about them and so you&#39;re not dealing with 45 000 people who receive H. You&#39;re dealing with half a million people who are going to be pissed. So this is playing with the third rail, as Corey has said.</span>

Give me a scale on 1 to 10, 1 to 10, on what you think of the first few weeks of Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership. You know, he came out this week with a very interesting strategy that tried to go after big corporations, but also try to, you know, support workers, taking a pretty interesting shift. Globe and Mail writing that, you know, Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s pitching himself as an ethical government in waiting. How do you think the first couple of weeks have gone on a scale of 1 to 10 for Aaron O&#39;Toole?</span>

And sure enough, people on my Twitter feed have done that. But let&#39;s just step the hell back for a minute here. I mean, he&#39;s come off as a sensible adult. He is shaking up the political calculus big time by talking about working Canadians. And don&#39;t kid yourself, there&#39;s going to be a ton of resonance for the kind of message that Aaron O&#39;Toole is talking about. And he&#39;s going to leave the Liberals in a deeply uncomfortable place of defending free</span>

Most people want a government that puts us first. You know, and forget about the details. The details are irrelevant. So I think that O&#39;Toole is doing a better job. I think that he&#39;s brought in a better staff. And overall, the entire Conservative Party seems to be working better. And that should be a giant red flag for the liberals, and especially any liberals who are thinking, you know what, this could be the time to do a snap election. Those liberals are nuts.</span>

But I want to leave it on this one, which is, are you in or out on this strategy by the Trump campaign? They&#39;ve come out today and have started to en masse say, don&#39;t worry, Donald Trump will trail in the polls until he wins on Election Day.

            <span class="text">Well, I think it&#39;s not even a bad strategy for him if he doesn&#39;t win, right? Because he&#39;s going to say the polls are wrong, the polls are wrong, the polls are wrong, I lost. Well, that&#39;s crazy. I was always going to win because the polls were wrong. I mean, like what he&#39;s doing is essentially creating an environment where you can trust none of your senses, or at least if you&#39;re one of his supporters. And so you don&#39;t have that to fall back on and say like, well, well, the polls said he was going to lose and then he lost. You&#39;re like, well, we</span>

And the example I&#39;ll give you is here in Alberta in 2015, the poll or the election that Rachel Notley won. People talk about the 2015 election as Rachel Notley winning and it being a big surprise and a big polling miss well the conservatives the progressive conservatives at the time didn&#39;t lead in a single public poll all election and rachel notley&#39;s ndp didn&#39;t trail in a single public poll for the last two weeks of the election they were leading in every single one of those polls but people still look back and say well we can&#39;t trust polling because in 2015 rachel notley won and we didn&#39;t see it coming and the polls didn&#39;t see it forgetting they just ignored the polls so there&#39;s like a human psychology thing here that trump benefits from if he can just get his voters to discount the polls writ large, even if he loses.</span>
