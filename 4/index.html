Does this highlight the need for every campaign to take security more seriously? What are politicians supposed to do when protested or heckled?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the race for the race - and the increasingly public debate about how the Liberals should set the rules for the Leadership Contest to come.

How do you structure a contest when you might be in the polls in a month and still set your party up for success? With the Liberals so down in the polls, why should anyone care?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang assemble. But really, what with Donald Trump and the state of the world and all, what&#39;s the point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter helplessly wallow in the upcoming US election before Stephen Carter rallies to make a bold Alberta UCP leadership prediction at the 44 minute mark. Is canvassing dead? Can Danielle Smith survive her review with &#34;a number that starts with a six&#34;? And does Carter even know what he predicted at 43:30? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey loses faith in campaigning, Stephen loses faith in Saskatchewan, and Zain tries to create new slang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the fizzled Liberal coup, a Pierre Poilievre policy announcement, the BC election results - all while watching and not getting results for the Saskatchewan election. Is there any additional chapter in the Liberal caucus rebellion, or is this the end of the book? Have campaigns forgotten how to matter? And what goes it with hitting .400 in baseball anyhow? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

But the great ones always find a way to slow it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are on the clock. With twelve minutes for each segment, they need to tackle the BC election, the Trudeau revolt, US politics and a mystery bonus section that Zain will graciously let them choose. Is Harris&#39; campaign dying a vibe-based death? Who will win the showdown at the Liberal caucus? And can we all agree we don&#39;t care about the Speaker in BC? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang assemble late Friday afternoon to talk about growing unrest in Ottawa, growing sloganeering in Alberta, and the closing hours of the BC election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter go from east to west - discussing the strategic considerations of the growing Liberal revolt against Justin Trudeau, the Alberta &#34;scrap the cap&#34; ad campaign and BC&#39;s impending election. Will Trudeau survive next week? Have campaign war rooms become too powerful at the expense of campaign success? And why would the word chicken make somebody so upset that they&#39;d commit financial crimes? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang reunite to talk early 20th century literature and reports of Liberal MPs collecting each other&#39;s pledges to support leadership change. The odds of Justin Trudeau&#39;s leadership surviving October may have dropped, but the odds of podcast adventure have just increased to 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a growing rebel faction within the Liberal caucus, and what each &#34;side&#34; needs to be doing now. How does a Prime Minister&#39;s Office deal with reports of rebellion? How do rebels keep momentum? And of all the gifts the magi could bring, is a change in Liberal leadership at this time the most cosmically ironic? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

You know, just another week in Alberta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Alberta Premier&#39;s apparent embrace of the &#34;chemtrail&#34; conspiracy theory and new legislation targeted towards transgender youth in Alberta. Will Danielle Smith&#39;s comments be any more disqualifying than a dozen other so-called disqualifying comments? Is the Alberta NDP engaged in a strategy of duelling videos with the UCP government? And what&#39;s the proper price to expense for an intimacy coach, anyhow? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Zain runs Stephen and Corey through a &#34;what-if&#34; scenario based on an Ottawa rumour that won&#39;t die: what if the Liberals decided to prorogue parliament? Would they? Could they? Should they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss proroguing Parliament - whether it&#39;s something Justin Trudeau could do, whether it would serve any purpose and what it would mean for all of the parties. Is prorogation a &#34;circuit breaker&#34; that would allow the government to a chance to reset? How could the Liberals sell it? And do we think Stephen would lower or raise his rate to run the Liberal campaign? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Are voters going to end up annoyed by the fine print on the Rustad rebate? Were the Bloc and NDP smart to diffuse the confidence motion so quickly?
