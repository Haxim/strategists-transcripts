        <p>Zain Velji has an existential crisis. Stephen Carter has an upcoming nap. In between, the gang talk religious or cultural groups wielding their political power, national pharmacare and Pierre Poilievre's position that biological males should be excluded from female places. Plus more!</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the national pharmacare/national "pharmacare"/"national" pharmacare proposal as well as cultural voting blocs and Pierre Poilievre's stance on transgender rights. Is pharmacare a win for Jagmeet Singh? Has Pierre Poilievre fallen into a polling trap? And how does one book voyage on the "Noah's Ark of Drugs"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I then also threw in, Corey, and this is where it might get problematic, I threw in the broader statement, I like when groups that are cultural or religious such as this one own their power. hour now now cory on whatsapp on whatsapp i&#39;m being celebrated i&#39;m getting the first the first couple hours they&#39;re like dude the talk&#39;s all about you a lot of love a lot of love from the community i&#39;m like you know what i am a hero of the community this is good yeah they</div>

Number one, on the specifics, I&#39;m glad that the Muslim community, at least this National Council of Canadian Muslims, has put out this letter. I believe in what they&#39;re trying to do by forcing the hand of politicians. I&#39;ve largely been a believer for a long time that we have, as minority communities or religious communities, largely voiceless ones like the Muslim community, been too okay with politicians just coming and using us and treating us like a voter block and not expressing our power. So I&#39;m happy with the fact that I said that. I&#39;m not so happy that the implication here, Carter, is that on files that I&#39;m absolutely opposed to, as in these Muslim groups or certain Muslim groups, I shouldn&#39;t say these, now taking a cue to say, you know what? Yeah, you can&#39;t come in and be pro-trans rights if you want to speak. I&#39;m not saying anyone has said that, but the implication is certainly there. So the question to me is, A, did I fuck up? And B, and the answer could be yes, and I&#39;m happy to take it. But B, what you guys think of communities using</div>

This was, like, one thing is clear, I think, across the board, regardless of your politics in the broader Muslim community, and I know there&#39;s varying, like, politics all the way from hyper-progressive, like today, I was part of a WhatsApp email blast, and an email blast simultaneously being like, we are moving to the federal NDP, that is where this community needs to move. move. That&#39;s the only community supporting us. That&#39;s the only community that&#39;s on the right side of what we care about. All the way to, you know, we stand with Daniel Smith, Al-Rashid Mosque sort of statement, which has been circulating around WhatsApp sort of thing, which is the medium that&#39;s most popular amongst certain groups. But Corey, like, what do you think of communities feeling frustration have to draw this red line? I find that fascinating, because we&#39;ve all for the longest time talked about widest tent, coalition building, reasonable reasonable compromise. That&#39;s how you, you know, use power effectively. But I&#39;m curious what you think of this, because when you follow this up to its rational conclusion, as you&#39;ve just said, we could end up in a very weird spot where this lesson, if applied broadly, ends up to perhaps hurt democracy in some way, although I could maybe even argue the opposite, which is like, democracy should be difficult and uncomfortable and not necessarily served on a silver platter for politicians, although I&#39;m not making that argument.

Like, have we gotten into such, you know, simple headline-based politics that does the substance of what the framework first step even matter? Or the fact that the NDP can go back and say, we did it. We&#39;ve gotten pharma care on track. we are going to get this done. And is that just a political win anymore? Like, help me delineate where we are in this world of politics, where substance needs to ground certain things, but doesn&#39;t need to ground other things.

I think that there is a reason why they did this in this fashion, and that&#39;s because, especially the people who vote Liberal and New Democrat, these will be very popular measures, and they are generally perceived by the population as a good thing.

I don&#39;t think it was a super smart idea, but it was essentially to try to grab some of that populist language and and say like hey you can&#39;t trust the liberals to deliver these programs because they&#39;re too bay street they&#39;re too in the pocket of uh you know all of the various industries that we need to regulate and kind of push out of conversations like pharma care and uh but and that&#39;s why you vote for ndp and that&#39;s why you send ndp mps to ottawa and we get results that&#39;s what i think he was going for i think the reality of such commentary is anybody who is critical about a narrow scope will be like well sounds like the big pharma back liberals fucking rolled you you dummy and uh you&#39;ve just given a great opportunity to turn a win into a loss and that is the fundamental problem they&#39;ve got to be united in presenting this as a win at least until we have the details before they start undercutting it by suggesting that one you know that their counterparty here that their partner here partner Keep in mind, they&#39;ve got a supply and confidence agreement with them.

He&#39;s actively stepped into the debate, deliberately, on trans rights. He did it this past week, saying biological males should be banned from women&#39;s sports, change rooms, and bathrooms. This, of course, on the heels of him kind of arguably flubbing a question earlier on puberty blockers, in some ways kind of, you know, on the facts, not necessarily knowing what they were, conflating them with different types of hormones. Quote, female spaces should be exclusively for females, not biological males. He said in his typical Pierre Polyev voice, definitive, kind of looking at them being like, you know, what else would it be? He made the comments after being asked if as prime minister, he would introduce legislation to prevent transgender women or biological men from participating in female sports. supports carter he stepped into the debate this is this is not the pure polyam from two and a half weeks ago where everyone was silent and we&#39;re going to just you know try to get through this no we&#39;re now leaning into this is this a strategically sound or right move by pure polyam in your mind well</div>

He kind of went after the oil and gas industry for dragging its heels, for conservative politicians, for fooling Canadians. Both of those things made headlines in their own way. Are you in or out on this version of Justin Trudeau? And perhaps by extension, do you think we&#39;ll see more of it?</div>

But regardless of what he tries to do and run on, he&#39;s not going to win if it&#39;s not a winning formula. And I don&#39;t think this is proving to be a winning formula for him. I think there&#39;s a group of people who feel fucking fantastic when the Prime Minister fights with the Prime Minister&#39;s enemies. I think there&#39;s a lot of other people who say, yeah, this smug prick, more of the same, and he&#39;s got to watch that.
