            <span class="text">a situation. The question is, did I fuck up? Because there&#39;s two ways to think about it. Number one, on the specifics, I&#39;m glad that the Muslim community, at least this National Council of Canadian Muslims, has put out this letter. I believe in what they&#39;re trying to do by forcing the hand of politicians. I&#39;ve largely been a believer for a long time that we have, as minority communities or religious communities, largely voiceless ones like the Muslim community, been too okay with politicians just coming and using us and treating us like a voter block and not expressing our power. So I&#39;m happy with the fact that I said that. I&#39;m not so happy that the implication here, Carter, is that on files that I&#39;m absolutely opposed to, as in these Muslim groups or certain Muslim groups, I shouldn&#39;t say these, now taking a cue to say, you know what? Yeah, you can&#39;t come in and be pro-trans rights if you want to speak. I&#39;m not saying anyone has said that, but the implication is certainly there. So the question to me is, A, did I fuck up? And B, and the answer could be yes, and I&#39;m happy to take it. But B, what you guys think of communities using</span>

            <span class="text">what do you think about communities feeling like they&#39;re forced to use the stick rather than the carrot? And I find that so fascinating. This was, like, one thing is clear, I think, across the board, regardless of your politics in the broader Muslim community, and I know there&#39;s varying, like, politics all the way from hyper-progressive, like today, I was part of a WhatsApp email blast, and an email blast simultaneously being like, we are moving to the federal NDP, that is where this community needs to move. move. That&#39;s the only community supporting us. That&#39;s the only community that&#39;s on the right side of what we care about. All the way to, you know, we stand with Daniel Smith, Al-Rashid Mosque sort of statement, which has been circulating around WhatsApp sort of thing, which is the medium that&#39;s most popular amongst certain groups. But Corey, like, what do you think of communities feeling frustration have to draw this red line? I find that fascinating, because we&#39;ve all for the longest time talked about widest tent, coalition building, reasonable reasonable compromise. That&#39;s how you, you know, use power effectively. But I&#39;m curious what you think of this, because when you follow this up to its rational conclusion, as you&#39;ve just said, we could end up in a very weird spot where this lesson, if applied broadly, ends up to perhaps hurt democracy in some way, although I could maybe even argue the opposite, which is like, democracy should be difficult and uncomfortable and not necessarily served on a silver platter for politicians, although I&#39;m not making that argument.

This means you will get the medicine you need. need. Stephen Carter, Alberta has just signaled a couple hours ago, if I&#39;m not mistaken, that they&#39;re not going to be participating in this plan. Give to me the political win that this is for the federal NDP. This has been across the headlines for the last number of weeks, the ongoing sort of grinded out negotiations. Diabetes medication is in, it&#39;s out, it&#39;s in, it&#39;s out, and it&#39;s in, turns out.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">nobody thinks it is in any way appropriate that diabetes medicine costs as much as it does. So, again, from a comms perspective, like, the two absolute least objectionable components are now in the front window here.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Which almost implies that the rest of it is going to be harder to do. Is that not right, Carter? Like, and I guess the question here to me is, does any of the materiality here matter? Does any of the substance here even matter, right? Like, or is it just the presence of the fact that there is substance and we can call it pharma care? You know what I mean? Like, have we gotten into such, you know, simple headline-based politics that does the substance of what the framework first step even matter? Or the fact that the NDP can go back and say, we did it. We&#39;ve gotten pharma care on track. we are going to get this done. And is that just a political win anymore? Like, help me delineate where we are in this world of politics, where substance needs to ground certain things, but doesn&#39;t need to ground other things. What do you think of this in terms of that, if you look that as a spectrum?</span>

He&#39;s actively stepped into the debate, deliberately, on trans rights. He did it this past week, saying biological males should be banned from women&#39;s sports, change rooms, and bathrooms. This, of course, on the heels of him kind of arguably flubbing a question earlier on puberty blockers, in some ways kind of, you know, on the facts, not necessarily knowing what they were, conflating them with different types of hormones. Quote, female spaces should be exclusively for females, not biological males. He said in his typical Pierre Polyev voice, definitive, kind of looking at them being like, you know, what else would it be? He made the comments after being asked if as prime minister, he would introduce legislation to prevent transgender women or biological men from participating in female sports. supports carter he stepped into the debate this is this is not the pure polyam from two and a half weeks ago where everyone was silent and we&#39;re going to just you know try to get through this no we&#39;re now leaning into this is this a strategically sound or right move by pure polyam in your mind well</span>

Even if you don&#39;t have the conviction on this file, do you know who we are in the broader societal spectrum here? Let&#39;s not kid ourselves in some way. Corey, your thoughts on this.
