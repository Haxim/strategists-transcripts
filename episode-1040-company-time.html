            <span class="text">There are two openings right now, or two obvious openings in political life if you&#39;re a resident of Ontario. One of them is leadership for the Ontario Liberal Party. And one of them, of course, as we&#39;ve discussed on one of the last episodes I was on, is Mayor of Toronto.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">What I find really interesting about this, Carter, is that both of these seem to be relatively short, relatively quick turnaround sort of races. They will appeal to those that have name recognition. Stephen Carter, when you think about people that have name recognition, it&#39;s largely sitting politicians. And you&#39;re seeing that. For the Ontario Liberal leadership, you&#39;re seeing Yasser Naqvi, sitting MP, former Ontario MPP and minister. minister, Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, also an MP, looking at this sort of spot as well. And then on the mayoral side, you&#39;re seeing some of the names of yesteryear kind of kick the tires. You&#39;re seeing some sitting councillors, but you&#39;re also seeing folks like Mitzi Hunter, a sitting MPP, now looking for a job potentially as mayor.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I find this really interesting, Carter, this concept of politicians looking for jobs while they have them. In every other domain, in every other field, of course, you secure your next gig before you quit this one. But in politics, we&#39;ve kind of looked at it in a negative light, kind of being like, do you kind of try to get one job while you have the other? What do you really represent? So, Carter, I think I want to use today&#39;s episode to talk about this phenomenon. I&#39;ve called this quiet quitting, and it&#39;s not quiet quitting, or is it? it. But Carter, give me your thoughts on this. Politicians with existing jobs seeking other jobs, there&#39;s a strategy behind how to do it well. There&#39;s a strategy about how you explore it properly. How do you balance your constituents that you have, specifically around the constituents that you want, which might be different? And should it be derided in politics? And maybe we&#39;ll start with that particular question, Carter. Have we for the longest time looked at those that that are seeking other opportunities in political life in a negative light incorrectly?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that, you know, first of all, you are far more likely to move within your field than outside of your field, regardless of what your field may be, right? So if you&#39;re in tech, you&#39;re likely to move within the tech industry. It is highly unlikely that you&#39;re going to move from tech to some completely other different field. Now, which doesn&#39;t say that it doesn&#39;t happen. Of course, we have new entrants into politics all the time. But the two high profile positions that you spoke about, we talked about how, at least for the mayor of Toronto version, it was very likely to be someone who already had a past reputation, because it&#39;s going to be very difficult to assign and create different, you know, a brand position without having an existing one. And without being known, I can&#39;t see this being a particularly easy</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">easy path in the short term for a politician to take. So this being a known politician is probably the only way to get through. So of course, we&#39;re going to see people whose names are already known. And it&#39;s not like when you apply within your field, right? Like you put your name forward and no one&#39;s talking about you applying for different jobs because it&#39;s all done behind closed doors when you&#39;re a politician it&#39;s all done out in the open and that out in the open is testing</span>

            <span class="text">what i think is interesting about these particular races is the names i&#39;ve just mentioned don&#39;t have to quit their existing job to explore this opportunity right i think that&#39;s one of the reasons that&#39;s one of the reasons that you&#39;re hearing the knack fees and the earth&#39;s expense because they&#39;re not leaving the liberal federal liberal caucus to pursue an opportunity at the provincial level. And same with Mitzi Hunter. She&#39;s not giving up her MPP seat as a member of the Ontario Liberals to pursue this as mayor. The question is, Corey, should they have to? Because all of this is out in the open, should you have to? Politics has been given this special sort of like you explore new opportunities in the open, you do exploratory committees, you do it all in the open. But is this a sacrifice to your current job, your current role and responsibility, that you are now seeking this without necessarily having to risk your current gig that you own? Talk to me about your thoughts on that before we get into like how one does it and your experiences, if you&#39;ve had any with politicians that have kind of tried to not jump ship, I say that so negatively, but tried to pursue other opportunities. Your thoughts first, Corey. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, look, first of all, voters can decide whether them looking for exits in different gig down the road is ultimately disqualifying. And I think that is is the safeguard that we should be relying on and not creating rules around this otherwise. But, you know, it tells us a little bit about how politics is perceived. And in reality, federal issues are different from provincial issues, they&#39;re different from municipal issues. But in practice, voters sort of see them all as the same bucket of service, right? They&#39;re taking a philosophical approach to the same general types of issues, and they&#39;re going to manage them. Because there&#39;s an argument to be made that having experience as a federal politician is a pretty piss-poor experience for a provincial politician. Our</span>

            <span class="text">we tend to perceive looking at leadership opportunities at different levels no different than we perceive looking at leadership opportunities at the same level because you can make a lot of the same arguments you just made when somebody decides to explore running for leader of their current caucus right like where your eyes not on the ball oh you&#39;re not eyes not on the ball you&#39;re not thinking about your constituency you&#39;re all of a sudden thinking about all of these other issues that have to do with you know the province as a whole or the nation as a whole rather than the thing i elected you to do</span>

And when you&#39;re a minister, you are being taken away from those issues. And so we do tend to look at these things and just allow that certain permeability. And I think as voters, we just see it all as like one greasy ladder, everybody&#39;s trying to climb however they can, and maybe they leap to the other side or not. And we seem to be totally fine with that. And the people going out there, they always say sort of the same thing, like, well, I&#39;m just looking for other ways to serve, different ways to serve i want to continue to serve my constituents but in a different manner right and um again voters can be the ultimate judge of that but i will say that like the strivers in politics in my experience they are taking their eye off that local constituency ball they they really are and and at the end it might actually be better for their constituency on net because they have control of the reins yeah yeah but but it is different and it does take you away from from that constituency work, that we want our MPPs, our MPs, our MLAs, our council people. It takes it away from that. Yeah,</span>

A minister spends significantly less time on their local constituency than a backbencher, a leader even less, right? But to your point, they have the reins of power of being able to shift certain things, one would say. So maybe they serve their constituents deeper. more,</span>

We seem to forgive that quite easily, striving within your own party, striving to become a minister, right? Like that&#39;s just expected, but to go look for another political job, there&#39;s a bit of eye rolling. And I&#39;m going to talk about the eye rolling from the public, but there&#39;s also a bit of eye rolling and consternation that that one&#39;s own caucus can have. If you&#39;re a NACFI or a Nerskin Smith being like, the fuck, man, like we&#39;re fighting for our lives. You got Pierre Polyev here, like, and you&#39;re looking for another job. You&#39;re looking for an off ramp. So talk to me about like, let&#39;s talk about the public first. And then I want to talk about like the caucus sort of thing, Carter. Yeah.</span>

Now you have to, to, you know, make a pledge to give away your salary or that you&#39;re going to give it you&#39;re going to donate it to charity or something along those lines so it doesn&#39;t appear that you&#39;re you feel like that&#39;s just like when you</span>

            <span class="text">with the person, the president. So either the middle school or the president, when they had their position, they said, no, I&#39;m going to take the salary. Now, you can say that&#39;s self-serving, but the philosophy behind it, the logic behind it, the reason we pay politicians in the first place, because politicians were not always paid. is because by paying them, you are not excluding people that were otherwise excluded. Like, you couldn&#39;t have a day laborer being an MP in England if the MP was expected to pay their own salary, right? And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so, you know, the reason we pay these people is not entirely because of the work they do, but because we do think it&#39;s a public service and we want it to be available to everybody from all walks of life. And the more you create this expectation that when you start doing things like this, you give your salary away. Well, imagine you&#39;re an MP who is like a mother of three, who</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">who is a single mother, does not have any other income earners, and would actually not mind being leader of their party, or perhaps leader of a provincial party. But now they simply cannot do it because an expectation has been set that they have to give away their salary. Despite having been elected, despite this potentially being a different way to serve, you know, it becomes an avenue only available to a certain class of politicians. So I&#39;m generally pretty disdainful anytime a politician gives away their salary or says I&#39;m only going to take a dollar a year or any of that nonsense for those reasons.</span>

            <span class="text">being the the candidate, you know, we would we shouldn&#39;t be putting this this block. I like the idea. The general population thinks that these skills are transferable, obviously, to anybody who&#39;s worked in the municipal frame, as well as the provincial frame and the federal frame. They&#39;re not transferable skills.</span>

            <span class="text">They&#39;re extremely different skills, but that shouldn&#39;t really matter. By keeping them at least transferable, we keep a population that is at least looking at different options. It&#39;s hard enough to get people involved in politics without constraining it and saying, you&#39;re going to just be a federal politician and you can&#39;t seek the next office. You can&#39;t seek your next opportunity until such time as you resign and move away from this particular opportunity. That would be very counterproductive to us as a society. And I think that that&#39;s what we should be getting back to in general is, does this benefit us as a society that these names are coming forward and being put forward to take these positions? And my argument would be, yes, having experienced politicians put their names forward is certainly going to help the city of Toronto and the Ontario Liberal Party more than having an inexperienced pool of talent.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">You know, Corey, this to me is different than the Horvath and the Del Duca experience where they both lose and they&#39;re both finding another job, right? Carter makes a good point about this is a profession. You can find gigs in that profession, right? I don&#39;t have problems with that. What I wanted to kind of talk about is this concept of if one of these politicians, let&#39;s just use Yasser Naqvi, right? Right. This is a former MPP justice minister, now MP in Ottawa, you know, openly exploring running to be the next leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, as kind of stated previously. Premier would be an ideal gig for him. He&#39;s also part of the Trudeau Liberal Caucus right now. So if you approached you, Corey, saying some of the basic questions, should I be feeling guilty about trying to seek this job while being part of Trudeau&#39;s caucus? Should I? How would you how would how would you, Corey? How should I navigate my colleagues around this? How should I talk about? Give me some like I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to build like a rules list, but I&#39;m curious, like if we want to like make this gig in this profession robust, we want to have people like make money that that they can live on, explore other opportunities, like, you know, have personal growth, have quality names to Carter&#39;s point that can, you know, move across different occupations. How would you talk to him as a strategist, but also as kind of a supporter of the overall ecosystem, if that makes sense? Like, what were some of the things you tell him around, like, should I feel guilty? How should I talk to my caucus about this? Because those are concerns.</span>

          <div class="turn">

And there&#39;s lots of versions of that. And there&#39;s, you know, like a very talented MP could</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">could probably do that better than, you know, while still looking for another job than an incompetent MP who&#39;s just basically taking oxygen up in the House of Commons. And there&#39;s an awful lot of them, right? So, look, I think it&#39;s fine as long as you&#39;re continuing to meet a certain base level expectation of behavior. You&#39;ve got to be clear with your colleagues and your leader about what that might mean. You should ask your leader to be clear with you about what his or her expectations would be as you&#39;re going throughout this process. and, you know, what might actually have to drag you back to the job that you are currently doing. And if you can do that, then I think that it&#39;s all fair ball. And in some ways, I think about it not too dissimilarly from when, you know, other people in a corporate setting are looking for a role. As long as you&#39;re still doing your job, you&#39;re free to look for other jobs, right? But, you know, and the job of MP is a very flexible job, and there are a lot of ways that you can do it.

But also make sure this is something you&#39;re actually interested in and actually want to do and that you&#39;re not just striving or looking for the next thing for the sake of the next thing. This is the opportunity to move forward. word because you don&#39;t get to just ping pong around perpetually do a thousand different roles pick the things that matter to you and go towards them and be thoughtful about it because the last thing you want to be is the guy or the gal who&#39;s going to run for everything whenever it comes up right that&#39;s a challenge well</span>

And it&#39;s awkward. It is awkward because like Corey, you make a point around the corporate world, but like not many people get to prance around being like, I&#39;m going to do my nine to five, but I&#39;m going to do it nine to two. And I&#39;m going to spend two to five finding the other gig, right? Like, you know, some people have the ability to get away. Most of us don&#39;t. So the fact is this is all what is happening right now. He&#39;s fucking kind of awkward, right? Like, and there is that bit of that eye rolling and what&#39;s going on. So Carter, I want to talk about it. Once you&#39;ve made a decision that you want to to pursue it, how you do it. And then I also want to talk about Corey&#39;s point, whether you do it, because Corey, you make some really good points around how do you access job match, make sure it&#39;s the right gig for you, like striving in any direction versus one direction. Carter, give me your thoughts on this. I know you&#39;re jumping to get in, but I wanted to maybe set up a bit of a framework for us to consider.</span>

How do you convince them that, like, you&#39;re going to be a good, effective team player, even though you&#39;re going to do your job? You&#39;re going to do your nine to five and a nine to two.

Oh, I get his committee postings, right? There&#39;s actually opportunity that&#39;s created for your colleagues when you step away like this. So it&#39;s a bit of a different conversation. So I actually don&#39;t agree or don&#39;t think that your big challenge is your relationship with your colleagues. It&#39;s more like, hey, gang, I&#39;m going to do this for a while. Still love you all. Try to make sure you continue to be friends with them. And obviously, if your long-term ambitions were, for example, to be premier or prime minister of this country, you don&#39;t want to burn those bridges or have them all saying that bastard wasn&#39;t here when we needed him.

Are you helping someone run for leader in the next leadership? and they will owe you and they will carry you up and put you into one of those star positions where, you know, you&#39;re the guy who or you&#39;re the woman who got the leader elected because you have all these great relationships across the country and you opened up all these doors for them on their leadership. So if you&#39;re going to run to be the leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, fail and then go back, then when you do your campaign to be the leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, You better have so many fucking good relationships, even with the person who beat you, that you still have value to the next potential leader or to the existing leader.

It&#39;s like the, why are you running? Why? Right? Because I&#39;ve only ever heard you care about, you know, provincial issues before, or I&#39;ve only ever heard you care about federal issues before or municipal issues. And now you seem to want to go to another level. And I&#39;m always looking for them to show some enthusiasm for the core material, because it&#39;s also very dangerous to become a politician who only cares about politics. And I think politicians who are rooted in caring about something else are more successful politicians. So run federally because you care about the place of Canada in the world. Run provincially because you care about healthcare and education delivery. Run municipally because you care about the street lights that are out and crime and safety in downtown Calgary. But if you don&#39;t have something anchoring you to the job besides your ambition in the job, you are in a very dangerous place. And politicians need to acknowledge that about themselves.

There&#39;s a by-election here. I could do it risk-free. I just need to raise a couple hundred grand. I put my name in. If I don&#39;t get it, I keep my current gig. What do you say to them when they approach you with that? Corey&#39;s talked about that more fundamental philosophical ask why you&#39;re doing it, show an interest in the material. What else are you asking them yourself when you&#39;ve had this personal experience? Well,</span>

And for example, if you were going to run for the leadership of the Ontario Liberals, but you were very interested in being in cabinet next time, then you best be talking, you know, you best be setting as one of your campaign objectives to have the very best, most solid campaign infrastructure so that you know that campaign infrastructure can be used on on the next campaign right the the the development of of the next element of your campaign so these you can have multiple reasons or you know you can you can layer on different objectives but if</span>

            <span class="text">Well, let me underline that, though, because if let&#39;s just imagine in this scenario, you actually want to be in cabinet, right? And we&#39;re talking federal cabinet, right? We&#39;re using the Yasser situation. Federal cabinet. We&#39;re using Yasser as the example here. Let&#39;s say that you want to be in federal cabinet. Well, you&#39;re running for leadership at a different level and showing your chops as leader is maybe not even the skills I&#39;m looking for, But you being a strong number two to a leader, being somebody who can deliver for a leader, build those networks, be the lieutenant for somebody else, that&#39;s maybe more transferable skills for that ministerial job that you&#39;re talking about down the road. So that&#39;s a really interesting point Stephen made, and I think it&#39;s a strong one. You don&#39;t always need to run. You can take advantage of the contest in different ways if you&#39;re trying to build your profile, show your worth, build your network. And</span>

            <span class="text">And kind of bringing up Yasser as an example, he kind of did that with trying to back the mayoral candidate in Ottawa that ultimately did win in that sense, even going against some of his colleagues in his party in that sense. So it&#39;s a good political point. Carter, I want to ask you finally about this. There are going to be politicians who say, oh, I&#39;m scared to have that conversation with the leader. I&#39;m scared to let down my colleagues. I&#39;m going to take to it. Well, then</span>

We&#39;ve made fun of it on the show as we&#39;ve drafted me for a bunch of bullshit. But Carter, talk to me about this because where does this come? Where&#39;s the the genesis of this does it hold any strategic value the draft whatever draft yasser for ontario liberal leader and nine likes on the facebook page i&#39;m i&#39;m i&#39;m razzing him that&#39;s not how many it has i don&#39;t even know if he&#39;s got that page but how many times have we seen this as as a tactic so can we talk about this tactic and if it holds any value part of person then cory well</span>

Another question might be, where did it come from that people started lobbying for themselves? Because that was the unusual thing.

            <span class="text">I mean, if you&#39;d listened to a rather podcast, you&#39;d know all these answers. But there&#39;s a thing with the draft campaign that it still does. It&#39;s still, you know, the draft campaign allows you to have a list of 600 people that you can put into a room when you actually launch. You know how hard it is? I mean, many politicians have lists, but with the privacy laws and things like that now it&#39;s harder and harder to access those lists it&#39;s harder to get the lists out you talk about jumping from the political from the from the provincial party I&#39;ll tell you something provincial parties lock down their databases pretty quick when they find out you&#39;re going for a different level you&#39;re not going to have the same access to the database because they don&#39;t want you accessing their data to drag out 600 people for for your launch so So, you</span>

You know, people, your community should come to you and say, you know, I really, you know, Corey might experience this sometime in his life, Zane, you and I highly likely not to.

I have to ask it to you in this way. Fine, fabulous, or fucked? How fucked, fine, or fabulous this is for Justin Trudeau, the way the call for an inquiry has been going on the foreign interference on our elections. Trudeau has slapped down questions about it in an inquiry. uh he said it&#39;s not going to happen opposition mps have voted for for for an inquiry cory</span>

It&#39;s problematic for us as Canadians. And I think that the thing that he needed to do, even though it was perhaps locally not advantageous for him or his party, was to call this inquiry because this is just going to be a cloud that grows. It&#39;s like smog with no wind, right? It&#39;s just going to float there. And yeah, I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s thinking on this one. I understand the idea that you don&#39;t want to jeopardize people&#39;s faith in elections. But when there are legitimate questions, people need legitimate answers. And there are legitimate questions here. Carter,</span>

But before I ask you whether that&#39;s an inevitability that will enter into public inquiry territory, I&#39;ll do that next. Fine, fabulous or fucked, his current state right now, state of affairs, if you&#39;re analyzing, is it fine or is it fucked? I&#39;m going to take fabulous out of the equation. What is it? It&#39;s</span>

I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a very good reason to not have an inquiry from a bureaucratic point of view. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s ongoing investigations by CSIS. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots of foreign intelligence involvement and back and forth with the diplomacy side as well. But I think at this point it is becoming an electoral issue. And electoral issues are never solved by bureaucracy. Electoral issues are solved by politics. And that means he&#39;s going to have to bite the bullet and likely do some sort of a public inquiry, which does not, by the way, mean a fulsome wholesale</span>

            <span class="text">asking the same question a different way cory does this limit his range of motion to call an election and what if we we have a government that gets defeated like we entered some interesting territory which we can pick up we&#39;ll end with your thoughts on this we&#39;ll pick it all up again</span>

            <span class="text">yeah like i think every party should tread carefully as this is still a lingering issue out there. And it is bigger than China. You know, there&#39;s questions about Russia. Frankly, there&#39;s questions about the United States and the influence that&#39;s coming up here.

And we need an inquiry to resolve this relatively promptly. We need solutions to to come out of that that are embraced by all parties. And we need to be able to turn the page because it all starts with integrity of elections and people&#39;s confidence in the integrity of elections. And you can argue, and I&#39;m sure in an inquiry, there will be arguments on both sides as to whether this affected the integrity of the last election.</span>
