Grand order, yeah, in this country. He can talk all the time. You still work with him on speech techniques, bad habits that they have, and you try and eliminate them for the big speech. None of that appears to have been done for Trump. The second thing you work on is the actual content of the speech, the flow and the story that&#39;s going to be constructed. And I&#39;d say that this is – I haven&#39;t listened to every speech that Trump has done, but I think this is probably the best constructed speech that he&#39;s done. It had a flow to it.

Do you feel like the only thing getting in front of him with being a great spokesperson for this cause is his ego and him wanting to do this himself? Because at this point, should he position himself as a spokesperson person for this law and order cause and then maybe leave the second part of that statement which is me me me me me out of it i</div>

Brian Mulroney versus John Turner, we&#39;re talking about NAFTA. This is going to happen with Hillary being pro-NAFTA and Trump being so strongly opposed to NAFTA yesterday. Now, the difference is that it&#39;s occurring after the fact. And we are so looking for a reason why my life sucks. Why does my life suck? Well, it couldn&#39;t be anything I&#39;ve done. It&#39;s got to be NAFTA or it&#39;s got to be President Obama or it&#39;s got to be immigrants or it&#39;s got to be Muslims. We&#39;re willing to find enemies in things that aren&#39;t enemies.

And that&#39;s, to me, where we were about minute 65. The world was ready to lynch him just to get him off the stage. Now, that could have just been my Twitter feed, my personal experience. But I do think I would have loved to have seen the ratings as we went through the full 75 minutes, how many people started, how many people finished, because I think he lost people just from the duration of the speech alone.

          <div class="said">Well, this is where you get into a really bizarre, bizarre state of the world with Donald Trump. Right. So normally, Corey and I would look at the map and I&#39;ve pulled up real clear politics. politics and they&#39;ve got a map of all the swing states and you&#39;d say, okay, well, how do we go from, uh, 164 that are in Trump&#39;s camp solidly or leaning, you know, right. How do we get from 164 electoral votes to 270? And we would go through and we would say, okay, we&#39;re going to need, uh, Pennsylvania. We&#39;re going to need Ohio. Uh, we&#39;re going to need Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Florida. So let&#39;s, let&#39;s begin our, our stump tour right away in those areas. So he chose Ohio</div>

          <div class="said">Ohio to start. Right. We&#39;re going to go straight into Ohio and we&#39;re going to figure out how to get those 16 electoral votes. That&#39;s 16 percent of what I need to get in order to win this this election, except he seems to be fixated on California. California has 55 electoral votes. It would be a significant swing. I mean, if it was to move, if</div>

          <div class="said">if it was to move, it would be a devastating blow to Hillary Clinton. and it&#39;s never going to move. So I think that you have this, the strategy that should be implemented is get thyself to Ohio and Pennsylvania and figure out how to get those two swing states to move. They seem to be relatively straightforward to get them to move Florida, depending on which polls you look at, also something that can be moved. In fact, Florida might be the easiest move. Florida and Nevada might be the two easiest moves he&#39;s got.</div>
