            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it&#39;s a big loss. I mean, I think that Catherine McKenna was a good minister. I think that she also carried a lot of heavy files. miles and i can see why she would be um tired tired of this crap and tired about uh being a minister in a government that uh she had to do a lot of heavy lifting so i can see that i understand probably why she wants to leave um but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right, so my answer, Zane, is no, this is not a huge loss for Trudeau because Stephen Carter, known political strategist, couldn&#39;t even mention that she was Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. The reality is since the last election- I&#39;m not going to say infrastructure. What</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">She has taken the back seat. I think it&#39;s pretty fair to say since the last election. She&#39;s been a much less prominent player since she was shuffled out of the environment file. And in many ways, it feels like it&#39;s been a bit of a long goodbye. So if there was a hit that Trudeau took, that hit was taken years ago at this</span>

            <span class="text">deal in the world for the liberals or for Justin Trudeau personally. I do, however, think it is a loss for the liberals and it is reflective of the fact that in 2015, there were all of these personalities that came in that were supposed to be these new star players in this cabinet that was going to be more primus inter pares, at least in theory, right? We&#39;re going to have all of these. You know, after the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that authoritative, not that well known. And then there was this Team Trudeau that was prominent people who were coming forward to take on these positions. And Catherine McKenna was supposed to be part</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">part of this, right? She was one of these personalities who was going to be moved into the limelight. But there&#39;s been this thing that&#39;s happened over the past six years of governance with the Trudeau liberals, and that&#39;s been this shrinking of who we consider to be a key player within the government. And I think that in many ways, her story is a microcosm of the bigger story.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that&#39;s totally true. True. I really, you know, like the it&#39;s the tendency that is happening within the provincial governments for quite some time. And I think that maybe it was less so when the when the prime minister, prime minister had less experience. But kind of it&#39;s not just the shrinking of the number of cabinet ministers that he&#39;s relying on. It&#39;s also the shrinking of the number of staff that he appears to be relying on as well. He seems to have a smaller and smaller subset of people that he can reach out to and rely on. And that is evidenced by some of the campaign team that he&#39;s announcing, as well as the people who work and are serving his office. It feels like this prime minister has fewer people to call on through the course of his tenure than more people to call on.</span>

You know, this is not necessarily the same situation that everybody&#39;s in as they go through their leadership process. So, I mean, I&#39;m trying to think of other ones that have served for a long time and whether or not they were successful.

We could do traffic and weather right now. Weather, fucking hot. Climate change is real. Traffic, probably more of it. There you go. There&#39;s your national climate and weather forecast together alongside traffic. Carter, here&#39;s the thing. You guys have opened up something fascinating. In fact, this particular point both of you made in the past, I think, Corey, I&#39;m going to quote you. Scarlet letter was what you used and or albatross, right? Like you wear it around your neck running for political office, being a political staffer. You know, it&#39;s not often this trampoline to your next gig, this sweet landing spot that many people think it is. With that being said, I&#39;m kind of curious right now. Like, if you&#39;re the prime minister, right, you&#39;ve got a few folks that you&#39;ve probably lined up. Well, I&#39;ll shove the Carney question one more time for a second. But what is the PM&#39;s pitch right now to recruiting new candidates? Like, what would you tell the PM if he&#39;s on a phone call with, oh, I don&#39;t know, like a Don Iveson or, you know, someone in the other part of another part of a country who could be a candidate for him? What would your pitch be right now, knowing we just discussed the noxious nature of social media, of the overall sort of thanklessness that is public service, the scrutiny, the limelight, etc.? You know, what would your pitch be in this moment in time? Corey, maybe I can start with you. If you&#39;re the PM and recruiting new candidates, what would you be telling them?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s at that charged moment that you can actually make the case somewhat perhaps even compellingly, like the now has never been a more important time to serve. Look how charged everything is. Look how over the top politics has become. And even if you want to kind of look at it less in those kind of virtuous senses, the fact is there&#39;s also the negativity there. They&#39;re so terrible. We need you to help us.

            <span class="text">this is actually not a bad time to try to be recruiting candidates particularly if you&#39;re the liberals just even setting aside that dramatic moment the clash of civilizations that&#39;s going to draw people to the ramparts people always sign up for war even though they could get a bullet in the head right even besides that moment if you are the prime minister a you&#39;ve got the fact that polls are looking very much in your favor and And so it looks like you might be looking at a majority government going forward. And hey, four years of the gig sounds pretty cool, I&#39;ll bet. But B, and probably more importantly,</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;re at such an inflection point. And the way the prime minister is talking and the way even you can just look around at other jurisdictions and just see so plainly, decisions are going to be made that are going to dictate the course of this country for decades to come, generations to come. We are spending so much money. We are going to have to decide whether we continue to spend. If so, are we going to be doing it on transitioning our economy? Are we going to be paring down? Are we going to be having an entirely different paradigm in the next bit? And there&#39;s something very enticing about that, right? There&#39;s this sense that this is a moment that you want to be part of because you can really make a difference. There are moments of caretaker government in this country. I can think probably I would argue the 90s in many cases after we sort of got through the early 90s and decided everybody didn&#39;t like deficits for a while.

In fact, the shift has occurred, though. And so now you&#39;ve got people who are going to be attracted to it. And there&#39;s also going to be a group of people who are going to be attracted to defeating it.</span>

            <span class="text">And instead you say, you know, can we get better people to come in on these two sides or these different things? there has to be kind of a different way of respecting one another, a different way of approaching the office if you&#39;re really going to get good people. Because while Corey&#39;s appeal has certainly appealed to me, and I think to you, Zane, because we&#39;ve been in this arena quite a bit, what I&#39;m seeing is the opposite. What I&#39;m seeing is more people trying to trend towards independence, trying to trend towards, I&#39;m not going to take a side. We had someone tell us today that I have to be Switzerland in the municipal government race. Why the hell do you have to be Switzerland? what&#39;s at stake what the hell&#39;s at stake it&#39;s a municipal government race like who&#39;s going to hurt you um but this is not just municipally but it&#39;s municipally provincially nationally people are perceiving the choosing sides is in some fashion going to hurt them and and i think that the reason for that is that it does so cory&#39;s pitch notwithstanding if we go back to cory&#39;s core premise cory&#39;s core premise was this is a time when good people need to do good things we&#39;re forgetting about which side.

The liberals have named their campaign director, okay? So on its own, probably another, you know, proof point that an election is coming. Azam Ismail, the current director, the national director of the party, has a field background. I&#39;m curious for, like, national campaign directoring, like, as a job construct, is a field background, like, the best skill set? Or are you looking for someone that&#39;s, like, your air war marketing digital person i i know we&#39;ve kind of touched on this in the past a bit but i&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve got any thoughts on this because i was thinking about it i mean seems like a very talented guy seems like he&#39;s been part of the liberal machinery for a long time ran a go tv for them but a field director running your national sort of campaign does</span>

            <span class="text">just grabbing and and implementing and making the right decisions and i think that that is in at its core what field is field is about getting things done. The only thing the field should be doing is measuring outcomes. How many doors did we reach? How many people did we convert? How many names did we get? How many signs got out there? And that type of, you know, measurement of actual activity is probably a great thing at the national campaign director level.</span>

            <span class="text">want I want to ask you guys about something about that campaign, though, maybe like comparing it to your experience is that the best analogy that I read about that campaign was that New York got a sugar high on Andrew Yang and then he literally crashed. The feeling inside a sugar high campaign, have either of you kind of seen one of those things where it just is to the moon or been on the inside to one of those things and then it just craters while you&#39;re in the middle of it and you just there&#39;s nothing you can do to resurrect it? Because the stories that came out from the Yang campaign, Corey, he was projected to be in first two months out. But the stories the week before were like, this guy&#39;s fucked. Vanity Fair did a profile. Politico did a profile. Strategists were turning on each other. Knives were being put in backs and twisted over the press. Like, you could tell that everyone had accepted that the sugar high theory was correct, that there was no resurrection to a fourth, fifth, sixth place finish. And we still don&#39;t know exactly where he lands. But I&#39;m kind of curious what you make of that analogy from your personal and professional political experiences, if any, in your time working in this space. space so</span>

I&#39;m not sure that New York was really busting for another entrepreneur who&#39;s filled with big promises. I think they were looking for someone that had more life experience that more reflected their own, which is a very common theme in elections. Very often people get elected because they are like the electorate.

Everybody expects an election is coming anyways. It&#39;s entirely baked into the pundit class, and that will lead the conversation among Canadians. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to get hurt for calling an election. I don&#39;t think a weak one direction or the other is going to matter at all at this point.</span>

So let&#39;s do one quick hit or hot take, pun intended, considering how insane our province is weather-wise on Alberta. Anything you guys want to comment on either restrictions, on opening, on an Alberta story, on Jason Kenney, something you&#39;ve seen on social media, whatever that might be. Or even the crazy social media back and forth, you know, takes between issues managers and comms directors and opposition leaders. There&#39;s a lot of stuff to chew on.
