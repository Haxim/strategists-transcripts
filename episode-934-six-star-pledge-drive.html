        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Katie Telford's upcoming trip to Committee, how Jason Kenney got his groove back and NACI communications challenges.

Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

A man has been jailed for robbing a McDonald&#39;s in England and making off with not only some cash, but also with some food. Unfortunately for him, Stephen Carter, not only did he get caught, but he wasn&#39;t even able to get the chicken nuggets because, of course, it was 10.30 a.m. and they weren&#39;t serving said chicken nuggets. He&#39;s now in jail for robbing $600 and having some free chicken McNuggets. Stephen Carter, I have to start with you with an obvious question. He did not ask for a Filet-O-Fish.</div>

TV, New Jersey breweries will reward vaccinated residents with free beer. That is right. New Jersey residents can now receive a free beer for proof of COVID-19 vaccination as part of the state&#39;s new vaccine incentive program. I think we heard about ice cream in Russia not too long ago, Carter. On Monday, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced that participating New Jersey-based breweries would give people age 21 and older a free beer if they had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in May.

This just brings home how archaic the Alberta liquor laws are. because if Jason Kenney wanted to do that, he could not do that in Alberta and give away a free beer. You have to purchase, you have to buy beer in Alberta. You can&#39;t give it away for free at licensed establishments. So there you go. The breweries wouldn&#39;t be able to, you could do it in a tasting room. That&#39;s how archaic our liquor laws are. If you can&#39;t get a free beer for a vaccination, I don&#39;t even know what the hell is going on. Someone should run on that platform. It&#39;s a winner.</div>

We talked about Trump wanting to do this at a federal level when he was president. But yes, the South Carolina House voted Wednesday to add firing squad to the state&#39;s execution methods amid a lack of lethal injection drugs, a measure meant to jumpstart execution of states that once had one of the busiest debt chambers in the nation.

I mean, the Americans and their fixation on death and life imprisonment is pretty amazing. The other thing that you&#39;re not going to get in the headlines is that the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a 15-year-old that was given a life in prison sentence with no parole. 15 years old, and he&#39;s now in prison for the rest of his life. The United States is not a model of anything. They are a backwards nation with a gun problem, a death problem, and an incarceration problem.

Conservative members of the committee had put forward a motion last Friday to invite Telford to testify, but Liberal MPs on the committee filibustered that motion. The meeting has been set to resume debate on that motion on Monday, but was abruptly canceled just minutes before the start. The committee heard last month from Elder Marquez, a former senior advisor to Trudeau, that he had been asked by either Telford or her assistant to pass an allegation against General Jonathan Vance to bureaucrats in March 2018, one day after the allegation was shared with Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan. Bureaucrats promptly opened and then abandoned that probe, but Telford appears to have never informed Trudeau of the allegation, which has led to intense scrutiny over what she knew and why she did not tell the prime minister, which brings us to what we are expecting to see on Friday, which brings us to a preamble of Harjit Sajjan, who is Minister Harjit Sajjan, who&#39;s been grilled by the conservatives on this issue and now calls by Aaron O&#39;Toole in advance of Katie Talford testifying on Friday to resign. Carter, this is a loaded story with a lot of background, a lot of context. Is there anything you want to add contextually before we kind of get into what this might mean politically for the top political Well,</div>

          <div class="said">difference between the principal and the staff. And it also serves as a as a frame to defer responsibility from the minister responsible. Also, I think that not everything that goes into a chief of staff&#39;s ears has to come out her mouth to the to the minister. If this was dealt with properly from her point of view, it doesn&#39;t need to go back to the minister. There was accountability. There was a pathway through the bureaucracy to deal with this. I&#39;m just not really a big fan of chiefs of staff or the leadership teams of a minister being dragged in front of a committee to testify. There&#39;s a lot of information that Katie Telford knows that probably shouldn&#39;t be brought forward to an open committee. And this just makes me very, very nervous for the state of our democracy and the state of the minister to staff relationships. Now, there&#39;ll be those who are hearing what I&#39;m saying, and they&#39;re going to say, everything should be public. Everything should be open to being heard by all members of Parliament. And to those people, I say, stop being so fucking naive. Stop pretending like this is the way that the world works, because it doesn&#39;t work like that. that. There&#39;s lots of information that flows through a prime minister&#39;s office that MPs themselves aren&#39;t entitled to know, nor should they know. So my view is that this is a mistake to put Katie Telford in front of the committee, even if she stands in front of the committee and simply answers the questions in terms of what I expect to hear from her, which is, yes, I was given this accusation. Yes, I gave it to the bureaucracy as quickly as I could. And yes, yes, I believed it to be handled at that point. Now let me get the fuck off of this stand. I expect that that will be her testimony on Friday.</div>

Number one, does not think it&#39;s great precedent overall or strategy to have political staffers or the prime minister&#39;s chief of staff to testify. And then he thinks good strategy for the conservatives, horrible strategy for the liberals acquiesce. Pick up on that from where you stand.</div>

          <div class="said">parliament, right? I just don&#39;t agree with that. And I think that there has to be some sort of accountability. And I also believe parliament&#39;s powers should be pretty broad and pretty deep. And if they want to call the chief of staff, I think that&#39;s within their right. Right. And let&#39;s not forget, this is a minority parliament. If this was a majority parliament, the Liberals would have had the votes just to say no dice. But the reality is, the Liberals don&#39;t control the confidence of the House. The House is ultimately the body that you are responsible to, and the House has decided they want to talk to the Chief of Staff. So have at her. Now, I feel a lot of things about this issue. I mean, fundamentally, I think people should have acted and people should have taken allegations more seriously. And it pisses me off that we continue to be having this Groundhog Day approach to accusations of misconduct in the military. But I want to approach this with a little bit more nuance and talk about why decisions could or could not have been made by the chief of staff to the prime minister and what might have been going on in people&#39;s heads, right? The first is this theory of what the chief of staff role is, the original chief of staff. Eisenhower created the role because it was supposed to be a filter to deal with the things that don&#39;t need the boss&#39;s attention and bring to the boss with the supporting materials required the things that did need the boss&#39;s attention he took this from the military so this was like the first political chief of staff right and the whole basis of it is it&#39;s supposed to be complicated issues that you filter up judgment calls that need to be made by the the big boss this is not a complicated issue there is no judgment that needed to be issued here so if katie telford wants to deal with it and say if i can look into this bureaucracy i you know that to me is not unreasonable reasonable.</div>

          <div class="said">you don&#39;t. So what they&#39;re trying to imply, in my mind, is that in some fashion, the prime minister had accountability for the actions of General Vance. And I see their point. I mean, you know, the buck stops here kind of a thinking. But I don&#39;t want the prime minister to be the judge and jury on sexual harassment allegations. I want there to be a proper process in the bureaucracy for every employee, whether they&#39;re the junior clerk all the way up to deputy ministers or the chief of staff of the defense service. All of that should be subject to the same rules and process. process and one of the things that we try to skip over on these sexual harassment allegations is a due process due process has been seen as a negative element of this and i think it&#39;s just totally wrong due process that is well designed to protect the people who are making the allegations as well as well designed to to manage the people who are being alleged to have committed these these uh offenses is part of the system and and having the prime minister step in and weigh in in and say this is a major problem it subverts the system and puts undue pressure on the prime minister from what i can tell katie telford did the right thing if if she&#39;s correct if what is if the way you described it at the beginning of this segment is correct and</div>

I walk through that a little bit slowly because I want to talk about the way it was done. The Emergency Management Cabinet Committee met earlier that day to approve new measures to help protect the health care system in the province. Each of the measures announced applied to businesses and municipalities where there were more than 50 cases per 100,000. That lowers the floor from the initial, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, was it 250? That was applied, 250. And with more than 30 or more more active cases in a region. This now includes K-12 being online. If there&#39;s a workplace outbreak, you have to close for 10 days. Retail at 10% capacity. Patio closed. Tattoo parlors, hair salons, as of this Sunday, are closed. Restaurants will be limited to takeout. And social gatherings, currently, outdoor social gatherings, currently at 10, are now limited to five, amongst a few other items as well. But I think I hit the major ones. Corey, talk to me about the Kenny strategy here. And let&#39;s talk strategy overall, all, and then we&#39;ll talk about how he did it with the televised address, no direct questions. What do you think of what he did? And what do you think he was trying to do?</div>

They are one quarter the number of people that are actually suffering from COVID-19. They took different actions than we did. And we&#39;re paying paying the price. In early April, we started to be worried about these variants. In mid-April, it was very keenly, we were very aware that we were around 15,000 total number of patients with COVID. We chose not to act because of religious holidays and the premier&#39;s religious beliefs. That is not, in my mind, a good enough reason.

          <div class="said">and ambiguous signals are worse still and if you are intending to forecast that you&#39;re doing something like this you can&#39;t be sending counter signals within the same amount of distance there um the the appropriate approach for jason kenney if he was trying to do something Something like Doug Ford did in Ontario, which now it seems to me he was, which is saying, hey, new restrictions are coming in a couple of days, was actually to say that a little bit more clearly before Monday and allow people to know that this was happening. And then they could have beaten up on him and said, well, if they&#39;re coming in a couple of days, why the F aren&#39;t you doing them now? But that would have been better than the chaos that he created over the couple of days and making it look like he just decided now it&#39;s too bad and I&#39;ve got to move into it come Monday, come Tuesday. interesting this you know this is it&#39;s so interesting how you can sort of look at some of the broader lessons of diplomacy when you&#39;re talking about politicians because you don&#39;t normally think of politicians as needing to do strong diplomatic signals to the public that they are elected by but jason kenney with all of the weird constituencies he has and all of the weird things going on absolutely needed uh needed the smoke signals to be clearer cory</div>

Before we jump back to how we did this and the vaccination story a little bit more. Carter, talk to me about this lessons for Kenny going forward, rather than in the short term, but going forward. Corey mentions about broader lessons that you learn about diplomacy. What are lessons Kenny needs to be sure to follow going forward, knowing that he&#39;s instilled these tougher restrictions and knowing that he&#39;s got the multiplicity of various interests in his caucus? What would you advise him today</div>

Ralph Klein was very fond of this saying when he was tackling the deficit, that he wasn&#39;t going to blink.

And the pressure will undoubtedly, because people have such recency biases become immense, like, okay, well, look, those numbers are coming down. Why can&#39;t we open up? Why can&#39;t we open up?

This is not us just walking up to the microphone, scheduled for 3.30, rescheduled for 4.30, actually getting to the microphone at 4.45. This is him saying, this is the most important part of this. This is my final discussion on it. We&#39;ve used that tactic before. Redford used it with the bitumen bubble. and and the cost of you know the need for pipelines uh the prime ministers have used this tactic people the the address to the people the direct i&#39;m not going through the media is super important to really put an emphatic uh exclamation point on what it is that you&#39;re saying and then you come in the next day and you hit with it with the channel changer right it is a massive a master class in we have a significant problem but we have the solution that was the the the one-two punch of it, and it worked, I think, perfectly because everybody&#39;s attention was gathered by the Tuesday night address, and then the Wednesday, our concerns were alleviated. We were given the opportunity to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and some 100,000-plus millennials today booked their vaccinations. So it was a pretty good day, a pretty good couple of days for Kenny after his Tuesday announcement.</div>

          <div class="said">the yellow i don&#39;t think like i know i don&#39;t love the yellow and purple it feels very royal family to me i i think that visually it&#39;s a bit uh bit garish it&#39;s not it&#39;s not my favorite but there&#39;s a good logic to what they did here uh if you&#39;ve used the same creative for over a year people are inevitably going to stop noticing it this is something that anybody who&#39;s worked in politics is familiar with it&#39;s kind of the sign blindness that happens happens around day 28 of a campaign, you don&#39;t even sort of realize that there&#39;s red signs, blue signs, orange signs all over the place. And so one of the things that campaign organizers will often do as like a election day tactic is go and move all of their signs around, even if it&#39;s on somebody&#39;s lawn, just the other part of the lawn, to kind of break that sign blindness. In that case, they&#39;re just moving it to a different place and hoping people catch attention. But what the government is doing here is changing up the creative.</div>

It&#39;s bled into the background. Let&#39;s change this. And, you know, they wanted to say, okay, we&#39;re serious. Okay, this is different. Okay, this is big. And I think that that&#39;s largely been accomplished by this. Again, I&#39;m not like a huge fan of the creative itself, but that&#39;s a personal taste. And obviously that garishness is helpful to make somebody look. One of the reasons when you&#39;re going through a facility that has big warning signs everywhere, that has them in yellow and black, is it&#39;s really hard to miss. So they&#39;re playing on some of the fundamentals of marketing, playing on some of the fundamentals of psychology of communications.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, I think that the choice to stick with the purple was a mistake. I think that they should have gone with black on yellow. I mean, if you think of yellow caution tape, it&#39;s black printing on yellow. If you think of yield signs, if you think, you know, anywhere you&#39;re going to go into where there&#39;s caution, where there&#39;s, you know, you should be careful. The yellow and black is a fairly standard look. I think that they tried to maintain their purple feel. And that was a mistake. I mean, Corey went through why they chose purple before. I&#39;m not going to dig into it. But just because you have committed to purple in the past does not mean you have to stick with purple in the future. And this is a new campaign now. So just let it become the new campaign. Dig in on the,</div>

          <div class="said">We&#39;re going to leave that segment there. Moving on to our next segment, Nacy Naysay. Carter, I want to talk about the National Advisory Committee on Immunization. They&#39;ve had a week. And so let me try to fill people in as much as I can, and as articulately as I can. So if this is a struggle for me, I really don&#39;t care. We don&#39;t do this for money. Like Corey said, we don&#39;t care. Although it is the five-star review pledge which is still ongoing, which people can jump in on. Corey, people may have paid attention to only the second half of this podcast, and I want them to know that The Pledge Drive continues. Here we go. Let&#39;s talk about this particular story, Carter. And I&#39;m looking at you specifically, because there&#39;s a lot of communications lessons to be learned here. So the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, they had their chair, Dr. Caroline Quash, on television earlier this This week, giving a series of interviews, but one very notable interview on CTV&#39;s Power Play with Evan Solomon. She described that getting the vaccine is dependent as a risk on where you live. She said if you live in a place with high COVID risk, she didn&#39;t specify exactly what she meant by that. Absolutely get the first vaccine available to you. But if you live in an area with low risk, once again, not explaining what that what that is or where you work from home, given the flood of mRNA vaccines, i.e. Moderna and Pfizer that are coming to Canada, Maybe you should consider waiting a few weeks. And then she then mentioned, I think, the line that has become the viral sensation, which is, quote, This needs to be an informed consent. If, for instance, my sister was to get the AstraZeneca vaccine and die of a thrombosis when I know that it could have been prevented and she&#39;s not in a high risk area, I&#39;m not sure I could live with it. And at this point, you know, you saw Evan Solomon&#39;s, you know, eyebrows jump and his jaw kind of drop, and he immediately talked about, you know, well, you know, that&#39;s super rare, right? Like, you should be qualifying that that&#39;s super rare, trying to help her in the interview. And she agreed that it was super rare, but kind of made mention that, you know, hey, maybe you should wait. Right. Stephen Carter, this is the first time we&#39;ve heard this message from someone with this authority, chair of one of Canada&#39;s two sort of boards or bodies that talks about immunization in this country at a national level. Was this a communications failure? This might be an elementary question. Or do you feel like she was actually trying to get this message out there and knew what she was doing? Because there is a school of thought for some that, you know what, we may have actually overestimated the AstraZeneca efficacy, we should probably backtrack on it. Or do you think this was a communications failure, you know, deviating from the lesson and the line we&#39;ve heard from every politician, get the first vaccine you are offered. Let&#39;s start there with the baseline. And then let&#39;s jump into, you know, wherever you kind of lead us with with your path. This</div>

          <div class="said">This is a massive mistake. This is a massive mistake with unbelievable far reaching implications. When you, you know, if we&#39;re going to construct a bridge, you know, you don&#39;t necessarily ask the engineer who designed the bridge, who understands the specifications of the bridge to actually do the welding. you get people who have or who are experts in their field to do the work and here&#39;s the problem when we get an expert in the field of science and research to do communications we&#39;re fucking up because communications is a different expertise than the actual art of of determining these these pieces did anything she say was wrong no of course not it would be you know and we&#39;ve lost our first person to uh to a blood clot in alberta that&#39;s tragic it&#39;s i&#39;m i&#39;m terribly terribly saddened for that family but here&#39;s the here&#39;s the thing there&#39;s a trade-off and the trade-off is that we can get all of these vaccinations into our arms as quickly as possible there&#39;s always risk and and we and we&#39;re terrible at managing risk we&#39;ve said this before on this podcast we don&#39;t understand risk inherently so when we play up one risk or we misidentify a risk and we say that a risk that is one in two million is in some fashion the same as a risk that is one in a thousand we are making making a colossal fuck up. And this woman made a colossal fuck up. And she&#39;s undermined now all of the messaging, all the work that has gone into making sure that these vaccinations are effective for all Canadians. And this angers me. It angers me beyond all reason, because I think to myself, it could be managed so much easier if you did two things, either train this person to be a better fucking communicator or put a real communicator in Evan Solomon&#39;s seat. Because this idea that that a subject matter expert is going to be able to answer evan solomon&#39;s questions here&#39;s the truth and i like evan solomon evan solomon&#39;s not asking that insightful a question he does not asking how these vaccinations work a communicator can answer the fucking questions that evan solomon&#39;s asking the cost of this interview the cost of evan solomon&#39;s interview and the cost of of the promotions and the the the the speed with with with which this information traveled the the internet is that people will lose their lives and that just makes me sick to my stomach</div>

You&#39;re talking about the speaker, you&#39;re talking about the message, and you&#39;re talking about the audience. and when you&#39;re talking about trying to deliver a message you are trying to build at all times credibility relevance</div>

          <div class="said">to pick up on both of your points partly why i introduced it the way i did the topic around, did she deliberately mean to do this? Is that this is someone who&#39;s been doing this for the last year. Like, this was not her first interview. This was not her first interview with Evan. This was not her first interview on the internet. And nationally, she&#39;s done dozens of these. She&#39;s a media spokesperson slash doctor over the last year in many ways. So, you know, we can all have off days, but part of me was wondering, is this an off day? Or is this someone someone who was trying to actually communicate this and, I don&#39;t know, trial balloon it or whatever. I felt like there could have been an element of that, especially with what we&#39;re hearing in places like Nova Scotia right now, right? Where they&#39;re saying, you know, in that Atlantic bubble, they talk about, you know, the risk of working from home versus getting AstraZeneca. Like, they talk about these things more actively in those places. So part of me was wondering, you know, to that point, was this perhaps deliberate on our part? But we&#39;re both, Both of you seem like going down the path of that this was a giant fuck-up in one way, shape, or form. The question I have is, what&#39;s the solution here? Is it, you know, Corey, you&#39;re saying work with doctors. Is this a failure in media training? Is this a failure in key messaging, do you think? Or is this a failure in something broader in your mind?</div>

That means that that everyone who has received AstraZeneca has been protected against COVID-19, encouraging people to, you know, try to abate the remorse and try to encourage people to get their second shots.

It&#39;s also just the way that these vaccines have been treated in general. The AstraZeneca and the Johnson and Johnson vaccinations have been given this kind of we approve you, but we don&#39;t approve you. We approve you, but we don&#39;t approve you. We approve you, but we&#39;ve got a problem. We&#39;ve approved you, but you&#39;re not going to work. That problem has been this on again, off again, switching. Oh, AstraZeneca is OK for people 55 to 65. OK, AstraZeneca is not OK. Johnson and Johnson, we&#39;re not going to be able to distribute that because it&#39;s it&#39;s not going to work. here&#39;s the problem it&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">it&#39;s got you know when you&#39;re dealing with medical uh issues it&#39;s not certain any doctor worth their weight will tell you that there&#39;s always a risk and there&#39;s always um a plus and a minus there&#39;s always a waiting to whether or not you take an action there&#39;s could be a situation where open heart surgery has a one in a thousand chance of failure but if you don&#39;t do it it&#39;s a one in one failure rate so you do the one in one thousand failure rate right and and those those types of trade-offs are made every single day in the medical field. But we don&#39;t talk about them like that. Because as soon as you start talking about them in general, about all the various challenges within them, the public loses confidence. And this is a public that for whatever reason has decided that it wants to be vaccine hesitant, for whatever reason it wants to be conspiracy driven, for whatever reason it wants to believe the worst in our society right now. And all of those reasons mean that you&#39;ve got to go out with certainty. You&#39;ve got to go out it with certainty and backing and forthing and backing and forthing just undermines your position and and i would prefer that governments learn um based on the the inputs that we see from society today and don&#39;t bring medical issues into communications opportunities great</div>

We&#39;re not quite there, but we&#39;re probably 5%, 10% away from where we started to see their curve bend the wrong way and start to move more slowly towards full vaccination. This is also maybe an opportunity to pick up some of these threads. let&#39;s not react to this if we see a decline in demand a crash in demand maybe we do need now to talk about things like vaccine passports not for everything but enough things that people say oh shit i&#39;d kind of like to do that like maybe you can only go to a bar if you&#39;ve got your two doses if</div>

We want to incent this, and so my recommendation to government would be incent the discovery, don&#39;t disincent it. Germany took that action today, and I think that that was the right call.</div>

Now, we could go into all of the reasons why we could talk about the fact that, you know, the city should have relied more on the DC bylaw, which allows this use and not the ARP, which is aspirational and discretionary and existed when the DC bylaw was last up. We could talk about all those things. But that would make the conversation more substantive than it&#39;s been for the last bit where people just decided to pick sides based on tribe and decide that the city was obviously right because they love the city.</div>
