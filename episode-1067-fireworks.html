I mean, we talked about that months ago. And here we are watching these two leaders fight over the exact ridings that we were talking about. So I think what we&#39;re seeing is that it&#39;s going to be a close election. And anybody who&#39;s got a specific number, like, for example,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what what steven has said as always is padded and bullshit but the the core of it was right it it does seem to be if you look at where people are spending their time where they&#39;re putting their big rallies a it&#39;s all calgary we</span>

            <span class="text">The fact that we are now looking at Acadia and Glenmore as areas where both leaders have spent some time, and certainly we know from conversations we&#39;ve had with people where both Both parties are throwing resources in a pretty heavy way. Tells us generally what Stephen has said is correct. Like this is a very close election. Any seat projection that we&#39;ve seen, even the ones we dispute, all put Glenmore and Acadia in that tipping point area. Certainly our own views of that are pretty consistent going way back. Glenmore is a bit of a bellwether. Glenmore is the one that it feels like if you&#39;ve got that, you probably have the election.</span>

And it does tell you that it&#39;s going to be a very close election. And it&#39;s going to matter a lot how the parties execute this endgame and run their ground games, frankly. Exactly.

            <span class="text">Fascinating parts of the city. They often shift around. You&#39;ll see them move back and forth with different parties and such. Not necessarily provincially, but when you&#39;re doing it, you know, like again, federally, they elect conservatives. conservatives across the board. Now, I know people are shocked, but they&#39;re just south of where Calgary Centre and Kent Harry used to serve for the Federal Liberal Party. They&#39;re south of Glenmore Trail, which is right on our reservoir. And one of the things that&#39;s fascinating about that is it&#39;s also kind of the demarcation line of where we really start to see different representation of visible minorities in Calgary. Visible minorities tend to live in the north part and the inner city. And then as we move further south, we start to see fewer and fewer visible minorities. There&#39;s been some excellent graphics posted on Twitter showing the type of distribution of visible minorities in the city. And keeping in mind, we are, I believe, Corey, you&#39;ll correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but the third most populous city of visit. Third</span>

            <span class="text">most diverse. Yeah, third most diverse city. So it&#39;s a significant number of visible minorities in the Northwest and the Northeast, not the South. So when you start talking about Acadia and Glenmore, you&#39;re talking about a predominantly white population these communities are ancient corey grew up in one of them which gives you a sense of how old it is um so they&#39;ve been there for a long long time and they&#39;ve been very well to do i think for a long long time also the silver spoon in corey&#39;s mouth shows itself so this</span>

            <span class="text">when they do switch like calgary glenmore has has produced a cabinet minister like forever right uh but when the ndp won in 2015 keeping in mind that we thought of that as the accidental election cory&#39;s used this term that i don&#39;t recognize called vote splitting but even in that particular election there was a 10 vote victory for the ndp in calgary glenmore so when you remove like this potential vote split that other people talk about that i don&#39;t recognize um you&#39;re basically saying you know that get vote number is 50% of the population. It used to be 33% using terminology that I recognize. It used to be 35% and you could win. Now you have to win with 50%. That is showing a significant change in the way the population of that area is thinking about the election. And the way that we might equate this is if suddenly the Toronto area ridings moved from being liberal to being conservative, right? Like it would be a significant shift and you&#39;d be saying, well, that probably denotes something. That means something special in the federal election context.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, you know, here&#39;s the thing about Calgary Glenmore, and I did grow up there. It is what I would call the first truly suburban riding going south in Calgary. Like, you can argue about where the suburbs begin, but the way the ridings are split, the ridings north of it have huge inner city components, no matter how you cut it as you move towards downtown. town glenmore acadia those are you know that&#39;s glenmore for sure that&#39;s the suburbs acadia carries in a bunch of industrial zones that move towards the north actually well north of glenmore trail i should</span>

So the other thing about Glenmore, and Glenmore now is also north of the reservoir, actually, in Lakeview. But I guess the thing I would say is that good chunks of Glenmore feel like almost their own sort of separate city enclave. and um and and it is it&#39;s got certain pockets of density certain pockets of suburbia it&#39;s a bit of a microcosm for what we think of as calgary and there&#39;s a lot that makes</span>

            <span class="text">you&#39;re watching now again if we you know when we were talking about this months ago we were talking about how calgary glenmore if If the NDP were winning in Calgary, Glenmore, Calgary, Acadia, they were going to win this election.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">So what should we be watching for in the next, like, Friday, Saturday, Sunday? What should we be watching for in terms of what the campaigns are doing and where the leaders are? Like, let&#39;s say leaders come back to Calgary, Glenmore, Calgary, Acadia. What is that saying?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it tells me that they&#39;re very nervous, right? So if any leader does two trips to the same space, like the same ridings within the last five days, it says they are really trying to win those areas. There&#39;s a lot at stake, and those areas are not locked or set by any stretch of the imagination. But you can also tell where they&#39;re ignoring, right? So if they&#39;re going back to those places, and instead, like, so right now, I don&#39;t know where they are tonight, but let&#39;s assume they&#39;re just in the Northwest. If they went to the Northwest tonight and then came back to Acadia on the weekend, that tells me that they&#39;re just, you know, they&#39;re more worried about here than they are up there. And, you know, Northwest has more ridings. There are only two ridings that we&#39;re talking about in this south area that are even up for grabs. So with only two ridings down there, it seems really weird that you&#39;d spend a lot of time down here when you have the ability to move six ridings in Northwest Calgary. So if you&#39;re competing in them, if you&#39;re pushing on it, that means that you&#39;re more comfortable in these other areas, in my opinion.</span>

And you do try to spread the love as a political party around. So if you start seeing the party leaders hyper-focus on these two geographies and running multiple rallies, get-out-the-vote activities in Glenmore and Acadia, that does tell you a lot about the current state of the race.</span>

            <span class="text">the the final summation is it didn&#39;t matter a ton daniel smith for a day or two had to deal with questions about some of the comments she made that were pretty indefensible like she was cleared by the ethics commissioner right but in a way she got off super easy by the long weekend because there sure wasn&#39;t the discourse i would expect when somebody is is damned that that strongly by an ethics commissioner or in the middle of an election. And so, yeah, I mean, I agree. If you told me on election night, hey, I&#39;m telling you nothing about the results except Acadia and Glenmore went for the NDP, what do you think happened? I&#39;d say, well, sounds like the NDP won.</span>

They&#39;re not actually that that much like the rest of Calgary, right? They are a little less diverse, or at least they&#39;ve historically been. I really wish I had some of the stats in front, but I guarantee you they are less diverse than North Calgary.</span>

It is the, we have a negativity bias and we also are tribal. We like to belong to groups. And that means if we belong to one group, we don&#39;t like the other group. And therefore we shit on the other group. And this is not just something that happens in politics. I mean, there are study after study after study that if you do something just as simple as like assigning one group, an odd number and another group, an even number, or give one group of students one color hat another group of students another color hat they will actively with with within seconds almost of being assigned these different groups actively work to discriminate against the other group negative ads work because it reinforces our sense of who we are and who they are us versus them and we need that that is part of our instincts as human beings now i will concede those instincts have sometimes got us into trouble but this is you</span>

We have all of these people voting. On the other hand, Elections Alberta indicated that they expected up to 50% of the vote would be accumulating during the first five days of the advance vote. We&#39;re averaging 150,000 votes per day, give or take. And if that continues, we&#39;re going to be at 750,000 votes by the end of advance. if that&#39;s 50 percent then that&#39;s 300 000 votes less than we got in 2019 so</span>

            <span class="text">now everybody can do it and if it is 50% and maybe elections Alberta was a little optimistic but I think that 50% is reasonable I actually think this represents a downturn in the number of voters I think that that&#39;s a a good indication for the ndp because i think that the reluctant walk us through that the reluctant ucp voter right so let&#39;s imagine there&#39;s three types of voters david coletto articulated this you know in in december of of last year three types of voters the first type of voter is a ucp voter they&#39;re going to vote ucp even with daniel smith as the leader they believe in it number</span>

That reluctant UCP voter doesn&#39;t want to vote for Danielle Smith, does not like Danielle Smith, but by God, they are not someone who can vote for the NDP. So they have to stay home or they have to make an unpleasant choice. And if this represents a decrease in voter turnout, then my belief is they&#39;re staying home.</span>

            <span class="text">No, I mean, I think Elections Alberta was probably a bit overzealous in how much advance voting there would be. We don&#39;t really know what the final total is yet, because we haven&#39;t gotten to Saturday. That&#39;s a day of advance voting. And I suspect that&#39;ll be a pretty significant day of advance voting. But let&#39;s just say for fun and for math being simple, it&#39;s $750,000. So we get $1.5 million under that projection. That&#39;s one way to look at at it. Another is we&#39;ve never had so many people vote in the advanced polls. And when you look at the Ontario election last year in 2022, they had 10 days, I think, of advanced voting, a little bit of a different system, you know, it&#39;s always hard to do apples to oranges. But I don&#39;t think 25% of the vote came from advanced polls in Ontario. So my suspicion is Elections Alberta just overestimated the interest in advanced voting. And perhaps we&#39;re led a bit astray by some of of the trends they saw that were more COVID-based around the world. I&#39;m imagining that they based this on some numbers they had 2019, looking at overall trends, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, this is a lot of people. This is a lot of people voting in advanced polls. It is changing the way people approach campaigning. It&#39;s changing how Get Out the Vote works. It&#39;s changing how you layer in campaign announcements. Today, Rachel Notley, not new announcement, but a bundling of of previous announcements said this will be bill one this will be bill two this will be bill three and i thought and this will be irrelevant to you know 400 000 people who have already voted and maybe that&#39;s okay this is not an earth-shattering announcement but you have to think at this point let&#39;s</span>

That&#39;s not everyone, that&#39;s a very, very small percent of the population. And what we do is we then carry that to others, right? You know, I&#39;m sure the people who are listening to this podcast are very comfortable getting telephone calls from their friends saying uh man i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know what to do like should i vote for this person or that person well</span>

Can you believe how corrupt they are, these guys? And they say, hey, Art, you got to call them out for that. You got to go on the steps of the legislature and put them on blast. And so he did it because that&#39;s what really unhinged people do. None of this happened. It didn&#39;t happen. happen the call even the tape that we do have where danielle smith is is talking you know a lot has been made of the introduction being like oh yeah no i&#39;ve followed your your work for a long time does that sound like the introduction of like hey arthur yeah you&#39;re the guy we were going to give two million dollars to like does any of that seem congruous does any of this work none of this happened right so</span>

And the fact that this was a decision made by administration and then administration told city council, I&#39;m sorry, but fuck you anyways. We&#39;re not going to listen to you. You don&#39;t have a role in determining what the outcome of this decision is. The fact that they said that tells me that these people need to be fucking taken out back and fucking fired because it&#39;s all over.
