I mean, we talked about that months ago. And here we are watching these two leaders fight over the exact ridings that we were talking about.

Tells us generally what Stephen has said is correct. Like this is a very close election. Any seat projection that we&#39;ve seen, even the ones we dispute, all put Glenmore and Acadia in that tipping point area. Certainly our own views of that are pretty consistent going way back. Glenmore is a bit of a bellwether. Glenmore is the one that it feels like if you&#39;ve got that, you probably have the election.</div>

Not necessarily provincially, but when you&#39;re doing it, you know, like again, federally, they elect conservatives. conservatives across the board. Now, I know people are shocked, but they&#39;re just south of where Calgary Centre and Kent Harry used to serve for the Federal Liberal Party. They&#39;re south of Glenmore Trail, which is right on our reservoir. And one of the things that&#39;s fascinating about that is it&#39;s also kind of the demarcation line of where we really start to see different representation of visible minorities in Calgary. Visible minorities tend to live in the north part and the inner city. And then as we move further south, we start to see fewer and fewer visible minorities. There&#39;s been some excellent graphics posted on Twitter showing the type of distribution of visible minorities in the city. And keeping in mind, we are, I believe, Corey, you&#39;ll correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but the third most populous city of visit. Third</div>

It used to be 33% using terminology that I recognize. It used to be 35% and you could win. Now you have to win with 50%. That is showing a significant change in the way the population of that area is thinking about the election. And the way that we might equate this is if suddenly the Toronto area ridings moved from being liberal to being conservative, right? Like it would be a significant shift and you&#39;d be saying, well, that probably denotes something. That means something special in the federal election context.</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, you know, here&#39;s the thing about Calgary Glenmore, and I did grow up there. It is what I would call the first truly suburban riding going south in Calgary. Like, you can argue about where the suburbs begin, but the way the ridings are split, the ridings north of it have huge inner city components, no matter how you cut it as you move towards downtown. town glenmore acadia those are you know that&#39;s glenmore for sure that&#39;s the suburbs acadia carries in a bunch of industrial zones that move towards the north actually well north of glenmore trail i should</div>

So the other thing about Glenmore, and Glenmore now is also north of the reservoir, actually, in Lakeview. But I guess the thing I would say is that good chunks of Glenmore feel like almost their own sort of separate city enclave. and um and and it is it&#39;s got certain pockets of density certain pockets of suburbia it&#39;s a bit of a microcosm for what we think of as calgary and there&#39;s a lot that makes</div>

            <div class="said">Well, it tells me that they&#39;re very nervous, right? So if any leader does two trips to the same space, like the same ridings within the last five days, it says they are really trying to win those areas. There&#39;s a lot at stake, and those areas are not locked or set by any stretch of the imagination. But you can also tell where they&#39;re ignoring, right? So if they&#39;re going back to those places, and instead, like, so right now, I don&#39;t know where they are tonight, but let&#39;s assume they&#39;re just in the Northwest. If they went to the Northwest tonight and then came back to Acadia on the weekend, that tells me that they&#39;re just, you know, they&#39;re more worried about here than they are up there. And, you know, Northwest has more ridings. There are only two ridings that we&#39;re talking about in this south area that are even up for grabs. So with only two ridings down there, it seems really weird that you&#39;d spend a lot of time down here when you have the ability to move six ridings in Northwest Calgary. So if you&#39;re competing in them, if you&#39;re pushing on it, that means that you&#39;re more comfortable in these other areas, in my opinion.</div>

But did you talk to the person at the door about the stakes? Did you talk to them about the need to present this contrast? It&#39;s really important people understand exactly what&#39;s going on in this election. Do we feel good about the fact that we need to call out these things our opponent is doing? No, it&#39;s terrible. It&#39;s terrible our opponents would run an opponent like that. It makes us feel bad that we have to say the things that we have to say that are so negative about them, but it&#39;s kind of on them. If they don&#39;t want the negative ads, that&#39;s fine. Tell them all about our positive message. Hand them this fucking brochure that is all about the things we&#39;ll do. The arenas we&#39;ll build. Move on with your life. but you don&#39;t uh you know you don&#39;t stand by your ad important rule right like you don&#39;t disavow these things and and you can there&#39;s ways to pivot like yeah listen i i appreciate that the ad makes you feel uncomfortable yeah the</div>

We have all of these people voting. On the other hand, Elections Alberta indicated that they expected up to 50% of the vote would be accumulating during the first five days of the advance vote. We&#39;re averaging 150,000 votes per day, give or take. And if that continues, we&#39;re going to be at 750,000 votes by the end of advance. if that&#39;s 50 percent then that&#39;s 300 000 votes less than we got in 2019 so</div>

            <div class="said">No, I mean, I think Elections Alberta was probably a bit overzealous in how much advance voting there would be. We don&#39;t really know what the final total is yet, because we haven&#39;t gotten to Saturday. That&#39;s a day of advance voting. And I suspect that&#39;ll be a pretty significant day of advance voting. But let&#39;s just say for fun and for math being simple, it&#39;s $750,000. So we get $1.5 million under that projection. That&#39;s one way to look at at it. Another is we&#39;ve never had so many people vote in the advanced polls. And when you look at the Ontario election last year in 2022, they had 10 days, I think, of advanced voting, a little bit of a different system, you know, it&#39;s always hard to do apples to oranges. But I don&#39;t think 25% of the vote came from advanced polls in Ontario. So my suspicion is Elections Alberta just overestimated the interest in advanced voting. And perhaps we&#39;re led a bit astray by some of of the trends they saw that were more COVID-based around the world. I&#39;m imagining that they based this on some numbers they had 2019, looking at overall trends, blah, blah, blah. But yeah, this is a lot of people. This is a lot of people voting in advanced polls. It is changing the way people approach campaigning. It&#39;s changing how Get Out the Vote works. It&#39;s changing how you layer in campaign announcements. Today, Rachel Notley, not new announcement, but a bundling of of previous announcements said this will be bill one this will be bill two this will be bill three and i thought and this will be irrelevant to you know 400 000 people who have already voted and maybe that&#39;s okay this is not an earth-shattering announcement but you have to think at this point let&#39;s</div>

Can you believe how corrupt they are, these guys? And they say, hey, Art, you got to call them out for that. You got to go on the steps of the legislature and put them on blast. And so he did it because that&#39;s what really unhinged people do. None of this happened. It didn&#39;t happen. happen the call even the tape that we do have where danielle smith is is talking you know a lot has been made of the introduction being like oh yeah no i&#39;ve followed your your work for a long time does that sound like the introduction of like hey arthur yeah you&#39;re the guy we were going to give two million dollars to like does any of that seem congruous does any of this work none of this happened right so</div>

And the fact that this was a decision made by administration and then administration told city council, I&#39;m sorry, but fuck you anyways. We&#39;re not going to listen to you. You don&#39;t have a role in determining what the outcome of this decision is.
