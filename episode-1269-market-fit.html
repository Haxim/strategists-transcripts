            <span class="text">we&#39;re going to talk about OpenAI because they have had quite a weekend. They have gotten rid of their co-founder CEO, someone who has spearheaded, without exaggeration, Carter, it&#39;s fair to say, billions of dollars of valuation for this company. I don&#39;t even know if I can call it a company. Maybe it starts there in terms of our examination. This non-profit that governs a company that was not supposed to make money but has now got profit caps on it. Anyways, the CEO is gone. He&#39;s now potentially coming back. There&#39;s a lot to talk about as it relates to like strategy, as it relates to governance, as it relates to overall vision and direction, frankly, leadership. So this is where I want to go. This is a non-political topic that might quickly turn political. But it has all the necessary ingredients to make a successful strategist episode. Corey, do you agree? Or do you disagree fundamentally? I can&#39;t tell by how you&#39;re looking at me right now. I</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, I think I agree. There&#39;s a lot of interesting things going on with this. And I think Sam Altman both made some very poor strategic decisions in the past, which we should unpack. And he&#39;s made some, what, at least on Sunday night at 9pm Mountain Time, which is the proper time zone in Canada, made</span>

            <span class="text">think one of the cool things he&#39;s done is he&#39;s set up some optionality for himself and he&#39;s gone from like a no win situation almost to a no lose one and big assist from that board but uh but really really been interesting to watch for the past 48 hours carter</span>

            <span class="text">carter i&#39;ll come to you in a second cory since i&#39;ve heard you infrequently consult in the space can i ask you to give us an understanding of of what you you find interesting about this particular case study or this live wire case study as it relates to the content we so commonly discuss on this podcast? For me, I&#39;ve laid out a few, including, and I haven&#39;t added, just a communication cycle back and forth and how a large social following can really drive a narrative. You know, the media leak side of things are interesting, but what interesting sort of topics do you find in this current sort of last 72 hours between between Friday and tonight that, that you, you, you would want to maybe perhaps unpack on an episode.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I&#39;ll throw a few on the table here. One is the governance, which you alluded to of open AI is super weird, right? It was this nonprofit group that then created a for-profit company. That for-profit company provides a certain amount of profit to its investors, which include groups like Microsoft, but anything above a certain cap goes back to this nonprofit. This nonprofit has board members that don&#39;t have any ownership stake in kind of like the for-profit components of the business. And in fact, we&#39;re designed to be kind of a safety breaker, right? And that clearly is not really working well in practice because the minute this happened, a bunch of people made a bunch of phone calls and now it looks like that entire thing is going to be reversed and there might be a new board. So I think that&#39;s interesting because it&#39;s almost a mini case study in itself about how like you can say you do these things, but clearly OpenAI is not actually running in this way anymore, regardless of what happens over this weekend. And so it becomes a little bit phony and I wouldn&#39;t mind unpacking that. Maybe I&#39;ll leave that there. The other one, though, is, so Altman&#39;s out. And all of a sudden, there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is a clear pressure campaign. I think some of it&#39;s organic, and some of it he helped along. There&#39;s a lot of talk about how he immediately started conversing with Microsoft about this thing or the next thing. but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but he created you know a groundswell of stakeholders pushing back on this board to try to change the outcome but concurrently he started exploring the idea of maybe he&#39;d start his own ai company and even just by putting that out there i think a put pressure on open ai but b he could actually do that and he could kind of flip the script on these things and perhaps create a for-profit company that he himself could benefit in significantly so i think that&#39;s really really interesting. And then there&#39;s this one in between the hinge point that is the board meeting. And there&#39;s been reporting on this, which, you know, also could be part of the media leak strategy really well done by him if it is where it&#39;s been leaked that he&#39;s really mad at himself for losing connection and control with the board, like that he didn&#39;t put the care into the board. The board was much bigger at the start of the year. People left the board for various reasons. The board became six people from nine, became four after the two left, you know, Altman and the president. And he said, like, I didn&#39;t put the care and tending into the board that I needed to do. And that&#39;s really interesting to me, too, because that&#39;s an interesting point about strategy as well, how you sometimes get fixated on things, but the people who are actually running the scoreboard, maybe</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe they don&#39;t care about the things you&#39;re fixated in. And it&#39;s a lesson in audience, I suppose. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I like a few of these topics. I want to start with the first one, Carter, if that&#39;s okay with you, which is just this broader concept of we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">we have seen the politics of effective altruism, of capitalism without its sharp edges, of this like unbridled, I don&#39;t need ownership or upside in the company, I&#39;m just doing good for the world, right? Right. And I&#39;m simplifying a lot of Altman&#39;s and for some background, right? So Altman has made a shit ton of money. This was an initial Y Combinator guy, found a tremendous amount of upside, you know, was part of what many would argue the tech bro revolution of growth at any cost, right? You know, who cares about revenue? Just grow. We need one of these companies to hit. You dominate the market, you dominate an industry, you create a new vertical, like all these sort of things that we&#39;ve heard over the course of the last number of years. This guy has made a boatload of cash in that era. And this, while an innovative</span>

            <span class="text">technology, I don&#39;t even know if we&#39;ve mentioned, we may have that the OpenAI is the parent company of ChatGPT, which is why it&#39;s so interesting because of their massive user growth, user sort of pay base that they also even have on the revenue stream. But Carter, the concept of the anti-Elon, the concept of the person who is going to just be in a space to kind of advocate for it, to be on the front edge or the cutting edge, but using the instruments available for capitalism and business to drive this change and to do it morally and ethically. Corey makes an interesting point that maybe the revelatory nature of this conversation that we&#39;ve had over the past number of days is that that doesn&#39;t necessarily exist in modern business, even if there are massive attempts to try to correct it or shape it or navigate it in that direction. Your thoughts on that before we jump into some of the strategy pieces there.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that this is something that we struggle with all the time. I mean, there are forms and functions for things. And we&#39;ve talked about it even in the political context where we talk about, you know, the board of directors versus the leader&#39;s office, right? Like, how do we ensure that there&#39;s the right proper power mix between these organizations, between these various structures that have been created? and it&#39;s difficult because you know we have in the same way that we have leaders that are very very powerful we also have founders that are very powerful and the board of directors of these organizations you know they often get distracted by you know as they&#39;re going through the processes to try and figure out what it is that they should be following what are the things that they should should be chasing in order to make sure that it is a better company. And so we&#39;ve seen corporations kind of get off track by following the quarterly returns and not investing into longer scale or bigger scale, bigger paybacks. Those are</span>

Like if you choose to subvert yourself to single metrics, you wind up in really difficult challenges. challenges and i think this is where we struggle with with open ai the altruism thing doesn&#39;t make sense either i remember there was a guy i don&#39;t know if you guys know him samuel bankman freed um who uh also had this big idea of of altruism and uh wound up i think</span>

            <span class="text">the reasons and rationales for running a company um are perverted all the time right they are perverted when it is to generate just a simple feedback you know to grow at all costs like you said zane or to generate the most positive cash flow for the investors as we see so many times from other organizations uh we&#39;re watching the oil and gas community uh just you know not worry about climate change just trying to maximize profits all of these things are perverted it in some fashion. And this one with open AI just seems to be a another example of trying to create something that makes the most, you know, make sense for society, but ultimately doesn&#39;t work.</span>

And I&#39;m not trying to undercut the entire sort of like CSR elements of business or this, you know, multi-dimensional stakeholder stuff of business as we talk about. But Corey, your thoughts on this as we kind of like dissect and get a peek into OpenAI in this like rare vulnerable, you know, weekend moment of kind of being like, what actually is going wrong in this business, which for any other purpose is a rocket ship in its growth and its market capitalization from a pure capitalist perspective?</span>

It&#39;s fucking bullshit. It&#39;s nonsense. That&#39;s not the way incentives run in a free market like this. It&#39;s marketing. It&#39;s just marketing. At the end of the day, it&#39;s marketing to consumers. It&#39;s marketing to employees. It&#39;s just fucking marketing. Wake up. Grow up. These people do not care about you. These organizations do not fucking care about you. somebody has said there&#39;s a niche i can fill over there if i tell people that i&#39;m donating one dollar for every x dollars i get and i&#39;ll get those customers and the customers who are more price sensitive they&#39;ll go to the company that&#39;s going to outsource everything offshore to child labor and everybody wins and i don&#39;t give a fuck and the stakeholders are happy and this is not a conscious conversation people are having this is the market at work it&#39;s a feature and you are telling yourselves you&#39;re living a good life because</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it is really interesting to see how this organization was set up, this board, which by the way, Elon Musk, you talked about the anti-Elon, Elon Musk was one of the people who helped set up OpenAI and nobody was more mad than Elon Musk when OpenAI became a for-profit organization. Like he called Sam Altman in and basically said, you have absolutely betrayed this vision that we set together. Yes,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the background there, and Corey, you may want to help me fill it, was OpenAI was going to kind of be the moral arbiter nonprofit that kind of had a technology base under it. Sam Altman and the board directors did not get shares directly from OpenAI and its upside that it was having from a pure market capitalization perspective. And then Altman kind of did a minor pivot, which included taking investment from Microsoft and other organizations, but had a profit cap rather than a non-profit motive, which for anyone who&#39;s ever sat on a board of directors of a non-profit, if your CEO comes to you and says that we&#39;re going to actually have a profit cap, despite, you know, and even brushing aside what laws that might be breaking, it&#39;s a fundamentally different model and is a fundamentally different structure, one might argue, in terms of what it&#39;s trying to promote. That&#39;s some background. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, yeah, sure. And I mean, I just played the cynic for a minute here. But to be fair, part of the logic at the time was, this is a space that requires massive injections of capital to be relevant. And so if we get the money from groups like Microsoft, which allow them to benefit from a technology that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that we are going to create ethically, right, that we are going to build in an ethical fashion, well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, then everybody wins, right? And we&#39;ll make sure that a lot of this money funnels back into this nonprofit and allows us to take on a lot of the governance work and the non-glamorous work that needs to occur in artificial intelligence in order for it to be a safe technology down the road. So this was kind of the logic. It was a cake and eat it too kind of argument that occurred here. but what&#39;s clear now after this weekend after this pressure campaign from microsoft and from all of the other investing groups here but most predominantly microsoft is like</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like the board is not actually in charge because the minute this occurred despite the fact that microsoft has no seats on the board not even observer status on the board microsoft found out apparently minutes before altman was fired um what happened next was microsoft called and i have no doubt a version of of the conversation was, you&#39;re not getting another penny from us. And we&#39;re going to pull out any money we haven&#39;t already fully committed here, if you continue down this path. And that plus employee pressure saying, we actually kind of liked what Sam Altman was doing. It just made the board realize that they were out entirely on a limb. You know, the Wall Street Journal had some interest in reporting that the board of OpenAI, they didn&#39;t have any lawyers, any communications people on the ready because they assumed OpenAI&#39;s lawyers and communications people would just do this work for them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But they didn&#39;t because</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they were actually on Team Altman here,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? Which actually also tells you something else about this board, which it was foundationally detached from the work that was going on at OpenAI. So, you know, their criticism that there&#39;s not kind of forthright communication between Altman and the board, maybe some truth to that if they&#39;re so so removed that they don&#39;t even understand where the employees would be, but clearly misread the situation. There&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">There&#39;s so many interesting lessons on board governance, which I think apply to like the broader political world and the broader leadership world. But Carter, I want to throw a few things on the table, just for your reaction as it relates to some of the lessons that we are seeing, not just over this weekend with Sam Altman and OpenAI, but just broadly in terms of leadership. And one of them is, we</span>

Corey, you might argue from your perspective that we&#39;ve always been in that era where the cult of personality, if not the personality in that individual leader, can drive so much of not just the narrative, but a company&#39;s value. you, that it is like we&#39;re almost in this aligned age between our politics and our business, that this cultural moment is at the apex of people, rather than the fact that open AI, even the day Sam Altman leaves, still has its market capitalization and upside, but we&#39;re very much in a leader-centric world. I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on that, Carter. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, so can I pick up on this? Because I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ve ever explored this with the intersection of like political organizing and political sort of values, Carter, which is how should political entities, and let me just choose the left here for the natural purposes that you will find shortly, how should they deal, to Corey&#39;s point, if they bind that thesis, how should they deal with business? One of the criticisms that the political left, especially in this country, often faces is that they&#39;re not friendly for business. Corey ultimately here is saying, listen, he likes corporations, and I&#39;m not labeling you as someone on like the left, Corey, but I&#39;m just saying like let&#39;s put your argument out there and then let&#39;s attach it to the political left sort of thing. If you like corporations, but you also want to regulate them heavily, what is like the modern day argument or relationship or entanglement, so to speak, that the political left and progressives should have with corporations? How should they deal with them, Carter, from a rhetoric perspective? How should they deal with them from a pure sort of policy perspective? Also knowing that progressives, especially in this country, and let me even narrow down even more to this province, have to get the mandate that&#39;s available, not a perfect mandate where they can kind of have Puritan views on everything, including, you know, how the capitalist system works, so to speak. I&#39;m kind of curious to explore this for a bit. Well,</span>

Good regulation means clear, understandable, and enforced regulation is good for business, right? I think that that&#39;s one of the things that people have often asked for. When those corporations stood up and stood beside Rachel Notley and said that they supported the carbon tax, one of the reasons that they stood up and said that is that they thought that everybody should be in the carbon tax place, not just people who produce significant amounts of carbon intensity through corporate activities. activities um those were clear and understandable objectives it doesn&#39;t mean no regulation there&#39;s no world in which no regulation exists except a bad one um corporations need to be you know you don&#39;t have to accept their narrative that in in any way shape or form it&#39;s bad the other thing is it&#39;s it&#39;s incumbent upon people to figure out where the regulation is and work to the edge of that regulation whether you&#39;re a corporation or you&#39;re a political party or whatever the situation may be the working to the edge of the regulation is is how you maximize opportunity i often see the left specifically the left discerning that they&#39;re going to be in some way uh better than other political organizations by following rules that don&#39;t exist you</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, your thoughts on the relationship of the political left and corporations, if you were to accept your premise that you&#39;ve kind of put out there around CSR and all this other sort of stuff being a bunch of marketing bullshit in your mind. Leave that in for me before we kind of get to the lessons that OpenAI has taught us this weekend.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it starts in not denying that markets are a real thing. And way too often you see in rhetoric on the left, like this notion of, well, that&#39;s not true. I&#39;ll raise a tax and it won&#39;t make a difference. Everybody will still stay here. It won&#39;t affect profits. They&#39;re still going to make money, so they&#39;re still going to be here. That&#39;s not actually how economic decision making happens here. So here&#39;s a couple of basic rules that I would suggest for somebody who wants to take kind of a pro-market approach here with a progressive bend. One is just set the floor for behavior. Don&#39;t drown them in red tape. Find very specific things that you want to address and say, these are the expectations. It&#39;s not a thousand of them. It&#39;s 10. And here&#39;s the 10 that I require you to do. Don&#39;t ask them to donate. Don&#39;t ask them to step up or be good corporate citizens. That&#39;s bullshit. That&#39;s actually an out for them. tax them, and spend that money on social priorities. Acknowledge that differences between markets do drive economic decision-making, so you need to collaborate and coordinate with jurisdictions to reduce those differences. That means going to the table with other provinces, trying to knock down provincial trade barriers, trying to make sure that when you are working with other jurisdictions, you have collaborated to the point you can and then designed your policy not to put your companies at disadvantage relative to those competitors. There&#39;s lots of work that&#39;s been done in this space. I&#39;m not going to go down that hole really deep, but we do this all the time. We do this with the carbon tax. Tie free trade to labor rights is an obvious one, but be clear at the end of the day, not all economic activity is good economic activity and just be really transparent with businesses. But ultimately go back to my first point, like don&#39;t deny market behavior. Like, you know, at the end of the day, you can say, I understand that would make more economic profit. I still don&#39;t want to do it. But like, just sit there and say, I don&#39;t believe that will not change things is ridiculous. And it&#39;s just kind of a denial of certain economic facts that have been proven, as Carter said, you know, since the days of Adam Smith, like have been known since the days of Adam Smith. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So Carter, reflect on this. And then tell me about the opposite argument when when when in the media, you see, if you believe this, right, if you&#39;re like ingesting this as a political belief, and saying, Okay, I&#39;m not going to deny that the market exists, I&#39;m not going to try to be like anti-business about it. I&#39;m going to use the power of laws, regulations, et cetera. Carter, I love your point about clarity, not so more so volume. I think that&#39;s a really sharp point that you made. But how would you then politically and strategically react if that is your belief going forward to when corporations maximize profit, right? Because I think the other side of it is when you see the Rich Kruegers of the world, let me point him as an example, at Suncor, we&#39;re going to get back to basics. Fuck all this other stuff that we&#39;ve been doing, effectively acknowledging and different sort of casing Corey&#39;s point being like, it&#39;s a bunch of bullshit that wasn&#39;t giving us money back into our pockets. And we&#39;re just going to do the thing that puts money back into our pockets. How should you then react if you&#39;re like accepting Corey&#39;s premise? You want to jump in on this first, Corey? Go ahead.</span>

This is what I actually wanted to go back to. Rich Krueger&#39;s not wrong. wrong it&#39;s not his job to do that shit it is not his job to do that shit and he&#39;s going to be at an economic disadvantage if he attempts to you know what should happen a law should be passed that requires him to do those kinds of things taxes should be levied that give government the ability to do those kinds of things and the notion that you&#39;re going to rely on the goodwill of a random corporation to do things is childish it is just childish and it&#39;s buying into a fantasy of capitalism that you don&#39;t need nobody needs carter</span>

And that&#39;s really what he was saying is that I recognize that this is what we&#39;re trying to achieve, but I&#39;m going to just maximize shareholder value by just kind of digging deep and trying to get the last gasp of success out of this instead of investing in longer term, more successful ventures. I mean, that&#39;s basically what he was saying. So I think he was being an asshole. I think that he was ignoring the fact that there are great returns to be found in renewable markets, and those returns are being found everywhere. That&#39;s fine, and shareholders</span>

            <span class="text">pieces of feedback of a market-based solution like the carbon tax is that it has certain failures there will be people who are willing to pay the price there are you know there&#39;s people driving around my street all the time with their black smoke coming out the back of their fucking cars because they don&#39;t care how much it costs for gas they got money in their pockets the their money in their jeans, and they&#39;re prepared to spend the dollars in order to make whatever their point is. So I think that that&#39;s one of the challenges with market-based solutions as opposed to actual regulation-based solutions. So I partly agree with Corey, even though I really don&#39;t want to.

And then, of course, another, which is a for-profit company saying we&#39;re going to actually strip away all the non-for-profit elements within our institution. But on rhetoric, Corey, where would you say you would go if you&#39;re the political left on rhetoric against capitalism and big business? Because it&#39;s all over the place right now, right? You&#39;re seeing some deny that America or North America should be a capitalist institution or an institution writ large. Others go after the regulation argument that you are. Others just say, you know, if we can get iterative improvements to improving capitalism, let&#39;s do that. Where would you be on the rhetoric for political gain right now?</span>

I don&#39;t, I mean, one of the challenges, it just globally on a million issues is what is going to be politically advantageous is probably not great policy. And you are never going to go wrong, frankly, by taking rounds out of unpopular billionaires, you know, the plutocrats of the world. And, and, and frankly, there it&#39;s been some rapacious behavior. So it&#39;s not very hard to understand why that would be the case. But you have a situation where if you&#39;re a left wing politician and you want to score some cheap points that will have resonance with people across the spectrum you know talk about big business owners talk about you know big capital and you know again given</span>

            <span class="text">Thanks for that blinding insight. Carter, okay, I think there&#39;s a few things on the board here that I find interesting. So number one is this broader concept of doing it differently. We talk about this in the political realm often. You know, political parties are machines that are designed to win elections. That&#39;s it. Don&#39;t overcomplicate it. Don&#39;t try to do it differently with that machinery, right? That is what the machine should be set up for. It&#39;s an interesting parallel with what we&#39;ve seen here. Interesting conversations on, like, you know, leadership, on individual leaders driving the sort of narrative. I think we got into a nice little deep dive where we got to explore Corey&#39;s mind a bit on the future of capitalism as it relates to the left.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But I want to come back to governance, Carter. And, like, we&#39;ve talked quite a bit about boards on the political party side, mainly because of Take Back Alberta here in the last little bit. We&#39;ve talked about boards, and I think we did a deep dive on political boards a couple years back. But what parallels do you see about over or underestimating board, either role, competency, or power that this example kind of portrays? And just to lay it out there for people, because Corey did, this was a very strange board. It&#39;s a group of folks that are, you know, looking after the purse holders, so to speak, of a $90 billion company that is designed with a nonprofit board. So people who don&#39;t have shares, don&#39;t have equity. equity so design like any non-profit board think of your local why which by the way i sit on the board of right i do not get upside in the why why would i it&#39;s a non-profit that doesn&#39;t work that way right i don&#39;t know if these board directors got paid but i suspect there was very little you know sort of upside for them even on a financial basis beyond and outside of the shares so they&#39;re doing this out of their goodwill their generosity maybe their relationship to the ceo or other folks in the broader tech community none of the vcs or funding partners that you had had funding OpenAI&#39;s growth were sitting on this board or had access to that information or were involved in the decision to let go of the CEO. So I want to just add some of the context there. But really, Carter, I&#39;m talking about power and influence of boards. What lessons or sort of parallels do you see between politics and what we saw go down this weekend with this really bizarre story?</span>

I think that the individual that is seen to be the power behind the organization, is becoming or or maybe always was more important than the boards and things along those lines i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s countless examples of companies that are publicly traded that are controlled by a small group of shareholders um because uh the power of the founder or the power of the organization you know the or the the primary that that that person uh or the the the, the family or whatever. I mean, we all watch succession. We all understand this, um, that, that, you know, whether it&#39;s set up formally so that they have control or whether their control is seen to be almost mythical.

            <span class="text">their dumb, meaty hands. It&#39;s like ridiculous. Well, talk to me then, Corey, about power here, right? Because they&#39;ve got to do this. And in politics, we often kind of look at the board as an aside, outside of the flashpoints of Take Back Alberta. And this was a couple weeks ago, right? So it&#39;s fresh in our minds. They took over the board. Great. We&#39;ll forget about this in a couple months. And then boom, they have an ability to do something. They ousted Kenny. They organized to oust Kenny. Now, of course, that was less bored and more organizing. But, you know, there are these sort of moments where we forget their ability, despite their competence, to do certain things. And I think that&#39;s such an interesting dynamic that we have in this era of cult of leadership, where it&#39;s like, it&#39;s Trudeau, or it&#39;s Pierre, or it&#39;s Danielle, and it&#39;s all these people. But there&#39;s this board, regardless of what you think of their size, their competence, their makeup, how they got there, that controls some very important aspects of the current ecosystem that we find, whether it&#39;s in business or in politics.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s a great point. And, you know, it doesn&#39;t matter what – actually, I think political boards are the perfect jumping off point for this, right? Because on paper, the board of a political party has a ton of authority. In practice, the board of a political party does not, right? Like on a day-to-day basis, they simply don&#39;t, right? Right. And it&#39;s true. I think of organizations, big and small political and non-political corporate nonprofit, whatever it, it actually only matters a little what&#39;s on the paper. You only have the power to do the things that says you can have on the paper. If everybody&#39;s going to let you do them, like if all of the stakeholders around are going to allow that to occur. And here there were some very powerful stakeholder groups who clearly were disinterested in the board&#39;s decision, you know, and let&#39;s be clear, the board was set up to be worried about the safety of ai sam altman himself regularly talked about how this was the board&#39;s purpose which made it unique and he himself was accountable to this board and this board could fire him right but there were funders there you know the the valuation hadn&#39;t gone through but there was estimates of 80 billion us that&#39;s a lot of money in canadian coin here right</span>

            <span class="text">for a situation like this to occur in a normal, healthy organization, and I will say you can be a normal, healthy organization that has to fire its CEO. For a situation to occur like this in a normal, healthy organization, there would be kind of like months of conversations, critical feedback from the board saying, we&#39;re not getting what we need from you here. There would be mediation. There would be people brought in. There would be conversations with the funders, you know, to make sure that there was comfort with it. There would be kind of a seasoning of the employees to allow them to at least see some of these things coming and not have them come out of the blue like this and just rock their world on a random Friday. And none of that seems to have happened. None of that seems to have happened.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, what&#39;s the parallel you see between the world we often talk about, operate in, in politics, and Corey&#39;s point here around the power on paper versus the actual exercising authorities? You&#39;ve probably witnessed this in your own right, having seen political boards. So, you know, maybe I kind of go down to a baseline question based on your answer around, like, are we overestimating and over-crediting the value that some of these political boards might have? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, I look at the power of a cabinet. The power of a cabinet is so weak right now. It is probably the weakest it&#39;s ever been. I just finished reading a book about Churchill and World War II and the cabinet&#39;s backs and forths and the challenges that Churchill was having with Lord Halifax during the first month of his prime ministership. And I don&#39;t think any of that would exist in today&#39;s society. In today&#39;s society, it is get on board with the prime minister, get the fuck out of here. And I think that, you know, there are responsive roles in response. The diffusion of responsibility isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. Having people be responsible for different pieces of oversight is probably pretty good. In politics, we&#39;ve all been given it up. We&#39;ve said to Justin Trudeau, you&#39;re in charge of the liberals, you&#39;re now in charge of the government, you&#39;re in charge of your cabinet. You know, people forget that the liberals aren&#39;t the government. The cabinet&#39;s the government. The prime minister is not the dictator. The cabinet&#39;s supposed to be running the government. The prime minister is just the first minister. minister. But in today&#39;s society, we&#39;ve given that away. And we&#39;ve gone with this cult of, you know, cult of personality. And because I don&#39;t know if it was easier or, or what, but even when you compare it to the American frame, right, the American frame that these people were never going to, you know, the president would never campaign, they would never debase themselves that way. And that didn&#39;t last because the president there was power to be had. And the The moment there&#39;s power to be had, people are going to act to get it. And, you know, in today&#39;s society, that means that they are acting to get it from their colleagues within within their own caucuses. And the board of directors, if you will, the cabinet that&#39;s supposed to be running our country has</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s interesting. Carter, taking my interpretation of political boards in a different direction, but I like it around cabinets, so to speak, and their influence. Corey, final thoughts for you, and weave this question in. Are we going to see more of this? And let me define this. This being companies that have that continued social mission that sort of lathers on even heavier than we&#39;re seeing before, for-profit companies cased with the non-profits, kind of like we&#39;ve seen here with Sam Altman and others. There&#39;s this sort of general movement of wearing your politics, wearing your advocacy, your social mission on your capitalist sleeve. Do you feel like that era is coming to an end? Do you feel like you&#39;re sort of thinking around like let it be in its more defined box is coming to kind of back into into vogue? I&#39;m kind of curious to get your thoughts on this, both from your strategist perspective and also sort of your business hat, so to speak, as well.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">mean, maybe we&#39;re at a it&#39;s time to call bullshit moment here. Because if you have a situation where a board, which in theory has all of the powers to do exactly what they did for exactly the purpose they did it, right? The entire purpose of the board was to set up to make sure AI was being created in a safe way. That&#39;s the entire reason this organization exists. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this was the decision they made, that they were no longer comfortable with the communication they were getting and that AI was being created in a safe way with all of these launch of commercial products being rushed to market. That&#39;s what the reporting is, again, as of like, well, now 9.50 or whatever mountain time here.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But this is hardly unique. I mean, it is such an extreme manifestation. And the fact that they can&#39;t even hold when all of those conditions favor them should make us really question a lot of the other initiatives we see out there. There are CSR initiatives in corporations that maybe don&#39;t actually care that much about CSR. DEI initiatives in organizations that seem to only be giving lip service to DEI. Like it does seem when the rubber hits the road, do these things actually matter to these private corporations? I think you need, I</span>

Like, it&#39;s just, it&#39;s a foolish idea. And so, you know, I&#39;m not a big like regulate everybody to death kind of guy, but I think we need to be very thoughtful and very purposeful and be willing to regulate where it makes sense to regulate to set a floor that we insist on as a society.

It&#39;s not like they allow their own staff to just run roughshod through the organization. There are rules and regulations within the corporations to protect the corporation. There should be rules and regulations that are put in place to protect society. That&#39;s just common sense, but we&#39;ve moved away from it too much. And we&#39;re asking these corporations to do that work themselves, and they&#39;re not going to do it. They&#39;re not going to put in the rules that we need.</span>

And the reason I ask is there is a political backdrop here. DEI in the United States is at an assault. We&#39;ve seen it here a bit with the UCP, right, with kind of mentioning some of their institutions. But in the United States, we&#39;re seeing this as part of the anti-woke movement.

And if you want to represent who you are in a certain light, there&#39;ll be people who go above and beyond. on my point is if you expect the floor to be something that everybody just kind of accept you know if you want a floor that&#39;s above the regulatory floor you&#39;re kidding yourself that&#39;s never going to happen these things are not going to just occur and so you&#39;ve got to accept that and you&#39;ve got to set the floor where the floor has got to be set and that&#39;s a societal conversation that we can have when i talk about things like dei right and where i question perhaps some some corporations overall commitment to them.</span>

And, you know, I just question whether like, if we&#39;ve got a problem with that, then I think we got to do something about that. We can&#39;t just sort of assume that some corporation is going to do this because it&#39;s in the goodness of their heart. Now, do you want to go there? Do you not want to go there?

We&#39;ve seen the assault from a pure political basis happen in the U.S. We see it creeping in here. There&#39;s an argument that is being made by the right and certainly some members of the center-left, let&#39;s be honest, that&#39;s saying that we went too fast, too hard on DE&amp;I, that it felt like it was being forced down to people, that it was trying to be a conversation, that we were trying to compress what we hadn&#39;t done in the last 50 years in a matter of a couple of years post-2020. There is that loud criticism that you hear, even with people who consider themselves, quote unquote, allies.

There are other initiatives of DEI where the economic benefit to a corporation is less obvious, like creating scholarships for employees for DEI and things of that.
