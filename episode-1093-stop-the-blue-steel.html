            <span class="text">candidates out of the debates. A debate, when you&#39;re going to win regardless of whether or not you attend, is just filled with risk. There&#39;s no upside for going to a debate. If you don&#39;t go to the debate, the voters will in some fashion punish you. They&#39;re not going to do that. So why would you go to the debate? I mean, it is just risk. There is no reward. So if you&#39;re if you&#39;re being quite crass about it there is absolutely no reason to go to a bait and in fact i&#39;ve advised some of my candidates don&#39;t go to the debate there are other ways that we can use your time that will get you the same outcome or even a better outcome and i would argue for donald trump he got a much better outcome now for other candidates getting booked in a jail in in uh in in Georgia, isn&#39;t going to be a better outcome. But for Donald Trump, I mean, he&#39;s got the Midas touch in some fashion. You know, anything he touches turns to gold. And by gold, I mean fundraising opportunities. And he&#39;s turned it into fundraising opportunities. The guy&#39;s nailed it. Absolutely nailed it.</span>

Corey, I&#39;ve called this on a previous episode, probably going to be the most circulated image that we&#39;re going to see going forward when it was out. But talk to me about debate first, before we get into the tactics of Donald Trump and what lies ahead for the week. Was it the right call to just skip out in the debate? And was the right call strategically to just be like, there is no upside for me. So settle this yourself, second place contenders.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, you know, Donald Trump has always been a little bit, he&#39;ll play it his way with debates. You&#39;ll recall in the 2016 debates, he&#39;s like, maybe I&#39;ll show up, maybe I won&#39;t. There were the pat questions about, will you agree to support the other candidate if you lose? And he said, no. And there were boos in the crowd, and he&#39;s like, I don&#39;t fucking care. Right. His strength as a candidate, insofar as you can call it a strength and not a deep moral weakness, is that he is willing to push those boundaries and break those norms if there&#39;s not any kind of extrinsic punishment that comes with it here. And like, there&#39;s a broader story about debates. And Donald Trump&#39;s just an extreme manifestation. You know, I remember in 2004, I think it was, where Vladimir Putin was running for re-election. I think it was 2004, might have been like 2012. You know, it was one of those presidential election years for him. And he just didn&#39;t do the debate. And I remember thinking, well, that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty good example of like what Russia is or has become, because obviously, if somebody tried to do that in a Western democracy, they would be they would be crushed for it. You know, there was this sense that the voters would punish them, as you&#39;ve already talked about, we used to at least think they would.</span>

You&#39;re like, you got to show up for a debate. those rules don&#39;t apply anymore and nobody manifests the the rules don&#39;t apply anymore id of our time more than donald trump so so i i mean i think it&#39;s he&#39;s running an optimal strategy is it a moral strategy i mean no one&#39;s ever accused the guy of running a moral strategy and he&#39;s the front runner and if nothing else happens he will be the republican nominee so why would he help anybody make news it just doesn&#39;t make any sense carter</span>

Because we&#39;ve talked about on a riding level, we&#39;ve done episodes where on a riding level, why candidates skip debates. If they feel like there&#39;s no upside, usually it&#39;s the central campaign telling them to be like, fuck off, don&#39;t go to a debate. Anything that gets clipped out of that debate takes us off message. This is not that question. The question I have is, this is the guy at the top skipping out on a debate. I suspect that if the polls stay the same for him in the head-to-head against Biden, he might do the same. Now, the polls don&#39;t say that right now, but he might do the same. So the question I have for you is like, is there a lesson here that</span>

I mean, that&#39;s not a great development, frankly. and um and that&#39;s too bad i don&#39;t think it&#39;s the root cause i actually think the sports team thing is a much more meaningful challenge that we have right now people not willing to hold their own team to account but to bring this back to you know the strategic implications you asked about the reality is politicians of all stripes are testing walls always you know they&#39;re they&#39;re looking to see what they can get away with uh what they will be punished by the voters for doing and what the voters will turn a blind eye to. And Lindsey Graham is actually the perfect example of that. Lindsey Graham clearly</span>

            <span class="text">clearly hates Donald Trump. I don&#39;t doubt that for a minute. But Lindsey Graham is clearly a coward. And he has this feedback mechanism around him where every time he speaks out against Donald Trump, the world around him comes down and criticizes him. And he says, Oh, my God, I am so afraid of not being popular. I&#39;m going to jump back into the boat with this asshole. And so this is something that I think as voters is, I mean, we live in a democracy. This is so self-evident, but I&#39;m going to say it. This is your superpower in a democracy, your ability to moderate behavior based on what you are willing to tolerate. And if we&#39;re going to tolerate anything, well, then anything is going to happen. And that&#39;s just a reality that I think should cause us all a little bit of concern. Hey,</span>

And we used to talk about country before party, constitution before candidate, things like that. Really interesting to see how polling has shifted on a lot of those things and answers answers to questions, especially in the United States, to things like, I would be okay with an end to democracy if it meant my party was always in charge. Shockingly high percentages in the United States. Both parties would say that. And that&#39;s really, that&#39;s</span>

But he will respond to it because he&#39;s looking into essentially a mirror of something that Joe Rogan values, which apparently is human combat. But, you know, it doesn&#39;t matter to Trump. Trump just grabs the cultural touchpoint, morphs it and uses it for himself. And that&#39;s his really, I think, only skill is being able to take those touchpoints and turn them into his own thing.
