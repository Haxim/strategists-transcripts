          <p>The gang talk about Trump's perfect mug shot and the politics it reveals before turning their attention to Chrystia Freeland being caught going a too-fast-but-pretty-normal speed of 132km/h in a 110km/h zone - and her extremely contrite reaction.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Donald Trump's Georgia arrest, the strategy of mug shots and Chrystia Freeland's speeding ticket reaction. Did Trump get the picture he was after? Why did Freeland dial the contrition for speeding up to 11? And when will we hear more about Carter's monthly nut? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

There&#39;s no upside for going to a debate. If you don&#39;t go to the debate, the voters will in some fashion punish you. They&#39;re not going to do that. So why would you go to the debate? I mean, it is just risk. There is no reward. So if you&#39;re if you&#39;re being quite crass about it there is absolutely no reason to go to a bait and in fact i&#39;ve advised some of my candidates don&#39;t go to the debate there are other ways that we can use your time that will get you the same outcome or even a better outcome and i would argue for donald trump he got a much better outcome now for other candidates getting booked in a jail in in uh in in Georgia, isn&#39;t going to be a better outcome. But for Donald Trump, I mean, he&#39;s got the Midas touch in some fashion. You know, anything he touches turns to gold. And by gold, I mean fundraising opportunities.

But talk to me about debate first, before we get into the tactics of Donald Trump and what lies ahead for the week. Was it the right call to just skip out in the debate? And was the right call strategically to just be like, there is no upside for me. So settle this yourself, second place contenders.</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, you know, Donald Trump has always been a little bit, he&#39;ll play it his way with debates. You&#39;ll recall in the 2016 debates, he&#39;s like, maybe I&#39;ll show up, maybe I won&#39;t. There were the pat questions about, will you agree to support the other candidate if you lose? And he said, no. And there were boos in the crowd, and he&#39;s like, I don&#39;t fucking care. Right. His strength as a candidate, insofar as you can call it a strength and not a deep moral weakness, is that he is willing to push those boundaries and break those norms if there&#39;s not any kind of extrinsic punishment that comes with it here. And like, there&#39;s a broader story about debates. And Donald Trump&#39;s just an extreme manifestation. You know, I remember in 2004, I think it was, where Vladimir Putin was running for re-election. I think it was 2004, might have been like 2012. You know, it was one of those presidential election years for him. And he just didn&#39;t do the debate. And I remember thinking, well, that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty good example of like what Russia is or has become, because obviously, if somebody tried to do that in a Western democracy, they would be they would be crushed for it. You know, there was this sense that the voters would punish them, as you&#39;ve already talked about, we used to at least think they would.</div>

You&#39;re like, you got to show up for a debate. those rules don&#39;t apply anymore and nobody manifests the the rules don&#39;t apply anymore id of our time more than donald trump so so i i mean i think it&#39;s he&#39;s running an optimal strategy is it a moral strategy i mean no one&#39;s ever accused the guy of running a moral strategy and he&#39;s the front runner and if nothing else happens he will be the republican nominee so why would he help anybody make news it just doesn&#39;t make any sense carter</div>

If they feel like there&#39;s no upside, usually it&#39;s the central campaign telling them to be like, fuck off, don&#39;t go to a debate. Anything that gets clipped out of that debate takes us off message. This is not that question. The question I have is, this is the guy at the top skipping out on a debate.

And he says, Oh, my God, I am so afraid of not being popular. I&#39;m going to jump back into the boat with this asshole. And so this is something that I think as voters is, I mean, we live in a democracy. This is so self-evident, but I&#39;m going to say it. This is your superpower in a democracy, your ability to moderate behavior based on what you are willing to tolerate. And if we&#39;re going to tolerate anything, well, then anything is going to happen. And that&#39;s just a reality that I think should cause us all a little bit of concern. Hey,</div>
