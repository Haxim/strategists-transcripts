And the most important comment is the one he made at the end about like a bastardization would be possible here. And let&#39;s be really clear. Yes, it&#39;s the Trudeau Foundation. Yes, it&#39;s about Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Yes, there is separation from Justin Trudeau. But no, it&#39;s not something he can entirely walk away from. It&#39;s a foundation named after his family, his father specifically. And there is going to be that conflation in people&#39;s minds. And look, if we were talking Donald Trump and the Donald Trump Foundation and Eric Trump, for example, saying, I have nothing to do with that foundation. Now, admittedly, in this particular scenario, Eric Trump was involved in the foundation. But the fact is, the family names there, it&#39;s all tied together. If the foundation elevates reputation, the foundation can bring down reputation. And that&#39;s just something you have to be mindful of when you have a foundation. Wealthy people who have foundations face these these challenges all the time the reputation of the foundation and their reputation one and the same in many cases and the fact that it&#39;s named after a father rather than the son pretty irrelevant because a lot of foundations take that particular approach too and you know i could even think of like my my alma mater is you know ivy right named after richard ivy senior but the donation was given by richard ivy jr do you think people say like well no that&#39;s his father that&#39;s not him Like there&#39;s that conflation happens. That&#39;s just a blurring that they have to live with. And so that&#39;s really unfortunate for Justin Trudeau, but it&#39;s a reality. The foundation&#39;s woes are his woes.

Corey, let&#39;s say the headline in six weeks. Let me use six weeks as an arbitrary measure. Trudeau Foundation can&#39;t fucking survive shutters, doors, fine, fabulous, or fucked. You said that the current story is an in-between on fine and fucked. What would that story be to you for the political damage it would cause the liberals?</div>

            <div class="said">Do you know, in a funny way, I think it would actually cause less damage because then that separation would be almost an unavoidable element of the story, right? As people were talking about, well, but the foundation exists separately and Justin Trudeau is not actually involved in it. And that delineation almost would would be an important component of the story as it was being explained to readers and listeners. So in some ways, it reduces the risk. Still a little fucked for all of the reasons I said. And look, the idea of Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport being the equivalent here, let&#39;s actually use that example. If the federal bureaucracy decided to put all of its money into Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport, and do you think it would actually work for the prime minister to say, you know it&#39;s named after my dad but it has nothing to do with my dad right the reality is no but you&#39;re it gets messy no it gets messy it gets messy when your name is tied to all of these things for the same reason schools it&#39;s</div>

Like, we&#39;ve all been there in a meeting where you kind of agree with the attacker, but you think they&#39;re being such a dick, you almost find yourself jumping the defense of the person that&#39;s being attacked. And this is a bit of an example of that. Like, for starters, why bring Canadian press into it? I</div>

            <div class="said">I don&#39;t think that Canadians, if you were going to poll them on Canadian press, then Canadian press should go down in flames or that they&#39;re some deeply partisan organization. That&#39;s, you know, maybe there are pockets of people Maybe that&#39;s something going on in the right-wing blogosphere right now. Canadians as a whole, general population, not pissed off with Canadian press. So you&#39;ve taken an issue that was strong and you&#39;ve made it weak, right? But the second is you&#39;re just being a jerk about it. And at the end of the day, I just don&#39;t believe Canadians are jerks. And I don&#39;t think that they want to be represented by a jerk. And Pierre Polyev needs to be careful that while he&#39;s playing to a bass that is very animated and very riled up, and while he&#39;s trying to take tactics that worked for Donald Trump, he doesn&#39;t forget the context. Canada is not the United States. And while there might be kind of a growing antipathy between partisan sides in this country, we&#39;re not there, and we&#39;re not them. And there are different considerations here. We don&#39;t have winner takes all states. We go writing by writing. And we&#39;re ultimately just not as nasty of a people in public discourse. So he&#39;s got to watch that as he goes forward. word yeah</div>

You&#39;re not actually, if you&#39;re in an actual argument with somebody, the odds of them actually changing their mind on the spot are super low. They might change their mind a week later. They might find a way to modify their views so they&#39;re a little closer to your views if you&#39;ve convinced them in certain ways like debates do work over the long term but in the short term they don&#39;t so you&#39;ve always sort of got to keep in your mind i am you know i win the debate by staying focused on my point and presenting myself as i want to be presented not by scoring the most points with the individual right like it&#39;s not a boxing match where you&#39;re trying to take somebody down you&#39;re not getting scored on a card it&#39;s the overall feeling that you provide to the person who&#39;s watching it the last thing you want is people shuffling uncomfortably in their seats you know I was saying on Twitter, and this was about a different Pierre Polyev thing that maybe we&#39;ll get to, is you don&#39;t want to act like somebody that you feel deeply uncomfortable being stuck in an elevator with. You don&#39;t want to act like somebody that would make you get off a bus a stop early because you just feel deeply uncomfortable in their presence as they&#39;re going on and being such a jerk. And he&#39;s trending dangerously into that territory for some people. If you get off the bus a stop early, you&#39;re never going to hear the point.

But do you feel like for those that organize, that try to persuade, that try to mobilize people, this kind of provides a window into what that interaction looks like at the doors when you&#39;re trying to convince people in some way? And you might think this is a stretch and I should move the fuck on, but I found this quite textbook in some ways of what you try to teach an organizer around a difficult person who&#39;s got an opinion that you might be able to... You know, they might take a while to Corey&#39;s point around getting around to it and seeing that they&#39;re actually don&#39;t have a very strong, robust system of thought around what they believe. But it dislodges someone, maybe even momentarily. Just any thoughts on that before I move on to the other questions? I mean,</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;ll tell you this. Deep canvassing is interesting to me. The thing about all politics is it&#39;s an ever-shifting landscape. And for decades now, the conventional wisdom has been the purpose of going to the doors, the purpose of canvassing is identify votes, get off the door if it&#39;s somebody who&#39;s not in agreement with you, because you&#39;ve just got to go out, you&#39;ve got to find the votes, you&#39;ve got to pull them on election day. But we are seeing a shift, I think, in the past 10 years where people are starting to say, wow, that&#39;s super shallow. And maybe in the long term, that&#39;s not a productive strategy. Maybe we do need to make the investments in time to try to persuade people of our arguments and move them forward. And you&#39;re seeing more investments in that. But it&#39;s hard to do at scale. And one of the things that was interesting about this particular moment is if you were to watch it, now the trick is you&#39;d have to get somebody to watch it who holds those those beliefs but it could almost be a proxy that you could sit there and be an observer for and yes and maybe like not quote unquote learn from it zane maybe i don&#39;t i don&#39;t go that far but it&#39;s something that you could say wow</div>

She&#39;s speaking about the nature of foreign interference at the Procedures and House Affairs Committee. committee, many times saying she can&#39;t get into it, that it&#39;s not something she can talk about, that she can&#39;t speak to specifics, testifies for two hours. Overall, you know, seems to have a bit of a mixed bag. Some people frustrated about a lack of specifics. Doesn&#39;t seem to be any smoking gun, at least from the early hours of analysis that we are seeing right now. For the liberal government, fine, fabulous, or fucked overall? Does this change anything from your perspective? What do you think? And we talked about some advice to her last Sunday, heading into today. Fine, fabulous, we&#39;re fucked.</div>

And so mission accomplished. I do think there were probably some optimizations that were available. The way that she brushed off the comments, you know, and said, like, this is a national security matter, seemed fine, at least in the clips that I saw, could have maybe been stronger and said, and been taken more of that approach of being like, I would love to answer and there&#39;s other avenues in which I can answer. Maybe she did that in some of the answers. I didn&#39;t watch the full footage, so I&#39;m just going to fully confess on that. that i do wonder if she hasn&#39;t set a couple of small traps for the liberals down the road her comment that the prime minister reads everything that is put in front of them right</div>

But, you know, the reality is they also said – they did it for, I think, very principled reasons. They make a pretty compelling case that they are not state-funded. Only about 1% of their budget, I believe, comes directly from government. There&#39;s some indirect money that comes in there, too. but it if they are state funded basically every outlet in canada is state funded because of the way that we support media in this country everything from post media to cbc so i don&#39;t think that they were wrong and it&#39;s nice when you can take a principled stance and you&#39;re not wrong um maybe the start of something maybe not i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s other shoes to drop i certainly I certainly could imagine other outlets being</div>

Polyev is now asking the CRA to audit the Trudeau Foundation over donations connected to foreign governments. In or out on Pierre, continue to stoke the flames. He did the letter that we talked about, and now he&#39;s asking the CRA to audit, in or out, on his continued assault on the Trudeau Foundation. Is it good strategy, and are you in on it?</div>

Are you in or out for the feds being like, fuck it, we&#39;ll just buy this land that&#39;s now been closed. We&#39;ll just buy this street.
