            <span class="text">It&#39;s somewhere between fine and fucked. I think Stephen is glossing over it. And the most important comment is the one he made at the end about like a bastardization would be possible here. And let&#39;s be really clear. Yes, it&#39;s the Trudeau Foundation. Yes, it&#39;s about Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Yes, there is separation from Justin Trudeau. But no, it&#39;s not something he can entirely walk away from. It&#39;s a foundation named after his family, his father specifically. And there is going to be that conflation in people&#39;s minds. And look, if we were talking Donald Trump and the Donald Trump Foundation and Eric Trump, for example, saying, I have nothing to do with that foundation. Now, admittedly, in this particular scenario, Eric Trump was involved in the foundation. But the fact is, the family names there, it&#39;s all tied together. If the foundation elevates reputation, the foundation can bring down reputation. And that&#39;s just something you have to be mindful of when you have a foundation. Wealthy people who have foundations face these these challenges all the time the reputation of the foundation and their reputation one and the same in many cases and the fact that it&#39;s named after a father rather than the son pretty irrelevant because a lot of foundations take that particular approach too and you know i could even think of like my my alma mater is you know ivy right named after richard ivy senior but the donation was given by richard ivy jr do you think people say like well no that&#39;s his father that&#39;s not him Like there&#39;s that conflation happens. That&#39;s just a blurring that they have to live with. And so that&#39;s really unfortunate for Justin Trudeau, but it&#39;s a reality. The foundation&#39;s woes are his woes. And in a lot of Canadians&#39; eyes, they will say, well, something</span>

It will be forgotten in the sands of time and it will not be deep enough to write the enduring story. The enduring story is the primary brand story. We talk a lot about establishing brands.

Corey, let&#39;s say the headline in six weeks. Let me use six weeks as an arbitrary measure. Trudeau Foundation can&#39;t fucking survive shutters, doors, fine, fabulous, or fucked. You said that the current story is an in-between on fine and fucked. What would that story be to you for the political damage it would cause the liberals?</span>

            <span class="text">Do you know, in a funny way, I think it would actually cause less damage because then that separation would be almost an unavoidable element of the story, right? As people were talking about, well, but the foundation exists separately and Justin Trudeau is not actually involved in it. And that delineation almost would would be an important component of the story as it was being explained to readers and listeners. So in some ways, it reduces the risk. Still a little fucked for all of the reasons I said. And look, the idea of Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport being the equivalent here, let&#39;s actually use that example. If the federal bureaucracy decided to put all of its money into Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport, and do you think it would actually work for the prime minister to say, you know it&#39;s named after my dad but it has nothing to do with my dad right the reality is no but you&#39;re it gets messy no it gets messy it gets messy when your name is tied to all of these things for the same reason schools it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">the tax on the CBC. So this week at a press conference, Pierre Pauliev had a back and forth with a reporter who asked him, you know, I&#39;m going to paraphrase here because I don&#39;t have the actual script in front of me, but I&#39;ll pull it up. If you want to defund the CBC, are you going to do that to Radio Canada, which would be toxic in Quebec? Are you going to change the legislation</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">to do that? He says, aren&#39;t you from the fucking Canadian press? Isn&#39;t the CBC your biggest client? They say, yes, we&#39;re from the Canadian press. Yes, the CBC is our biggest client. Okay, well, I don&#39;t want you to have a conflict of interest with your CBC overlords. And then he goes on with a rant that calls CBC a biased propaganda arm of the Liberal Party. Corey, conservative leaders historically have attacked the CBC. This seems to be an increasing Pierre style of rhetoric, so maybe not all that surprising. Strategy, strategy, strategy, though. Fine, fabulous, or fucked. The work that Pierre is doing on this particular file, this particular tone against the CBC, the tone that he&#39;s creating, creating fine fabulous or fucked from a pure strategy level for himself in your mind we&#39;ll start with you uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh i think individually it&#39;s actually fine but as part of a broader pattern of behavior it&#39;s a bit fucked let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about the cbc issue specifically and then let&#39;s broaden what i think is pierre&#39;s challenge and i think i&#39;ll probably be returning to this a few times based on what i know else has happened this week yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so the cbc issue defund the cbc in polling you will generally see that canadians support that more than they don&#39;t they want to reduce funding for the cbc like 46 37 support for it you know strongly is on both side but generally speaking it&#39;s an issue where there&#39;s more people who want to reduce funding for the cbc than them want to maintain funding for the cbc so it is a bit of a winner right in terms of like a policy issue for the government but that said there there was always two things to consider in any political communication on policy right the first is the product the product&#39;s a winner the second is the packaging and he&#39;s got to think about the tone and the way he&#39;s comporting himself and how he&#39;s bringing himself into public conversations here because it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">really you know really good point made in a way that is just so off-putting that that you find you can&#39;t agree with the point. Like, we&#39;ve all been there in a meeting where you kind of agree with the attacker, but you think they&#39;re being such a dick, you almost find yourself jumping the defense of the person that&#39;s being attacked. And this is a bit of an example of that. Like, for starters, why bring Canadian press into it? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think that Canadians, if you were going to poll them on Canadian press, then Canadian press should go down in flames or that they&#39;re some deeply partisan organization. That&#39;s, you know, maybe there are pockets of people Maybe that&#39;s something going on in the right-wing blogosphere right now. Canadians as a whole, general population, not pissed off with Canadian press. So you&#39;ve taken an issue that was strong and you&#39;ve made it weak, right? But the second is you&#39;re just being a jerk about it. And at the end of the day, I just don&#39;t believe Canadians are jerks. And I don&#39;t think that they want to be represented by a jerk. And Pierre Polyev needs to be careful that while he&#39;s playing to a bass that is very animated and very riled up, and while he&#39;s trying to take tactics that worked for Donald Trump, he doesn&#39;t forget the context. Canada is not the United States. And while there might be kind of a growing antipathy between partisan sides in this country, we&#39;re not there, and we&#39;re not them. And there are different considerations here. We don&#39;t have winner takes all states. We go writing by writing. And we&#39;re ultimately just not as nasty of a people in public discourse. So he&#39;s got to watch that as he goes forward. word yeah</span>

You&#39;re not actually, if you&#39;re in an actual argument with somebody, the odds of them actually changing their mind on the spot are super low. They might change their mind a week later. They might find a way to modify their views so they&#39;re a little closer to your views if you&#39;ve convinced them in certain ways like debates do work over the long term but in the short term they don&#39;t so you&#39;ve always sort of got to keep in your mind i am you know i win the debate by staying focused on my point and presenting myself as i want to be presented not by scoring the most points with the individual right like it&#39;s not a boxing match where you&#39;re trying to take somebody down you&#39;re not getting scored on a card it&#39;s the overall feeling that you provide to the person who&#39;s watching it the last thing you want is people shuffling uncomfortably in their seats you know I was saying on Twitter, and this was about a different Pierre Polyev thing that maybe we&#39;ll get to, is you don&#39;t want to act like somebody that you feel deeply uncomfortable being stuck in an elevator with. You don&#39;t want to act like somebody that would make you get off a bus a stop early because you just feel deeply uncomfortable in their presence as they&#39;re going on and being such a jerk. And he&#39;s trending dangerously into that territory for some people. If you get off the bus a stop early, you&#39;re never going to hear the point.

            <span class="text">and and it&#39;s it&#39;s one of the the mantras of or the organizing the organizers in politics which is it gives people hope right like most people present strongly but once you motivationally interview them or you deep canvas them which are like two organizer techniques which are people use at the doors that you can actually persuade them and to me the reason if i were to answer this question i thought this was fabulous is that this was kind of textbook in both cases prime minister kind of like questioning someone their cognitive dissonance and being like how deep do you is your commitment here and you realize that&#39;s actually quite shaky so proving you know one of that and also the way he kind of conducted the conversation i thought that was quite interesting carter like and maybe the question i have for you guys is is do you feel And this is just one example. But do you feel like for those that organize, that try to persuade, that try to mobilize people, this kind of provides a window into what that interaction looks like at the doors when you&#39;re trying to convince people in some way? And you might think this is a stretch and I should move the fuck on, but I found this quite textbook in some ways of what you try to teach an organizer around a difficult person who&#39;s got an opinion that you might be able to... You know, they might take a while to Corey&#39;s point around getting around to it and seeing that they&#39;re actually don&#39;t have a very strong, robust system of thought around what they believe. But it dislodges someone, maybe even momentarily. Just any thoughts on that before I move on to the other questions? I mean,</span>

            <span class="text">mean, the whole deep canvassing thing, I think that it has been proven to be the only thing that actually will shape someone&#39;s overall opinion. And Corey&#39;s made the point, you know, you can change someone&#39;s opinion. That is something that can happen. But it does come with an awful lot of steps to get through. I mean, you have to identify the political, you know, the political leadings, how tightly they&#39;re associated with their cohort. Is this, you know, this isn&#39;t, it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ll tell you this. Deep canvassing is interesting to me. The thing about all politics is it&#39;s an ever-shifting landscape. And for decades now, the conventional wisdom has been the purpose of going to the doors, the purpose of canvassing is identify votes, get off the door if it&#39;s somebody who&#39;s not in agreement with you, because you&#39;ve just got to go out, you&#39;ve got to find the votes, you&#39;ve got to pull them on election day. But we are seeing a shift, I think, in the past 10 years where people are starting to say, wow, that&#39;s super shallow. And maybe in the long term, that&#39;s not a productive strategy. Maybe we do need to make the investments in time to try to persuade people of our arguments and move them forward. And you&#39;re seeing more investments in that. But it&#39;s hard to do at scale. And one of the things that was interesting about this particular moment is if you were to watch it, now the trick is you&#39;d have to get somebody to watch it who holds those those beliefs but it could almost be a proxy that you could sit there and be an observer for and yes and maybe like not quote unquote learn from it zane maybe i don&#39;t i don&#39;t go that far but it&#39;s something that you could say wow</span>

But one of the things that it highlighted is that when you&#39;re fed that high sugar, low nutrition diet, like there&#39;s nothing there and you crash just like a sugar crash. And the prime minister really exposed the superficiality, I think, of some of these views. And over time, I think there&#39;s a window. I don&#39;t recommend you do it in a 28-day campaign right now, for example, like if you&#39;re an Alberta campaigner.

That is evidently clear. And again, it has that same very grating tone. And at one point, conservatives were the ones who were supposed to support tradition and respectfulness and decorum and politics. politics and i mean what the hell happened here that a governor general appointed by a conservative by stephen harper is being called dear quote rapporteur not the right honorable david johnson yeah right or or something like that it&#39;s just designed to be kind of shitty and again</span>

She&#39;s speaking about the nature of foreign interference at the Procedures and House Affairs Committee. committee, many times saying she can&#39;t get into it, that it&#39;s not something she can talk about, that she can&#39;t speak to specifics, testifies for two hours. Overall, you know, seems to have a bit of a mixed bag. Some people frustrated about a lack of specifics. Doesn&#39;t seem to be any smoking gun, at least from the early hours of analysis that we are seeing right now. For the liberal government, fine, fabulous, or fucked overall? Does this change anything from your perspective? What do you think? And we talked about some advice to her last Sunday, heading into today. Fine, fabulous, we&#39;re fucked.</span>

And so mission accomplished. I do think there were probably some optimizations that were available. The way that she brushed off the comments, you know, and said, like, this is a national security matter, seemed fine, at least in the clips that I saw, could have maybe been stronger and said, and been taken more of that approach of being like, I would love to answer and there&#39;s other avenues in which I can answer. Maybe she did that in some of the answers. I didn&#39;t watch the full footage, so I&#39;m just going to fully confess on that. that i do wonder if she hasn&#39;t set a couple of small traps for the liberals down the road her comment that the prime minister reads everything that is put in front of them right</span>

Only about 1% of their budget, I believe, comes directly from government. There&#39;s some indirect money that comes in there, too. but it if they are state funded basically every outlet in canada is state funded because of the way that we support media in this country everything from post media to cbc so i don&#39;t think that they were wrong and it&#39;s nice when you can take a principled stance and you&#39;re not wrong um maybe the start of something maybe not i don&#39;t know if there&#39;s other shoes to drop i certainly I certainly could imagine other outlets being</span>

            <span class="text">Final question for you, Carter. I&#39;m going to start with you. The federal government is offering to buy the street in front of Parliament Hill that&#39;s been closed since the Freedom Convoy. The feds want to see this street in front of Parliament Hill that&#39;s closed in a letter to the mayor. procurement minister says the government wants to reimagine the parliamentary precinct and keep the Wellington Street closed to traffic. Are you in or out for the feds being like, fuck it, we&#39;ll just buy this land that&#39;s now been closed. We&#39;ll just buy this street. We&#39;ll make this our own, maybe to avoid another freedom convoy, maybe to kind of make things move forward. Strong opinions on this, Stephen Carter, in or out? I&#39;m</span>

We&#39;ve walked up and down Pennsylvania Avenue looking at the White House. It&#39;s kind of nice that we&#39;re not going to get hit by a car, uh, while we&#39;re doing that. And, uh, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, I think that number of tour groups alone, they go up and down that space. I think it justifies having, uh, you know, a pedestrian friendly area. I think that the re-imagining of that space would be, uh, really fantastic. Let&#39;s go for it. Car-free zone. I&#39;m in.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I think generally I&#39;m in for the same reason Stephen&#39;s in, in that I generally like it when they close streets and turn them back to pedestrian areas, especially in the inner cities, which allow, you know, more mixed use than we currently see. And Wellington was always a bit annoying to me in that, you know, it had trucks parked with signs, you know, people trying to make their point on Parliament Hill in ways that were really quite in your</span>

            <span class="text">people overestimate the traffic chaos it will create. And obviously, it&#39;s been closed for so long, people have already adjusted. So I think I&#39;m in. Generally speaking, it&#39;s not because it&#39;s a reaction to the convoy. It&#39;s just I think it&#39;s good to close streets like that. But</span>
