        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dig into the Conservatives' pipeline motion, the Liberal response, and why Ottawa is spending its time debating make-believe infrastructure. What's the real strategy behind a motion about a pipeline that doesn't exist? How should the Liberals handle a fight built entirely on hypotheticals? And is Manitoba ready for the unique brand of chaos that follows Carter everywhere? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

And, you know, any day that you are united and your opponent is in disarray is a good day. Those are the best issues. And it allows Pierre for the maybe the first time since the election to punch back on an economic issue and get out of the culture wars that he&#39;s been kind of stuck in. So it&#39;s great for all those those reasons. And when the liberals all vote against it, he can send out his fundraising emails saying, see, the pipeline wasn&#39;t real. They&#39;re just faking it, which is, you know, a silly message, but fine for the base.</div>
