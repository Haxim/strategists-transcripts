        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk Brian Jean's by-election win, the effect on Jason Kenney's leadership review and police oversight before turning to the federla Conservative Party candidate's launch websites and what they tell us about brand, tactics and more. Can we expect logistical chaos in Red Deer on April 9? Does Canada have a policing problem? And is there a better medium to discuss websites than a podcast? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

I want to do this in quasi-rapid-fire format. It&#39;s not going to be like the lightning round, but I&#39;ll try to get through this quickly. So I&#39;m going to throw a couple things at you. I want to get your hot takes. We&#39;ll go back and forth. I&#39;ll call time. We&#39;ll move on. It&#39;ll be like that show, Corey, you always wanted to invent for television. vision part of the interruption for politics we&#39;re going to try it here uh first thing steven carter brian jean he&#39;s now in 63 of the vote in fort mcmurray uh his first message when getting interviewed effectively and i&#39;m going to paraphrase here fuck you jason kenny steven carter thoughts about brian jean his win now inside the ucp when brian jean is back yeah</div>

          <div class="said">yeah i mean if he&#39;d been kicked out of the caucus that would have been spectacular um you know but i mean the the premier you know Premier Kenny has had people disrespecting him from inside his caucus almost from day one. I mean, it took two and a half years to get rid of Drew Barnes. So if it takes two and a half years to get rid of Brian Jeaton, well, I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a new leader.

          <div class="said">Corey, anything surprising in his victory, either the percentage of how big he won by, how quickly he has not even pivoted, but how aggressively he&#39;s talking about Jason Kenny. And then, of course, he&#39;s on every media outlet today trying to sell UCP memberships. I think anyone who had a radio program or a TV program, he was there trying to slog more UCP memberships.

          <div class="said">Yeah, I don&#39;t think anything about it is remotely shocking. And I think the reaction to it as a result is surprising to me. People are really updating their priors an awful lot for the most predictable event in the world. Brian Jean won in Fort McMurray with a big majority. Stop the fucking presses. But, you know, the reality is it is now spitting out this narrative that is unhelpful to Jason Kenney. Hilarious, because again, of course, this was going to happen. Predictable, yes. The predictability of it also brings me back to what in the world was Jason Kenney thinking letting him run in the first place?</div>

          <div class="said">right? You need things to go viral in order to pull people into your little adventures. And so when we&#39;re looking at something that&#39;s relatively small, and it&#39;s very easy for us to organize something that&#39;s relatively small, as it grows a little bit bigger, it&#39;s the equivalent of saying, well, we&#39;ll have a little house party. We&#39;ll call over a couple of friends. It&#39;s just going to be a dinner party. And then, you know what? Let&#39;s make it a real party. We&#39;ll invite everybody over for the Super Bowl. And then there&#39;s the, oh, my God, everybody from my high school crashed my party party. And that is out of your control. It&#39;s gone viral. And I think that this is where we are with this leadership where, you know, and the experience I have with this is watching Alison Redford, Ed Stelmack, when they&#39;re 78 percent, you know, their approvals. that was organized, that was coordinated. Even Brian Mulroney, when he organized and coordinated against Joe Clark, only got 34% of the vote, right? So organizing and pushing and coordinating these numbers feels to me like it&#39;s beyond organizers&#39;</div>

And I know even with Alison Redford, when she got 78 percent, people were saying that it was fixed by the party because it was the same numbers as Ed Stelmack, like they wouldn&#39;t fix it, like 82. Like, are you crazy? Like, yeah, we&#39;re going to fix it to the exact same fucking numbers, Ed Stelmack. Don&#39;t think stupid thoughts. Try and think smart thoughts. And, you know, so it&#39;s hard for people, Zane, you have to help them. So I think that this, if it&#39;s close, yeah, there could be some people who were on the other side of the voting that aren&#39;t going to be able to vote because of logistics.

Actually, we&#39;ve had a pretty good turn here, and we&#39;ve seen some polling that that shows that a majority, well, not like on the intensity side, but an overall majority of conservatives support Jason Kenney.

And that was the side that was fed up with people who had been holding these protests for a year. And these people who had been protesting for a year were doing it with total disregard to the community. And why is it that the counter protesters are the ones that the police decided to move back rather than the protesters? protesters and um and as steven said it seemed fairly aggressive it seemed aggressive not just in action but in in kind of the way the police carried themselves and so if</div>

          <div class="said">Well, let&#39;s begin by reminding our listeners is that we have a governance problem when it comes to police forces. We saw it in Ottawa with the Ottawa Police Board. We&#39;re seeing it now here in Calgary with the Calgary Police Commission. The commission is the group that is in charge. They are the only ones who can hire or fire a police chief. They can&#39;t dictate anything. So when the letter that was sent from city council was written to the police commission, they don&#39;t have the authority to dictate anything um they they simply send a request that basically says please ask your officers if they&#39;d be so kind as to enforce the law equitably um you know because when when police services choose which laws they&#39;re going to enforce and which laws they&#39;re not going to enforce they remove themselves as law enforcement and they become essentially the entire legal system right the legal system is set up so that you have law enforcement and then you have the judicial system and then if required you have the punishment system which is our jail system and things like that but these are supposed to be separate so far you know like but the the police when they are judge and jury and</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">and that&#39;s what they&#39;re being when you choose to enforce laws and you choose you know you are choosing to allow some people to get away with certain things and that if it happens that the people that you are allowing to get away with certain things happen to be white, happen to agree with your point of view. That&#39;s a real problem, right? Because if this was happening with a different group of protesters, and this is the point of the Black Lives Matter group, we just saw Black Lives Matter protests. The police chose to act differently. The police are choosing to act differently now. And they say it&#39;s because they don&#39;t, you know, they don&#39;t feel empowered to enforce and whatever. I think that that has been eroded by their actual behavior. Their</div>

I don&#39;t want the police to ticket everybody who jaywalks, everybody who, you know, is a drug user, send them to jail. I think that would be wrong and it would also be an abuse. And I also think the police need to know when not to exacerbate a situation. But that&#39;s not really what we&#39;re talking about. Corey,</div>

          <div class="said">ultimately we need to change the police act um the police act is written in such a fashion that there is very very little accountability. A large number of our acts were written years ago when we were smaller centers where people, you know, you could ask for volunteers to oversee the police service. Well, the police service is now a $400 million organization in Calgary, about the same in Edmonton. These two police services have, you know, have been trapped in their own performance as well. And you actually need to get better as a police service. We are looking at a time when citizens are demanding more and better out of our police service. And our police officers, frankly, are confused about what they&#39;re supposed to be doing and some strong leadership from police commissions or from elected officials. I&#39;d be fine seeing a police commission model in Alberta murder that was 50% elected and 50% paid community members who are overseeing these important functions that, frankly, when they go wrong, have the chance of people being killed. We had another person killed in Edmonton just this week. This is life and death. And the acts that govern these police services are simply inadequate.</div>

I want to spend some time using our strategy and marketing lens to analyze the launches and the initial collateral and tactics of the three main competitors, I would say, in the conservative leadership race, one Pierre Pallieva, one Jean Charest, one Patrick Brown. I want to talk about their slogans. I want to talk a bit about their websites, their conversion. We&#39;ll talk about what that means, tactics, their branding. and I want you to start by giving me a grade for each of the folks as we go through them. So Carter, as I always say, the only way to start is to start. Stephen Carter, Patrick Brown. Let me lay out some of the Patrick Brown materials here. It&#39;s not Patrick Brown on the website. It&#39;s Mayor Brown. It&#39;s not PatrickBrown.ca. If you were to go onto your website right now or onto your web browser right now and try to find PatrickBrown.ca, I don&#39;t know where it would lead. It might forward you to this but this is the main url fighter leader winner.ca i want to talk about that choice and then i want to talk about the strategic choice on after a day of launching to a room that was quite sizable arguably the largest launch size of any of the three competitors uh picking a fight directly with pierre pollier on the nikab band steven carter those are the early days of the patrick brown campaign what grade are you giving it and then let&#39;s dive into a few of these elemental items that put on the table um</div>

That&#39;s just too wordy, and then you don&#39;t have any room for a slogan. But if you can turn that last one into going to bring neutrality back.ca, you almost get to use your slogan without cluttering up your sign further. A little different in a leadership campaign, though, right? Because you don&#39;t think of leadership campaigns as things where you have lawn signs or where you have to worry about that economy of space so much. and in fact most of your advertising that would lead to the website i suspect is already on web and it&#39;s just one click away but</div>

Pledge Your Support is the headline, it&#39;s like the first, it&#39;s a pop-up. It&#39;s the first conversion ask. And then when you go to buy a membership, what I find interesting about his website is rather than, unlike the Sharae website, which we&#39;ll get to in a second, it doesn&#39;t port you out to the conservative portal. It actually has its own little form that you fill out internally on fighterleaderwitter.ca before it takes you to buy a membership. Talk to me about the strategy of pledging support as like a top line conversion prior to even membership, which we know this thing is about selling a shit ton of memberships in a narrow window, is pledge your support the right headline, the right initial ask for someone that lands on your webpage? Give me your sense of that in like the modern campaigning. Is this what you would suggest to a candidate if they were one of yours in this conservative leadership race?

I will concede that it is a rapidly evolving space, and the tactics that worked in one year do not necessarily work in another. So it&#39;s important to be led by the testing. If they are smart, they&#39;ve been A, B testing a bunch of different varieties. But I feel very differently about it. I don&#39;t like it. I think it&#39;s a bad start for the funnel.

You can click on pledge a donation, not donate. This is not donate. This is pledging a donation. And when you go to pledge amount, you can actually, in fact, go up and down and enter a minus number to pledge a donation to jean chere uh that is this website you can negative pledge money to jean chere i suggest if you are not a jean chere fan that you go to jean chere.ca you pledge a donation and you pledge a negative donation to jean chere you know why because he wants you to and he allows you to cory i&#39;ll let you i&#39;ll let you take it from what you&#39;re about to say but i just noticed that right now as you were speaking well</div>

Stephen Carter, Peer Poly Evra. You can go for, I think you can. I&#39;m going to check it while we record. This is the type of rough shot operation we have here, folks. Peer 4PM with the number 4.ca is a website. However, you don&#39;t see it anywhere. You know what you do see on his social media everywhere? It&#39;s a Linktree account to Peer Poly Evra. So So it&#39;s link.linktr.ee slash pier4pm. And on there, what&#39;s fascinating is it&#39;s a bunch of Google Doc forms. Sign up in English, right? A petition to end mandates, a petition to scrap the carbon tax, a petition to do all of that in French. Very little about buying a membership. Very little direct conversion about, you know, donating. fascinating this all seems to be aggressive unabashed naked data mining and i&#39;m super super fascinated and curious to get your take on this because out of the three you&#39;ve got patrick brown who&#39;s probably the most conventional right he sets up a nice looking site his launch videos there he&#39;s got his text he&#39;s got his pledge buttons that&#39;s serviceable jean charre you&#39;re like this is a little bit stuck in the past dude your main conversion is to the conservative party website And then Pierre taking this tactic to not necessarily have a website, and if he does, not necessarily promoting it, but promoting micro issues, small petitions, signups, momentary issues, not really pushing the membership. Curious, Carter, your take on this from a practitioner&#39;s perspective. Give me your lens on what you see from Pierre-Paul Rievre in his digital knife fight. I</div>

The guy&#39;s social media accounts are enormous. He&#39;s got 500,000 followers on Facebook. God only knows how many on Instagram. He&#39;s got followers all over the Western world who think he&#39;s the next coming of I don&#39;t know what, Alex P. Keaton, I guess. And he doesn&#39;t care about his website. His website serves a purely functional purpose, which is kick him to a petition from my social media. Kick him to the donation page from my social media. That&#39;s how he&#39;s going to win this thing. That&#39;s how he&#39;s going to build the connections he&#39;s going to make. That might also be true of the other candidates. but like who gives a fuck about a website in 2022 it is kind of an anchor for content end of story uh we put time into it we want to put a veneer on it but how many people do you think are actually going there as their first engagement with him when we talk about funnels the website itself is further down the funnel which actually now as we&#39;ve talked this out makes me think maybe their data does show that pledging your supports there because who actually seeks out a website besides somebody who&#39;s already a little bit committed That&#39;s not where you go looking for information these days.

          <div class="said">Carter, I want to talk about Jean Charest. You know, his campaign, slow out of the gates, in a sense, website, digital, etc. People are like, oh, is this campaign from bygone era? And then lo and behold, kind of seems a bit to be a campaign from a bygone era. In that sense, though, agree or disagree with the following statement I&#39;ll put in front of you, that his social media silence shouldn&#39;t be mistaken as him not being able to organize, that those are two different things, that there might actually be an upside that he&#39;s not entering the fray, keeping above it, maybe not spending too much time or resources on digital brand when he knows that the only fucking thing that might matter is selling a shit ton of memberships every day? Is there a case to be made there? Or are these two things so tied to the hip these days, that you succeeding on the air war is tied to how good you do on the ground game of selling memberships and their leadership? I guess the question is fundamentally, is Sharae just saying, I&#39;m going to put my fucking resources in what&#39;s important. I&#39;m known as an organizer. I&#39;m just is going to go fucking do that is there a case we made with that or is the early air war lack of charrette in the media perhaps a little bit of a lumpy start to begin with giving you pause in terms of what the firepower of this campaign could be he</div>

Twitter, Facebook, whatever, fuck it, website, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m just going to do the work. Carter, you disagree.

Any of these tactics can be fine if they meet your strategy. But the point is, there is a little bit more sophistication, both on behalf of campaigns and on the voters to say, like,</div>
