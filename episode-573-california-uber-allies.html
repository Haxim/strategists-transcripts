            <span class="text">you go right now? I think Bernie has always been a man who&#39;s felt dueling pressures, right? He has placed clearly a premium on integrity in his political life, right? He&#39;s taken unpopular positions. He stood up. He said, no, that&#39;s wrong. No, I will not be a Democrat because I think that fundamentally, and these are his words, I&#39;m paraphrasing now, both parties are corrupt. Both parties have too much big money in it. The only way that I can be a virtuous civil servant is to stay away from all of that. But the other Bernie Sanders is the one who&#39;s like, man, I&#39;ve got to throw my lot in with the Democrats or the Republicans. The Republicans are nuts, right? Easy choice. So he caucuses with them. People forget he actually chaired a committee in the Senate when the Democrats controlled the Senate because he was sort of given seniority in the same vein that the Democrats would give one of their own party members because of his history of caucusing with them and his commitment to democratic ideals. So it&#39;s not like he has no connection to these guys, but I&#39;m sure he always struck them as obnoxiously righteous. Oh,</span>

Do you want to go into a random range? You cannot mask just like a total subversion of democratic will as technocracy. and that&#39;s exactly what uber is trying to do the reason why you get into a cab and it always costs the same per hundred meters you go is because cab companies used to screw people around and civic governments came in and said no that is a fundamental right transportation it&#39;s why we have public transportation systems it&#39;s why we have public walkways it&#39;s why we have cycle tracks it&#39;s because getting around is required by everybody regardless of how much or how little money you make okay step one step two the reason we put these protections in and have all these verifications that you&#39;re going to have drivers who get your class four license in alberta or whatnot is not because they taxi companies came to us and said hey we&#39;d like to do this that seems like a good idea once again it&#39;s because governments of the people by the people have had to step in and say you are abusing an open system we need to put regulations in to protect consumers so when you come in and you say we don&#39;t need any of that stuff because we&#39;ve got an app Fuck you, okay? Go through the system. You want the laws changed? Go to your councils, get them changed. Do not start operating illegally and saying, this is fine, this is progress. That is bullshit. That is utter bullshit. And I think it&#39;s time that somebody stood up to him. And that&#39;s why I have a hard time being that mad with the guy. Because they are dicks.

And yet when the leader itself is doing something that&#39;s a party function, their reaction is, why is the party paying for that? They should only get their premier salary. That to me almost doesn&#39;t make sense from like an intellectual integrity standpoint. Let me ask you like a really real question here. Like what fundamentally are they worried about in that case? Do you think that the NDP in B.C. are trying to protect the donors to the B.C. liberals? No. Do they think that the B.C. liberals are somehow going to hold an outsized sway on the premier because</span>

Right, right. It would move you down to like $45,000, $55,000 from where you&#39;re doing. and and and i i think we have to ask ourselves why we&#39;re not willing to go that far but we think we&#39;ve totally nailed it at the level we&#39;re at right now right</span>
