          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the "South Conference Conference" (?!), Supreme Court of Canada and the Stephen Carter Clause. What does the carbon tax decision mean for federal politics in Canada? What do the "Resistance" Premiers do now? And can Stephen Carter's entire personality be captured in three tweets? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Then they will vote out this government for another government that&#39;s offering them something that looks a little bit more rosy. And there is a natural inclination, and I think it&#39;s wrongheaded, but nonetheless, there&#39;s a natural inclination that if you&#39;re looking for an economic savior, you move towards the conservatives. The people anticipate that the Conservatives are better at managing the economy. This is the future that Justin Trudeau is afraid of. And I think that that&#39;s what the budget needs to address. I mean, those numbers aren&#39;t necessarily new, Zane. I mean, Canadians have been afraid for their economic future for a very long time. And what&#39;s</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, you know, these numbers often in the stimulus-injected pandemic world we&#39;ve been in, some of these numbers get clouded or perhaps put on the back burner. But these are pretty grim. One in three Canadians say they&#39;re worse off now than they were 12 months ago, which is half as many as say that they&#39;re better off. And only 38% of Canadians are confident that they&#39;ll live as well as their parents&#39; generation. This is the backdrop, so to speak, that the Trudeau government has to deal with heading into this budget. Corey, same broad question for you. What are the stakes here? And maybe I&#39;ll kind of expand it a bit. How does the Trudeau government perhaps reconcile a budget that meets Canadians where they are with some of the concerns that they&#39;ve expressed here?</div>

It hasn&#39;t been fixed in five years or 10 years. These aren&#39;t these are kind of more perennial issues. And oftentimes what the game is, is to take the the voters&#39; eyes off of that particular uncertainty and go to a different question. But in this particular case, keep in mind that he&#39;s 30 months away from needing to call an election. He&#39;s not even at his halfway point yet in this particular government. What he&#39;s doing is buying himself another four years or trying to buy himself another four years and escalate to a majority, a more stable majority government. But one would argue this is a stable minority government. If he wants to go for two more years, I think he&#39;s got the two more years. It doesn&#39;t need to be, he&#39;s got to call it in the spring. He&#39;s got to call it in the fall. He&#39;s got to call it in 2022. He doesn&#39;t have to call it until October. Well, I guess it gets called in September of 2023. Like that is, and even then, you know, he can rewrite the act that forces him to call it then and call it in October of 2024. This is, he&#39;s got time. And I would just simply, and I&#39;m not saying this is the right choice, but what I don&#39;t think he should be doing is locking himself into, I have only two windows to call this election, spring 2021 or fall 2021.

In a decision that is marked as an important victory for Justin Trudeau, the climate change agenda, Supreme Court ruled that that the federal government&#39;s imposition of carbon taxes in provinces that oppose them was indeed constitutional. Citing Parliament&#39;s power to legislate on matters related to peace, order, and good government, the court said that fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions was a matter of national concern. Quote, this matter is critical to our response to an existential threat to human life in Canada and around the world, the court wrote in a 6-3 decision, also adding that climate change is real. It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, and it poses a grave threat to humanity&#39;s future, close quote. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you.

The Conservatives have gone to what would be the traditional left-wing solution, which is regulations and making sure that you are doing whatever you can to just make the pain be felt by specific people and not by everybody, you know, not share that burden, not create that market mechanism to do it. Basically choosing how you are going to reduce your carbon rather than letting the market dictate how carbon is going to be reduced. I find that fascinating.

Some of the analysis that&#39;s come out of this, Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on this, is that this is actually good news for O&#39;Toole, the Supreme Court decision, that it now kind of legally mandates something like this be resolved so he doesn&#39;t actually necessarily have to have that fight with this party, so to speak.

The problem with telling everybody that a carbon tax is horrible and only a villain would bring it in is that now you&#39;re stuck having to come up with something else. Corey&#39;s alluded to, I&#39;ve talked about a couple of different things that could happen, but he needs to tell us at some point what that could happen is actually going to be.

But the talking points in the right-wing sphere have become pretty settled, right? This was a bad decision. So I don&#39;t see how it releases Aaron O&#39;Toole from the group that believe this is a bad decision. I just I don&#39;t see that whatsoever.

I don&#39;t believe for a minute they have not thought about what would happen if this court case got lost. That, to me, is unfathomable. But I&#39;m sure they were hoping they would win. And I&#39;m sure that they told the public service don&#39;t start prepping a lot of contingency plans because we don&#39;t want to get foips that we have a contingency plan. So, you know, the actual reality behind the scenes is likely a little bit different than we&#39;ve never thought about it. It&#39;s probably been more along the lines of we don&#39;t want to get the political hit of looking like we thought we have already lost this. That would also not be ideal. So we&#39;ll just cross that bridge when we get to it. The reality is all of these things are going to take several months after a court decision. anyhow it&#39;s not as though it would even be particularly wise to just own the carbon tax the very next day it might even make sense to say well we&#39;ll see what happens in the next federal election if nothing happens then alberta is going to have to make a change maybe</div>

Advice that might apply across the board as if you&#39;re a Ford or a Pallister or a Moe or a Kenny, what advice would you have for them as they kind of make their moves to either A, adopt this federal plan, which seems like most of them will not be doing, or B, as they decide on their tool and their system going forward with the politics or the even policy around it, would love to get your top line advice to them. And if you have specific advice for any specific one, feel free great to tease that out, but I almost wanted to kind of get your strategist&#39;s advice for now kind of reconciling a court ruling, so to speak.

This is why I&#39;m fascinated by Kenny signaling that he likes what Trudeau&#39;s done. It is fascinating to me that he could have even the 10% of the the revenue that it&#39;s collected. Keep in mind, you got to be collecting a shit ton of carbon revenues out of the oil sands and out of carbon intensive industry in Alberta, and you&#39;re giving back 90% of that to the population of Alberta. That would fundamentally change, and I don&#39;t have the numbers in front of me, obviously, but I believe that that would fundamentally change the math for the rest of Canada. Every Albertan could be getting a larger carbon tax rebate than the rest of the country because we emit so much carbon tax. It would be fascinating to see if we could create a similar system here that would actually result in more significant rebate to the Alberta population.</div>
