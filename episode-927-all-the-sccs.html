Carter, who was such a great chief of staff, never actually managed to understand the rules of the legislature, may not know this. But private member bill time and private member motions are totally independent time allocations. So getting through rodeo faster wouldn&#39;t have changed a thing. It would have just led to another PMB being discussed, I believe. Somebody can correct me if I&#39;m wrong. But, like, fundamentally, I think that this is one of those things that sounds really good, but, you know, it&#39;s a little more complicated in real life.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, let me start here. And I want to spend a bit of time on this as related to the April 19th budget that the Trudeau government will introduce. We now have a date. It is April 19th. It&#39;s going to be the first budget in over two years. Let&#39;s start with the question around how high are the stakes here for the Trudeau government on this particular budget?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">mean personally I would I would be if I was in Trudeau&#39;s PMO I&#39;d be taking the idea of a 2021 election off the table I said from the beginning that they can govern as though they have a majority so why not pretend as though they have a majority what is at stake the entire government if people feel like they are not being taken care of if they feel that their work their their future is getting worse their economic future Their opportunities are disappearing. Then they will vote out this government for another government that&#39;s offering them something that looks a little bit more rosy. And there is a natural inclination, and I think it&#39;s wrongheaded, but nonetheless, there&#39;s a natural inclination that if you&#39;re looking for an economic savior, you move towards the conservatives. The people anticipate that the Conservatives are better at managing the economy. This is the future that Justin Trudeau is afraid of. And I think that that&#39;s what the budget needs to address. I mean, those numbers aren&#39;t necessarily new, Zane. I mean, Canadians have been afraid for their economic future for a very long time. And what&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">what&#39;s new is, of course, that there&#39;s new groups of people who are finding themselves in there. You know, the fairly well-off in Alberta are finding themselves quite scared of what the changes are that are happening. Lots of shifting around in British Columbia, housing crisis in both the lower mainland and in the Toronto region. People are scared for how their kids are going to stay where they are, how life will continue moving forward. Those fears are the fears that take down governments. And, you</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, you know, these numbers often in the stimulus-injected pandemic world we&#39;ve been in, some of these numbers get clouded or perhaps put on the back burner. But these are pretty grim. One in three Canadians say they&#39;re worse off now than they were 12 months ago, which is half as many as say that they&#39;re better off. And only 38% of Canadians are confident that they&#39;ll live as well as their parents&#39; generation. This is the backdrop, so to speak, that the Trudeau government has to deal with heading into this budget. Corey, same broad question for you. What are the stakes here? And maybe I&#39;ll kind of expand it a bit. How does the Trudeau government perhaps reconcile a budget that meets Canadians where they are with some of the concerns that they&#39;ve expressed here?</span>

Election Now is their best strategy because it allows them to drop a budget, talk about some solutions to this that are still conceptual. They won&#39;t be able to resolve these things immediately, but at least they&#39;ll be able to give some hope for the future. They can start to sell some of that hope. And they can play a bit on the pandemic response moving through, particularly if we all get needles in our arms come June. June. This is probably the best of a couple of bad situations right now.

It hasn&#39;t been fixed in five years or 10 years. These aren&#39;t these are kind of more perennial issues. And oftentimes what the game is, is to take the the voters&#39; eyes off of that particular uncertainty and go to a different question. But in this particular case, keep in mind that he&#39;s 30 months away from needing to call an election. He&#39;s not even at his halfway point yet in this particular government. What he&#39;s doing is buying himself another four years or trying to buy himself another four years and escalate to a majority, a more stable majority government. But one would argue this is a stable minority government. If he wants to go for two more years, I think he&#39;s got the two more years. It doesn&#39;t need to be, he&#39;s got to call it in the spring. He&#39;s got to call it in the fall. He&#39;s got to call it in 2022. He doesn&#39;t have to call it until October. Well, I guess it gets called in September of 2023. Like that is, and even then, you know, he can rewrite the act that forces him to call it then and call it in October of 2024. This is, he&#39;s got time. And I would just simply, and I&#39;m not saying this is the right choice, but what I don&#39;t think he should be doing is locking himself into, I have only two windows to call this election, spring 2021 or fall 2021. He has multiple options, multiple different choices.</span>

In a decision that is marked as an important victory for Justin Trudeau, the climate change agenda, Supreme Court ruled that that the federal government&#39;s imposition of carbon taxes in provinces that oppose them was indeed constitutional. Citing Parliament&#39;s power to legislate on matters related to peace, order, and good government, the court said that fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions was a matter of national concern. Quote, this matter is critical to our response to an existential threat to human life in Canada and around the world, the court wrote in a 6-3 decision, also adding that climate change is real. It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activities, and it poses a grave threat to humanity&#39;s future, close quote. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you. Top line thoughts when we saw this earlier, I guess, this past week, when the Supreme Court decision came out.

And I mean that both in the federal government sense, minimally, but largely, I mean that for all of these provinces that have been holdouts and stomping their feet about it. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;re going to get into it. But some of the some of the premiers took different paths, some had contingency plans, some did not. But the fundamental point here is, all right, we now know the framework under which we&#39;re working.</span>

But the provinces, if they have their own plans, you have to imagine it will better reflect the needs of the province. So here in Alberta, for example, the old plan that was done by the Alberta NDP government gave money back to Canadians, much like the federal one does, but really much more focused on your income level. So it was lower income, middle income Albertans who got money back. and the money that would have otherwise gone to wealthier albertans went into a number of green funds that were helped to try to green the economy i think something like that makes sense in the alberta context because we&#39;ve got quite</span>

You know, this has been advertised, everything from a sigh of relief for Trudeau to a political windfall and massive victory. Quantify the degree of victory for me, for Trudeau on this. Is this like one of those defensive victories being like, oh, we&#39;re proven right. Thank God we can move on. Or is Is this a type of victory that you can press on and leverage and kind of make a hallmark of your party, your government, and your leadership? Where do you kind of quantify it? And I know that&#39;s a weird spectrum I&#39;ve given you, but where do you kind of quantify it on the type of victory this is? I</span>

I don&#39;t know that it fundamentally changes what the Trudeau government is going to do. I mean, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind these carbon prices projected out now to 2030, that&#39;s already been announced. That&#39;s fairly significant. That&#39;s there.

            <span class="text">federal programs that could do this. But I think the court was pretty clear that the national concern doctrine lives. You&#39;re going to have to prove that this is a thing. And part of the Supreme Court saying how profound the issue of climate change is was not just the statement of a bunch of justices. It was them saying, okay,</span>

You can do something in peace, order, and good government. Something less than that, well, we&#39;re going to have a different conversation with the court. So, you know, they didn&#39;t get like carte blanche to do whatever they want with the federal government. However, I will say if this had gone against them, oh my God, this would have been a disaster for them. I don&#39;t even know what they would have done because it would have taken one of these marquee programs right out. It would have totally thrown up the entire conversation as to what the federal government was able to do in climate change. And even where the conservatives right now are looking a little bit wrong-footed with Aaron O&#39;Toole on the defensive about his party and its statement on climate change in action,</span>

Well, guess what? This is a 90th percentile revenue-neutral carbon tax.

As we had under the new Democratic government, the conservative government, the United Conservative Government, can choose to make this a made-in-Alberta solution.

The Conservatives have gone to what would be the traditional left-wing solution, which is regulations and making sure that you are doing whatever you can to just make the pain be felt by specific people and not by everybody, you know, not share that burden, not create that market mechanism to do it. Basically choosing how you are going to reduce your carbon rather than letting the market dictate how carbon is going to be reduced. I find that fascinating.

But what are you going to do? you know what which tools are you going to use to put in place to reduce carbon output at the same time as keep everybody whole i don&#39;t know of any he doesn&#39;t know of any if he was putting forward an example that said we&#39;re going to move away from a a carbon tax into a cap and trade system oh okay i can get my head around that let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about that is that better for producers or is that worse for producers um i i know that some of the people look in alberta would have thought that the cap and trade system was exactly where they wanted to go. Because again, the free market system is what they would prefer. You know, these are these are open discussions, but he&#39;s not having the open discussion. Instead, he&#39;s having this bullshit, I&#39;m going to take care of, of the low income earner. If you file your taxes, if you pay tax, if you may not even pay taxes, as long as you file them, you are going to get a rebate back. And that rebate is going to far and far in a way exceed the amount of money that you&#39;re paying on it so you&#39;re taking away a benefit and this is what bothers me about the argument the</span>

Some of the analysis that&#39;s come out of this, Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on this, is that this is actually good news for O&#39;Toole, the Supreme Court decision, that it now kind of legally mandates something like this be resolved so he doesn&#39;t actually necessarily have to have that fight with this party, so to speak.

So I&#39;m not buying that analysis. analysis. The problem with telling everybody that a carbon tax is horrible and only a villain would bring it in is that now you&#39;re stuck having to come up with something else. Corey&#39;s alluded to, I&#39;ve talked about a couple of different things that could happen, but he needs to tell us at some point what that could happen is actually going to be. Because the problem is he could could win Saskatchewan he could win Alberta he can win certain you know the places that he&#39;s currently winning but he can&#39;t form government he</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, what do you think on both of those questions?

It does make me think at some point, somebody is going to argue in a court some way shape or fashion the government is required to act in this sense and they didn&#39;t and the court has already declared this is an existential emergency so ergo government you are you are not filling your required role by being silent on this matter i feel like that&#39;s that&#39;s a path we&#39;re now walking down and so i don&#39;t a hundred percent buy that nothing is mandated but i don&#39;t at all buy that this makes it easier for erin o&#39;toole i</span>

But the talking points in the right-wing sphere have become pretty settled, right? This was a bad decision. So I don&#39;t see how it releases Aaron O&#39;Toole from the group that believe this is a bad decision. I just I don&#39;t see that whatsoever. And I think that&#39;s almost wishful thinking for conservatives who just want him to get out of this box.

            <span class="text">Carter, I saw a lot of head nodding in certain sections, a lot of fist shaking in others. I&#39;ll let you just close us out on the Aaron O&#39;Toole side. And then we&#39;ll jump to the premiers and their flat footedness or lack thereof, depending on who you are and their response. So finish us off on O&#39;Toole. So</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So the question I was interested in is, are you bullish about Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s carbon plan? And I&#39;m just not because there may be many different options available, but no one&#39;s done any work to educate us about what the opportunities are of these different options. So, for example, if you&#39;re going to go into a cap-and-trade system, you know, it already exists in Quebec. Quebec&#39;s part of the California system, I understand. These are good, well-established markets. Someone could be making the rounds right now. And keeping in mind, we don&#39;t have a lot of time if Corey&#39;s prediction about we should be doing an election as soon as possible is correct.

Corey, was that the right message for Kenny to broadly give? And it was interesting. He did, you know, issue some sharp elbows against Justin Trudeau, but said, you know, we&#39;re open to many options as we kind of go forward. What do you kind of, what do you, A, make of the message? I&#39;ll double barrel the question. Why not?

I don&#39;t believe for a minute they have not thought about what would happen if this court case got lost. That, to me, is unfathomable. But I&#39;m sure they were hoping they would win. And I&#39;m sure that they told the public service don&#39;t start prepping a lot of contingency plans because we don&#39;t want to get foips that we have a contingency plan. So, you know, the actual reality behind the scenes is likely a little bit different than we&#39;ve never thought about it. It&#39;s probably been more along the lines of we don&#39;t want to get the political hit of looking like we thought we have already lost this. That would also not be ideal. So we&#39;ll just cross that bridge when we get to it. The reality is all of these things are going to take several months after a court decision. anyhow it&#39;s not as though it would even be particularly wise to just own the carbon tax the very next day it might even make sense to say well we&#39;ll see what happens in the next federal election if nothing happens then alberta is going to have to make a change maybe</span>

Unless Aaron O&#39;Toole wins and it just changes everything and that fundamental math gets shifted around, I would imagine, however, it&#39;s probably more along the lines of what New Brunswick is doing with the gas tax and maybe making it revenue or neutral. neutral. I suspect there will be some sort of angle on it where you can say, see, well, we did whatever we could to try to make it not the carbon tax. But ultimately, as that thing scales up to 2030, there&#39;s no avoiding the fact that it will be an Alberta carbon tax.</span>

I mean, you got to give him that in 2023. He&#39;s not running against Justin Trudeau as much as day to day he runs against Justin Trudeau.

Advice that might apply across the board as if you&#39;re a Ford or a Pallister or a Moe or a Kenny, what advice would you have for them as they kind of make their moves to either A, adopt this federal plan, which seems like most of them will not be doing, or B, as they decide on their tool and their system going forward with the politics or the even policy around it, would love to get your top line advice to them. And if you have specific advice for any specific one, feel free great to tease that out, but I almost wanted to kind of get your strategist&#39;s advice for now kind of reconciling a court ruling, so to speak.

I don&#39;t think any of these premiers, any of the resistance, and frankly, even the people who are really bought into the to uh to climate change issues like quebec and british columbia they did not you know they did not buy into this program because they had their own programs that they were able to point to and say we are already doing this and we can be on track with what you&#39;re doing uh with our local uh programs which are designed for our local population that&#39;s how you win government that&#39;s how you stay in government you design things for the local politicians.</span>

This is why I&#39;m fascinated by Kenny signaling that he likes what Trudeau&#39;s done. It is fascinating to me that he could have even the 10% of the the revenue that it&#39;s collected. Keep in mind, you got to be collecting a shit ton of carbon revenues out of the oil sands and out of carbon intensive industry in Alberta, and you&#39;re giving back 90% of that to the population of Alberta. That would fundamentally change, and I don&#39;t have the numbers in front of me, obviously, but I believe that that would fundamentally change the math for the rest of Canada. Every Albertan could be getting a larger carbon tax rebate than the rest of the country because we emit so much carbon tax. It would be fascinating to see if we could create a similar system here that would actually result in more significant rebate to the Alberta population.</span>

            <span class="text">Underrated. Newfoundland behaves differently in provincial elections. I mean, my favorite was Danny Williams&#39; ABC campaign. You know, it was conservative on conservative violence. And they&#39;re just a different, they&#39;re not related in the same fashions. And they&#39;re very, they&#39;ll vote for whoever the hell they feel like voting for. That&#39;s the beauty of the Newfoundlander folks. I love them. Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s do a live show out there. We should do a live show.</span>

It&#39;s not like in the West where all of these parties have disaffiliated. But I don&#39;t know. I wouldn&#39;t read too, too much into it. It will be tough for the liberals to do better than how they&#39;ve done in Newfoundland over the past couple of elections, I believe. Actually, now I don&#39;t even know how they did in 2019, it occurs to me. But I can&#39;t imagine that it&#39;s going to be what they live or die on.</span>

Now he gets appointed to the Supreme Court and say, hey, you know what? It is. And this is the environment that we&#39;re doing politics now. So here are my solutions. So I&#39;d give it a B+.
