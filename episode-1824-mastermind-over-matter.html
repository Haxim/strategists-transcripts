        <p>Zain returns from a successful trip to Toronto, bringing news of how flat his jokes fell in front of a large audience, and leads the gang through a grab-bag of federal and U.S. topics. Stephen Carter rests on his laurels.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a second Trump assassination attempt, Singh abandoning support for the Liberals' consumer carbon tax, upcoming by-elections and lessons from the U.S. Presidential debate. Is Singh playing with money he can't afford to lose? Was the debate over the minute Harris shook Donald Trump's hand? And what model of Nissan most screams "attempted murderer"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

He backed the Liberal Party, which, to be clear for folks, has the consumer facing price on carbon included within it. We know and we talked about that he&#39;d be trying to add some distance from the Liberals.

I want to meet the voter who says I support the NDP if it were not for their position on the consumer facing carbon tax. I I think it&#39;s a really helpful frame, not just on this question, but every question to ask yourself when you&#39;re a political practitioner to say, you know, is anyone asking this question? And sometimes that nets out a result where you&#39;re like, oh, fuck, that actually this person doesn&#39;t exist.

          <div class="said">But I think that there is actually something really important about what came out of this debate. There&#39;s two really important things that I want to talk about. Let&#39;s just take the simple one first. She managed to do what absolutely nobody has managed to do, which is actually make Donald Trump look like the guy who got his ass kicked, right? She just shoved him around. She made him look like a fool in a way that nobody else has really been able to do. We&#39;ve seen people attempted in the Republican primaries and mostly just look like idiots, right? When you have, for example, Chris Christie go out and start to say, he&#39;s Donald Duck now. That&#39;s my great line. He&#39;s now Donald Duck. Or Marco Rubio in 2015, 2016 saying, I&#39;m going to bring the fight to him and start insulting Donald Trump. It never worked. Never worked. This time worked. Donald Trump looked small. He looked diminished. He looked beaten up. He looked bullied. And I can already hear people say, that&#39;s not bullying. Kind of is, right? She picked on a vulnerability and she was relentless at it and she picked on him and she hit it and she just kind of used her words to get exactly what she wanted out of him until he was just like a mess on the stage. And I think that&#39;s really, really important because it showed an end to the Donald Trump formula. So even if now something were to happen, we know how to beat Donald Trump now. Somebody has done it and I actually think that&#39;s very important and shouldn&#39;t be underestimated. underestimated and it will pay dividends in a lot of ways down the road but the other reason why i think that the w is actually more significant perhaps than people are appreciating is people</div>
