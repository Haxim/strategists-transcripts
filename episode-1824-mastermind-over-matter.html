He&#39;s actually abandoned the movement that he built in 2016 and hasn&#39;t continued as far right as we need to, as extreme as we need to, so to speak. Doesn&#39;t that help him?

He backed the Liberal Party, which, to be clear for folks, has the consumer facing price on carbon included within it. We know and we talked about that he&#39;d be trying to add some distance from the Liberals.

We talk about this, and I get the frame you&#39;re talking about. And I also appreciate the question you asked, right? I want to meet the voter who says I support the NDP if it were not for their position on the consumer facing carbon tax. I I think it&#39;s a really helpful frame, not just on this question, but every question to ask yourself when you&#39;re a political practitioner to say, you know, is anyone asking this question? And sometimes that nets out a result where you&#39;re like, oh, fuck, that actually this person doesn&#39;t exist.

First thing he does is he spends three years sucking up to liberals and propping them up in an environment that hates the carbon tax. It&#39;s not like it came around last Thursday that we suddenly didn&#39;t like the carbon tax. The carbon taxes existed the whole time that Singh has said, you know what? I prop you up, buddy. We got an agreement. Then he fucks off on the agreement. Not only does he fuck off on the agreement, he fucks off on the carbon tax. What does this guy stand for?

It does absolutely nothing to reduce the cost of carbon to the average Canadian. It&#39;s just that instead of paying a carbon tax on everything, now you&#39;re just going to pay carbon tax on everything that is produced that has high carbon levels. So you&#39;re going to pay a ridiculous amount of money for gasoline. You&#39;re going to pay a ridiculous amount of money for your plastics.

He sympathized with Singh. He said, I feel for the NDP and for Jagmeet. This is a hard moment. There are political headwinds. There are a lot of political pressures. I&#39;m certainly feeling it. Everyone should be feeling it. And then he continues to say, I don&#39;t entirely understand the position of the NDP in pulling back from affordability measures and from the fight against climate change. But I can assure everyone that this government my government will continue to step up and fight against climate change we&#39;ll continue to put money back in the pockets of families i&#39;m</span>

He didn&#39;t even meet in the middle. She walked into his space and shook his hand and said, let&#39;s have a good debate tonight and walked back. And from there, she owned the whole fucking room. It didn&#39;t matter where the camera was. It didn&#39;t matter who was talking. She was the center of attention. And so to me, I think that&#39;s more of the lesson of that handshake.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But I think that there is actually something really important about what came out of this debate. There&#39;s two really important things that I want to talk about. Let&#39;s just take the simple one first. She managed to do what absolutely nobody has managed to do, which is actually make Donald Trump look like the guy who got his ass kicked, right? She just shoved him around. She made him look like a fool in a way that nobody else has really been able to do. We&#39;ve seen people attempted in the Republican primaries and mostly just look like idiots, right? When you have, for example, Chris Christie go out and start to say, he&#39;s Donald Duck now. That&#39;s my great line. He&#39;s now Donald Duck. Or Marco Rubio in 2015, 2016 saying, I&#39;m going to bring the fight to him and start insulting Donald Trump. It never worked. Never worked. This time worked. Donald Trump looked small. He looked diminished. He looked beaten up. He looked bullied. And I can already hear people say, that&#39;s not bullying. Kind of is, right? She picked on a vulnerability and she was relentless at it and she picked on him and she hit it and she just kind of used her words to get exactly what she wanted out of him until he was just like a mess on the stage. And I think that&#39;s really, really important because it showed an end to the Donald Trump formula. So even if now something were to happen, we know how to beat Donald Trump now. Somebody has done it and I actually think that&#39;s very important and shouldn&#39;t be underestimated. underestimated and it will pay dividends in a lot of ways down the road but the other reason why i think that the w is actually more significant perhaps than people are appreciating is people</span>

She&#39;s now defined as the woman who kicked Donald Trump&#39;s ass. That&#39;s enough. That&#39;s the definition that she needs. She doesn&#39;t need to be like, here&#39;s my policies.

I truly believed around probably the 30 to 40 minute mark, there was a non-zero chance Donald Trump storms off the stage. He was getting his ass kicked so badly. Right? Like from 20 minutes to 40 minutes, he was in an absolute tailspin. All of his answers were crazy. It was chaotic. It was so- I think that&#39;s where dogs</span>
