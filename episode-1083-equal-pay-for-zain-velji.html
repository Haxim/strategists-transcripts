I think that that&#39;s disappointing, but I think that that&#39;s what you get when you can&#39;t manage your brand, when you can&#39;t protect other brands who are associated with you.</span>

And I also don&#39;t think Nike has a brand image to protect. They&#39;ve got a brand image that they&#39;re trying to grow, and they&#39;ve been very clear about what it is. They&#39;re in the position, and they&#39;ve leaned into this for better or worse, Carter, progressive politics and progressive representation is what they want. And hockey is too fucking white, man. And hockey is too fucking problematic. problematic and you add those two things together alongside the fact that the market share of hockey as a sport has been lagging behind soccer, has been lagging behind basketball, has been lagging behind the areas that Nike wants to play in.

            <span class="text">This is where opportunity meets strategy. They had an opportunity to pause. I bet they were celebrating that day. They had the opportunity to pause. And then when they reassessed, it was not just on the sexual harassment and the ongoing issues shoes with Hockey Canada. It was, does hockey align to us? And frankly, hockey is actually part of the backward slide we&#39;ve seen in society. Fuck Gary Bettman and his bullshit a couple months ago with trying to ensure that no NHL team can have pride or military appreciation nights prior to hockey sliding backwards to where Nike wants to be. So for better or worse, Nike&#39;s evolved as a company from the Michael Jordan company of the 1990s, where he said Republicans also buy shoes to now leaning into the Colin Kaepernick and to selling to a more Democrat, more blue, more financially affluent crowd. And they know that&#39;s where growth will come from. Will that ultimately be their downfall potentially, where others kind of bastardize their woke or progressive politics? Possibly. But as it relates to the opportunity that they have and the brand strategy and the alignment that they have, I think it&#39;s exactly where they want to be. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfortunate at all, because I think it&#39;s a sign that hockey has has not done what it needs to do in this country so there</span>

See what I did there? I don&#39;t take issue with any of that. But there are athletes behind all these decisions. There are young children who want to play sports. And the vast majority of people who are engaged in things that Hockey Canada does are four-year-olds to 12-year-olds that are playing hockey before you even get to the stage where you have to make a team. And I feel sorry for those kids who don&#39;t have additional resources because the big kids at Hockey Canada couldn&#39;t figure out how to protect the brand.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">think it depends right like if you&#39;re hawk if you&#39;re nike for example you&#39;ve already laid out a very clear business and frankly brand strategy right and and hockey canada and frankly the sport of hockey was probably not fitting that for a while which is where my point of opportunity and strategy colliding comes into place with your bauer hockey you are literally fucking bauer hockey right so So you&#39;re going back to hockey unless there is a a new sort of, you know, creation of a new national organization. As there was a rumor about that at the time that Hockey Canada is too toxic. We need Canada hockey. We need something else that replaces it. You know, they would have gone there. So for them to come back, you know, yes, it&#39;s going to hurt a bit. But honestly, what other choice do they have? It&#39;s about hockey at the end of the day. That&#39;s where they&#39;re at. And Hockey Canada still holds the most amount of juice as it relates to Carter&#39;s earlier point about athlete-partner sort of collaboration, co-creation, and win-win situations. If you&#39;re Esso, you&#39;re looking at, and if you&#39;re TELUS or if you&#39;re some of Tim Hortons to your earlier point, these are Canadian brands. They&#39;re not necessarily playing outside of the Canadian sphere. So the brand sort of alignment for them is very much based on the audiences that they care for, right? We always talk about the audience that matters to you, right? And in this case, the audience is deeply domestic, deeply well-moneyed, and it&#39;s about alignment with Canada&#39;s national sports. So for them, it&#39;s a very different consideration than Nike, which is a global behemoth. So I suspect many of them, if not all of them, will go back. You could see something like Telus, which is actually putting a lot of its sort of chips in different categories across the board in different areas. You could see them easily pull back because of the maybe slightly indirect relationship. But I suspect hockey, which is very much considered to be aligned with Telus, which is, I&#39;m sorry, Tim Hortons, which is very much aligned with hockey, as well as ESO, a partner aligned with the sport, not even just the nonprofit, to come back. So I suspect it&#39;s really going to be about where the brand alignment for them is and who the target audiences are at the end of the day.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, well, having the minister just say we deserve better will not make a difference. Having the minister say, fuck you, you&#39;re done, Hockey Canada will, right? I mean, at the end of the day, it&#39;s really to Carter&#39;s point about how much ministerial discretion and how much ministerial sort of authority the minister and frankly, the prime minister, who also is on record commenting on this issue in the height of its scandal, want to exert on Hockey Canada. And so you saw what Hockey Canada did over the course of the last number of months with their rehabilitation exercise, bringing on consulting firms like Navigator, trying to get a more star-studded board of directors, which, you know, was part of its governance reform. But was it really, right? Yeah. Trying to ensure there was a committee that was formed where they asked former sort of male and female hockey stars or products of the Hockey Canada ecosystem to come join. So their real core desire, Hockey Canada, was survivability, right? They wanted to, and they, of course, and I think where they nailed it strategically, Carter, and I&#39;m curious to get your thoughts on this if you agree, is I think they, to your point, put the athlete in the center. Whoever gave them the strategic advice to save their ass, it wasn&#39;t about their ass. They actually put the athletes and the young kids, to Carter&#39;s point, that emotional resident story in the middle of their survivability existential crisis. So that broader sort of concept of we can&#39;t have a gap in the system. If you kill us, what happens, right? What happens over the intervening months? We would rather have governance reform rather than have net new governance from the ground up because what happens once again to the kids? Everything they said was about the kids, was about that emotional story, was about that cold February afternoon or morning that parents would get up and have their four or five-year-old go and play hockey. That is who would suffer. So as part of their ongoing sort of sales pitch to ensure that they stayed around, they made a compelling enough sales pitch to the minister that this gap that existed could not be filled with something that was net new, that this conversation around governance should be one of reform and not one of net new governance principles embedded into an organization, which would take many years to actually refine and find a sort of standalone culture. And I think the minister bought it. But at the end of the day, Carter&#39;s right. If the government wanted to take control on this file, they could have. And there are solutions to all the issues that I&#39;ve brought up here. But they&#39;ve decided that Hockey Canada is its vehicle. And we&#39;ll see where it ends up going. Because if they continue to drop sponsors, I can tell you the government is going to potentially have to, not just be forced to, and this is a government that&#39;s been pretty lethargic on many issues, have to decide around where the license goes to or the charter goes to Carter&#39;s point. point.</span>

But they&#39;ve sold, and this is what many stakeholders do and many organizations do to government, that, listen, we&#39;re not perfect, which is endearing, but we are progress.

It was employing a different type of professional artist and getting its funding model put in place. You know, like the people who did that were doing God&#39;s work work because it was so hard to do because we had a status quo funding model. Well, the government of Canada has created essentially a status quo funding model for sport that is empowering and enabling bad fiscal management and bad management for athletes. And it hasn&#39;t been looked at since we created the Own the Podium program a gajillion years ago, trying to put people on as though the the ultimate end of all sport. The ultimate end of all sport is simply to put people on a podium at the end of the day so the Canadians can sing the national anthem. And I will recognize that that&#39;s an important part, but it&#39;s not the only thing that matters.</span>

            <span class="text">feel like, you know, when Carter mentions on the podium, there&#39;s almost an emotional resonance that comes with that phrase. And I think that is one of the last times that we&#39;ve had the emotion of sports enter the NSO or the sports recognition policy that the government has jurisdiction over, right? Because it is an emotional story that was told about Own the Podium. Whether you strategically agree with it or not, the fact that it was about pride, the fact that it was about success, the fact that it was about pure merit at any cost, frankly, justified the cost, frankly, justified the government intervention, frankly, justified diversified, uh, the legislation, the regulation that came with it to allow it. Right. And I&#39;m not saying the government needs to get back to sloganeering, but there is a case to be made that if you want reform in this area, whether you are one of the, if I can call it Carter startup aspiring NSOs, right? Because this has a very incumbent advantage. As long as you&#39;re not fucking up, as long as you can show progress and you&#39;re not perfect, you&#39;re not fucking up. We&#39;re not going to revoke your, you know, uh, your, your license from you. We&#39;re not going to to revoke your overall sort of governance of specific sports. And I think for those who may want to enter this market, who may want to reform it, who may want to shake it up a bit, I think it&#39;s really about that emotional story that they can sell to government, that government can sell to the people so that they can justify their participation. Because at the end of the day, Carter, the sports ministry, if they can just fucking do their thing, right, if things can go humming along directionally correct with very few benchmarks about what success looks like, Like, that&#39;s fine to them, but I think it&#39;s really about selling them an emotional story that they can sell back to the Canadian public that would allow them and give them the runway and the rope to legislate and regulate, ultimately.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I like where Carter started here, actually. I think the labor movement is a good comparator because of the preconditions of what the labor movement brings, which is a network effect of of you talking to your friends about something you care about. That has been the root of the labor movement 100 plus years, right? It&#39;s not been a large advertising heavy. It&#39;s not been a large sort of broadcast heavy. It&#39;s been a, this is important because this is fundamental. And this is fundamental because it&#39;s about livelihoods. And I think what we need to do is if I expand on a strategy, and there&#39;s a lot of proof points to this, and let me kind of maybe list a few of those, at least that are top of my mind that I wrote out here. And Carter&#39;s hit on a few of them, right? The equal effort and dedication to men, I think is a huge one, right? So whatever bullshit argument people want to make about the WNBA and the NBA, which I know is a lot of butt of the jokes in the sporting world, being like, oh, they can&#39;t sell out even one fifth of an arena. That bullshit, I think, needs to be parked aside because equal effort and dedication. You also have this role model inspiration piece, which Carter hit on with Christine Sinclair. All respect to my homie Alfonso Davies, so I do not know, but are Albertan known, right? Christine Sinclair is the best fucking soccer player that&#39;s ever set foot and put on a Canada jersey, no doubt, and the best women&#39;s soccer player ever. So you have this role model aspect. And yes, rooted in this is this fairness and equity, but there&#39;s an economic impact upside here. There&#39;s a role model inspiration. There&#39;s just a social progress element to it. And I think what you have to do at the end of the day is you have to use soccer as your sort of lightning rod. You have to use soccer as the beginning of it. And I think beyond the friend-to-friend contact, the sort of broader equity argument has to be this conversation that if we can do it for soccer, we can do it for anything else, sporting and otherwise. And I think that&#39;s really exciting to me, is the argument to say, we are actually using soccer, not just as in the bounds of a sporting conversation, So that athletes in other jurisdictions and other sports can achieve equal pay. Soccer, as demonstrated by the Canadian National Women&#39;s Team, which are the best in the world, right? Best in the world, best at what they do, do not receive equal pay. This needs to be the tip of the spear. And it&#39;s popular. It&#39;s easy to access. It has those role models. I think this is a conversation point. And then what you do is you attract people to any on-ramp, whether they&#39;re sport-related or not. But the labor movement does this really well in certain jurisdictions. They expand the scope so much that they allow multiple entry points into a campaign that you don&#39;t necessarily have to know that educational assistant that is going to be helped out in a particular jurisdiction or a particular province. We need to do that with the sports movement. And in fact, allow people who may not be soccer related or even soccer adjacent or even sports adjacent to see themselves, to see their daughters, to see their future in this sort of movement. So I would say, take the whole spectrum. Don&#39;t just restrict it, expand it, because that&#39;s what tent building looks like. and you allow people to, campaigns Carter has built in the past, to feed their own words and their own language around why they care about something. This is not scripted. This is about a broader sort of fight. And soccer is now in the zeitgeist, tip of the spear, helps you make the case. I would start there. Create your ambition big rather than narrow. You might think it&#39;s a failed strategy to begin with because of that wide scale ambition. I think it&#39;s actually the the start of something, because it expands beyond one particular federation, so to speak.</span>

            <span class="text">across the board, because it&#39;s an easy metric to add. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s going to be difficult to evaluate. I mean, yeah, there&#39;s probably some questions when we say equal pay. Is it equal pay for equal effort? Or is it, for example, an equal percentage of the box office? There&#39;s multiple ways to measure equal. But right now, the measures that we have are completely off track with what the opportunity is to start valuing the efforts and the performance.

            <span class="text">You know, I&#39;ll just maybe add one point. And I think Carter hits on something really important. I love your idea, Carter, of that equal pay clause and any sort of government funding or sports support that the federal government or the minister in particular would green light on. And I think to my earlier point around, you know, plugging into existing movements about equal pay, rather than having to kind of set up a net new movement, use soccer as kind of like a proof point or something in the zeitgeist to galvanize people around. What something like that does, that idea that Carter put on the table, is it allows the minister to pick their own on-ramp. We know governments have, I was talking about on-ramps earlier, we know governments have varying and often changing reasons for doing something. So to give them, you know, the positive health and social outcomes on ramp, to give them the public support and expectations on ramp, to give them the even the moral obligation or the economic impact or the fair recognition of effort, as we talked about, or just frankly, this clear social justice and equality. If you give them all these opportunities, the chances that one of them will be the one that they walk on, depending on the mood of the government, the priority of the government, what they feel is symbolically important. As we know, this government&#39;s key strategy, but also failure, is symbolism. You give them these opportunities and you give them these on-ramps to jump in and take action on this fight. And I think one thing that organizations often fail to do, especially those that are advocating, is that they don&#39;t give enough on-ramps to government because they want their specific one to be the right one. So they have a moral clarity as a stakeholder to be like, you have to do it because of social justice reasons or equity reasons. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">if the government doesn&#39;t walk up that ramp, they kind of say, well, fuck you. That&#39;s the only reason to do it. And I&#39;d say that&#39;s wrong in this case, right? You have to give them several opportunities to get to the conclusion. And who gives a flying fuck which one they ultimately take? You just want the thing done. And I think that&#39;s where Carter&#39;s proposition provides several opportunities for government, should there be a desire to take action.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i think that the hook is going to be that this is going to be probably the most watched women&#39;s world cup in history um and the canadian team is really good and the emotional hook of this moment at this time is that it&#39;s most likely christine sinclair&#39;s last last hurrah it is a team that is super strong with a coach that&#39;s really interesting um you know her strength And her leadership is kind of second to none, I think. And so you&#39;ve got this cast of characters. And you&#39;ll recall, Annalise, we talked about characters a lot during the last election, right? You have to have a story, you have to have characters. And these characters are so strong that you would be almost nuts not to take advantage of this character set. And that&#39;s why I&#39;m so baffled by, you know, Soccer Canada. I mean, Soccer Canada has the opportunity to really jump into these characters, own these characters, define these characters. I mean, I remember when I mentioned</span>

They pulled the two women&#39;s ski cross, won gold and silver, and they pulled them out of a press conference. They cost those young women hundreds of thousands of dollars in endorsements because one of their coaches got drunk and drove a van. That is that&#39;s the exact opposite of how to do crisis management. This is what you know, this foundation, this this federation should be grabbing onto these these wonderful characters and telling some spectacular stories as this all all unfolds.</span>

We&#39;re just going to take over. We&#39;re just going to be the best in the world at this thing. And this speaks to the broader immigration story. This speaks to the broader development story. This speaks to overcoming gender stereotypes. This speaks to overcoming a country&#39;s stereotypes. This speaks to empowering future generations. We just decided that we wanted to put our mind to something and that these women, in fact, not we, these women wanted to put their mind to something and they they just fucking did it. They just decided they wanted to dominate something. Role models, achievements, breaking barriers, support and solidarity, national identity and pride, right? All of these things are tied together when you kind of take the underdog story that so casually ended up being the most dominant force in the sport. And I think that extension of that to me is such a poetic, such an interesting, such an emotionally resonant opportunity to talk about what else could we put our mind to? I know we&#39;re limiting the scope here to soccer, right? But when I think about this as the broader conversation of equal pay, it is that sort of story that I think is very much in our Canadian ethos, right? Where we don&#39;t kind of feel confident about ourselves until we&#39;re recognized elsewhere. Well, fucking look right here. We just kill at this thing. And I think it&#39;s really, really powerful. We kind of lean into some of the narrative threads that Carter put on the table and maybe some of the ones that I did as well.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think they really matter because there&#39;s almost an infinite number of things that you can do within any ministry. And you have to put some parameters on them. Now, in a perfect sense, what would be happening with the mandate letters is that the ministers would get the mandate letters and then they would be able to go and solve the problems on their own. We&#39;ve talked about kind of the first ministers problems where the first ministers are, you know, or take over and don&#39;t allow their their ministers to have autonomy. This is the opportunity to allow autonomy. Do these things. These are the things that we&#39;re hoping you will achieve through your mission. And you don&#39;t have to come back and ask permission to solve these problems. Go just solve these problems. And as a government, we will be happy</span>

            <span class="text">happy and satisfied that you did so. So I think that there&#39;s a real value in that. And I also think that there&#39;s a real value to the stakeholders in that, you know, we said in this mandate letter, this is what&#39;s going to happen. And now this is what&#39;s going to happen. Right. And you can hold this to account. And if it&#39;s not in the mandate letter, then get the fuck out of here. We don&#39;t need, you know, don&#39;t tell me how important this is. I&#39;ve got a mandate letter that tells me what&#39;s actually important. So I like mandate letters. I think that they are a great way to establish direction, to establish priorities and to communicate to stakeholder groups. This is what matters to us. So, yeah, I like them.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">do. do. I struggle with them a bit more because I feel like the ones that we receive are truncated. They&#39;re more of a laundry list. They&#39;re filled with vagaries. In certain cases, this sort of specific but vague, no timelines, no specific outcomes, occasionally which stakeholders you have to work with. But I have to park most of that aside and agree with Carter because I think I think they actually are a multipurpose tool. I think that when they were originally designed and these haven&#39;t been around for a very long time. We think of this as an ancient practice, right? Like you could even look back to the Harper era government and they really didn&#39;t have public mandate letters. I&#39;m sure that the PMO and especially the prime minister himself had direction, iterative and specific, your one go at your next three years or two years at a ministry, sir or madam. But at the end of the day, this has really been, and I shouldn&#39;t say Trudeau invention, but something popularized by the Trudeau government, this publicly accessible mandate letter. And I think to Carter&#39;s point around stakeholders, we&#39;ve gotten very used to it as one of the stakeholders of these mandate letters, I would say, the broader sort of media, the podcast class, the blogger class, right? We are one of the folks that takes them apart. And they create their own media narratives, right? Like you&#39;ll see journalists pick apart these mandate letters. They will go to stakeholders to be like, what do you think of this? And that will create a new story, right? I like this. I don&#39;t like this. And as every single important one comes out, I like this. I don&#39;t like this. But to my earlier point, they&#39;ve become this multi-pronged tool. They&#39;ve always, since they&#39;ve existed, been toward Carter&#39;s point about direction, accountability, guardrails, right? Do shit in this box, right? Don&#39;t fuck around. Your name of your ministry is very broad. I&#39;m narrowing it for you, right, minister? So go do these 12 things, right? right? You get to decide on the order. Maybe you don&#39;t because I&#39;ve given you a more detailed mandate letter that is not publicly visible with timelines and KPIs and goals that you&#39;re going to fucking execute on. But you&#39;re staying in these guardrails, to Carter&#39;s point, right? Coordination. One of the things that we see in mandate letters increasingly more so, and this was not the case in early mandate letters, but more so, you work with this person to get this thing done, right? And we see that even in the Daniel Smith letters. But even more more so these days, I find these mandate letters allow like to be a multi-pronged tool in some ways, right? You&#39;re able to, Carter&#39;s point, talk to stakeholders. And one of the things that I love that the Trudeau government has done, and I don&#39;t see it as much in the Danielle Smith mandate letters, and we can talk about this, is they outline specific stakeholders, which is really, really interesting. Not just like work with industry, but like work with the association of of welders work with this particular stakeholder. And I think that&#39;s actually quite smart because Carter, you and I have talked about this in the past, right? The best way to write a best-selling political memoir is you mention everyone&#39;s name that you&#39;ve ever encountered. So they go to the index and they try to find their name in it. And I look at mandate letters similarly. If you can mention these stakeholders, if you can put their names in them, ensuring you don&#39;t commit the error or of omission, but expand that scope rather than make it more vague, it allows those folks that are potentially going to be enemies to maybe even momentarily be allies to say, okay, well, I&#39;ve actually been called out as someone who&#39;s going to work with them. So let&#39;s wait and see. Maybe the minister has a conversation with me. Maybe there is possibility here. So beyond just accountability and direction and guardrails, they also allow this ability to have kind of stakeholder influence. It allows this ability to even manage your ministers a bit more, make them publicly accountable, use the public accountability mechanism in a way so that you can kind of keep cabinet control and implementation of policy. So I put aside the vagaries, I put aside the lack of timelines and the specific outcomes. And I say, I still like them despite all that because of the reasons I mentioned, the reasons Carter mentioned.</span>

            <span class="text">really have coverage and engagement about these, or they&#39;re trying to hide them, right? And so we always think of the more cynical, like, hey, you&#39;re fucking burying these things, right? You don&#39;t want anyone to pick it apart because here&#39;s the thing, if you could put it in a letter, and if no one picks apart, or no one finds necessarily what it means, or it&#39;s so specifically vague or perfectly vague in an artist sort of way that people can&#39;t really discern what you&#39;re saying, but you said it, well, it gives you a license to do it. That&#39;s your mandate. We trial ballooned it, no one picked it up, and fucking now we can do this thing. And to Carter&#39;s point, right, like perhaps releasing the finance minister&#39;s two big sort of points around the income tax collection as well as the domestic sort of or the provincial pension plan during the height of Stampede, probably strategic to bury least amount of coverage. coverage. But the other way to look at it for them is, listen, they want to put these out there. They know that the media is not necessarily going to beef up over the summer in any meaningful way. It&#39;s still going to be a thin media that&#39;s going to be distracted over the dog days of summer. Let&#39;s just get them out when they&#39;re ready. Let&#39;s not worry too much about it. We&#39;re not necessarily gaining press from this thing. We care about our... This is a stakeholder exercise. So what we&#39;re ultimately doing is punting these over to stakeholders who&#39;ve approached us or that that we want to appease, or frankly, still want some of their money filtered back to the party to ensure that they understand that we are on their side and their agenda item is our agenda item. They&#39;re probably using that sort of strategy, more decentralized sort of strategy. So for them, I think it&#39;s really about like, listen, let&#39;s just get these things out when they&#39;re done. Let&#39;s not think too much about the media cycle. And you&#39;re seeing that more and more, this concept of media relations, a lot of political parties, and frankly, governments, frankly, don&#39;t give a shit anymore. And I know this government from some of the things I&#39;ve heard is part of that cohort they&#39;re like who gives a flying fuck what what the media covers it&#39;s summer it&#39;s not like they&#39;re growing over the course of the next number of days so what well they&#39;ll they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have to choose between 12 we&#39;ll have to choose between six we don&#39;t care right all we want is license to do our shit and i think that&#39;s that&#39;s the very simplistic and perhaps most optimal strategy that they&#39;re currently using</span>

            <span class="text">I agree. Just to add on this point, when you can use specific or deliberately vague terms, which is an art, which is an art in communications, as the three of us know, that it feels like there&#39;s a lot on the bone, but when you look at it, oh, there&#39;s many outs for them. Did it say accomplish or did it say collaborate? Oh, it said collaborate. Well, I guess, okay, well, progress in that sense is actually totally subjective. Excellent. So if you could keep from a pure practitioner&#39;s perspective, if you can have this, it feels dense, but it&#39;s actually light feeling to your language, which they have actually successfully done. And I feel like this has become a bit of an art in mandate letters. And then pepper on stakeholders that are specific, make those specific and the actual KPIs vague. That allows you to get that that sort of feeling of we&#39;re actually trying to turn friends into enemies. And one of the things I&#39;ve loved that governments in the past have done that I would really advocate for around mandate letters is the strange bedfellows technique. Put</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Put on, let&#39;s say, a housing ministry. And I know this government doesn&#39;t have one. But on a housing ministry, put an association of construction professionals or builders alongside the charitable housing groups together. Put them in the same mandate letter. Put them side by side. Show that you&#39;re expanding your scope rather than reducing it or narrowing it. And that collaboration could very much just be a conversation or two. But once again, you&#39;ve named someone. It&#39;s a huge GR government win. It helps you back on the party dollar side. Let&#39;s not forget about that. That&#39;s what fucking fuels these campaigns going forward. So if I&#39;m named, I look like a friend, that&#39;s helpful, even on an individual basis. Even these corporations can&#39;t donate on an individual basis. Yeah, these execs will probably attend the premier&#39;s next lunch or dinner or fundraising event. All that shit adds up, and it matters when people can feel like friends rather than enemies. And I think mandate letters, more so than they have historically, allow government that latitude, and they allow the government that latitude by naming folks specifically. Lastly,</span>

So, you know, I think that the mandate letter and using it as a scorecard is a super valuable technique that should be that should be more in in more utilized by by governments as they can.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I was going to jump in on kind of this using mandate letters as a report card. I agree with Carter around the public accountability aspect of it, right? And I think mandate letters really depend on the minister, right? As certain ministers, you give them longer rope. The mandate letter is directionally correct. You fill in the gaps, right? And let&#39;s be clear about one thing. The mandate letter that is publicly provided to us is a summary of what is provided to these folks, I would hope, in certain cases. They probably have key measures, key timelines, things that are actually prioritized, right? Because right now, mandate letters, as they present themselves, are a laundry list where you&#39;re trying to seek out your thing. If you&#39;re a stakeholder, or they probably have a priority system, what&#39;s interconnected with what. And at the end of the day, as government, as a premier or the prime minister, you either give someone a script, that&#39;s your mandate letter, or a direction, that&#39;s your mandate letter. And you judge them based on that. If you trust, if there&#39;s a greater amount of trust, which is a lot of what this comes down to, you give them a greater amount of latitude. At the end of the day, though, any premier or prime minister recognizes that the political capital that they have is being spent by ministers, right? on these mandate letters. So if someone comes back three months later at a check-in, formal or informal, and saying, you spent way too much of my fucking capital not getting enough of this list done, that&#39;s a problem. Whether that&#39;s because you didn&#39;t follow the script, whether you went off the rails, you felt like you needed to explore here and see if there was a key issue that was not in the mandate letter, only to come back and say, you know what, everything is. I don&#39;t need more of that shit. So there&#39;s that ultimate element that we as a government, a minute. I, as the first minister and premier, I&#39;m writing a story. You don&#39;t get to freelance an author unless I tell you because you&#39;re just one fucking chapter of that story, right? Everything you do may not be directly interconnected, but it certainly is for the broader story that we are trying to tell to the public to get and secure fucking reelection in four years. And four years might seem so far out to you, but I&#39;m writing a story for four years from now. Any competent competent first minister, any competent premier&#39;s office is always looking at that saying, this is chapter by chapter, verse by verse, and you just are on borrowed time writing and authoring and helping us author one of those chapters for us. And frankly, we would do it ourselves, but we can&#39;t with all the limitations to what the premier needs to do. So you&#39;re the proxy for doing it. That&#39;s all you&#39;re on. You&#39;re on borrowed time and you&#39;re on our capital. And I know that sounds Sounds harsh, but in many ways, that&#39;s how you keep these folks in line, give them enough latitude to do the job, and then you assess them constantly. The one final thing I&#39;ll say is that all of this, all of this can be thrown out the window if public opinion of you and your job and how you&#39;re doing it, and frankly, in certain cases, you fall out of favor with either the first minister or the public, those two things can wipe out any sort of performance review formally that you would ultimately get. So I think all of that&#39;s worthy of noting, but none of it is as important as do we even like Marco Mendocino anymore, for example, which is the conversation. Exactly why do we know? Well, kind of a bit of this and a bit of this. But if you look at the mandate letter, Marco&#39;s fucking nailing it, right?</span>

Maybe be able to talk about something else because the problem with political events, as we know, around the summer barbecue season is that they&#39;re fucking redundant. redundant. You see the same 200 people over and over again. And as a politician, you have to do that. But if you don&#39;t have any latitude to talk about things that people connect with, or to break the ice or to actually show any sort of range of motion or interest, you actually look way more one dimensional overseeing someone over multiple events than you do interesting despite the multiple interactions you&#39;ve had with them.

But the palatable public version of that, I fucking love. I actually think they have found the lane here finally. And I think they&#39;ve, you know, they&#39;ve</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;ve always criticized this bill trying to do everything. Save journalism, create jobs, be morally righteous, battle big tech. I think they&#39;ve now picked the lane to say, we&#39;re going to use this as a tip of the spear to battle big tech. The journalism is almost a byproduct of that. Big tech has actually fucked around way too long and we&#39;re not going to push back. And so what&#39;s at stake right now is them not wanting to pay for news. But I think what they&#39;ve done is they said, this is going to be our issue that we select to fight big tech right now. And they&#39;ve gotten away with it for too long. And I think this is exactly what the government needs to do, that they need to start acting like this is a political fight, and not even acting. I think they need to leave. It is a political fight,</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s a political fight that gives a government that has been lethargic, that has been arguably lazy, that has actually never closed a deal on so many files, but has been an expert at symbolism on them, to</span>

            <span class="text">pick a fight, devote resources, and win it. This, to me, is like finding a new purpose in the late stages of a dwindling or at least lethargic government. You&#39;re not going to win the fight on cost of living. You&#39;re not going to win the fight on this emissions green versus this balance argument that you&#39;ve been trying to. This, to me, David versus Goliath, and where you could be positioned as the underdog, I think is beautiful to go up against these behemoths that are now falling out of public favor significantly. significantly. There are spokespersons on the other side, and I don&#39;t mean official ones. I mean the leaders of these organizations, the Musks, the Zuckerbergs, and less so the Googles in that sense, are not popular figures. You have a fight. Go fucking wean it. Lean into this would be my recommendation to them. What&#39;s next for journalism? I don&#39;t know. It really does depend on how aggressively the liberals want to fight this fight. To me, it&#39;s a renewed purpose. It&#39;s on the table. It&#39;s in front of you. Go fucking do it. Carter,</span>
