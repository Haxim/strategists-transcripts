        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Erin O'Toole threatening the end of fossil fuels and political responses to the omicron variant. How can leaders navigate the evolving pandemic politics? Is Erin O'Toole secure in his leadership? And whatever happened to Blockbuster Video anyway? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

What I would do is I&#39;d put the bookmark on the page I just finished. Why? Because I imagine that the people who need multiple sittings to read a book probably have a very low attention span, probably don&#39;t grasp knowledge, probably need a refresher or reminder in terms of what they just read the next time they crack open that book six months later, which is why you leave it on the page you just read as a bit of a preview it&#39;s like the previously on the west wing and then you read that page and then you just go on to the next page carter so a couple of</div>

Not generally, no, because I think, you know, splitting the difference when you&#39;re talking about a public health crisis is not necessarily going to get you where you want to be. But it does sort of lead me to my rule. And I take what Stephen&#39;s saying. I&#39;m not trying to shit all over his point here because there&#39;s some wisdom in it here. But you just have to be careful knowing that, you know, compromise can lead you into some pretty uncomfortable positions. I think that&#39;s a lot of where Jason Kenney ended up wrong side, you know, trying to challenge, do two strategies at the same time. My rule is don&#39;t turn off your brain, right? Like past performance is not a guarantee of future results here. And just because you want it to be over does not mean it&#39;s over. And you&#39;ve got to sit and look at Omicron for what it is and not either what you wish it is or what the last wave was.

Start focusing on the negative outcomes because the case numbers are astounding. They&#39;re just like, even though we&#39;re not tracking PCR tests in the same fashion in Alberta, you know, 40% positivity rates in Alberta, those positivity numbers across Canada are massive.

And secondly, how do you make that political shift? Because the public health advice is kind of going in multiple directions. Some are still focusing on cases, some media outlets saying we&#39;re switching over to hospitalizations.

So that we can look at and we can say, okay, maybe that&#39;ll tell us a bit about where we are in the trend. because i think one of the reasons people are a little anxious to give up cases is uh the canary in the coal mine right you see cases rising you can expect uh icu&#39;s to rise</div>

We&#39;re going to see much higher immunity levels. Not everybody&#39;s going to get it, but it&#39;s going to be widely, you know, Corey&#39;s numbers of 600,000 people active cases right now in about three weeks, we will see 60% of the population of Alberta will have been exposed or would have had this thing. It&#39;s a big it&#39;s a big problem, big opportunity, because when you get that kind of big spread that coupled with your vaccination rates gives you a fairly solid herd immunity. And this may be the last one. So in that case, then the win is winning. Right. The win is you&#39;re out of Omicron. You&#39;re done. We&#39;re done. COVID COVID is now the Spanish flu, which we get every year. Right. And we can have booster shots. We&#39;ll get we&#39;ll get better at managing COVID as it mutates. we&#39;ll be ready to catch it and hopefully we see just better and better outcomes for people who get it the</div>

The win is, if there&#39;s a win, it&#39;s that we&#39;re out of Omicron, not that we&#39;re out of Omicron before anyone else, and we can&#39;t control the types of variants. So the other thing governments need to do as a rule is focus on downside risk. There&#39;s absolutely no sense to let things go absolutely nuts with with the hopes that you&#39;re just out of this two weeks before, say, the province next door. Prudence has still got to be the rule of the game here. If this is running through and it takes another four weeks and that protects your health care system because of measures you&#39;ve taken, I think people</div>

          <div class="said">people will forget that inconvenience a lot faster than they will forget a collapse of the health care system. So downside risk. It&#39;s not equal, right? You&#39;re not placing a bet and it&#39;s 50-50 either way. If you place a bet, this is all going to be fine and you do nothing and it&#39;s not fine. I mean, I don&#39;t think that, just to use this province as an example, I don&#39;t think Jason Kenney&#39;s got another one of those in him. I think it&#39;s over, over, over. Maybe not with his party, but certainly with the province of Alberta, if we still have something like Delta again. So given that, what is, is it worth it?

But for the last little bit, a lot of the political rhetoric and a lot of the political focus has been given to the 10% in terms of the blame. And, you know, this is where you should be looking versus the 90%.

Make sure you&#39;ve got your tetanus shot, your COVID shot, your, you know, whatever shots you need to have in order to be safe, because that&#39;s where we want people to be. And the 6% or 4% that choose not to get vaccinated at least stop rallying because right now they&#39;re being persecuted and that persecution is creating a secondary response. And I don&#39;t mean that the persecution is wrong in any way, shape or form, but it&#39;s in everybody&#39;s mindset. And that&#39;s that&#39;s just if we can just make it back to normalcy, then the protests go away. We don&#39;t have to shut down roads every weekend.

It was turned into something that it wasn&#39;t. He flapped it. You know, the best way to describe it is he flapped his arms. he made text that was super big. It looked ridiculous. He looked more like Ezra Levant than the leader of the Her Majesty&#39;s Loyal Opposition. It was, you know, I just hate this stuff. I hate when people take things that aren&#39;t true and turn them into political opportunities. I think there&#39;s tremendous opportunity in truth. And you should pick that which is true. And you you should find a way to make it into something that matters. You should not need to lie to be good at politics. And I think that in fact, if you do lie, if you use excessive hyperbole, and note the word excessive because hyperbole does have a place in traditional politics. But if you use excessive hyperbole, it will come and bite you in the ass. And I think that this one did bite him in the ass. It didn&#39;t go where it needed to go.

He wrote a tweet about it, and it really struck me because I agree with it 800%. He said, flapping about like a coked up second string Fox News host over things that were never said won&#39;t get Aaron O&#39;Toole elected. I agree.

I can&#39;t remember the wording right now, but I was quite struck by how split it was. Because for a long time, we had seen Canadians generally wanting more.

But you know, that in Alberta, it&#39;s probably if anything, likely tipping the other way with people saying, you know what, no enough, like, it&#39;s too much, like, it&#39;s enough, right. And so I just, you know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily a political winner to call for those kinds of actions. I think Stephen hit the nail on the head with schools. It&#39;s really tough. I knew it was five right away because I&#39;ve got a five-year-old. I&#39;ve got a seven-year-old. Those are pretty important years. And I will confess, I&#39;m getting a little freaked out about how much time they&#39;ve spent just sort of in bubbles, sitting at desks, even in kindergarten, on the mat on their own and all of that and what this is going to do in the future. And the idea of going to online learning again seemed wild. like there&#39;s things i want the government to do i want better ventilation in schools this should have been an eye-opener for all of us that schools need better ventilation this isn&#39;t just a covet thing let&#39;s just fix ventilation in schools how about that for a starting issue here i want to make sure that we have the protections available let&#39;s use the best mask let&#39;s do all of those sensible things that would allow us to continue those are reasonable things that i&#39;m looking for as a parent i&#39;m not looking for another fucking like shutdown of schools i&#39;ll tell you that right right now.
