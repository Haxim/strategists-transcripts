          <p>Get your novelty New Year's Tie out of that box in the garage and pretend it's going to all be different next year because it's time again for The Strategists to unpack the year that was in their annual Holiday Spectacular. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the best and the worst of the year, write political obituaries and talk about the year-to-come in this regular-length special. In the commercial spirit of the season, <a href="https://thestrategists.ca/products/short-sleeve-unisex-t-shirt" target="_blank">our sponsor</a>* tells us exactly what to do while Zain Velji keeps everybody in line.</p>

You survived. And let&#39;s reflect on some of those magical moments of this holiday season. You got confronted by that relative, the one who voted for Trump and proudly declared, see, Trump isn&#39;t racist because all those Mexican men love him too. You sat there in silence, radiating the courage of a small, ineffective, spineless rebel. Well</div>

And now, nothing will rekindle those cherished holiday memories quite like kicking back, relaxing, and maybe picking up a little bit of RSV while you listen to the Strategist Holiday Spectacular proudly presented by Flair Airlines. Because if it isn&#39;t late, it isn&#39;t Flair. And with me as always, Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter.</div>

Three reasons, and we give these three reasons every year. Number one, not late, okay? Orthodox Christmas is on Tuesday. Number two, and this is where you guys can say it with me, we only record when the sponsor&#39;s check is in the bank, right? Thank you for going right.

Let&#39;s start with a new segment on this Flair Airlines Holiday Spectacular presented by Flair Airlines, which, by the way, you might say, that&#39;s redundant. It is not. on. We named it the Flair Airlines Holiday Spectacular before Flair Airlines sponsored the Holiday Spectacular. And we said, where do you want your name? Because it&#39;s already in there. They said, we want an extra. We want more. And I said, well, that&#39;s not consistent with anything you guys do. And they said, exactly. And so that&#39;s why it&#39;s tagged on to the end as well. Corey, keeping with their spirit of talking about things that they don&#39;t offer, our first segment is called the Companion Pass, okay? This is something Flair Airlines does not offer. This is the Flair Airlines Companion Pass. Don&#39;t look for it because it&#39;s not a real thing. It doesn&#39;t exist, okay? It&#39;s called a regular ticket.

But who is one person that we would have rather avoided going on a political journey with this year? And then pull out another person. This is a little bit of the fantasy part of it.

And I want them to identify when the budget was introduced. And I want them to look at what polling did between then and now. Because what you&#39;ll see is the continuation of an unbroken trend down from summer of 2023 when Justin Trudeau probably should have resigned, right? When he did his first big change-up, when he decided he was going to do the cabinet. So then there were ads, and then there was the budget, and then there were more ads, and then there was the change of staff and all of this shit. And it&#39;s not worked. So I think that realistically, to give it to anybody else would be doing a disservice to this award. It would be like one of those weird Oscar zags, or I guess more topical would be a weird Golden Globes zag. Yes, to record on the 9th. Yeah, it&#39;s just not going to happen.

Freeland did a, like, she basically brought down a prime minister, right? There was a lot of grumbling for a lot of time. Nobody stood up and did fucking shit. And then his most loyal lieutenant took him out, right? That is wild. And she did it with this perfectly written letter. She played the next week perfectly. perfectly, but</div>

That&#39;s not to say she&#39;s not out there doing things, but I think that there&#39;s a lot of conversation that is not being controlled by her and her team. Let&#39;s put it that that way so that&#39;s that&#39;s uh that&#39;s why i put freeland off to the side here christy clark could be the dark horse here i am not gonna i&#39;m not gonna write her off because i made the mistake of writing off daniel smith when she ran for the ucp leadership thinking that she was too far outside of the mainstream there but and daniel smith of course announced basically the day i think actually the day that jason kenney resigned right we were all like what is she doing that&#39;s It&#39;s crazy.</div>

But, you know, BC plus Alberta is, you know, is as big as Quebec plus a chunk of the Maritimes, but it&#39;s not enough to win the Liberal leadership. And that leaves Carney. And strangely enough, while I wouldn&#39;t give Carney the play of the year earlier, I think that he is pretty well positioned here, in the sense that he was at ground zero, but somehow seems to be getting to walk away from it. Go back to all of the drama with Freeland and Trudeau and the end of it all, and the fact that he was going to be brought in to prop up the Trudeau government. government but i don&#39;t know i mean it&#39;s way too early to call these things but i guess don&#39;t get the sense that that stink is is uh sticking to him in either sense right and um ultimately a lot of the reason why he was appealing to the prime minister is why he&#39;s probably well positioned to be one of the serious contenders for this liberal leadership and to be prime minister of canada now do i think he can win the election fuck</div>

Stranger things things have happened but i will pick uh doug ford not only has he managed to hold on to ontario not only has he managed to totally change the landscape of ontario politics over his terms in office but he also has started to build himself a persona amongst canadians that makes him look like a real leader and listen ontarians out there this is going to rock your fucking world but most of the time we actually don&#39;t think of the premier of ontario as a particularly important person in our lives outside of uh you know well ever right but doug ford the way he&#39;s standing up to donald trump he has actually started to have resonance in other provinces here and um no i think it&#39;s all good for him i think that he&#39;s having kind of uh so inexplicably because of all of the scandals that have been around he&#39;s having a really good year at a time when premiers Premiers don&#39;t usually have really good years.
