So you have all these groups that aren&#39;t necessarily enemies, but they get to have the opportunity to make this case. And Corey also makes the case.

So those were the other guys. Those were you. That was the liberals who did that, and that was ultimately the thing that I think was fatal to the Martin government, the failings of the liberal government, that he thought because he was so deep in it and because he thought people will see a difference between Martinites and Gretchenites, that he could just blame the last guy, but he just eroded his own brand. And so I don&#39;t think Daniel Smith can sit there and say, yeah, that was all Jason Kenney and that was a bad idea.

            <div class="said">poverty is an interesting problem and this is one of the things that i don&#39;t think that danielle smith can wrap her head around Not everyone can afford $150 a month for private insurance. And if you can&#39;t afford $150 a month for private insurance, if you can&#39;t afford $30 a month for contraception, or whatever the numbers may be, you are more likely to get further and further impoverished. And there is a direct correlation between poverty and lifetime ability in health, education, performance, if you will. You know, so if we have a real big problem with the impoverished population not being able to choose when they&#39;re going to have children, not being able to choose how their family is going to be constructed. And if you&#39;re, you know, we always talk about pro-choice in the context of abortion. And it&#39;s really, I think, very small minded in that sense, because it&#39;s actually pro-choice in the sense of when is a family going to choose to become a bigger family? When is a family going to choose to undertake that additional expense, that additional responsibility? And too many people in our society are having that responsibility foisted upon them without necessarily an active choice being made. And the cost to society, as well as to that individual family and that individual child, the cost to society is massive. $30 million? We spent $30 million on chickenpox vaccinations. This is nothing. This is absolutely zero. uh in the overall scheme of things and it will have real world outcomes that far and away outreach just the cost of the contraception well</div>

And you get the benefit of the overall national conversation about BC&#39;s move. Whereas if this had been an initiative that was simply done by the Alberta NDP right now, two things. One, it might have seemed less practical because people would be like, can we even do that? I don&#39;t even know if that&#39;s a thing government should do. Well, I guess they can because it&#39;s happening in BC. And the second thing is it just seems more real, right?</div>

You know, there&#39;s some excellent work being undertaken by the BCNDP to take responsibility for the opioid epidemic and homelessness, mental health illness. That&#39;s really fascinating. And it may move us in some really different directions than people thought. institutionalization and big questions and i do think that we should be looking and stealing from those um those jurisdictions but i still don&#39;t like this and i don&#39;t like it i think because of the time i think it&#39;s because of the timeline i think the timeline is we announced it on thursday you know they announced it thursday we announced it the next tuesday and i</div>

            <div class="said">yeah i i mean listen i&#39;m not the target audience for it uh for a bunch of reasons um but this is uh this to me seems like it&#39;s it has a couple of characteristics that make it an obvious vote getter one of them is it it addresses something that people feel is a little unjust the other is that it puts money in their pockets and the third is it addresses a broader approach to health care that says we&#39;re going to cover more things so and we know healthcare is a big issue for people and when people are talking about healthcare and answering polls no i don&#39;t think that they&#39;re necessarily thinking about contraception but i think they&#39;re generally speaking about a system that is frustrating and doesn&#39;t always get people what they want when they want so uh it&#39;s also a great hook in to talk to the overall ndp uh healthcare strategy so yeah i mean for 30 million if you want to be crass about it for 30 million dollars it seems like a great return on investment in terms of vote getting yeah</div>

            <div class="said">the gender divide is huge and the gender divide happens on two sides there&#39;s a side that is um men men are more likely to vote for the ucp than the ndp um so there&#39;s that and there&#39;s also a reluctant ucp voter that tends to to be female. So two-thirds of reluctant UCP voters are female. And so if you can mess with those reluctant UCP voters, either keeping them home or shifting them over, that&#39;s a significant upgrade on the number of potential voters that you have or reducing the number of voters in the field. So the gender divide, first of all, it&#39;s been huge for a long time with women trending towards a little bit more progressive in general and then the you know in Alberta at this moment there&#39;s actually a fairly significant gender divide that is kind of exacerbated by COVID and economic recovery being a little different for women than it is for men</div>

Like what&#39;s the top issue in the province? The economy. And when you asked women, what&#39;s the top issue in the province? Jobs, right? Like it was more about like the people impacts. And look, but like you&#39;d have people in both, but there was an obvious gender skew there. So So when you start thinking about the demographics that you need to win, and I think there&#39;s almost a growing cliche about the idea that it&#39;s like the suburban female voter is who&#39;s going to determine this election. Even when you are taking something that is an overall issue, there are ways that you can package it that is going to land better with that audience. And so maybe it&#39;s not even the question you asked, but whenever you&#39;re putting anything forward like this, there&#39;s the product and there&#39;s the packaging. packaging and there are products that are going to be more appealing depending on your demographics depending on who you are and there&#39;s going to be packaging that&#39;s more appealing depending on demographics and who you are but you</div>

You know, and but this kind of goes back to overall theories about persuasion. And the reality is, we don&#39;t live in a post-truth world as much as we think we do. People are not as nihilist as that. Arguments do change minds. But arguments also tend to ossify opinions in the moment. And so, you know, you can track changes over time more readily, when people are in debates, like when they&#39;re really setting their ground. And, you know, a lot of marriages have dynamics where it&#39;s like, well, I&#39;m going to argue with them about this or I&#39;m going to hold my ground and we&#39;re not just going to do that. And so, I don&#39;t know. I think it&#39;s complicated. I think marriages are complicated and it&#39;s not so simple. I think it&#39;s actually kind of a good thing that we can&#39;t just assume a household is all like one way voting anymore. I think it&#39;s a little weird if your spouse doesn&#39;t know how you&#39;re voting, frankly, but that&#39;s kind of weird to us as people who think and talk a lot about politics you got to keep in mind a lot of people it&#39;s not the dinner conversation and so um you know we also shouldn&#39;t judge on that particular matrix it&#39;s</div>

If you really want to make some changes, and I&#39;m with you, let&#39;s make some changes. But if you really want to make changes, then address the ones that are actually prohibiting people from having children. And those are the rules that say you must leave. If you miss three meetings in a row, you&#39;re off council, right? Those are the ones that are actually prohibiting you from actually having a child. Whether or not you bring your child to council has no impact on on your ability to be a good or bad counselor. And that is my final argument.</div>

            <div class="said">Well, I do know that managing the schedule is tough and, you know, back and forth like that. But generally speaking, you should be able to meet with the mayors of the top two cities and maybe like a joint meeting at a mayor&#39;s conference or something like that with the smaller cities within, I want to say, a couple of months. It&#39;s important to meet with the mayors. It&#39;s also, I think, really important and incumbent upon any premier or mayor to just arbitrarily throw a child into that meeting. And just to remind you of the importance of the issues and the impact that they&#39;re going to have on future generations.</div>

            <div class="said">You know what? Carter&#39;s not wrong about the schedule. It is really difficult to coordinate schedules for premier&#39;s offices. And it&#39;s easy to say like, oh, they&#39;re the mayor. Of course you should meet with them right away. It&#39;s like, okay, well, what about the minister of health for the federal government? What about the premier of British Columbia? What about the prime minister? You know, you got a lot of important meetings you got to slot in.</div>

            <div class="said">I agree it should be in the first couple of months. I would argue it should probably be in the first month. And if it&#39;s not in the first month, you&#39;re probably signaling something. And it&#39;s not even so much about the month, but it&#39;s the things that have happened in those five months that make me say, well, how? How is this possible? Because it&#39;s not as though the legislature is in some remote city in the middle of nowhere. It&#39;s in Edmonton. And we&#39;ve gone through a session of the legislature and we&#39;re in a second one here. And it feels like, yeah, maybe if you&#39;re in Calgary, it&#39;s a little harder to get up to see the mayor because you&#39;re coordinating schedules, but you&#39;re not necessarily in Calgary all the time. right but the seat of government is in edmonton you are in edmonton all of the bloody time you must be able to find some time to to pull together with this individual and again not</div>

            <div class="said">events that occurred physically in edmonton uh that would have occurred in that time period where they couldn&#39;t find a time to coordinate those two busy schedules and i&#39;m shocked that based on the subject matter and some of the investments and some of the things they&#39;ve done in edmonton that they haven&#39;t sat down with the mayor of edmonton so like on three categories i&#39;m it&#39;s a bit of a head scratcher and i don&#39;t quite understand how with all of the very big priorities going on they didn&#39;t find the time and i will say like i feel like if it was a conservative mayor of edmonton i don&#39;t think it would have taken five months i think some of this is politics i think a lot of it&#39;s politics and uh and that&#39;s unfortunate because government works best when government works together and the cities are an important part of the equation but</div>
