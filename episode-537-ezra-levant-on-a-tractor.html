            <span class="text">you can drive a truck through. And those loopholes are all closed at the federal level. This isn&#39;t something like, well, we didn&#39;t think of it, right? This is something where if you wanted a good piece of legislation, you only needed to look to the federal level that has shut down all of these things. Total miscalculation, Corey.</span>

Not that they would do that because that&#39;s illegal. But they may need to do that. And then he says, now I can get behind this because corporations can&#39;t pay off loans. Like that – his original critique of the bill and the reason he got behind it were so misaligned as it&#39;s just – it&#39;s not even – like to call it fiction does injustice to fiction because we can find truth in fiction, guys.
