        <p>Come fly with us and Captain Gary Russell as we discuss why prime ministers almost never have post-premiership political careers, what to make of a small uptick of support for an Alberta Pension Plan and the dynamics of teamwork and ranked ballots.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss David Cameron's appointment as UK Foreign Secretary, a poll that shows support for an Alberta Pension Plan up from 21% to 27% and an Ontario Liberal leadership pile-on. Was the win for Sunak that we aren't leading with Suella Braverman being fired? Do incremental increases in support for an Alberta Pension Plan matter? And why did you make us remember the David Cameron pig thing? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Our first segment, why the fuck do we still do this? Guys, it&#39;s an oldie but a goodie. I&#39;m going to test why the fuck we still do this, except I&#39;m going to put a spin on it. Because in this case, we don&#39;t do this all that often. And we&#39;ve seen it happen. Corey, you teased this a bit. We&#39;re going to go to the UK to talk about this political tactic. You don&#39;t need to know a lot, listening audience, about the UK, other than what Corey&#39;s mentioned, which is you have a Home Secretary who should not have been Home Secretary. She&#39;s been given the boot. You have a Prime Minister who has replaced Liz Truss, Rishi Sunak, who is desperately fighting for his political life, heading into an election, down in every single poll. And one of the moves Corey has made is not just booting a unpopular, hardlining Home Secretary, which he has, and Suella Braverman, which, by the way, is the second time she&#39;s lost her job in the last 12 months, but that&#39;s a different show. um the</div>

I wouldn&#39;t mind just changing up this conversation entirely. The last couple of prime ministers have been knifed by the right. Maybe that&#39;s not a great dance partner. Maybe I&#39;ve got to look to the center. Maybe the reason I&#39;m down 20 polls is because I&#39;m not looking to the center. And so I think that Rishi Sunak&#39;s just kind of trying to throw out the rundown here.

They&#39;re never really brought back. But we&#39;ve also talked about this other sort of swim lane of people being addicted to the craft, the attention. Why do we not see this, what we saw today?

But Carter&#39;s right, like he&#39;s got all sorts of relationships, he&#39;ll have immediate credibility, as he&#39;s engaging with foreign leaders who know him as a serious player. And when you think about his interactions on the continent, you know, with the most important allies of the UK, they know he was on the side of remain, you know, and that actually means something too at this particular moment when you&#39;re trying to hold everybody together here.

The Alberta pension plan has a boost in a new poll by Leger Marketing. It suggests that it has gone from 21% support within the Alberta populace to a full 27% support. I&#39;ll put the sarcasm aside because there is some interesting numbers in here. Opposition for it fell from 54% to 48%. And respondents who don&#39;t know held steady almost since October at 24%. This is, of course, the Alberta pension plan, $7.5 million ad spend on this particular thing. I think that ad spend is not completely exhausted. Corey, can I start with you on this? You have been used to, you know, public sort of campaigns within the government context. I give you some of the top lines, right? $7.5 million campaign, 6% boost, 4% drop in opposition. opposition, taking off this hat, putting on that old hat, how would you kind of read what I just put on to you top line?

          <div class="said">too early. I think the reference poll was actually done in the spring. And even if it was done right after this was all dropped out in October here, it doesn&#39;t tell us enough about how much it permeated into the population. And what we need to know is how much of that six point gain was from that initial bundle of offerings right is this you know we&#39;re going to get 334 billion dollars your premier now supports it that&#39;s an important part of the offering your team supports it right uh so 334 billion your team now supports it you&#39;d be paying less you&#39;d be getting more that initial bundle and how much of that is the result of this media campaign pain that&#39;s gone on since and if if all of that came in the first couple of days and none of it has come since well then they&#39;re obviously in some serious serious trouble and so if all of it came as a result of advertising in the past four weeks well i guess now we know they can move agree by about one point a week and then you&#39;re not in trouble at all you easily have the runway to get there if you need to not saying that you&#39;re not going to hit saturation points yeah yeah</div>

          <div class="said">I want to get your perspective. That&#39;s actually very helpful, right? Like, so the last point I find particularly insightful, which is that should this government have unlimited appetite on an ad spend or a greater appetite than the initial tranche of money that they have, if they can move a point a week, they&#39;re going to take that in a binary race and push it to this eventual referendum, which they&#39;ve highlighted. lighted this is not coming in the next 12 months for example it may be a longer runway than that so to speak uh if they wanted to kind of go through this one point a week sort of drudge carter you read it from your strategist lens not to say that what cory&#39;s provided isn&#39;t a strategist lens but it&#39;s i asked him for a slightly different one what do you see when i give you some of these top lines well</div>

Like, you know, you&#39;re now shaping narrative less so trying to use numbers to analyze next moves.

One of the things that Danielle has done, and this contrasts greatly to Notley when she brought in the carbon tax. When the carbon tax was brought in, the people who stood up on stage with Rachel Notley were the CEOs of the big oil and gas companies in Calgary. And those CEOs stood up and said, we&#39;ve been paying carbon tax forever, and this is a good thing for all of Alberta. And people forget that because those CEOs ran away with their tails between their legs when things started to get tough. But this is kind of the same.</div>

When you&#39;ve got people who are strongly for or against this tactic works less what i&#39;m about to say but it is a pretty common tactic when you start using polls and weaponizing them and it&#39;s part of why during elections people pull their hair out when there&#39;s a very suspect poll that because it looks like it creates social acceptability for a choice right like oh i thought that was dead maybe that&#39;s not dead oh that&#39;s interesting people are actually on board with that oh maybe i should open my uh my mind to that and it allows you as a government to say things like well as people learn more about an alberta pension plan they love it they really get on board and you know i too was skeptical at the start but when these facts are presented it&#39;s just such a no-brainer for alberta and you can see that in the polling as we&#39;ve gone out as we&#39;ve talked to more people we have persuaded people simply by putting the facts in front of them that this is right for alberta here right and then as captain gary russell would say fasten your seat belts anything can happen from there all of a sudden you&#39;ve got a majority level of support for this fucking thing and and you know that&#39;s that&#39;s what the government hopes for that&#39;s that&#39;s what the government aspires for, but see my comments at the start. It&#39;s probably not that likely in a scenario where there&#39;s so many strongly opposed, right? Because it&#39;s just, it&#39;s, you&#39;re not sitting there kind of clueless to how people feel about this particular thing.</div>

And similarly, they can look at what&#39;s being used successfully out there by politicians and hangers-on of politics and say, maybe that&#39;s something that we can leverage and use too.

Now, if they were questioned on this, this is, you know, and so for folks to bring them in on this exercise, right? Corey, I get it. They&#39;ve got a lane that they&#39;re communicating in right now. It&#39;s not seen in a, but if they were pushed on this issue, if they were like cornered on this issue, right?

          <div class="said">Albertans absolutely have the right, but it would hurt Albertans. it would hurt Canadians. And ultimately, I think if Albertans want to have a conversation about this, they need to have a conversation rooted in the facts. And the facts are bigger pensions get better returns, bigger pensions are less risky. A pension that allows you to port your pension from province to province is good for all of us because it supports mobility of Canadians. And, you know, we just really hope that the government of Alberta takes this seriously and doesn&#39;t see this as a communications exercise, but instead a very serious conversation about about the cons of stepping out of the Canadian pension plan, as well as what they perceive as the pros.

          <div class="said">psychology of this is really straightforward people who there is a clear front runner people who choose not to vote for that front runner are doing so for a very specific reason uh yasser and nate aren&#39;t going to lose because of um you know people loving bonnie too much if bonnie gets over a certain percentage right now i would peg that percentage somewhere around 45%, 43% on the first ballot, then she&#39;s going to win. And that&#39;s just the way that&#39;s going to go. If she gets below that, then she only wins if there&#39;s something called attrition, which means that people stop marking their ballots for Yasir or Nate or someone else. So Bonnie is in real trouble if she doesn&#39;t get close on that first ballot. And that&#39;s where i think these guys have gone wrong they seem to think that they have to paint a negative picture of bonnie crombie for them to actually win what they&#39;re doing is actually hurting themselves what they should be saying is i really like that uh nate i really like that yasser we agree on so many things we want to support each other we are in fact a unified candidacy one and two one and two it does not matter who you put one it does not matter who you put two who</div>

They&#39;re both wanting this job. They&#39;ve clearly painted a singular opponent. They&#39;ve indicated by doing that that she&#39;s the front runner. People may already know that.

          <div class="said">Yeah, it&#39;s really, really hard to argue with Stephen on this, because ultimately, he&#39;s right. The idea that somebody is going to flip and become a supporter of theirs who was otherwise going to be a crummy supporter seems relatively remote to me, just because of how leadership politics often work. And he really stuck the landing when he talked about like, it&#39;s about attrition and the fact that you might otherwise have some of the supporters just say, I&#39;m voting one, and that&#39;s done. Like, I&#39;m marking an X, I&#39;m not even putting numbers at all. And so this is a way to avoid that. And look, I can speak from some limited experience here. In 2006, in the Dionne campaign, there was all sorts of conversations with Gerard Kennedy delegates. And there was, of course, a broader deal that is well understood, like whoever was behind the other one was going to drop off the ballot, right? And so there are ways to signal those things and there are dynamics that can exist and be unspoken, such as we&#39;ve got to stop Michael Ignatieff. But the minute you speak to them and bring them in, you&#39;re bringing kind of an ugliness that almost demands a backlash. And we started to see that last week. So, you know, right around the time Captain Gary Russell was celebrating his birthday with a giant piece of cake in the cockpit of his 737, totally feeling himself creating a huge delay at Pearson while he demanded somebody bring him chocolate ice cream, not vanilla</div>

We rarely kind of give the party like a strategy voice. But if you&#39;re a political party, the executive director of the Ontario Liberals, these sort of conversations, like, and Corey, I&#39;ll come to you in a second for natural reasons.
