        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the recent turns in the 2015 election campaign. Is the Conservative's new advisor a sign of a campaign in freefall? Should the New Democrats be worried about Trudeau's latest moves? And can James Carville best the top political minds in China? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

Now they&#39;re mentioning and introducing this notion of social infrastructure, affordable housing units, you know, seniors, housing units, recreational places. What do you guys make of this policy announcement? I know it probably gives them the same type of leverage to go into multiple cities and make that announcement. But any broad thoughts on that?
