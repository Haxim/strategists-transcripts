            <span class="text">so once again that&#39;s next Thursday. Ticket at live.thestrategist.ca. Okay, before we get into today&#39;s show, last episode was our liberal strategy special. You guys spent a lot of time, an hour and what? Our episode was like an hour and a half, so like a full Ridley Scott movie of talking about the liberal strategy. And I wanted to ask you, off the top, you know, we&#39;re about About a week out from where we initially recorded that, any regrets, any sort of second guesses on what you threw out there based on what we put on the podcast?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, just like a Ridley Scott movie, maybe the ending was confusing to me. Did</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Did we leave ourselves open for a sequel? Probably. No, I have one regret. I have one regret, and it&#39;s not something that I disagree with, but I think I was maybe a little too emphatic. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And thinking about the past elections, I&#39;m now wondering if I shouldn&#39;t hedge a little more. And that was when we talked about Quebec, and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and I talked about the liberal ceiling at 30 points.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Still true. But I have to ask myself, what would the NDP&#39;s accessibility numbers have looked like 35 days out from last campaign? And when I think about that, and I think about how quickly Quebec has flipped in the past, I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I wish I&#39;d left a little more wiggle room. I&#39;m a little worried I&#39;ve exposed myself to look really stupid. To</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Yeah, like how stupid I looked in the Foothills by-election. Yeah, what was the turnout</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">called it a victory for the strategists. My 9% plus your 30% equals 39% turnout. The strategists win.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">My only regret is that it turns out you can get paid to rescue a campaign in the middle of the campaign.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And we should have just held out like the Linton Crosby strategy and maybe waited for the telephone to ring a couple more days. Well, I&#39;m sure</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know. And now we&#39;ve given them the strategy. We get zero money.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">we don&#39;t get imported into a campaign. That&#39;s unfortunate. Very unfortunate. So Carter&#39;s regret is that he didn&#39;t get paid for it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And so by making at least a somewhat public knowledge that this is happening, they are saying there is going to be a change. This is a chance for them to hit reset in a much more literal way. Maybe not literal, but a metaphor that is seen by more people than if they were just to quietly bring this guy in to consult on the side. Now, the</span>

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to the liberals and their announcement of social infrastructure. They had this broad based announcement of that infrastructure plan, which made headlines for a couple of days, and frankly, which we covered for a good 20 or 30 minutes in a previous episode. Now they&#39;re mentioning and introducing this notion of social infrastructure, affordable housing units, you know, seniors, housing units, recreational places. What do you guys make of this policy announcement? I know it probably gives them the same type of leverage to go into multiple cities and make that announcement. But any broad thoughts on that? Because I found that quite interesting to envelope that with infrastructure.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I guess we&#39;re seeing a pretty broad theme, putting the pieces in place. I don&#39;t mind it from a traditional liberal standpoint. I&#39;ve always thought being a liberal means creating</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I also think you could view it as a bit of a pivot away from the notion of infrastructure uh to more of a social lens and and and if we&#39;re now talking about infrastructure in the context of what it means for people and how it helps them all the better for the liberals i think yeah</span>

Justin is out ahead of me if I&#39;m the NDP. Should I be concerned if I&#39;m inside the NDP war room right now or the campaign team?</span>

            <span class="text">Justin Trudeau has moved left of the NDP. That is a challenge.

And this is, again, something that&#39;s really it pulls well, for lack of a better term. People are going to be attracted to it.
