            <span class="text">we have talked Donald Trump. We have talked U.S. politics today. Let&#39;s focus on our home province with Alberta politics. A lot going on, a lot to catch up on. Which leads to our first segment. I know what you&#39;re doing this summer, Stephen Carter. We have done the drive-by on Jason Kenney the last three or four episodes. But let&#39;s dig deeper into the current situation with Jason</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Jason Kenney to remind people running for the leadership of the PC party with the sole mandate to merge the PCs in the wild rose in a unite the right movement, a double carom, a three domino effect situation for him. Start off with your initial thoughts. How is this summer going for Jason Kenney? And we&#39;ll take it from there with some of the more poignant questions that he&#39;s facing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, if I&#39;m to be charitable, I mean, he&#39;s dominating the limited provincial media about politics. He&#39;s getting a lot of it because he&#39;s out and he&#39;s doing things and he&#39;s He&#39;s posting images on Twitter of him in front of coal-fired electricity plants saying this is the best thing since sliced bread and we have to keep things going. He&#39;s doing all those things and no one else is doing anything, right? So from that point of view, he&#39;s getting off to the early start that he needs to get off to. I&#39;m not sure that anybody&#39;s paying attention.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, is this the start he needs to get off to? Is all press good press for Jason Kenney this summer? Those are two different questions,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">questions, I think. I think he&#39;s doing exactly what he needs to do. it&#39;s not about winning the media in the summer it&#39;s about the fact that he is meeting with those local organizers and the people who might be willing to take constituency positions go out and vote in what is now a delegated leadership race i actually at this point wonder where is everybody else i don&#39;t know why they&#39;re seeding the field to him so uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">completely you know i mean the the challenge they have right now is that it looks like jason kenney is doing a very good job of making it look like a victory lap rather than a campaign and that&#39;s going to be the case until some serious candidates get it in a serious fashion and that&#39;s not happening right now so you got to give jason kenney full marks on that well steven</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">steven i think to you on that question because this official campaign doesn&#39;t start until october 1 and so jason kenney is spending this time and he&#39;s faced some controversy for it this time this summer campaigning before and even collecting money through a a super pack of sorts but to cory&#39;s point should other candidates be out in in the field right now or do they wait i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">mean you could certainly make a case that that being out there is a good idea right um don&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t cede the territory don&#39;t make you know don&#39;t give jason kenney the opportunity to set the question i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i would argue that jason kenney has already set the question he set the question the day he started and that is i&#39;m going to merge these two parties if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">if i was advising a candidate and i guess i am i would say don&#39;t come in because i I like that question. I like him being able to ask that question, and the answer that people are reaching automatically is no.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So if I thought that he was asked, if the question was being asked and the answer was yes, then I would probably say, we better get a candidate in there and better start changing the dialogue. I don&#39;t think the PC members, anyways, or prospective PC members, are buying his question. Don&#39;t</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s worthwhile, Stephen, to have a candidate, or if you&#39;re a candidate, against the question or the ballot box question, and Jason Kenney is setting, to be out there and be full-throated in why people should reject it?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to a degree. You can get out there and you can be full-throated. But I&#39;m a big fan of if it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s not doing you any damage, don&#39;t fight it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s doing damage. I mean, he&#39;s getting out. He&#39;s doing his work. He&#39;s traveling around in his blue Dodge pickup truck, talking to people. That&#39;s his strategy. strategy, I would suggest that the other leadership candidates are doing something similar without the profile that he&#39;s doing it with. Corey,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you are in charge of, let&#39;s say, a PC leadership candidate who wants to run. What are you doing right now? Are you telling them, get your shit together and let&#39;s get out there as soon as possible?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">possible? Well, maybe they are behind the scenes. The fact of the matter is I don&#39;t have Sandra Janssen&#39;s day calendar. I don&#39;t understand what she&#39;s doing day to day. But look, I don&#39;t buy this notion that you wait and you keep your powder dry and you come in a bit later. I buy the compound interest argument. What do you mean by that? You get organizers early, and those organizers beget organizers who beget organizers. And you&#39;re better off starting and building that team much later. Do you do that publicly, though?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It doesn&#39;t matter. I mean, to my point, I don&#39;t know what Sandra Jensen is up to. But I do know what Jason Kenney is up to. And certainly by him taking such a public approach to this, he&#39;s going to be getting some ancillary benefit. You&#39;re going to have people in different constituencies looking at their newspaper and seeing Jason Kenney and maybe even proactively reaching out to the campaign and getting involved.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">involved. It&#39;s cute. Do you think that people still look at newspapers?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, tell me this. To Corey&#39;s last point, when he talks about Jason Kenney reaching out to communities, who is Jason Kenney&#39;s audience for this summer, right? We first said it&#39;s not media. We said it&#39;s community. But let&#39;s dig a little bit deeper. If you are running that Jason Kenney campaign, who is your audience this summer? Is it PCs? Is it Wild Rose, Broadly? who are you looking to talk to? I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m looking really for anybody who hates the NDP government. And there are quite a few people who think that the NDP government is creating problems.

The thing about Jason Kenney is, if you want to stop him, you need to create a discomfort with him. You need to, as a PC, sort of put on this cloak and say, I&#39;m stopping the wolves from taking over this party. And the longer that Jason Kenney has to sort of build comfort with the PCs and say, hey, I&#39;m not so scary, I just want to get rid of the NDP, the better his chances are in that delegated convention. and especially if he&#39;s got those organizers who are already predisposed to be involved out there working on his behalf.

            <span class="text">Corey, I have two questions for you, and maybe we&#39;ll start with this first one. What does the existence of this PAC that Jason Kenney is allowed to do, right, which ultimately is a 10 minute registration and then let&#39;s just raise money. What</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">What does that speak? Does that speak to like a deficit in certain rules that we have right now? I mean, from your vantage</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">vantage point, what do you think? Yeah, there&#39;s a massive gap in campaign finance and expense laws in this country and almost jurisdiction by jurisdiction. And it is a bit of an arms race because somebody brings in a rule to fix a challenge, and then somebody brings in a new practice that circumvents the rule. And that&#39;s effectively what Jason Kenney&#39;s done. You have to keep in mind, in Alberta, leadership contests have not been regulated by legislation for very long. That&#39;s a relatively new development. Right, right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right. And now what they&#39;ve done is they&#39;ve said, well, it doesn&#39;t kick in until the official announcement of the leadership. So there we can circumvent that. That&#39;s no problem at all. But it&#39;s not just the leadership prior to the official call. We&#39;ve also got the fact that we don&#39;t have any rules, generally speaking, around internal party offices, right? If you want to take over every single constituency association in a party, you can have significant pull over the candidates and policies. There&#39;s no rules around that. Outside writ period, Stephen&#39;s already talked about. Federally, we have campaign expense laws when we&#39;re in writ, but there are no such rules when you&#39;re outside of the writ and you can pretty much put unlimited dollars against it as long as you&#39;re able to raise it. There are always going to be gaps, I guess. Well, there&#39;s a certain law of unintended consequences.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, yeah. I think you&#39;re absolutely right. And there are creative people like Stephen and I who are charged with finding creative ways to do these kind of things. If you&#39;re Jason Kenney, you&#39;re looking at your strengths and your weaknesses, and you&#39;re saying one of my strengths is I can raise a boatload of money. Right. So why wouldn&#39;t you try to find a way to leverage that advantage? So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that the only thing that I&#39;m confused about with Jason Kenney&#39;s particular approach to fundraising right now is I had not heard that it was incorporated as a for-profit corporation, but if I were him, I wouldn&#39;t have incorporated at all because at least the last time I was really in-depth with these finance laws, the rule was for an unincorporated association, if you make a contribution to a political entity that&#39;s under the Election Finance and Disclosure Act, all it does is it just it targets back that contribution to the original donor and not the association as a whole so what i mean by that is if i am raising as as you know unite alberta jason kenney&#39;s unincorporated association and i raise i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t know three million dollars and that&#39;s why i&#39;ve put the cap of 30 000 i can literally transfer all of that money to the leadership campaign on day one and it is just targeted back to the individual donor where it originated. So it would have allowed you to bring that money into the leadership contest. Under his current structure, if he&#39;s actually incorporated as a for profit corporation, he has no ability to spend that money as soon as the leadership contest begins. That&#39;s my only confusion about his approach.</span>

So like the exact same system that Stephen Harper was fine with for nine years. Jason Kenney was part of that government.

I&#39;m not a lawyer and I&#39;m not trying to pass like a legalistic judgment on this but the government&#39;s argument in a nutshell is that the changes that were made to introduce this Enron clause were introduced wrongly. Legislation only allowed changes to be brought in in a certain fashion there had to be going through some sort of review process and that didn&#39;t happen ergo these clauses aren&#39;t allowed right but</span>
