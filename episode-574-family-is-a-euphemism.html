You give us five stars, of course. I mean, that&#39;s just a given. Give us five stars. You say the podcast is great, but Corey Hogan. And what do people win, Stephen Carter? They can win an Al Nurkis Sam dog tag. Now, if you want the fulsome explanation of what Elmer Kassam is, last</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, quitting while you&#39;re definitely not ahead. Stephen and Corey. PKP. We are going to talk PKP. So we are talking about Pierre Carpelladeau quitting as a leader of the Parti Quebecois. And actually, before we get into the specifics, I want to talk broadly about the strategy of residing while in office. And I think there&#39;s a conversation here to be had around the concept of the excuses or the rationales given. In his case, this is a guy who was a star candidate recruited by Pauline Marois to run. He effectively, their party loses, and then he becomes leader of the party, and he gives the excuse, ultimately, Stephen Carter, the classic one. He wants to spend time with his family.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Tell me more, and we&#39;ll talk about the legitimacy of that, but tell me more about the rationales that politicians use to get out of office and ultimately what goes on behind the scenes when you are constructing the rationale because this one seems so tired that can we actually believe it? Okay. But before</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">before we even get there, I think that we have to acknowledge it is a pretty grueling job. It is not just nine to five. It&#39;s not even nine to nine. It is a 24 seven job in the realist sense. And you are away from your family a long time. It&#39;s difficult when you see them and they think you&#39;re a stranger or they&#39;re more familiar with your, your wife&#39;s quote unquote uncle. And you&#39;re pretty sure you don&#39;t have a brother. Those are probably difficult times. yeah look</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">look i gotta i gotta tell you the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the excuse feels tired because it is such an obvious reason to do it but that that reason to not be in politics existed prior to the date they retired so the excuse i think i get it yeah yeah i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i mean the excuse it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it feels like an excuse because that was true yesterday that was true last week that was true last month that was probably the day they took office sure it&#39;s always been true um and it probably wasn&#39;t more true today than it was was yesterday right so i think that&#39;s why people look at it and say like yeah is that is really why you want to retire uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sometimes it is i&#39;ll just throw that out there sometimes they&#39;re just thinking it&#39;s not worth the abuse anymore i&#39;ve got better things in my life i&#39;ve got bigger priorities yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah but let&#39;s look at why we actually wind up in this spot where we have to analyze it right it&#39;s the it&#39;s the excuse that we go to cried wolf</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so we what do we do when we have a politician that we need to resign right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right and when we say we need to resign them it&#39;s usually fired right so if we&#39;re firing someone or if we want to find them an easy way out the first thing we do is we say to them i think it&#39;s i think it&#39;s time that you resign now your family wants to spend more time with you so</span>

            <span class="text">yeah so give me one one second there so let&#39;s let&#39;s go down that rabbit hole for a second talk to me about what that conversation looks like where you ultimately go down the resignation path when someone needs to be fired tell me tell me about what that looks like carter well</span>

You couldn&#39;t make it happen. Are we actually, and I don&#39;t want to overreach here, so tell me if I am, but are we potentially entering an era where it&#39;s not even one and done? You don&#39;t even get to complete your term if you don&#39;t finish the shit you need to get done within the first year or two years.
