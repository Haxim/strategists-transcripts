        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about PKP's resignation and the polarization of American politics. What's the proper way for a leader to resign? How will an election contest with the two least likeable candidates in American history play out? And how do you crack the whip on an independent Senate? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

So we are talking about Pierre Carpelladeau quitting as a leader of the Parti Quebecois. And actually, before we get into the specifics, I want to talk broadly about the strategy of residing while in office. And I think there&#39;s a conversation here to be had around the concept of the excuses or the rationales given. In his case, this is a guy who was a star candidate recruited by Pauline Marois to run. He effectively, their party loses, and then he becomes leader of the party, and he gives the excuse, ultimately, Stephen Carter, the classic one. He wants to spend time with his family.</div>
