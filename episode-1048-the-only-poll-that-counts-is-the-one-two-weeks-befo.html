        <p>Zain, Stephen and Corey break Zain's self-imposed "no provincial politics" rule to talk Danielle Smith's updates to her Pawlowski recording strategy. Then: the gang gets righteous about an Ontario proposal to ban polls in the last two weeks of a campaign.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's shifting approaches to the Pawlowski recording and a no-good, very-bad idea to ban polling in the last two weeks of Ontario elections. Why can't Smith stick to a story? Will Ontario go forward with the recommendation to do away with public opinion polls during the closeout to elections? And when is AFL season over? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I want to go into this story a bit. I don&#39;t want want to go into it heavily i want to talk about it a bit now um i want to talk about whether this will matter from the frame of the election because this is what&#39;s most very interesting steven carter the background on this story this is a a leaked conversation that was uh i think about a couple weeks ago now uh put out there by the ndp and cbc um daniel smith on this uh 10 plus minute recording with arthur palowski uh talking about his covet uh prosecution Many of the facts already known out there as it relates to her saying, leave it with me. An unsavory character, Polowski, with a long history of discrimination. She has come out with a couple of different tactics. Tactic number one, initially saying, I&#39;m going after the CBC and refusing to talk to media about this. tactic number two on a radio show recently saying, well, I actually thought I was talking to a leader of another political party in Mr. Polowski, who at that time was the leader of, you guys may need to remind me, was it the Alberta Independent Party or some political party that he&#39;d set up?

I mean, she had said, I think, I think she&#39;d said, you know, kind of disingenuously that she couldn&#39;t speak to the issue because it was in front of the courts. That is something that Corey and I, you know, we&#39;ve seen it a million times where that line is used, but it&#39;s effective line because it gets you out of a problem. And then she goes in on her own radio show where no one&#39;s interviewing her. No one&#39;s asking her the hard questions. she goes and states that a whole brand new reason a whole new theory of the case as to why she&#39;s actually um you know speaking to to Arthur Pulaski um which is bullshit and everybody knows it&#39;s bullshit now it gives the media another opportunity to take her around one more time and speaking of someone who watched her go around and around and around in 2012 this is her pattern she tries to to get out of the problem instead of allowing the problem to go away and she&#39;s allowing this problem to to</div>

The premier welcomes the investigation, is fully cooperating with the commissioner, and is confident the examination will confirm that there&#39;s been no such interference. That part seems pretty standard fare. Then the second part, as a result of this ongoing investigation, would be inappropriate for the premier to comment on this further until the investigation is completed. Is that better strategically than what we heard? Or is that exactly the same in your mind And that same sort of trap, as Corey may have listed it, that he&#39;s put himself in.

It didn&#39;t seem to make a difference last election. I&#39;m curious in your mind, are we strangely enough, just, you know, climatized to that? Was that different?

We don&#39;t know what she&#39;s saying is actually true. So if we don&#39;t know that what she&#39;s saying is actually true, then we best find other examples of when she may be lying. And I think there&#39;s lots of them over the course of her kind of tenure, if you will, uh, as a columnist and as a, um, as a political figure, she has said and done many different things that kind of reinforce this, this, uh, attitudinal, you</div>

Now, keep the pressure up on this specific issue. Um, you know, I think that there&#39;s ways to put additional pressure on her cabinet to get more of this story out. I think that if it starts to look like they&#39;re going to lose their seats because they&#39;re not being honest and truthful around this issue, that maybe they start making leaks start happening as the rats try and escape the sinking ship and hold on to their individual jobs.

Obviously, I think this is nonsense. I&#39;m suing the CBC. Now, I mean, there&#39;s 11 minutes of tape. I mean, this is the fundamental challenge that the UCP has here.

If they were still so unsure as to what needed to be said, they shouldn&#39;t have come out swinging the way they did at the CBC because the idea that, oh, it was a party leader I&#39;m talking to seems like such a swing from where she was before.

Our next segment, Stephen Carter, margin of error. I want to talk about polling, Stephen Carter, and I want to talk about polling in the province of Ontario, because after some record low turnout in the last Ontario provincial election, not to mention some real dog shit candidates, The province&#39;s chief electoral officer is calling for a ban on publishing the results of political polls for the final stretch of the campaign. Let me give some context for listeners who may not be familiar with this. So as part of their 2022 debrief or audit of the election, the the election watchdog indicates that political polls have the potential to influence election results and under a heading called legislative changing, the report recommends disallowing the publishing and reporting of political polls two weeks in advance of Election Day. So for those keeping track at home, that would be like if you&#39;re in this Alberta election, May 15th, mid-May, last two weeks, no public opinion polls, no horse race polls, no understanding where things are going to continue. political polls have the potential to influence election results. He recommends that no public polling results stating political party favorability be published in the final two weeks. And he cites low voter turnout as being one of those things. Many respondents lost interest in the election due to early reports of a one-sided result. It</div>

Let&#39;s get to that stuff in a second. I know there&#39;s a bit of a soapbox that you guys want to get on, but can I go with the strategy stuff first? If you had to deal with this reality, I want to go into straight. This is now a thing. This had massive public support. How would they know? But it did. This had massive public support. This is something that is now instituted. Stephen Carter, just explain to me, as a guy who&#39;s run so many campaigns, so many elections, guiding the ship as a campaign manager, guiding the ship as a strategist, on a province-wide or a city-wide race, talk to me about the impacts of not having political opinion polls in the last two weeks. Just paint me a picture, just only like the two of you can. What would that reality look like? What would that terrain look like? Because I don&#39;t think we fully appreciate it. Um, in the absence of political polls, you might say it&#39;s actually not that different saying, or you might say, actually, domino effects and the downstream effects would mean this wouldn&#39;t happen if that doesn&#39;t happen. This doesn&#39;t paint me a picture, Carter. Let&#39;s start with you and Corey. Maybe I&#39;ll get you to paint a similar picture building on what Carter&#39;s kind of put on the table.</div>

It&#39;s against the law to release them, but we are looking solid. We have got the best polling. We&#39;re in the best spot. We&#39;re absolutely going to win. And I can now say that because there&#39;s no data that&#39;s going to come out to refute that. Absolutely nothing is going to come out. So now the poll that is released least um three weeks in advance of of the campaign or you know on the eve of the of the publication ban that poll is now going to be a gospel right and we&#39;re not going to see any movement we&#39;re not going to be able to see movement from uh you know that the long shot uh not had nenshi campaign where he&#39;s making the moves in the last three weeks and all of a sudden people now know that their vote vote for Naheed Nenshi, isn&#39;t going to be wasted. So it pushes them to go and vote for the underdog candidate. In fact, we have higher turnout because the underdog candidate is now viable. Oh, my God, this is so exciting. I finally get to vote for someone who I want to vote for, say the voters in Calgary, when that actually occurs. I mean, there would be none of these types of moves. And the worst part is that the cynics, the cynical operators who are going to just say that their candidate is winning, who have already used polls in kind of this really negative fashion, they&#39;re the ones who are still going to benefit from it because they&#39;re going to just make shit up.

Actually, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever asked you this on the show. Are you a believer in that old sort of adage that some of of our fellow political practitioners talk about saying, you know, in a race where someone is far out ahead, and I&#39;m going to butcher what the actual phrase is, it&#39;s much more succinct than this. In a race where someone is so far out ahead, that those that stay at home, it&#39;s actually not a sign of apathy, it&#39;s just a sign of, you know, a blessing to let the train go in the tracks that it&#39;s going in. That if Doug Ford is ahead by 15 points, and only 30% of voters show up, that it&#39;s a tacit endorsement, not by the additional 70, but by a portion of that additional 70 to say, hey, you know what, I&#39;m fine with the train going down that track.

          <div class="said">Corey, I&#39;m going to go back to the main question, if that&#39;s okay for you. Carter started painting a picture for us. What would happen if we had a polling blackout in the last two weeks of a rape period? He talked about everyone being in first place. He talked about the poll that gets released just before the blackout is being gospel. He talked about the fact that no real understanding that, and Carter, I&#39;m going to paraphrase once again, that people are in this black hole. They have no idea what&#39;s going on. Everyone could be in first. Everyone&#39;s viable. But it also limits It limits the chance of a come from behind. It limits the chance of a late surge. It limits the chance of a crescendo at the end that&#39;s untracked or doesn&#39;t necessarily get the resources that an NSHE campaign or a lot of late break win campaigns have gotten. Corey, extend that picture. What else will you be adding if you were painting a picture for the listeners as to what a polling blackout in the last two weeks of an election could do? Yeah.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah. So for the first election where there&#39;s a polling blackout, in particular, I think Stephen has hit the nail on the head. Everyone will be in first, there&#39;ll be all of these polls, quote unquote, leaked, that&#39;ll go around social media. Like, you&#39;re just not going to be able to put that genie back in the bottle. For sure. The reality is, when a poll gets published, there are requirements these days. What was the sample size? What were the questions? What was the order? When there&#39;s a poll that&#39;s leaked, that&#39;s not even supposed to be out there? I mean, by definition, you&#39;re not going to get that kind of rigor because it&#39;s not supposed to be out there to begin with. So I just think that that&#39;s, it&#39;s pretty dangerous. And it is ultimately going to make voters pretty nihilistic. And nihilistic voters, I think, is a bigger threat to democracy than complacent voters. Because like, what&#39;s going to happen is people are just going to say, well, it&#39;s all bullshit. Everybody&#39;s faking it. It&#39;s fine. And I just don&#39;t know how it serves anyone to have voters flying blind. I don&#39;t know how it serves anyone that voters would have access to less information than campaigns.</div>

They came out strongly against the niqab ban. The NDP dissembled. And then all of a sudden, the Liberals pulled ahead a bit. And then because they were ahead a bit, they pulled ahead a bit bit more, and the NDP vote collapsed, and the Liberal vote climbed, because voters saw this virtuous cycle where it&#39;s like, oh, the Liberals are starting to get ahead in the polls.

I think one of the most intriguing vote collapses, not necessarily a collapse, but the test of viability that happened was in Ontario in the last election with the orange-blue shift that happens that we see around the Labour vote. We saw a version of that with private sector unions supporting Doug Ford, looking at the polls, looking at the polls, saying, OK, the NDP don&#39;t really have a shot here. We&#39;re seeing that this is probably a more de-risked move to go with Ford. You know, that perhaps, if it was in the final two weeks, could not have happened, that collective sort of endorsement shift and perhaps even that worker shift that we&#39;re seeing. I wanted you guys to set the terrain around what could happen. And then Carter, I want you to put your Machiavellian hat on saying, okay, I&#39;m Stephen Carter, political strategist, campaign practitioner. I don&#39;t set the rules. I play by the rules.

You&#39;ll remember that our municipal campaign had the provincial campaign right on or the federal campaign right on top of it. So it was really going to be difficult to get attention to get airspace and those types of things. So that now basically what you what you have to design is a campaign that peaks to two weeks earlier. So you want to be in that campaign that is now peaking on in your two weeks before a writ date, which is already happening.

And then I would be saying like, yeah, look at this, like we&#39;re really on the move. It&#39;s a shame that everything&#39;s blind now. Look at all this momentum.

So if you end up, say, going into that final two-week period, and let&#39;s say it&#39;s PCs, 40%, liberals, 35%, NDP, well, like 10%, right? I don&#39;t know. Like, well, then it&#39;s just going to be the liberals versus the PCs, and it&#39;s going to come down to that writing by writing. Doesn&#39;t mean the election won&#39;t matter in the last two weeks, but that&#39;s going to be the election.</div>

And one of the pieces of information they want handed to them is who&#39;s going to win. Who&#39;s the winner is a huge driver for voter intention. It&#39;s one of the reasons that we talk about momentum all the time. Momentum is significant because people want to vote for the winner.

Is it over or is it under? The parliamentary budget officer this week stated that by 2030, when the price of carbon is expected to reach $170 per ton, most households will see a net loss despite the rebate payments offered by the federal government to offset the surcharge. So ultimately concluding that the carbon tax may not be, as the liberals have said for the longest time, revenue neutral. It was one of their hallmarks, their calling card, or their sort of branding line for the carbon tax that they have implemented. Now, there are many liberal MPs saying, go run the numbers again, because we&#39;re certain that they&#39;re wrong. There&#39;s some incorrect analysis. Others are arguing, regardless of what the facts are. Corey, as a political problem for the liberals, is this an over or an under on six for you? Well,</div>

          <div class="said">I understand it&#39;s based on the American Congressional Budget Office model, also a bit of a problem. But at least there, there&#39;s the logic of reconciliation and all of the other considerations that need to go into it that just they don&#39;t apply in the same way here. And yeah, I mean, I guess what I would say is the PBO can and does make mistakes. So we can&#39;t take it as gospel. But many people do take it as gospel. And for that reason, I think this is like a seven or an eight. This is a problem because it blows up a talking point that liberals have used with careless abandon over the past bit and, you know, live by the PBO report, die by the PBO report. Let this be a lesson to you. Ultimately, though, I do think the liberals can resolve it by saying, well, if that ended up being the case, we would increase the rebates or something to that effect. So it&#39;s not an unsolvable problem, but it will certainly complicate their communications implications on this particular file over the next bit.</div>

          <div class="said">seems like the liberals have faced two things on the carbon tax recently. First is that, you know, Biden, their political ally, one would say, in the United States, as part of his IRA Inflation Reduction Act on tackling climate change, has not issued a carbon tax, which gave a talking point to conservatives as it related to carbon pricing doesn&#39;t have to be the only way we solve this. And secondly, this PBO report, Carter, same question for you, over, over, under, on a six as it rates to a political problem for the Liberals? I</div>

          <div class="said">I think it&#39;s under a six. I mean, the PBO is something that, I mean, sure, a talking point has been erased, and it will be, the Conservatives will be jumping up and down on it, but it turns out the Conservatives haven&#39;t been really that fond of the carbon tax from the beginning. So it basically puts everybody back into their regular places. places liberals still support a carbon tax conservatives don&#39;t like a carbon tax here we are again i just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be a significant piece uh the pbo i agree with cory though um if it were up to to me that that sucker would be gone uh in the first term of whatever government comes in next carter</div>

So what&#39;s stopping, for example, the Western Standard, based here in Alberta, of running a poll and publishing a poll online in Ontario in those final two weeks. Abso-fucking-lutely nothing is the answer. So, like, this is the challenge and it&#39;s one of, like, a trillion challenges with it.
