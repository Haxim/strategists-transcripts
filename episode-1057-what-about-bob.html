But I think also in general, and one of the things that was chatter on Twitter was that Smith&#39;s campaign team had told reporters a few weeks ago that they would be like, yeah, every day there&#39;ll be an announcement, kind of standard campaign stuff. We actually talked about this last episode. This is the cadence of the campaign.</div>

I mean, it&#39;s not unprecedented in the sense that Doug Ford did a a pretty typical version of this as well. This is happening a lot more, particularly with governments. But what might be unprecedented is literally day two disappearing. Like, I cannot think of a time that has happened. That&#39;s really wild to me. Because at the end of the day, and maybe we can unpack this a bit, elections are supposed to be 28 days of accountability, where we hold a government to account and we consider our options. And the whole name of the game is is availability to voters through the media, right? The idea that you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re just, as the premier, going to talk to voters.

You know, we rent them a fucking bus so that they can sleep on the bus and catch up and do their, you know, do their meetings and never have to leave the campaign trail. and instead of doing that type of campaign the tried and true campaign where we are bustling and hustling this campaign has had this isn&#39;t a choice this is something that you have had to do they have had to remove the leader from the media which reaches i don&#39;t know minimum half million people a day minimum the the mainstream media if you were to do and be interviewed by you know know especially by the rebel you know but instead of doing this you&#39;re completely pulled back and now you&#39;re not getting any attention from to those half million people and instead you&#39;re talking to your hyper engaged because that&#39;s all you can talk to because those are the only people coming out to events those are the only people going door knocking those are the only people answering the doors like this is the most asinine quote-unquote strategic decision but it wasn&#39;t a a decision it&#39;s only being done because they had no other choice they know that if they put daniel smith in front of the media it&#39;s another two or three days of a negative story period</div>

But I do believe in a democracy. That&#39;s kind of the bargain, right? Like we just say, like for these 28 days, there&#39;s no hiding. There&#39;s no sleeping. This is what you do. You&#39;re available to people here. And instead, for a bunch of tactical reasons, they&#39;ve decided perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be wise to put Danielle Smith up. Maybe they&#39;ll ask a question. Maybe that answer will be reported on. Maybe that answer is bad for us. We don&#39;t show up. They can&#39;t do it. They don&#39;t show up. People can&#39;t get outraged. If everything stays the way it is, we&#39;re going to win this thing. And really the only guard we have against, and by the way, it&#39;s not just Danielle Smith, like this is happening more, right? This whole general approach is happening more. And the guardrail is supposed to be, we all get mad about it, right? We say, no, accountability is required. You&#39;re not giving it to us. See you later. But instead we are all so, and this is so ironic as a guy who has this podcast, who is talking to people listening to this podcast, but we are all so up the ass of the meta analysis, right? Right. Like, oh, what&#39;s the tactic? And is this a savvy tactic for Daniel Smith?</div>

We&#39;re fine if they&#39;re talking to you and not about Artur Pawlowski, right?

And when they say we refuse X, then they say, well, I tried to be reasonable. I offered X plus a moderator of their choosing. And yeah, I chose Derek Fildebrandt from the Western Standard. You know, I think that he&#39;s a very reasonable individual and he would bring an awful lot to the debate. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re afraid of Derek Fildebrandt. I was willing to accept, you know, Don Braid, their moderator. I mean, I&#39;m just randomly picking a person, but the reality is she can create this equivalency between a mainstream personality on global global television, you know, at PostMedia, and whoever she wants to bring in from the rebel or true north or anything like that, and then almost look like the victim and say, I</div>

And if you only have a couple of questions and you start almost playing a game of chicken saying like, hey, listen, you can waste your question on this. There&#39;s going to be so many other things going on. You know she&#39;s going to say she can&#39;t answer it by not having, you know, when you think about newsworthiness, there&#39;s a few different components you look for, right? Right. Obviously, this has conflict, but this will no longer have timeliness if she pushes it back a couple of days and people will be sitting there going, oh, geez, do I really want to blow it on this one particular question?

One of the things about the Smith strategy of hiding, right? if that&#39;s what&#39;s going on, or even just not making themselves available is probably the less negative way to put that as part of a strategy to just not have the message bounce off where they are. One of the things about it is it&#39;s new. And I am sure that they are watching carefully to see its success or not. And so this is a moment where if people push back on it, whether it&#39;s the public or the media in some way, shape, or form, they might bail on it, and they might go to five days a week. But if there is no pushback, they&#39;ll just continue you going through it and so what&#39;s pulling it back to this palowski story if</div>

This is not about you. And you have a very interesting story here. Talk to your field officer about it. But we got to talk about the big story here. Would you like to hear the big story here now?
