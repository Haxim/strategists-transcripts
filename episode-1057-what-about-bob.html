            <span class="text">did not happen that&#39;s gonna be our next that&#39;s gonna be we&#39;re gonna do more than one segment today no it&#39;s okay you&#39;re just we&#39;re gonna do more than one so no daily announcement from daniel smith no opportunity for media to ask questions um a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">a statement from the ucp told reporters that smith has a really busy schedule today and she&#39;s talking with voters um and she&#39;s actually not she&#39;s not scheduled to hold a media availability until until thursday which will be day four of the campaign and just some contrast here the ndp had i believe four media availabilities today just in one day yeah so uh let&#39;s get into this cory hogan what what&#39;s the strategy here i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i this the strategy is pretty plain the strategy is uh if we don&#39;t get up we can&#39;t get knocked down and so we&#39;re not going to have ourselves available at this very very particular moment with the Pawlowski verdict. But I think also in general, and one of the things that was chatter on Twitter was that Smith&#39;s campaign team had told reporters a few weeks ago that they would be like, yeah, every day there&#39;ll be an announcement, kind of standard campaign stuff. We actually talked about this last episode. This is the cadence of the campaign.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But now they&#39;re saying, ah, maybe three a week. We&#39;re going to change it all up. And that&#39;s different. I mean, it&#39;s not unprecedented in the sense that Doug Ford did a a pretty typical version of this as well. This is happening a lot more, particularly with governments. But what might be unprecedented is literally day two disappearing. Like, I cannot think of a time that has happened. That&#39;s really wild to me. Because at the end of the day, and maybe we can unpack this a bit, elections are supposed to be 28 days of accountability, where we hold a government to account and we consider our options. And the whole name of the game is is availability to voters through the media, right? The idea that you&#39;re out there and you&#39;re just, as the premier, going to talk to voters. I&#39;m doing air quotes.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

You know, we rent them a fucking bus so that they can sleep on the bus and catch up and do their, you know, do their meetings and never have to leave the campaign trail. and instead of doing that type of campaign the tried and true campaign where we are bustling and hustling this campaign has had this isn&#39;t a choice this is something that you have had to do they have had to remove the leader from the media which reaches i don&#39;t know minimum half million people a day minimum the the mainstream media if you were to do and be interviewed by you know know especially by the rebel you know but instead of doing this you&#39;re completely pulled back and now you&#39;re not getting any attention from to those half million people and instead you&#39;re talking to your hyper engaged because that&#39;s all you can talk to because those are the only people coming out to events those are the only people going door knocking those are the only people answering the doors like this is the most asinine quote-unquote strategic decision but it wasn&#39;t a a decision it&#39;s only being done because they had no other choice they know that if they put daniel smith in front of the media it&#39;s another two or three days of a negative story period</span>

But I do believe in a democracy. That&#39;s kind of the bargain, right? Like we just say, like for these 28 days, there&#39;s no hiding. There&#39;s no sleeping. This is what you do. You&#39;re available to people here. And instead, for a bunch of tactical reasons, they&#39;ve decided perhaps it wouldn&#39;t be wise to put Danielle Smith up. Maybe they&#39;ll ask a question. Maybe that answer will be reported on. Maybe that answer is bad for us. We don&#39;t show up. They can&#39;t do it. They don&#39;t show up. People can&#39;t get outraged. If everything stays the way it is, we&#39;re going to win this thing. And really the only guard we have against, and by the way, it&#39;s not just Danielle Smith, like this is happening more, right? This whole general approach is happening more. And the guardrail is supposed to be, we all get mad about it, right? We say, no, accountability is required. You&#39;re not giving it to us. See you later. But instead we are all so, and this is so ironic as a guy who has this podcast, who is talking to people listening to this podcast, but we are all so up the ass of the meta analysis, right? Right. Like, oh, what&#39;s the tactic? And is this a savvy tactic for Daniel Smith?</span>

I can think of a lot of times when I have, like, even for corporate clients, when there&#39;s a Q&amp;A component, been like, that&#39;s good, but that&#39;s not actually what I&#39;m going to put online at the end of it, because that&#39;s not the message I control.

And as a result, we won&#39;t do it. Um, you know, so you could, you could say, Hey, we want, uh, you know, we want the Alberta party. We want the communist party. We want, you know, the liberal party. Do they even have a leader? You know, but we want seven, we want every political party that is running, uh, three candidates in this election to be on the stage.

I think the most obvious one right now at this moment with these particular players is Danielle Smith saying, I want the moderator to be X. And when they say we refuse X, then they say, well, I tried to be reasonable. I offered X plus a moderator of their choosing. And yeah, I chose Derek Fildebrandt from the Western Standard. You know, I think that he&#39;s a very reasonable individual and he would bring an awful lot to the debate. I don&#39;t know why they&#39;re afraid of Derek Fildebrandt. I was willing to accept, you know, Don Braid, their moderator. I mean, I&#39;m just randomly picking a person, but the reality is she can create this equivalency between a mainstream personality on global global television, you know, at PostMedia, and whoever she wants to bring in from the rebel or true north or anything like that, and then almost look like the victim and say, I</span>

And if you only have a couple of questions and you start almost playing a game of chicken saying like, hey, listen, you can waste your question on this.

You know she&#39;s going to say she can&#39;t answer it by not having, you know, when you think about newsworthiness, there&#39;s a few different components you look for, right? Right. Obviously, this has conflict, but this will no longer have timeliness if she pushes it back a couple of days and people will be sitting there going, oh, geez, do I really want to blow it on this one particular question? So, it might not even be an insane strategy. I will say that I personally probably would have recommended something, a</span>

So even though that is out there, it&#39;s filtered out of the cycle before it&#39;s even in there. And your answer is a non-answer to begin with.

Like, we just don&#39;t know. And certainly we do know one thing about the guy, and it&#39;s that he records fucking phone calls. So if there&#39;s other phone calls, that could obviously be a big shoe to drop. he&#39;s also clearly mad and he&#39;s clearly going to be sticking it to the premier insofar as he&#39;s able to do so so like yeah i mean buckle up it&#39;s</span>

One of the things about it is it&#39;s new. And I am sure that they are watching carefully to see its success or not. And so this is a moment where if people push back on it, whether it&#39;s the public or the media in some way, shape, or form, they might bail on it, and they might go to five days a week.

And if you have candidates saying they think the premier should do something different, the leader should do something different.

And you say, hey, Bob, you know what? This is not the call for it. There are 86 other campaign managers here. This has got to be stuff that affects all of us, Bob. So go talk to your field officer, Bob, right? Right. And, and, and so I guess that&#39;s the other tactic I would throw on the table in a big way is say like, this is about all of us. This is not about you. And you have a very interesting story here. Talk to your field officer about it. But we got to talk about the big story here. Would you like to hear the big story here now?

And in that same 2012 campaign, my director of tour, Justin Archer is his name, really great guy, really smart guy. He&#39;d done tour for McGinty in Ontario, like not at like the director level, but he, you know, so he, some of the tools of the trade came back. he had this wall that he created that we called the wall of sherman raj sherman was the leader there and every time there was a photo of raj sherman in one of the major newspapers in the province because of course different era we got them all every morning that</span>
