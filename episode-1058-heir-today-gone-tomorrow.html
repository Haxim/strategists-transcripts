          <p>Zain, Corey and Stephen talk about the mini-media blitz by Mark Carney that has re-spurred conversations about his possible prime ministerial ambitions. And given we heard on a podcast once that he was running in Edmonton Centre, it all sort of makes sense. Plus: FOX News, PSAC deal and much more.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter read the tea leaves on Mark Carney’s visit to the National Liberal Convention (and use it as a jumping off point to discuss how one positions themselves to be a party-leader-in-waiting) before discussing the CRTC holding hearings on FOX News’ place on Canadian airwaves. Does Mark Carney risk wearing out his welcome if he doesn’t take the next step? Do FOX News’ actions require it to be dropped from cable? And why is Corey trying to mess with the immutable science of sign placement? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

And I worry that Mark Carney would give off some of that energy because he&#39;s just so rich and so above it. His life is not like everybody else&#39;s life. And that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t understand everybody else&#39;s life, but it means he&#39;s got to put in the work to understand everybody else&#39;s life.

            <div class="said">Well, yeah, it&#39;s a little of both. And it is actually deeply contextual, right? You have to decide, is this the moment you go for the full brass ring? If I were Mark Carney, I would be thinking maybe I don&#39;t run in the next leadership, but I run to be an MP and position myself in the next one. So there&#39;s still that forward momentum. momentum. If there is really big momentum around you when you announce you&#39;re running, maybe an opportunity presents itself and maybe you take it. But there&#39;s a sequencing that both makes sense and is probably advantageous to you. And you do have to play the course, right? You&#39;ve got to understand what the hell is going to be going on here and what&#39;s likely to happen in an election.</div>

And it&#39;s actually fairly compelling to me to be like, yeah. And so I went into this thing. and I thought I knew what politics was and I fell on my fucking face and I looked like a bit of a fool. But you know what? I entered it for the right reasons. So I dusted myself off. I got back up. I decided then I was going to go and I was going to run as an MP and do this thing right and I was going to move forward. And now I&#39;m ready here on my second go to make this happen.

But I&#39;m excited to be part of a team that&#39;s interested in a big, open, optimistic Canada. One that, by the way, leads international rankings across the board.

Because that calculation is actually what&#39;s going to get you in trouble with the prime minister and his team or the people who don&#39;t like the prime minister.

If you&#39;re trying to avoid saying, yeah, you&#39;re Mark Carney, you actually have more latitude, as I talked about. But to Stephen&#39;s point, just be strategic about it. And if Mark Carney is sitting there with his advisors and saying, yeah, I&#39;m not going to actively take out Justin Trudeau, but I want to signal there&#39;s an option. I want to signal I&#39;m available. And I don&#39;t mind giving him a little bit of a nudge. Then you act one way. And if you&#39;re saying, I&#39;m just going to wait my turn. And when he&#39;s gone, it&#39;s my turn.

            <div class="said">I would have started off with saying we don&#39;t ban speech. This is one of the core principles of being Canadian, We don&#39;t ban speech unless it&#39;s hate speech. Hate speech has a carve-out in Canadian society. We do ban hate speech. And it turns out that that&#39;s what Fox News does. So they are the largest purveyor of hate speech in the Western world, I would argue. And as such, I&#39;m not sure they belong on our public airwaves. So I like the fact that they&#39;re doing a hearing. I like the fact that it&#39;s going through a hearing process. That feels to me to be about the right the right way to do this thing, not just to, you know, to have Justin Trudeau&#39;s liberals, you know, ban us. But this is this is a big question for me.

And if a cable carrier wants to carry Fox News, and they&#39;re fine with putting up with financial penalties, whenever hate speech is aired, then that&#39;s one thing. And, you know, let&#39;s just make it hurt in different ways that do not entirely shut down the voice. That would be my preference.</div>

And what would you be saying if if you were one of the progressive political parties, you know, this is going to clearly be something that energizes the right. This is going to clearly be something that energizes those folks. How do political parties, especially those, this is less of a strategy question, more of like a philosophy question around where, how you think free speech and the left currently co-mingle? Because the history here over the last decade has been fascinating. This is very simplistic, but it used to be the left that was defenders of free speech, especially in certain sort of academic context, and now we&#39;ve kind of seen the right kind of grab the free speech mantle. How do political parties on the left, like the liberals or the NDP, deal with this? Or is it as simple as just kind of saying, this is hate speech, this is like misinformation, disinformation, this is isolated to Fox News? How do they avoid getting into a broader conversation on freedom of speech, perhaps where their viewpoints might not necessarily be aligned or perhaps perhaps too out of touch in in this particular case yeah</div>

            <div class="said">fair position. I&#39;m not disputing the logic of, hey, we created the CRTC and we created these rules for a reason. My personal preference is for more of like an incentive and penalty-based model that allows you to ratchet things up incrementally. and it means that ultimately if a tough action like we don&#39;t want fox news on cable has to be taken that action is being taken by rogers and not by the government of canada like i think that&#39;s just an easier position uh for a lot of reasons and also it really pulls it back to the issue right so what you&#39;re going to have is they say they&#39;re banning fox news because of x but they&#39;re really banning fox news because of y that will be the conversation but it&#39;s</div>

They say they&#39;re penalizing Tucker Carlson for his comments on transgender people, and the fine was for his comments on transgendered people. Like, that&#39;s actually much easier, I think, for a government to kind of take a strong position on and say, yeah, and Fox News, if you don&#39;t want to become a financial burden to your partners, knock that shit off. I mean, I just personally believe more in an incentive model and a penalty model than I do government making these decisions that have such blanket ramifications because they are going to be interpreted so wildly.

The fine was so large, i haven&#39;t seen nipples in 15 years uh poor guy you know like if that&#39;s if that&#39;s the way we want to deal with it and and let&#39;s be clear cory&#39;s point that has been managed super well with a whole bunch of things the words you&#39;re not allowed to say on television have been maintained we have had no problems with with you know now we see effing on tv and stuff like that which is hilarious hilarious but um you</div>

Let&#39;s be real. This is a country of 40 million people in a world of 8 billion. There&#39;s a lot we can learn from people elsewhere, and there&#39;s a lot of good ideas that can trigger other good ideas here in this country.</div>

I do think there needs to be kind of like a, you know, some sympathy and some understanding, and there should be pretty broad latitude to wave things down, reduce payments, all of that to deal with individual circumstances. But I&#39;m out on this kind of blanket approach. I understand that when you&#39;ve paid your taxes and you&#39;ve overpaid, the idea is you get the money back you&#39;ve overpaid and in this situation, you actually owe the government money. So it kind of makes sense on its surface that the government would keep the money. But the reality is the way we all treat tax returns and the way we move through our lives is very different and because we have various uh expenses such as child care that that naturally lend to these like big ongoing tax returns and these tend to come at a time of year when you&#39;re paying your cpp and ei even if you&#39;re making like a hundred thousand dollars a year and whatnot like that money is very useful and it&#39;s planned into people&#39;s budgets and i just think that rather than taking this this approach i</div>

            <div class="said">i truly truly believe if there were errors along these lines every one of these should be bespoke payment plans and the government should just kind of carve it out and not worry about it until you have a payment plan like if you&#39;re dodging the cra talk to me in a year about that but if you are just if you can work out with the cra okay over the next three years i will pay you x number of dollars a month or whatever then i think that&#39;s a much more humane way to deal with this particular challenge</div>
