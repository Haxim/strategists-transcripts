This seems to be a debate that I&#39;m about to really try to put some energy into, Carter. Are you also witnessing what Corey Hogan has witnessed, which is the great, perhaps, remaking of the science of signs?</span>

Corey, Mark Carney is back. He is back in the media. He is back doing interviews. He was on Vashti Capello&#39;s last Sunday. You might be asking, why is this important? Why does this matter? Well, we have done one episode in the past. I&#39;m not going to do an entire episode. but there&#39;s enough time has lapsed that it is probably worthwhile to get back to our buddy Mark. Our buddy Mark is now going to be attending, Carter, the Liberal Convention, the convention in Ottawa that is happening as we speak, that has kicked off from this Thursday heading into the weekend. He&#39;s talking about the fact, listen, I&#39;m going to be there.</span>

Many folks inside still excited about what a Mark Carney candidacy could be. We, you know, have stories, anecdotal and otherwise, of how he was almost going to run for it back in 2014 in the Trudeau era. And his name keeps being floated and floated and floated, Carter. And people like Tom Mulcair and others keep writing about it. And people like Mark Carney himself keep showing up and showing up and showing up. Carter, we got to talk about what he&#39;s up to. We got to talk about what he&#39;s doing right, what he&#39;s doing wrong. He&#39;s going on the listening tour at the convention. His name&#39;s back in the media. We have to talk about a Mark Carney strategy. Carter, let&#39;s start with the fact that this guy, the</span>

Is my read correct that Mark Carney perhaps might be wearing the patience thin on folks that may want his candidacy to go? Or is Is this good strategy? Pop up every now and then, assess if it&#39;s the right time, duck back undercover, wait six months, a year, come back. What what is this good strategy? Or is Mark Carney starting to earn a reputation for himself in some way?</span>

It&#39;s not like he&#39;s he&#39;s threatened to run for the leadership and then not run since, you know, since Justin Trudeau became the leader, because hasn&#39;t been any leaderships. um you know he popped up prior to the last election we thought maybe he was going to run in edmonton center certainly that&#39;s what we heard on a podcast and that that gave us was it edmonton center it was edmonton center yeah yeah the the the point of the of him popping back and forth and the point of um you know articles</span>

He says things like, and I&#39;ll get into some of his comments, because I think the way he answered a few of them are interesting. But top line, popping in and out, good strategy? Or are you wearing patience thin and just kind of like annoying people that you&#39;re not actually moving anything forward after the sort of secret is out, buddy, that you want this job?</span>

I don&#39;t feel exactly the way Stephen does about it I&#39;ll say this it is a classic like if you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going you might end up someplace else and if he actually wants to be leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister someday I can understand some of the moves he&#39;s made but if he&#39;s just looking for like the the stroke then some of them make a little bit less sense but the reason why I don&#39;t feel exactly the same way Stephen does is is it&#39;s not as though since uh Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister there haven&#39;t been opportunities for Mark Carney to get more deeply involved in politics in</span>

But I am going to be the savior of the Liberal Party in the country by me, this guy who&#39;s done all of these things that are so much better running for prime minister.

And I worry that Mark Carney would give off some of that energy because he&#39;s just so rich and so above it. His life is not like everybody else&#39;s life. And that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t understand everybody else&#39;s life, but it means he&#39;s got to put in the work to understand everybody else&#39;s life. And he&#39;s got to expose himself to politics on a more retail level before he decides, I&#39;d be a great prime minister. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">I want to go back to this concept of suffering setbacks. But Corey, I want to give you a shot at the same question. You are the, of course, the proponent of the contextual lawn sign strategy. Are you also the proponent of the contextual run when it benefits you, run when you understand the full opportunity strategy?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, yeah, it&#39;s a little of both. And it is actually deeply contextual, right? You have to decide, is this the moment you go for the full brass ring? If I were Mark Carney, I would be thinking maybe I don&#39;t run in the next leadership, but I run to be an MP and position myself in the next one. So there&#39;s still that forward momentum. momentum. If there is really big momentum around you when you announce you&#39;re running, maybe an opportunity presents itself and maybe you take it. But there&#39;s a sequencing that both makes sense and is probably advantageous to you. And you do have to play the course, right? You&#39;ve got to understand what the hell is going to be going on here and what&#39;s likely to happen in an election.</span>

And there&#39;s a good chance that no matter what you you do pierre poliev is going to wake up as prime minister one day just because that&#39;s that&#39;s how it often goes but you know on this on this question of like success and failure and whether it</span>

Abe Lincoln, of course, is another famous one who failed, failed, failed, and then succeeded. Diefenbaker failed, then succeeded. It happens.</span>

These are great examples, Corey, but I guess the Carney example, what&#39;s interesting to me is that this one is someone who, at least on paper, not knowing the full sort of context of the bio, is someone who succeeded, succeeded, succeeded, succeeded.

And nobody wants the story with like the Mary Sue character who never loses and wins at everything. Like there&#39;s got to be an arc to Mark Carney. And it&#39;s actually fairly compelling to me to be like, yeah. And so I went into this thing. and I thought I knew what politics was and I fell on my fucking face and I looked like a bit of a fool. But you know what? I entered it for the right reasons. So I dusted myself off. I got back up. I decided then I was going to go and I was going to run as an MP and do this thing right and I was going to move forward. And now I&#39;m ready here on my second go to make this happen. Or whatever, if you fail, right? But I think that failure could be a powerful part of his story.</span>

I mean, I remember Jim Prentice&#39;s campaign for leader of the PCs in, what is that, 2004, somewhere around there. Federally, yeah.

You know, that was on his campaign stuff just to show people that, you know, while he had made something of himself, while he had succeeded, I think, beyond most people&#39;s wildest dreams, you know, he still had that those roots. And I think you could see that even with Carney because Carney still got things to pull from. I mean, he comes from Edmonton. That&#39;s got to hurt, you know, so he&#39;s shots</span>

Like, would you have talked about, here&#39;s the three or four things I care about, and that&#39;s why I support the government. Here&#39;s what they&#39;ve done, things that are aligned potentially to your leadership ambitions. ambitions. You know, would you have gone more fucky like you had been like more snipey? What would you have kind of done with that with that template, perhaps building off what Mark said, and iterating on it, or perhaps throwing it all out?</span>

            <span class="text">No, I think I listen, at its core, it&#39;s a good answer. It&#39;s to say Canada is a great place. This government&#39;s a great government. Can Canada improve? Sure. Can this government improve? Sure. Improvement is always possible. And I think that pursuit of improvement is what makes the Liberal Party special. When you think about the Conservative Party, it&#39;s always about tearing things down, going backwards, getting defensive. But I&#39;m excited to be part of a team that&#39;s interested in a big, open, optimistic Canada. One that, by the way, leads international rankings across the board. So you ask me, am I there for the Prime Minister? Am I there against Pierre Poiliev? Yes and yes.

Or is that just too overblown a political fear in that regard? Because that nervousness, that anxiety always exists. Like, right, one of the reasons he probably has taken this rather than full-throated approach, this is not a guy who can&#39;t communicate, right? But he&#39;s taken this measured approach, probably for that clippability in the future, or probably for some sort of like, well, I don&#39;t want to tie myself too much to the prime minister, given all his his baggage, and given the fact that this could be a change election, etc., etc., you can get in your head that way, or you could call that strategy.

This question of overthinking, is that what&#39;s going on in how you see folks assessing the political terrain, or maybe conflating strategy for what it&#39;s not and just overanalyzing certain things? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I think it&#39;s always dangerous when you see a candidate and a prospective candidate&#39;s wheels turning. And I think ultimately what you&#39;ve described to me is something that is clear. The wheels were turning. He was choosing his answer very judiciously. And that&#39;s a dangerous place to be, right? Because that calculation is actually what&#39;s going to get you in trouble with the prime minister and his team or the people who don&#39;t like the prime minister. And really, you should be thinking about these things more in terms of baseline expectations. And yeah, like, don&#39;t sweat.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">fuck&#39;s that going to do? Right? That is the expected answer. And so when you think about baseline expectations, act within them, right? And so, hey, there&#39;s a leader of this party. You&#39;re going to this party&#39;s convention. Do you support this person? You can say, yeah. That&#39;s not a concern. If you&#39;re trying to avoid saying, yeah, you&#39;re Mark Carney, you actually have more latitude, as I talked about. But to Stephen&#39;s point, just be strategic about it. And if Mark Carney is sitting there with his advisors and saying, yeah, I&#39;m not going to actively take out Justin Trudeau, but I want to signal there&#39;s an option. I want to signal I&#39;m available. And I don&#39;t mind giving him a little bit of a nudge. Then you act one way. And if you&#39;re saying, I&#39;m just going to wait my turn. And when he&#39;s gone, it&#39;s my turn. You act a different way. but you don&#39;t sit there and try to have your cake and eat it too by supporting not supporting because you&#39;re just going to piss off everybody doing that don&#39;t let them see the wheels turn act either</span>

            <span class="text">I would have started off with saying we don&#39;t ban speech. This is one of the core principles of being Canadian, We don&#39;t ban speech unless it&#39;s hate speech. Hate speech has a carve-out in Canadian society. We do ban hate speech. And it turns out that that&#39;s what Fox News does. So they are the largest purveyor of hate speech in the Western world, I would argue. And as such, I&#39;m not sure they belong on our public airwaves. So I like the fact that they&#39;re doing a hearing. I like the fact that it&#39;s going through a hearing process. That feels to me to be about the right the right way to do this thing, not just to, you know, to have Justin Trudeau&#39;s liberals, you know, ban us. But this is this is a big question for me. And it&#39;s something that, you</span>

And if a cable carrier wants to carry Fox News, and they&#39;re fine with putting up with financial penalties, whenever hate speech is aired, then that&#39;s one thing. And, you know, let&#39;s just make it hurt in different ways that do not entirely shut down the voice. That would be my preference.</span>

And what would you be saying if if you were one of the progressive political parties, you know, this is going to clearly be something that energizes the right. This is going to clearly be something that energizes those folks. How do political parties, especially those, this is less of a strategy question, more of like a philosophy question around where, how you think free speech and the left currently co-mingle? Because the history here over the last decade has been fascinating. This is very simplistic, but it used to be the left that was defenders of free speech, especially in certain sort of academic context, and now we&#39;ve kind of seen the right kind of grab the free speech mantle. How do political parties on the left, like the liberals or the NDP, deal with this? Or is it as simple as just kind of saying, this is hate speech, this is like misinformation, disinformation, this is isolated to Fox News? How do they avoid getting into a broader conversation on freedom of speech, perhaps where their viewpoints might not necessarily be aligned or perhaps perhaps too out of touch in in this particular case yeah</span>

If the speech is against our rules, then here is the way that we do it. Janet Jackson showed a nipple. The fine was so large, i haven&#39;t seen nipples in 15 years uh poor guy you know like if that&#39;s if that&#39;s the way we want to deal with it and and let&#39;s be clear cory&#39;s point that has been managed super well with a whole bunch of things the words you&#39;re not allowed to say on television have been maintained we have had no problems with with you know now we see effing on tv and stuff like that which is hilarious hilarious but um you</span>

Let&#39;s be real. This is a country of 40 million people in a world of 8 billion. There&#39;s a lot we can learn from people elsewhere, and there&#39;s a lot of good ideas that can trigger other good ideas here in this country.</span>

But hey, how about, you know let&#39;s talk to some people in france and give them a little bit more profile why don&#39;t we talk to some people in africa in asia and i know that the answer is because they&#39;re also trying to create a media event that gets the public&#39;s attention and hillary clinton will do that</span>

I do think there needs to be kind of like a, you know, some sympathy and some understanding, and there should be pretty broad latitude to wave things down, reduce payments, all of that to deal with individual circumstances. But I&#39;m out on this kind of blanket approach. I understand that when you&#39;ve paid your taxes and you&#39;ve overpaid, the idea is you get the money back you&#39;ve overpaid and in this situation, you actually owe the government money. So it kind of makes sense on its surface that the government would keep the money. But the reality is the way we all treat tax returns and the way we move through our lives is very different and because we have various uh expenses such as child care that that naturally lend to these like big ongoing tax returns and these tend to come at a time of year when you&#39;re paying your cpp and ei even if you&#39;re making like a hundred thousand dollars a year and whatnot like that money is very useful and it&#39;s planned into people&#39;s budgets and i just think that rather than taking this this approach i</span>
