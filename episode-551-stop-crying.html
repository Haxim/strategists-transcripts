            <span class="text">well this is the nature of the end days of campaigns everything becomes ultra compressed we&#39;re all of a sudden going through news cycles at three four times the regular cadence so it&#39;s sure like i i get it you know yeah it sure feels like a lot&#39;s happened since we last talked it was only a week ago but you</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">another day another wedge well let&#39;s just start it off with that with our first segment cold pressing the lowest hanging fruit guys the muslim issue and the muslim question seems to be one that is dominating the campaign and we started off with the syrian refugee crisis tangentially related to this issue We moved on to the niqab, to the citizenship. We moved on to barbaric cultural practices, which I know, Corey, for you really just was, I guess for both of us, was really the issue that got us. And now we have doubling down on niqab and headscarves on public services. is. The question I want to ask you is, despite</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">despite all this, how the hell are the conservatives up? How are they maintaining? How are they up? How are they winning votes? I want to get to the bottom of that and just plain English because that&#39;s what&#39;s baffling myself and a lot of people who message us online and be like, what&#39;s going on?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, this is one of those issues that I don&#39;t know how many people vote on it, but that&#39;s almost the point. There are bigots in the world, unfortunately. There are even more people who probably haven&#39;t thought enough about this to realize just how offensive their point of view could be considered from another frame and i think given enough time they will come to conclusions that are much more aligned with canadian values but i i think this is really a really great showcase of linton crosby and how he manages to distract people with these issues so there is this notion that he has that if you&#39;re at a dinner party and all of a sudden the conversation is turning against you well then stop having the conversation throw a dead cat on the table because all of a sudden they&#39;ll be talking about the cat they won&#39;t be talking about whatever it was that was causing you concern before and this is a dead cat like we&#39;re talking about the niqab i think not necessarily because it&#39;s some well it is well first of all it is it&#39;s a very bigoted wedge but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re talking about it we&#39;re talking about it because it is one of those things that not a lot of people vote on they can have this conversation and as much as a lot of us will be pulling our hair out about it there is a number of canadians who are like yeah you know i don&#39;t feel strongly one way or the other and here we are Now we&#39;re moving through the campaign, and guess what we&#39;re not talking about, guys? The economy, Dean Del Mastro, Mike Duffy, Canada standing in the world, any of the things that the conservatives could be absolutely hung on. The</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Remember that? Remember that little nugget that we were going to actually have the election on? The economy. We haven&#39;t spoken about that for weeks, and we&#39;re not going to speak about it again.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, this dead cat on the table, as you&#39;re describing it, is very effective. What I&#39;m fascinated about, what I actually wanted to find out, is are there any conservatives out there who&#39;ve changed their minds as a result of this issue? So we know of some friends of ours who are</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">particularly enamored with this style of campaigning. Correct. That are conservatives, that are disappointed.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Just disappointed? Just disappointed. Well, they&#39;re still</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They haven&#39;t changed their minds. They haven&#39;t found it within them to vote for Justin Trudeau. All they did was say, well, that&#39;s really disappointing, and I&#39;m not going to vote for</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for the other guys, but I&#39;m going to be sad when I vote. This is what I think is amazing. We are looking at this issue from our lens. This, to me, is a disgusting form of politics. I hate the way that this issue is being rolled out. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I hate the fact that we&#39;re picking on a very, very small subset of people. I hate this kind of divisionary tactic. And here we go. We&#39;re going to go down it. I don&#39;t think this is on the side of right and goodness, which is when, you know, I got accused of doing divisionary politics in 2012 for picking on, you know, Hunsberger&#39;s legitimate Christian view that all gays will burn in the lake of fire. You</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a legitimate Christian view. I was able to pick on it. I don&#39;t think that attacking people for wearing the niqab is also a legitimate view. So where the hell is the punchback from the liberals, the NDP, the Greens pushing back on this issue the way we pushed back on Hunsberger&#39;s hate?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Why is no one pushing back on the hate?</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">hate? Well, let&#39;s talk about one person that has pushed back, and that has been throughout this instance, probably the most popular political figure in the country, and Mayor Nahid Nenshi, our mayor here, has pushed back vocally against Jason Kenney, against the Conservative Party.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, because of exactly what I told you. They don&#39;t want to be talking about this issue, and it&#39;s not because they think they&#39;re wrong about the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">the issue. But is there not an ability to broaden this to a values conversation,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, great. And what does that get you? And are they going to win on values? And is anybody going to vote on values? The fact of the matter is, anytime they&#39;re not talking about the economy, anytime they&#39;re not talking about corruption, about Mike Duffy, about the changes to our international stature, they&#39;re talking about things the conservatives want them to be talking about. Yeah, I get it. I fucking hate what the conservatives have done on this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It drives me nuts. But every minute I spend talking about it is a minute the conservatives are winning. Well, listen, I mean, I&#39;ll confess</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">confess as a Muslim, this has been a very tough situation going on radio and television talking about this and, you know, and trying to parse out what I feel as a person who&#39;s a Canadian and a Muslim at the same time versus someone who&#39;s there to talk about political strategy and how this candidate and this party are still up. So I&#39;m going to challenge you on that, Corey and Carter. You both think this is a distraction. is this is there any way that the conservatives are trying to play this on principle something that they try to to demonstrate to the people that we are about security that we are about secularism that we&#39;re about trying to equal the playing field by going after this</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s the worst kind you know i I was talking to my wife yesterday and she was saying, I don&#39;t think Jason Kenney is a racist. Well, I&#39;ll tell you what, I think the distinction between somebody who&#39;s a racist and is willing to play the race card for benefit is there is no distinction. It&#39;s</span>

And I&#39;ll call a spade a spade on this one. That&#39;s just the facts. And where I think that the conservatives should be concerned is that no conservative is going going to look back on this campaign with pride in their heart carter</span>

There&#39;s groups from each, um, those conservatives we talked about who are very disappointed, but you know, they&#39;re going to vote for the conservative party anyways, is because the conservatives have done a great job over the past few years of convincing their base that it&#39;s them or ruin. Right. Right. And it&#39;s amazing to me just how far they&#39;ve been able to push that concept that some very good people I know are like, well, I&#39;ve still got to stick with them because, you know, chaos with Justin Trudeau. I mean, I can&#39;t even go down that road any further. It&#39;ll just make me mad. But there&#39;s a lot of things at play here, not least of which is this doesn&#39;t matter to a lot of people. When people think about it briefly, they actually tend to side with the conservatives and that there&#39;s a broader conservative crusade that this is wrapped up. Stephen,</span>

What does this issue do to them? Is it all goodwill gone right now if I&#39;m Jason Kenney, the guy that&#39;s built up this infrastructure? And where do the conservatives stand here?

And that&#39;s all that they&#39;ve been reading into it and saying, this is fine. I mean, yeah, of course, there&#39;s such things as Canadian values. Of course, you should not be able to wear the niqab. And then as soon as someone tells you something like, well, wait, since when did the majority get to decide what the minority needed to protect its rights? A very simple statement that clicks a light bulb on a lot of people. Or, you know, isn&#39;t telling someone what not to wear as oppressive as someone telling them what to To where like stuff like that, people have not thought this through.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s talk local campaigns. The national campaign is going to be doing their thing, and they&#39;re going to be sending emails out to supporters trying to encourage everybody to go volunteer and whatnot. not but fundamentally a local campaign has a limited communications focus it&#39;s just getting a few lit pieces out maybe some billboards or whatnot and it has a a very large what we call ground game focus</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and i think most people are familiar with the ground game but it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s easy to lose track of why people are knocking on doors it&#39;s not to convince somebody that your candidate&#39;s the guy it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s to convince somebody that they should tell you who you&#39;re voting for because Who is your guy if my guy isn&#39;t? Yeah, well, okay. So ultimately campaigns are about two functions, right? Identifying a vote and then getting that vote out on election day. And I&#39;m going to give you a bit of a real world example here. In 2008, I was helping out on a campaign of a liberal MLA here in Calgary who was an incumbent. And the turnout in that particular riding was 35%. On our identified vote list, we were able to get the turnout of those people. And because you can tell because on election day you go and you&#39;re watching them check off everybody on the list.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">got the turnout of the identified vote to 80%. The entire margin of victory was just encouraging people to vote who already agreed with us, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that&#39;s the mechanics of a traditional ground game. Now, there is nuance. And obviously, candidates do all sorts of things to try to gain an advantage and whatnot. The candidate is more successful at changing people&#39;s minds at the doors. The very fact you&#39;ve seen a campaign has a measurable impact on how people are going to vote. But ultimately, and this is a mistake that I think novice campaigners make, if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">if you get roped into a conversation at the door about a vote and it&#39;s taking you more than 35 seconds, you&#39;re doing it wrong. You lost that voter. Yeah, I mean, just move on. You have any</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">any idea how many times we&#39;ve sat down and tried to explain to volunteers and candidates to stop trying to convince people to vote for you, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? Right. That convincing of someone to vote for you is going to happen more likely through social networks, through peer-to-peer contact, through television advertising, through the leader, through how the overall national campaign is working. The reality is it&#39;s about identifying vote that could come out for you and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, and think about it from a simple psychological standpoint. point somebody says they disagree with you you instantly disengage they can be persuaded on the back corner but if you are going out and you&#39;re having an argument with them and you&#39;re going on for a few minutes what you&#39;ve done i mean everybody here like you know we&#39;re married zane you&#39;ve got a fiancee like how well does that work you start an argument and people entrench right they absolutely just you&#39;ve got a decouple and you&#39;ve got to come back at it from a different angle which is why on the doors it&#39;s just about identification and move on listen</span>

Number two, it&#39;s about mobilizing them. So all of the efforts that have led to the last 10 days is identifying. Tell me what the steps are that the campaigns under our feet right now in this city and in provinces across the country are working on right now to get that GOTV or get out the vote infrastructure going.
