          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan break down the niqab debate - and its impact on Canadians. Are the Conservatives just running a fear campaign? What are parties doing right now to get out the vote? And who put that dead cat on the table? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

We moved on to barbaric cultural practices, which I know, Corey, for you really just was, I guess for both of us, was really the issue that got us. And now we have doubling down on niqab and headscarves on public services. is. The question I want to ask you is, despite</div>

There are even more people who probably haven&#39;t thought enough about this to realize just how offensive their point of view could be considered from another frame and i think given enough time they will come to conclusions that are much more aligned with canadian values but i i think this is really a really great showcase of linton crosby and how he manages to distract people with these issues so there is this notion that he has that if you&#39;re at a dinner party and all of a sudden the conversation is turning against you well then stop having the conversation throw a dead cat on the table because all of a sudden they&#39;ll be talking about the cat they won&#39;t be talking about whatever it was that was causing you concern before and this is a dead cat like we&#39;re talking about the niqab i think not necessarily because it&#39;s some well it is well first of all it is it&#39;s a very bigoted wedge but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re talking about it we&#39;re talking about it because it is one of those things that not a lot of people vote on they can have this conversation and as much as a lot of us will be pulling our hair out about it there is a number of canadians who are like yeah you know i don&#39;t feel strongly one way or the other and here we are Now we&#39;re moving through the campaign, and guess what we&#39;re not talking about, guys? The economy, Dean Del Mastro, Mike Duffy, Canada standing in the world, any of the things that the conservatives could be absolutely hung on. The</div>

So I&#39;m going to challenge you on that, Corey and Carter. You both think this is a distraction. is this is there any way that the conservatives are trying to play this on principle something that they try to to demonstrate to the people that we are about security that we are about secularism that we&#39;re about trying to equal the playing field by going after this</div>

Right. Right. And it&#39;s amazing to me just how far they&#39;ve been able to push that concept that some very good people I know are like, well, I&#39;ve still got to stick with them because, you know, chaos with Justin Trudeau. I mean, I can&#39;t even go down that road any further. It&#39;ll just make me mad. But there&#39;s a lot of things at play here, not least of which is this doesn&#39;t matter to a lot of people.

I want to talk about a little bit with relation to the ethnic vote and what this does for the Conservatives. They have put in what many would consider to be many years of blood, sweat, and tears in trying to court the ethnic vote, various religious votes across the country, new Canadian votes. What does this issue do to them? Is it all goodwill gone right now if I&#39;m Jason Kenney, the guy that&#39;s built up this infrastructure? And where do the conservatives stand here? Have they turned their backs on a constituency they&#39;ve tried to build for so many years? Carter, I&#39;ll go with you first. Well,</div>

A very simple statement that clicks a light bulb on a lot of people.

So ultimately campaigns are about two functions, right? Identifying a vote and then getting that vote out on election day. And I&#39;m going to give you a bit of a real world example here. In 2008, I was helping out on a campaign of a liberal MLA here in Calgary who was an incumbent. And the turnout in that particular riding was 35%. On our identified vote list, we were able to get the turnout of those people. And because you can tell because on election day you go and you&#39;re watching them check off everybody on the list.</div>

And obviously, candidates do all sorts of things to try to gain an advantage and whatnot. The candidate is more successful at changing people&#39;s minds at the doors.
