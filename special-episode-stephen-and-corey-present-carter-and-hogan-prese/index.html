        <p>Zain Velji is on assignment in the United Kingdom so Stephen and Corey take the opportunity to talk about Alberta's essay contest fiasco and debate how likely Danielle Smith and Pierre Poilievre are to win their respective leaderships. PLUS: fucking Donald Trump, amirite?</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen and Corey discuss an essay contest in Alberta that became an international embarrassment, how presumptive the front-runners are in the UCP and Conservative Party of Canada leadership contests - and what Donald Trump's no-good, very-bad week could mean for America. How could an essay with such awful views on women and diversity win third place? Could mishandling nuclear secrets tank Trump? And is anybody else excited for when the copyright expires on all The Strategists' podcasts? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here.</em></p></blockquote>
