I ask you whether on a strategy scale of, Corey, what does it start at? It starts at one, Corey, all the way to 10. You&#39;re going to give me how good the strategy was. And then I&#39;m going to ask you there on after, if you were in the shoes of that political party or that leader or that person, what would you have done or said differently? So we&#39;re always going to try to make it better, course correct, try to help some of these strategic plays. And there&#39;s been a handful of them over the course of this past week. So without further ado, Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on the first round. You are first for us here. And let&#39;s start here. Let&#39;s start with Justin Trudeau. So Justin Trudeau has been going on several campaign stops across the country. He has been obviously</span>

            <span class="text">But Canadians, the vast majority of Canadians are not represented by them. He says that looking at them in the distance and their volume getting louder and louder. And I will not allow those voices, those special interest groups, those protesters, I don&#39;t want to even call them protesters, those anti-vaxxer mobs to dictate how this country gets through the pandemic. Stephen Carter, Justin Trudeau, accelerating or elevating his language, being much more assertive, calling these groups anti-vaxxer mobs. On a strategy scale, from what you see, where this story is going, on a 1 to 10, what would you give it? And then follow thereafter. What would you say or do differently if you were writing those words for Justin Trudeau? So first on the strategy scale, and then what would you have said or done differently if you were Justin Trudeau in this situation?</span>

First of all, by you talking about it in these terms, you&#39;ve got no escalation point from here, which means you&#39;ve got a bit of the boy who cries wolf problem. If somebody actually does create a bit of a mob here, it&#39;s just an unruly bunch of protesters. The other is you make it more obviously political when you talk about it in these terms as the prime minister. I agree with Stephen to an extent that you don&#39;t want to be giving them this kind of oxygen. I think it&#39;s tough because, of course, the reporters are going to put microphones in your face and say, what do you think of this? What&#39;s going on? What do you think of these people?</span>

Which way would they go now knowing that Justin Trudeau had a strategic card, which was going to be trying to tell the red-orange switchers to come over to red? Well, here&#39;s what we&#39;re hearing right now this weekend. We&#39;re hearing it quite a bit, which is, vote with your heart. There is no possible way, right? I&#39;m paraphrasing a bunch of tweets from what I quote-unquote progressive surrogates. There&#39;s no possible way O&#39;Toole&#39;s going to get a majority. And there&#39;s no possible way Jagmeet Singh and the NDP are going to support an O&#39;Toole minority, which means vote with your heart. Do what you want. Vote splitting is not real this time. Vote for the party you actually want to win. Corey, I&#39;m starting with you. On a strategy scale of 1 to 10, and I will be very clear, I&#39;m not attributing this directly to the NDP, but I do want to assess the strategic take. What do you think? And then based on what you heard, what would you say or do instead as an even informal or unauthorized surrogate strategy, if that is indeed your motive to get folks to stick with the orange rather than shift over to the red?</span>

You know, vote the way you want to vote, though. If we sort of say that&#39;s more the principle that&#39;s here, it&#39;s like, don&#39;t vote the way you think you have to vote. Vote the way you want to vote. You&#39;re able to do that.</span>

            <span class="text">It is okay. Obviously, it&#39;s backed up a bit by some of the polling numbers out there, not least of which is the approval rating for Singh is pretty good. And the approval rating for Trudeau is pretty not good. But obviously, it&#39;s not entirely true, because it&#39;s quite possible in a local riding to get a vote split that allows the conservatives to win with 40% of the vote or 38% of the vote or whatever it is. Instead of having a progressive candidate of any flavor, you&#39;ll get a conservative. That&#39;s absolutely possible.</span>

A letter written by Jagmeet Singh to Trudeau, O&#39;Toole, Blanchet and Annamie Paul has a bunch of writing, including the following paragraph going to read to you. Next Wednesday, September 8th, we will all be in Ottawa in advance of the first consortium debate. Let&#39;s put partisanship aside and stand together and record a message to be shared with all Canadians. We must tell Canadians, quote, if you are eligible, you should get vaccinated, unquote, as federal leaders. It is our job to lead and unite the country during these challenging times. We owe this to the frontline workers, nurses, doctors, health care workers. I&#39;m confident if we remain focused helping people, we&#39;ll get through this. We&#39;re so close.

That&#39;s a choice. choice um but i think that right now i mean there&#39;s a there&#39;s a few threads on twitter that say that justin trudeau wants these protests to happen that he wants this type of activity and maybe sing didn&#39;t want to kind of play into that um those</span>

Conservative leader Aaron O&#39;Toole and his top campaign aide are trying to distance themselves from one of the country&#39;s controversial firearms lobby groups after the Liberals tried to attack the Tories for striking some sort of, quote unquote, deal with what the Liberals refer to as the gun lobby. Quote, I&#39;m the leader and will have an approach focused on public safety, focus on maintaining restrictions in place, and having a review of our classification system that removes the politics from this, the politics that Mr. Trudeau always tries to employ to mislead and divide people, unquote, O&#39;Toole said. who formerly was part of this firearms association are trying to now distance themselves from this particular group.</span>

Then I don&#39;t even know. No, I mean, it&#39;s so baffling to me because the most obvious way to not have the last four days that he&#39;s had is why is this in the platform at all?

Because it implies a threat that maybe we don&#39;t see and the polling must be telling them something different. And actually, I think that the polling is telling them something different because we&#39;re starting to see a real rise out of the PPC. see uh the the videos out of the uh interior of british columbia today uh with max bernier uh and his his his uh his loonies his lunacy tour um were kind of staggering um and i think that the three things were for me conscious rights conversion therapy and guns uh why do you have to put those in if you don&#39;t feel a need to protect your right wing flank or your base depending on on how how</span>

We&#39;re seeing also Max Bernier, who has no business polling at the levels that he&#39;s polling at, start to switch. And it doesn&#39;t take very long. I mean, we&#39;ve been talking about the the the vote split between the the liberals in the NDP, or the vote sharing, if you will, it doesn&#39;t take very long for the PPC to start moving up. And all of a sudden, ridings like Calgary Confederation become in play. Edmonton Mill Woods, Edmonton Centre, Calgary Centre, Calgary Skyview, those are just the ones in our province. You take eight to 10% in these areas and tag it on to the PPC candidate. And all of a of a sudden, things are getting very interesting.</span>

It&#39;s you didn&#39;t win enough votes to win. You didn&#39;t earn enough votes to win. Maybe they felt that this is a way that they had to make sure that they could retain some of these votes. And by watching the polling that&#39;s going on with with Max Bernier, they may be right.</span>

And now we&#39;re heading into the stretch that the pundit class has been saying, oh, this is the final two weeks. This is when everyone pays attention.

            <span class="text">And in Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s case, they&#39;ll have an extra sentence to read. But Corey, what do the liberals need to do to maybe not make this a vote getter, but to perhaps leverage this moment of the last four days, which have been pretty good for them in putting O&#39;Toole on his heels to electoral success or to, you know, putting numbers on the board, so to speak.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the Liberals talk about forward, not backward. It&#39;s pretty clear they think that this is their ballot question. But really, in some ways, they don&#39;t even mean back to what Canada used to be. They just mean like retrograde, regressive, you know, bad policies, something that&#39;s more akin to this American version of conservatism, right? And so in that sense, I think the gun issue, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it plays into a narrative. We all watch the, you know, the situation in the United States with horror, right? You have something like Sandy Hook happen. You have something like the Pulse nightclub shooting. I mean, there&#39;s no shortage of shootings. I feel like the minute I start a list, I&#39;m just going to be missing massive shootings that are out there, Las Vegas, you name it. And I think</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think they wouldn&#39;t mind if people thought, well, this is that Americanization. And this is this NRA approach to things coming north of the border. And that&#39;s Aaron O&#39;Toole. And that&#39;s what the conservatives represent. So in that sense, yeah, maybe reinforcing of an overall narrative about the conservatives they are trying to create here. Right. Right. But the issue itself, guns, is just it&#39;s interesting to me. It&#39;s it&#39;s never been clear to me that it&#39;s something that people care a ton about because it hasn&#39;t been a big flashpoint short of the long gun registry in this country. Right. I mean, the liberals is not new. The liberals had their ban on assault weapons. Whether it was that 15 or was that 19?</span>

The overall trend continues to support the Conservatives. I would argue that he, Aaron O&#39;Toole, that being has stalled out perhaps as a result of this, right? You&#39;re not seeing the… Halt of the momentum, perhaps. The climb, halt of the momentum. Certainly, it&#39;s not the thing he wanted to be talking about for the past four days.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And at the start of the campaign, they had a poll that said 36% thought Trudeau had a hidden agenda. 26% thought O&#39;Toole had a hidden agenda. And that was a bit of a shocking number because normally the conservatives are the ones seen to have this quote unquote hidden agenda. It&#39;s actually what we&#39;re sort of talking about here. There is an argument to be made that liberals are having some success here because, well, there are still more Canadians that believe Trudeau has a hidden agenda than O&#39;Toole. That gap has shrunk. It is no longer or a 10-point gap. It&#39;s a four-point gap in the most recent poll that Ipsos did here, right? So 36% still believe Trudeau has a hidden agenda, but now 32% do for O&#39;Toole. So, and that was run 27th to the 30th, and that didn&#39;t really capture a lot of what we&#39;re talking about here in this conversation. That&#39;s probably more likely the result of healthcare, if anything, right? So they may be making some ground here, but where the liberals have to be careful is that we do do have a couple of debates that are coming up here that will be these events that allow us to really see the leaders and see the leaders define themselves. And I just don&#39;t think O&#39;Toole is going to come off as a crazy right winger. There&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve seen from him in this campaign that suggests that he will. And with these two weeks to go, if the hypothesis is correct that people are not as clued in before Labor Day as now, I</span>

It has O&#39;Toole in a montage saying, take Canada back, take back Canada, take back Canada, presumably from his leadership run. And then it has a voiceover with some imagery and headlines that says O&#39;Toole wants to take Canada back to private health care, assault weapons, abortion, and denial on climate change. Carter, I want to start with you. This liberal spot, and more specifically the message, 1 to 10, what would you give it?

But I want to give you the chance because you may be on the same wavelength as Carter. On one to 10, based on this ad that you see, what would you give it? What would you have said or done differently? And I&#39;ll just highlight the focal points again, right? It was health care, assault weapons, abortion and climate change.</span>

And it is a way that I think the conservatives are still fairly retrograde compared to their competitors. competitors on the other ones i feel like there are arguments that they&#39;ve been misinterpreted misread or torqued certainly on abortion certainly on private health care maybe on assault weapons depends on your read of that issue which gets muddier by the moment as as everybody talks about it right and so i don&#39;t know if i would have thrown in like what is like an obvious slam dunk with a couple of things that are a little dodgy because you may just sort of pollute all of them right like did you see that ad about erin o&#39;toole man pretty damning right yeah but did you you know that private health care thing got a manipulated warning on twitter did you know that abortion thing was on sex selective abortion specifically not on abortion overall and the conservatives have said they wouldn&#39;t reopen the question did you know the assault weapon thing is really about class that&#39;s the weaker one but the classification but like that my point is i</span>

Because the only one that actually sort of 100% truly is, is the climate change one. And so in that sense, I don&#39;t love it. But it is certainly hard hitting. It is certainly direct.

We&#39;ve just learned today the framework for the debate that&#39;s going to be happening on Thursday evening, the English language debate. To remind folks, this is a debate put on by the consortium of news and media outlets. We&#39;re learning a couple of things. We&#39;re learning that there&#39;s five themes to the debate affordability climate covid recovery leadership and accountability and reconciliation so once again affordability climate covid recovery leadership and accountability that&#39;s one and reconciliation and then here&#39;s the format i want to actually lay out the format to you guys too because i want you to view this from the lens of the</span>

In each of those five segments in this two-hour debate, a question from a voter, the question from a moderator slash journalist to each leader, leader to leader, three out of five, and then open debate for all five. Now, we can nerd out on this, but I want to get it from the perspective. And Carter, Carter, let me start with you.

They can like, you know, but when we go to a town hall, what&#39;s the first thing that we do? Hold our head in our hands when the when the questions from the floor start, because the questions from the floor aren&#39;t what I want. But more important, it&#39;s about having how many voices and when every voice that you&#39;re putting on the stage, every voice that you&#39;re bringing into this debate diminishes from the voices of the actual leaders. leaders and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the group that i&#39;m interested in hearing i want to hear from the leaders themselves i don&#39;t want to hear from every journalist who&#39;s ever been on parliament hill and i don&#39;t want to hear from the general population the journalists if they want to can ask a question from the general population but you know why they would never do it you know why they have to put the general pop in because their journalists know their shit questions this is not something and And the other thing, the debate amongst themselves, the debate amongst themselves turns into bullshit in about 12 and a half seconds. Let everybody speak. Let everybody be heard. Don&#39;t worry about debate about themselves. That is not a skill that we are looking for in the prime minister of Canada.</span>

Based on surging cases at the lowest vaccination rate in the country, Alberta will begin paying $100 to people who get a first or second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Premier Jason Kenney announced Friday this is part of a suite of new measures announced by the province, including making masks mandatory for all indoor public spaces starting yesterday, i.e. Saturday. Saturday, Alberta is the first province in Canada to offer a financial incentive for vaccinations, though the tactic has been tried in the United States as well. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. Whether you want to hit on the fact that Jason Kenney was away for a couple of weeks and had no deputy in charge to really kind of guide us through the rise in COVID cases on Delta, whether you want to talk about the $100 incentive that is now being offered, or whether you want to talk about the fact that none of this was, in a sense, you know, preordained destiny, that we could have avoided a lot of this. I&#39;ll let you pick the lane you swim in first, and we&#39;ll go from there and have a conversation on what we&#39;re seeing in our home province.</span>

            <span class="text">And we didn&#39;t do anything until almost September. I guess it was September. Was it September? Yeah, it was September. Why? Because the premier needed to rest and get ready to continue. And then he came back and took five full days, because I think it does take time to make a good decision, and made a shitty decision, made a decision that doesn&#39;t work on any level. And I think that, you know, the question that I have is, does anybody, anybody think that these restrictions and incentives are enough to force people to actually do the right thing? we have seen uptick amongst the vaccine hesitant in other jurisdictions when a passport or the like has been brought in when you have a requirement when you have a big enough stick you will actually move you you said that we were the first province to offer money keep in mind we were also the first province to offer a one million dollar prize and that didn&#39;t move anybody when we move when we put out the million dollars the percentage was almost the exact same as it is today the people people stopped getting vaccinated when we reopened people stopped getting vaccinated when we said it was going to be the best summer ever and it has turned into an absolute shit show jason kenney has now taken so what will happen is the next week we&#39;ll get a ton of data tomorrow about how things are actually going shit show is the answer there you go spoiler and um then</span>

            <span class="text">then he will take another week before he does the next level of restrictions, which is if you look at the little charts, every two weeks, he does something. He brings something in a little bit. And then two weeks later, he brings in the actual restrictions that will work. I would just desperately like to skip the first two weeks. It&#39;s only our fourth wave. It&#39;s only the fourth wave. You&#39;d think you&#39;d learn from second or third. I mean, you didn&#39;t learn a lot from the first. That&#39;s fine because it was was just little but the second or the third wave should give you enough institutional knowledge to not be a fucking moron jason you fucking idiot i&#39;m</span>

            <span class="text">i mean i got a lot i i do think that carter is is ignoring something that&#39;s fairly obvious here in terms of the fact that yeah we We have seen restrictions and then more extensive restrictions down the road that this is more than likely a caucus management technique, which is we&#39;re going to try everything except for the thing you don&#39;t want me to do. And when that fails, we&#39;ll do the thing that I want to do. Right now, I&#39;m not giving a pass to any government for that. Carter, look at you. You look like you&#39;re going to jump through the screen. Go ahead. I&#39;ll let you finish, Corey, and then I&#39;ll let Carter go. Go ahead.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I guess my point would be I think we can see clearly where this is going. It is frustrating. the feeling like why can&#39;t we end up there now but there&#39;s probably a reason and that reason is probably the ucp caucus and what some of those demands are uh that are being driven on the inside here so i you know that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s not a good thing i think that we should be thinking about whether there should be such a strong pull towards less restrictions in the face of this evidence but yeah i mean we know you&#39;re right we saw this in wave two we saw this in wave three we keep keep seeing this. We know the drill. We know what&#39;s going to happen at this point. And that&#39;s really not great because people&#39;s lives are on the line right now. But in some ways, I think as an Albertan, I&#39;ve been conditioned to think like, well, this is dumb, but the real restrictions are coming down the road.</span>

People who do the right thing without without worrying about what the political consequence is, because it could actually improve his his polling. his piece the people of alberta who he&#39;s supposed to work for not his fucking moron caucus not the group of people that that are running the the ucp as an executive those idiots they don&#39;t they don&#39;t matter they don&#39;t count the people who count in this are the 77 percent of albertans 77 percent of albertans want a vaccine passport you know why because it&#39;s number one the right thing to do and And number two, it&#39;s the popular thing to do. Why not try that, Jason? Because that&#39;s the thing that you were elected to do. Lead. This following the stupidest member of your caucus, following the person who doesn&#39;t want to lead, that&#39;s bullshit.

It is 77% support a vaccine passport. It seems like a political no brainer. But Alberta also has the highest strongly opposed in the country at one in five Albertans are strongly opposed to that.

There is no shortage of quotes being thrown around the Internet. Him saying, you know, best summer ever, obviously. We don&#39;t foresee a scenario where this is going to where we&#39;re going to go back into, you know, more restrictive cases. People who think otherwise are just fear mongers. That&#39;s all true.

I mean I&#39;ve long been on the whole – the idea that Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership is under threat is severely overblown.

            <span class="text">carter can i ask you this is there any risks on being on the pro positive popular public opinion side of an issue and i&#39;m using this one as as their example but like are there any risks or lessons learned of just having 80 you being on the right side of of an issue, the other guy just can&#39;t go there. Is there any lessons to be learned or any risks that you have to be careful of? You know, in this case, if you&#39;re the Alberta NDP, where you&#39;re 80% of the public is behind you?</span>

So there&#39;s not a lot of risk. I mean, this is the beauty of the democratic process. If 80% of the people have one point of view, and you reflect that, that&#39;s probably a good thing for you electorally, where</span>

So in this particular case, they support the vaccine passport. But when I think of the PST, we see 75% opposition to a provincial sales tax in Alberta, and that has, there&#39;s no doubt, had a tremendously negative impact on Alberta&#39;s long-term financial prospects, creating a real fiscal imbalance.</span>

I&#39;m not saying that the NDP are suffering from the same kind of extreme version of this, but like, let&#39;s not pretend that there won&#39;t be friction with a vaccine passport policy, that there won&#39;t be court challenges, that there won&#39;t be protests, that there won&#39;t be angry people, that there won&#39;t be an, like, here&#39;s the other problem. There&#39;s no obvious end date to this. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s VE day where all of a sudden you can declare victory over COVID and we can just get rid of all of these things. They&#39;ll need to be phased out based on certain triggers. People argue whether the trigger is appropriate or not.

            <span class="text">Yeah, let&#39;s start with Paul, because the stakes are so obvious in this situation, right? The stakes are you exist as a party or not. You capture the imagination enough to hold on to one effing seat or not. And it&#39;s your opportunity to remind people that the Green Party exists and that this is a moment for green politics. Those are the stakes. The approach then has to be, you need green representation in Parliament because this is the issue of our day. Perhaps it&#39;s even more important in a Parliament where things are up in the air, where the Conservative Party could potentially be the government. Because you know what, the Liberals, they support green politics as long as those politics work for them electorally. You&#39;ll support them no matter what, because you look over the long term, that has always been the Green Party&#39;s strength. You know, the Liberal Party likes to talk a good game about their green policy. The fact of the matter is they&#39;re getting to where the greens were 20 years ago.</span>

And so making himself palatable to the majority of Canadians, improving his best prime minister numbers, which is something I mentioned a couple of episodes ago, shifting himself into a prime ministerial role where people can see him in that role instead of the embattled opposition member. And I think that that&#39;s that&#39;s really his opportunity. And that&#39;s his his strategy. And the stakes are whether he&#39;s the prime minister or the opposition leader. You</span>

You want to provoke conflict. You want to provoke conflict on issues that you are basically Teflon and the others are going to be a little bit more awkward on. Bluntly, I would be taking the prime minister to task on reconciliation, which is one of the five topics in the English language debate, as we know.

Yeah, we&#39;ve got to think about what that potentially means for this. And you could see Aaron O&#39;Toole was trying to talk out of both sides of his mouth as he was talking to the right wing of his party. At the same time, he was making a play for those voters in the center. By the way, Bernier decided he was going to take his own approach here, and he had this, whatever, you know, go on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Continue with the commentary. So that is a win if you&#39;re Bernier. That&#39;s a win for the PPC. Carter,</span>

The other part of the stakes is he&#39;s got the votes that everybody wants. Everybody on that stage is looking to his party and saying, those are the votes I can go get. And so he&#39;s going to be under attack from whether it&#39;s the Greens, the the bloc, you know, the NDP or the conservatives.

I mean, uh, I think Corey and I were chatting today and he said, well, I mean, Ooh, maybe the conservatives dropped down to 52% in the province of Alberta. a big fucking deal. Good point, Corey.

But even from it, we don&#39;t think about Doug Ford&#39;s fuck-ups on a regular basis, and Doug Ford&#39;s fuck-ups don&#39;t play into our idea of what Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s government would be like, the way we think about how Jason Kenney and how he approaches things might. Same with John Horgan in BC with the NDP, same as you name it. It&#39;s just all politics is local, and people don&#39;t care about Jason Kenney as much outside Alberta as people inside, and Alberta&#39;s not a competitive race. Corey,</span>
