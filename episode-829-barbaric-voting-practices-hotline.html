            <span class="text">yeah yeah we&#39;ll do it let&#39;s jump into our first segment our first segment four yes indeed donald trump was at the golf course and while he was another four was being chanted amongst his campaign saying which four seasons are we going to the hotel no we are at four seasons total landscaping cory hogan Morgan, please</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">please tee this story up for us because I know you have been following it so intimately. And I go ahead. Just go ahead. No,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, it&#39;s the funniest thing that has happened all year, maybe all decade. I just I think it&#39;s if this was on television, we would think it was kind of absurdist humor. Like it feels very Arrested Development. You know, this notion of like, oh, yes, Michael, we&#39;re going to have the thing at the Four Seasons. Oh, the Four Seasons. Well, the Four Seasons landscaping company. and uh it&#39;s just as good though they&#39;re really the top of their landscaping game</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t know the story like no matter what the story is it&#39;s great so one of many things has happened here yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah do you want to do you want to like strategically scenario plan for us on the stupid okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay go ahead go ahead do</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">all right so one of these things has happened either they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">thought they were booking the four seasons hotel and they accidentally booked a a landscaping company just off the highway next to a porn shop across from a crematorium. Or maybe they intentionally</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">intentionally booked this place, which is equally baffling to me. And then, of course, there&#39;s been some reporting that it&#39;s a combination of the two, that Rudy Giuliani intentionally booked this place, and Donald Trump misunderstood him, believing it was the Four Seasons Hotel.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But why? That still doesn&#39;t answer why Rudy Giuliani did that. And then there&#39;s so many details that make you think that it does look like they just really badly screwed up. Like they delayed it by half an hour and it takes about 25 minutes to get from the Four Seasons Hotel to the Four Seasons Landscaping Company.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s so great. And let&#39;s just say, let&#39;s just take, for example, maybe that did happen. Maybe they accidentally booked the wrong venue.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Landscaping companies don&#39;t normally take bookings at their venues. you so like</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they picked up the phone oh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">oh no i can&#39;t even explain the imagery of like these eight and a half by eleven trump signs taped together on the back of a really old garage in this parking lot carter uh which of the scenarios that cory has laid out for us uh do you think is most likely and then uh followed closely by which of the scenarios is the most hilarious i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i think the the most likely is that they booked you know that there is some advanced person somewhere who is told to book the four seasons and i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think that that&#39;s reasonable i think that&#39;s the most likely but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but i&#39;ve been here like i haven&#39;t been in there because that that&#39;s gonna haunt for years like someone has to find out who&#39;s responsible for that because it wasn&#39;t rudy giuliani really Rudy Giuliani books like doesn&#39;t book anything like he&#39;s not involved in any of the tactics. Right. Like there&#39;s no way he does the tactics. So I want to find the person who did this. There&#39;s usually there&#39;s an advanced team that does these things. Now, this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this could be considered out external to the actual campaign. So there might have been like a separate group of people who did this. But my God, someone booked this.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think thinking it was the Four Seasons. someone then told like no one books a landscaping company to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">to announce the legal challenge like no one does this it&#39;s just not done the address should have been a tell but it also tells me that there was no one on the ground like there was there&#39;s no one prepared for any of this like we talked in a previous i think you the people like episode about how all the lawyers were going to be prepped and ready and there was all going to be standing by ready to go you know as as the challenges needed to be done uh there&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s no way that anybody was standing by to book the four seasons landscaping company oh my god it&#39;s too bad well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well apparently it&#39;s hard to find a republican in philadelphia we did learn that this week so well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well the one guy who is the republican in philadelphia has been getting death threats because he actually counted the ballots so that guy&#39;s not going to be a republican much longer you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you know the best part about this is that the landscaping company has put out a statement saying they were equally as surprised to get a phone call, but were happy to just be part of the democratic process. They felt like they were partaking in a process and are now putting up their merchandise store at midnight tonight. So if you want, you know, four seasons total landscaping merchandise, which I feel like will remain in our political zeitgeist, just out of Corey&#39;s sheer will, I feel like it will remain. Corey, you have, you have willed, you&#39;re going to of willed this story beyond the news cycle that it deserves uh just because when you take a step back and think how funny it is it is probably one of the funniest things that we&#39;ve heard about in politics it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there there are just so many ways i can allow my my imagination to drift and think about how this possibly could have happened i love to imagine the phone conversation between whoever this advanced person was and whoever it was who answered the phone i&#39;m assuming on a saturday at uh total or you know four seasons total escaping</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like like do you think they do you think they clued in part way through and if they did did they tell the advanced person like you know this is not the hotel or did they</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

You remember we were talking about fly swatters that were turned around like the same day? This is the same thing. They get to make money for three weeks. Make as much money as you can for three weeks and then laugh about it at all of the company barbecues that happen subsequently. This is something</span>

So why are we surprised? But my God, like put a grown up in charge of something. There is no one in charge of anything that seems to matter except sending out, you know, what was it, 15 emails in the last, I think, two or three days, all with a fundraising bent to try and raise enough money to pay the legal bills. But really what it seems to be is pay the debts that are owed by the Trump campaign. Like every other one of Trump&#39;s businesses, this one is running at an enormous loss. Is anybody surprised?

            <span class="text">You know what, it is interesting, because the diehard that do stand with him, those that voted for him is the second largest vote total in American history. So it is a significant portion of the population that voted for Donald Trump. Now, I&#39;m not saying they stand with him with these tactics and this communications crusade that he is on. But there is something to be said about the coalition that stands beside Donald Trump. So maybe I&#39;ll bridge this to a a little bit more of a serious conversation saying, you know, we sit here on the Sunday, as I mentioned, 73 odd days left until Donald Trump is out of the White House officially until January 20th. There is some damage that this man can do both communications wide, perhaps even legislatively. It&#39;s a question mark I add to that. But certainly further eroding the presidency is not out of question for Donald Trump over the next 73 days. So Carter, if I bridge to that conversation. What are you worried about? And what do you kind of suspect that someone like Donald Trump might do, knowing the fact that, you know, we still have to pay attention to him for the next 73 days, despite the lame duck status, because he&#39;s still president?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I was really worried about this. I mean, we&#39;ve talked before on You the People and on The Strategist about what we were fearful of after the Trump presidency, if it was a close election, if it wasn&#39;t decided on election night, if it took a few, you know, a little while to for the results to come in. But the good news is he&#39;s done it so comically bad that I think that his inability to string together a coherent narrative has ultimately undone everything. That and the media have finally shown some backbone and they&#39;re calling him out and they&#39;re saying that, no, this isn&#39;t true. And this is the first time that we&#39;ve seen those two things. So am I worried about future legislation? No, I&#39;m not really. You know, executive orders that are implemented in the last 73 days will be undone on day one of a Joe Biden presidency. So I&#39;m not worried about the executive orders. There&#39;s no way that anything is going to be rammed through Congress. That&#39;s just simply not going to happen. So I&#39;m not too fussed with what he can do on the way out. I mean, he can pardon a lot of people. He can pardon, you know, everybody and their dog. I mean, he&#39;s already done Sheriff Joe Arpaio. And that&#39;s just but one of the crazed lunatics that that that Trump has looked at and said, these are my people. So, you</span>

            <span class="text">you know, I&#39;m not too fussed about what he can do. Well, I was worried about what would happen if his people, the 70 plus million people who stood behind him and voted for him, actually decided to get, you know, to get upset about this. And I just think that he&#39;s done such a bad job of messaging it. You know, like it was a really bad look for him to be on the golf course yesterday and today. Like a really like a tragically bad look to be on the golf course when Biden is named the winner. like you&#39;re literally on like the seventh hole and someone comes up and says sir i&#39;m sorry um but you know the networks have called it for biden like that&#39;s</span>

You know, and he has Alex Jones on as a special guest star. He&#39;ll be able to speak with a degree of intelligence towards the things that his audience wants him to speak to. so you know the election has to be stolen from them this there has to be a queue there has to be a uh</span>

I talked about those 1,200 positions that are presidential with Senate appointment or Senate confirmation needed, but there&#39;s a lot more positions than that. Fire as enemies. Make a huge number of appointments of people that you think that you can trust. Basically make it just a total nightmare for the Democrats to undo. do. Broad pardoning of the people who work for you because you say you&#39;re not going to deal with the retribution on the way out the door. Make some political statements like a broad pardoning of police services who are being abused by the Democrats, you can say. Really just fuck things up in a way that your base will eat up.

On Saturday morning, on the day in November that had the mysteriously awesome weather across the cities of America, the liberal elite media announced Donald Trump was the—I&#39;m sorry, Joe Biden was president-elect, and people took to the streets to celebrate. Guys, I want to talk about, first of all, the celebrations on the street. Had you seen anything like that before? And kind of tell me about, and I don&#39;t want to get into deep pop psychology, but was this a celebration of joy or celebration of relief? I&#39;m kind of curious to get your take what these pseudo spontaneous celebrations breaking out, starting in Washington, then expanding across the cities of major cities of America, kind of meant to you and what you kind of took from them. Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you.</span>

I can&#39;t remember who, so I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not giving credit. But like, what kind of asshole do you have to be that they&#39;re ringing church bells in Paris when you get fired? And it&#39;s true. The celebrations weren&#39;t even limited to the United States of America. And they were pretty delightful to watch. People literally dancing in the streets, in city after city.</span>

The COVID case numbers are super, super high. And you know what? This is an excuse that it is good enough to finally allow you to go out and have something that replaces the Pride Festival, which was canceled, or something that&#39;s replaced the Friday night tailgate</span>

Does this hurt? Does this cause a rift with the Republicans? Absolutely. It causes a rift with the Republicans. The Republican, you know, Corey mentioned the 80 percent districts that are that weren&#39;t out celebrating. You know, the fear was that when the celebration took place, that there would be someone else who showed up who was angry. angry that didn&#39;t happen primarily because frankly the angry places are quite far removed from the happy places the happy places are anywhere that a general that there is a city the unhappy places are places where there is not a city and so those</span>

The celebrations on TikTok, the celebrations on Twitter, and the crying that&#39;s happening on Parler. I mean, like, all of these different mediums are aflame with people who are either feeling joy or anger. And I think,</span>

But Corey, before we get there, let&#39;s talk about the Saturday night events with President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Let&#39;s talk about what we usually do in these situations. Let&#39;s start with stagecraft and then perhaps let&#39;s dig a little bit deep into the message. So give me a sense of what you saw from stagecraft from both of them, both from the appearance to the set that they kind of the stage, I should say, that they were at. And then, of course, us watching them watching fireworks for 15 minutes. We can leave that till the end. But what did you kind of kind of make for from what you saw with with the Democrats and how they put together victory night on on Saturday evening?</span>

It was those standard platitudes about bringing the nation together. You know, there&#39;s not red states or blue states. there&#39;s the United States. Listen, a version of that line has been used ever since we started referring to red states and blue states. Barack Obama famously said something very similar.

And given what was going on, and given the context in which he found himself declared the presumptive next president of the United States, it was not a team speech. It was an America speech. speech. And in that sense, maybe he hit the team stuff too hard. But no, I think it was a fine speech. It was the speech you give when you win an election.

You know, he&#39;s going to come together with a group of scientists and people who are professionals at this who can help. Arguably, that in and of itself is political because the other side is rejecting. That&#39;s, you know, but for me, that was a good thing to hear. I am more worried about the politics of Georgia and what&#39;s going to happen with the Senate runoffs. So I&#39;m actually really interested in what happens with the cabinet announcements and those types of things. But to me, Joe Biden getting down to work right now is exactly the message that Americans need to see. He didn&#39;t wait until Monday to kind of put this thing out that it was going to happen.

So, you know, COVID is at the top of the list, but is there an overarching philosophy in how you&#39;re pointing, for example, to Carter&#39;s point, your cabinet? Is it a group of, you know, statesman-like people? Are you bridging on the other side of republicanism? Are you showcasing this divide and adding people from both sides? Or are you just saying, I need people who I can trust and fuck it, we have like serious times that I may only have four years to do this. I need to get my people in place.

She&#39;s near rockstar level. And I think that she gives the good people of Georgia an opportunity to see themselves represented in government, in a Joe Biden administration.

So is it strictly about the Senate? Or do you have other sort of overarching philosophies? Like, for example, around the cabinet, like, are you looking at making this a, I shouldn&#39;t call it a bipartisan cabinet, but maybe a bridge solution that has folks that might be center right, for example? Are you just getting people you trust? How are you kind of balancing both the needs of Georgia and the runoffs, the needs of putting together your transition in the cabinet, and then the overarching needs of like healing the country, so to speak?

How are you playing this if you&#39;re team Biden right now? Like, are you ignoring this chatter? Are you giving any hat tip to the social democratic wing of your party?

She makes an assertion that digital campaigning was a weakness for the areas or the Democrats that underperformed. Not sure. I&#39;m going to look into that.

            <span class="text">Yeah, thanks for framing our special episode, Corey. This is great. We&#39;ll, for the first time in the history of The Strategist, maybe do some research prior to showing up? Probably not. But once the data is in, I do want to talk about this, because there is a really interesting both campaign, governance, message, messenger, conversation, deep dive to be done, and frankly, not even including the parallels to be made here in Canada, where we have a divided left from a federal landscape, and to talk about some of those comparators. So leave that there and move it on to our next segment. Foods are whole, but hearts are empty. Guys, I want to talk about Whole Foods. It is a bit of a mini controversy here in Canada. So if you have not heard, a U.S.-based Whole Foods market had said poppies weren&#39;t allowed under its recently updated uniform policy. It was a recent policy change that they had. They then came out with the statement doubling down. And then only after they had a conversation with the Veterans Affairs Minister, Lawrence McCauley, who talked to the COO of Whole Foods that they&#39;ve now said, yes, employees of Whole Foods, you are allowed to wear poppies. You know, on this show, we&#39;ve discussed quite a few times, you know, corporate communications, you know, why they make certain decisions, what their decisions were, were they right or wrong. Carter, I want to start with you first. Let&#39;s go top line. What did you make of Whole Foods&#39; choice here to kind of double down? Because that&#39;s, I think, the strategy that I want to focus in on, on saying, no, we&#39;ve got a policy. It&#39;s not like we don&#39;t support veterans and the Legion, et cetera, but we&#39;ve got a policy and we&#39;re sticking with it. What did you make of their strategy and their statement? I understood</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">understood their strategy. I mean, they&#39;re in an incredibly polarized environment in the United States. You don&#39;t want your staff showing up and wearing buttons from various causes. I mean, Black Lives Matter is a really worthy cause, you know, especially in the United States. People are going to show up. They&#39;re going to be wearing Black Lives Matter buttons.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they&#39;ve applied that in a situation where really no one is offended by a poppy. And a poppy is not the same statement. And they got caught in it, right? And I&#39;m sure that they&#39;ll be caught in other things because these blanket policies are very, very tricky to manage. They they did. Now that they&#39;ve backed down on this one, they&#39;re putting themselves in a really tough situation for the next issue that they&#39;re going to have to back down on. So I have empathy for Whole Foods. Well, at the same time, I think it was a stupid policy in general, but I understand why they did it.</span>

But when you are sitting there in, I don&#39;t know, Seattle? Is that where Whole Foods is headquartered? I don&#39;t even know. Yeah, inside</span>

But when you have these centralized command and control operations, and you apply those rules, and you disregard local intelligence, disregard intelligence of the audience that you&#39;re serving, you&#39;re committing the most serious of communications errors, right? You need to understand your audience and what your audience&#39;s reaction will be to these things. And so these tie together. Like if your objective is to stay out of controversy and that&#39;s why you didn&#39;t allow people to wear pins, well, you fucking failed on your objective even though you followed your rule perfectly. And I think, again, local people could have told you about that. So that&#39;s why I think they made a mistake. I also think the minute the media started calling</span>

            <span class="text">I want to I want to stick with you for a second, Corey, but you make an interesting point about the social media traffic. You know, companies have taken so many stances in recent memory and have gotten burnt in the past. And, you know, especially in a divided America where they feel like if they take a stance, they&#39;re going to get two sided on everything. They&#39;re going to get some support, some hate. And perhaps to them, they weren&#39;t able to discern between is this just a standard hate this issue gets? Or is this like the large majority of the population that is kind of speaking against our stance here? So I think there&#39;s probably something to be said about that. But to Carter&#39;s point, you know, Corey, I&#39;m putting you on the spot, but how would you have navigated this particular issue? You know, you add local intelligence, okay, you add being more flexible than being rule bound. But how would you have navigated this issue that Carter mentions about now opening themselves up to other campaigns, other issues, other initiatives, which he feels like they clearly have? How would you have navigated that line for them? well</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s a slippery slope argument and unfortunately by the volume being risen that is more likely now that people will point to it and have this active example that they can point to and say well look you you let the poppy do it after after much blowback why can&#39;t it be the canadian flag why can&#39;t it be the alberta flag why can&#39;t it be the alberta flag in bc why can&#39;t but you</span>

This is a cousin of what we&#39;ve seen here, but just some general rules for organizations. Some of them, you know, have leaned into woke as being a business model. Everyone clamors over themselves to put in a black tile on Instagram supporting Black Lives Matter. What do you kind of think this says or doesn&#39;t say about the state of our what I&#39;d call commercial or corporate advocacy world where activism has kind of been ingrained in our cultural DNA that companies now need to stand for something in their community? What do you kind of take stock of where we are in that moment? I&#39;m kind of curious to get your thoughts.</span>

They were saying, OK, of all of the people who are purchasing my product right now, again, this is my audience. What are their expectations?

It&#39;s a collection of customers. And they don&#39;t all share the same values. So there&#39;s an interesting sorting that you are subjecting yourself to whenever you take stances like this. Many companies do it quite defensively. They don&#39;t want to antagonize the people that are are out there who</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right where their advertising is clearly not defensive it is staking ground uh and differentiating from from more staid uh you know even socially conservative groups like Like, arguably Adidas, right? So it&#39;s interesting.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">interesting. And I guess what I am saying and why I&#39;m rambling a bit on this is there is no one-size-fits-all for this. There is also a business model that says, my market is not the people who care about these things, right? My market is the people who are going to look for the lowest price, and that&#39;s why they come to Walmart. They don&#39;t come to Walmart for the politics one way or the other.</span>

And they also figured out, oh, hold on, that feels like it&#39;s environmentally good, too. So it was a coincidence, not necessarily a brand promise.

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to stick with you on on this one. There was a narrative this week coming out, an op-ed piece of the New York Times saying that Joe Biden&#39;s presidency is going to be a third term of an Obama presidency. Are you in or out on that narrative? Do you feel like this is going to be term three of a Barack Obama presidency or term one of a Joe Biden presidency? Are you in or out on the narrative that this is term number three for Barack Obama?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Barack Obama did pretty well. He would have won a third term. I think that if it was term number three, that they might be able to actively look forward to term number four. The challenge is the Senate and the way that McConnell and the Republicans treated Obama seems to be the way that McConnell and the Republicans want to treat Biden. So, you know, it very well may look very similar insofar as the Democrats aren&#39;t able to achieve the things that they want to.</span>

            <span class="text">No, I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t think that Joe Biden is Barack Obama. I think he&#39;s got different priorities. And I think America is fundamentally different than it was four years ago. It&#39;s just not not the case. That&#39;s some weird combination of wishful thinking and giving Joe Biden no credit and no agency.</span>

So to fill, to color in the lines a bit, the CBC ran what was kind of a pseudo profile on health minister Tyler Shandrow. Not entirely glowing, but a profile that we haven&#39;t seen in a while where it kind of covered some elements of how he interacts with staff, what motivates them, what drives them, etc. Carter, I want to get your take first. And maybe let&#39;s answer the suite of questions here. Is it part of a PR campaign? And is it a good strategy, So to speak, or an effective strategy. Let me let me change the question for for Chandra, who&#39;s been under under the gun for a lot of the health care cuts here in Alberta. So maybe answer both of those questions for for our listener question. progression i</span>
