            <div class="said">You know what, it is interesting, because the diehard that do stand with him, those that voted for him is the second largest vote total in American history. So it is a significant portion of the population that voted for Donald Trump. Now, I&#39;m not saying they stand with him with these tactics and this communications crusade that he is on. But there is something to be said about the coalition that stands beside Donald Trump. So maybe I&#39;ll bridge this to a a little bit more of a serious conversation saying, you know, we sit here on the Sunday, as I mentioned, 73 odd days left until Donald Trump is out of the White House officially until January 20th. There is some damage that this man can do both communications wide, perhaps even legislatively. It&#39;s a question mark I add to that. But certainly further eroding the presidency is not out of question for Donald Trump over the next 73 days. So Carter, if I bridge to that conversation. What are you worried about? And what do you kind of suspect that someone like Donald Trump might do, knowing the fact that, you know, we still have to pay attention to him for the next 73 days, despite the lame duck status, because he&#39;s still president?</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, I was really worried about this. I mean, we&#39;ve talked before on You the People and on The Strategist about what we were fearful of after the Trump presidency, if it was a close election, if it wasn&#39;t decided on election night, if it took a few, you know, a little while to for the results to come in. But the good news is he&#39;s done it so comically bad that I think that his inability to string together a coherent narrative has ultimately undone everything. That and the media have finally shown some backbone and they&#39;re calling him out and they&#39;re saying that, no, this isn&#39;t true. And this is the first time that we&#39;ve seen those two things. So am I worried about future legislation? No, I&#39;m not really. You know, executive orders that are implemented in the last 73 days will be undone on day one of a Joe Biden presidency. So I&#39;m not worried about the executive orders. There&#39;s no way that anything is going to be rammed through Congress. That&#39;s just simply not going to happen. So I&#39;m not too fussed with what he can do on the way out. I mean, he can pardon a lot of people. He can pardon, you know, everybody and their dog. I mean, he&#39;s already done Sheriff Joe Arpaio. And that&#39;s just but one of the crazed lunatics that that that Trump has looked at and said, these are my people. So, you</div>

And I just think that he&#39;s done such a bad job of messaging it. You know, like it was a really bad look for him to be on the golf course yesterday and today.

Let&#39;s talk about what we usually do in these situations. Let&#39;s start with stagecraft and then perhaps let&#39;s dig a little bit deep into the message. So give me a sense of what you saw from stagecraft from both of them, both from the appearance to the set that they kind of the stage, I should say, that they were at. And then, of course, us watching them watching fireworks for 15 minutes. We can leave that till the end.

And given what was going on, and given the context in which he found himself declared the presumptive next president of the United States, it was not a team speech. It was an America speech. speech.

You know, he&#39;s going to come together with a group of scientists and people who are professionals at this who can help. Arguably, that in and of itself is political because the other side is rejecting. That&#39;s, you know, but for me, that was a good thing to hear. I am more worried about the politics of Georgia and what&#39;s going to happen with the Senate runoffs. So I&#39;m actually really interested in what happens with the cabinet announcements and those types of things.

So, you know, COVID is at the top of the list, but is there an overarching philosophy in how you&#39;re pointing, for example, to Carter&#39;s point, your cabinet? Is it a group of, you know, statesman-like people? Are you bridging on the other side of republicanism? Are you showcasing this divide and adding people from both sides? Or are you just saying, I need people who I can trust and fuck it, we have like serious times that I may only have four years to do this. I need to get my people in place.

Carter, I&#39;m going to ask you the question I did to Corey, which is what is your overarching philosophy for Team Biden? 72 days, is it? I assumed it was, but I could be wrong. So is it strictly about the Senate? Or do you have other sort of overarching philosophies? Like, for example, around the cabinet, like, are you looking at making this a, I shouldn&#39;t call it a bipartisan cabinet, but maybe a bridge solution that has folks that might be center right, for example? Are you just getting people you trust? How are you kind of balancing both the needs of Georgia and the runoffs, the needs of putting together your transition in the cabinet, and then the overarching needs of like healing the country, so to speak?

She makes an assertion that digital campaigning was a weakness for the areas or the Democrats that underperformed. Not sure. I&#39;m going to look into that.

We&#39;ll, for the first time in the history of The Strategist, maybe do some research prior to showing up? Probably not. But once the data is in, I do want to talk about this, because there is a really interesting both campaign, governance, message, messenger, conversation, deep dive to be done, and frankly, not even including the parallels to be made here in Canada, where we have a divided left from a federal landscape, and to talk about some of those comparators. So leave that there and move it on to our next segment. Foods are whole, but hearts are empty. Guys, I want to talk about Whole Foods. It is a bit of a mini controversy here in Canada. So if you have not heard, a U.S.-based Whole Foods market had said poppies weren&#39;t allowed under its recently updated uniform policy. It was a recent policy change that they had. They then came out with the statement doubling down. And then only after they had a conversation with the Veterans Affairs Minister, Lawrence McCauley, who talked to the COO of Whole Foods that they&#39;ve now said, yes, employees of Whole Foods, you are allowed to wear poppies. You know, on this show, we&#39;ve discussed quite a few times, you know, corporate communications, you know, why they make certain decisions, what their decisions were, were they right or wrong. Carter, I want to start with you first. Let&#39;s go top line. What did you make of Whole Foods&#39; choice here to kind of double down? Because that&#39;s, I think, the strategy that I want to focus in on, on saying, no, we&#39;ve got a policy. It&#39;s not like we don&#39;t support veterans and the Legion, et cetera, but we&#39;ve got a policy and we&#39;re sticking with it. What did you make of their strategy and their statement?

            <div class="said">I want to I want to stick with you for a second, Corey, but you make an interesting point about the social media traffic. You know, companies have taken so many stances in recent memory and have gotten burnt in the past. And, you know, especially in a divided America where they feel like if they take a stance, they&#39;re going to get two sided on everything. They&#39;re going to get some support, some hate. And perhaps to them, they weren&#39;t able to discern between is this just a standard hate this issue gets? Or is this like the large majority of the population that is kind of speaking against our stance here? So I think there&#39;s probably something to be said about that. But to Carter&#39;s point, you know, Corey, I&#39;m putting you on the spot, but how would you have navigated this particular issue? You know, you add local intelligence, okay, you add being more flexible than being rule bound. But how would you have navigated this issue that Carter mentions about now opening themselves up to other campaigns, other issues, other initiatives, which he feels like they clearly have? How would you have navigated that line for them? well</div>

This is a cousin of what we&#39;ve seen here, but just some general rules for organizations. Some of them, you know, have leaned into woke as being a business model. Everyone clamors over themselves to put in a black tile on Instagram supporting Black Lives Matter. What do you kind of think this says or doesn&#39;t say about the state of our what I&#39;d call commercial or corporate advocacy world where activism has kind of been ingrained in our cultural DNA that companies now need to stand for something in their community? What do you kind of take stock of where we are in that moment? I&#39;m kind of curious to get your thoughts.</div>

So to fill, to color in the lines a bit, the CBC ran what was kind of a pseudo profile on health minister Tyler Shandrow. Not entirely glowing, but a profile that we haven&#39;t seen in a while where it kind of covered some elements of how he interacts with staff, what motivates them, what drives them, etc. Carter, I want to get your take first. And maybe let&#39;s answer the suite of questions here. Is it part of a PR campaign? And is it a good strategy, So to speak, or an effective strategy. Let me let me change the question for for Chandra, who&#39;s been under under the gun for a lot of the health care cuts here in Alberta.
