Of those, there are some parties that do better and some parties that do worse. This is how we measure that. You can see that things like climate change, the NDP has a plus 15. Reducing the gap between the rich and the poor, the NDP have a plus 10. The issues at the bottom are all NDP, including one that we really care about, which is healthcare. care. Unfortunately, the other things that we care about, like cost of living, is a push between the NDP and the UCP. Above that, you can start seeing things like protecting the rights of gun owners, also things we don&#39;t care about that much. But managing the Alberta economy, it turns out that we believe the UCP will do a better job. Apparently, four years of evidence matters not at all.</span>

Let me start here what people are saying guys Guys, first question, Stephen Carter, how does the Alberta NDP get respected for its economic policy, especially in Calgary? I&#39;ll ask both of you that question, actually. Probably</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The NDP always wanna fight this. They always wanna say things like, well, the economy took us there. You cannot change someone&#39;s beliefs. you can&#39;t change someone who believes that X is X and Y is Y or right you do and it takes too much time and energy we&#39;re now within eight weeks of this election actually occurring we&#39;re not going to change people&#39;s fundamental belief we have today instead change what they think is important and</span>

            <span class="text">and what they think is important is way easier to change and way easier to get them to vote for us that&#39;s why we&#39;re doing the negative strategy to keep the reluctant UCP voter home and the positive strategy to incent the the the Alberta party and and the NDP, and whatever liberals are left, maybe you, to go out and actually vote for the NDP. That&#39;s the next, that&#39;s all there is. You cannot convince someone that</span>

            <span class="text">yeah well Steven&#39;s exactly right just as I talked about for the UCP health care is something to deal with reactively like you&#39;ve got to have strong tight answers that you can throw out very quickly in any situation you need to be able to find a way to bridge back to ground on which you are stronger and for the NDP that&#39;s health care that&#39;s social programs more generally that&#39;s education those are the issues you want to be talking about. And if you spend your time trying to convince people, no, no, no, we&#39;re the economy people. Like I get the impulse, especially when you see how high it is there. But you know what else was really high? Healthcare. And you know what was a draw? Affordability. And so you have the winning ingredients there. You&#39;ve got to talk about the things that naturally lend people to think of you as the answer, not things that naturally lend people to think of the opposition is the answer Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well I think it has to be more than just Danielle because Danielle can point to you know probably a two-thirds of the slides that Corey put up at the beginning of his fantastic presentation about why to vote for the end at UCP the first you know 40 slides of that you know Danielle can disavow two-thirds of that so she you need to make it about the UCP in general the value set that they represent you know it&#39;s bigger than just Danielle Smith it&#39;s take back Alberta Albertans are already learning about take back Alberta I&#39;ll tell you something if you&#39;re running a pack and you&#39;re more you know as well known as the party you&#39;re not doing a very good job on your pack. So you have to try and get in there and equate Danielle Smith as just the latest in a series of bad decisions that are being made by the UCP. There&#39;s still Jason Kenney people. There&#39;s still Art Pawlowski people. All the people who are bad are in the UCP, except</span>

            <span class="text">well the challenge is if you do that and people don&#39;t buy it you haven&#39;t left them anything else you&#39;ve given them a great reason not to vote UCP you haven&#39;t given them a great reason to vote NDP and so a voter turnout cuts both ways right you&#39;ve got to have considerations as to what might make your opponents more or less enthusiastic to vote but you&#39;ve also got to have consideration for what make what your supporters more or less likely to to vote and when you look at the big dramatic change elections 2008 Barack Obama 2015 Justin Trudeau do you know what you see you see voters who don&#39;t usually vote showing up because they are motivated they are excited and they want to be there for you and it doesn&#39;t just show up in the voter turnout it shows up in that that enthusiasm bleeding out onto the doors bleeding out into conversations in the community you&#39;ve got to motivate your team you can&#39;t just scare them. You&#39;ve got to do both, but you&#39;ve got to motivate your team.</span>

And in reality, like you call it pandering, but you know what that is? That&#39;s an accusation people from the outside throw. Their votes aren&#39;t up for grabs.
