But let&#39;s talk about this leadership race. What are you thinking of it right now? What are you seeing of it from your strategist lens? What sort of tidbits are you picking up on? Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, I&#39;m constantly amazed at how bad we do certain small pieces. We can&#39;t seem to create a video in this country to save our lives. Peter McKay&#39;s How to Fill Out the Ballot video made me hurt myself. It was painful. And, you</span>

            <span class="text">you know, I mean, granted, the subject matter is not that great. I mean, Peter McKay. But still, you should try something, right? Like, you have to try and get people to actually fill in their ballots. And yes, a ranked ballot with four choices does challenge many conservative voters. voters but you know this this shouldn&#39;t be that hard um to get attention in this time i mean everybody uh posting on twitter that they&#39;d voted and they were mailing their their ballots in i</span>

            <span class="text">you haven&#39;t seen this video of peter mckay it&#39;s uh it&#39;s legendary it&#39;s about four minutes in length it starts with his wife uh going to the mailbox and getting the piece of mail which is of course the ballot to vote uh she then hands it over to peter who then like a staples sales rep uh photocopies his driver&#39;s license uh for the three minutes and 45 seconds she just stands there just looking at him um just sad i feel like it was she was just really just broken on the inside Corey, outside of videos, what are you sensing right now? What are you kind of feeling in this race? Is there anything you&#39;re picking up on or any threads that you kind of find interesting in the dog days of summer?</span>

And they are for the members. They&#39;re not for us. And if they were targeting in such a broad way that I was capturing their communications, I was capturing that excitement. in some ways, I would say, boy, that&#39;s not time or money well spent, right? So let&#39;s just set that as the baseline. I think the idea that this has been a boring, see-nothing race is really where you stand. And if you&#39;re a conservative insider, maybe you&#39;re a little bit more engaged in it. And certainly, when</span>

If you&#39;re organizing for one of these campaigns right now, you&#39;re a month away inside the bubble of a leadership race. Corey makes a very solid point that this is not for the general population. This is for the membership. If you&#39;re on the organizing or the campaign side right now, what are you back channeling? What are you back channeling to media? What are you back channeling to the rest of the membership? Is it just purely we&#39;re going to get this thing done? We&#39;re pure strength. We have this. Or is there more nuance you need to add to your message, especially when you&#39;re in such a small and tight bubble that you&#39;re communicating to?</span>

You&#39;ve called every supporter that you have, making sure that they filled out the ballot the right way. And you&#39;ve called them again, and you&#39;ve called them again, and you&#39;ve called them again, and you&#39;ve called them again. And that&#39;s really all you can do because that&#39;s now how this campaign is going to be won or lost. And then you&#39;re going to sit around until August the 21st. I&#39;m not sure whether or not you should be generating media or not generating media or generating attention or not generating attention because you don&#39;t want to help the other guy. So, you know, you&#39;re, you&#39;re just kind of sit. This is the downside of two things that I think the first thing is they were unfortunately impacted by COVID.

You know, sometimes these things drag on, but kind of what does the final stretch look like, regardless of what time of year it is? In this case, we&#39;re looking at summer, we kind of covered the summer context, but give our listeners a bit of an inside view as to what mechanics are going on right now in the final month of a leadership race.</span>

But at this point, you should have a pretty good sense from your lists who&#39;s pretty locked for a candidate who is one of those persuadables. You&#39;re using your candidate as much as possible on those persuadables. Hopefully, they are working the phones like crazy to create that personal sense of connection in the areas where they do the highest value, especially in a point system. And then you are having everybody else in the campaign who is not persuasive. So, you know, the people who are carrying your water, your MPs, your senators, I suppose, and whatnot, you&#39;re getting them to yank vote, just pull vote as much as they can. And ideally, you don&#39;t need to use the people who persuade</span>

            <span class="text">Well, no, I mean, it&#39;s also in this particular case, I think it&#39;s relatively straightforward because you&#39;ve got two such front runners in other campaigns. There&#39;s a lot of deal making that goes on. This ranked ballot structure is very interesting. We&#39;re trying to figure out where a campaign&#39;s second, third, fourth choices is going to go. If there were more candidates is super important. I mean, we saw Maxime Bernier lead right up until the last ballot in the last conservative leadership. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You know, I did a campaign in British Columbia and the deal was struck, I think, with about four weeks to go. And Andrew Wilkinson wound up winning the liberal leadership, I think, in no small part because of the deal that was done. But that work, you know, that takes a lot of time, a lot of effort. I mean, even us with Doug Horner, Alison Redford&#39;s leadership here, getting Doug Horner&#39;s voters to our side, Doug wasn&#39;t going to endorse. He refused to admit that he was going to come in third place. So getting him to change his mindset was near impossible. And that&#39;s why we concocted our endorse Doug Horner strategy. We told his voters who they were supposed to vote for. are this is interesting right now because you don&#39;t want to be aaron o&#39;toole or peter mckay endorsing either derrick sloan or or leslin lewis lewis i get that right yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I have long wondered if our campaigns aren&#39;t far longer than they need to be. You look at the British, you look at Boris Johnson. It was a month for round one and a month for round two. They had a two-round leadership contest concluded in two months. Now, the first round is just a vote of MPs, to be fair, but two months to finish everything, including a general membership vote. The Conservatives announced their leadership contest on December 12th, the day I remember, because it&#39;s my birthday. Strategist fans, mark your calendars. But that&#39;s eight months that you&#39;ve got a leadership contest going on for. And obviously, COVID is a complicating factor here. But it was supposed to be June 27th. It was still supposed to be a six-month leadership contest. These are very long contests, and I do wonder how much value gets added in these later days.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that aren&#39;t your core membership. This is the complaint about Alice in Redford all the way through is, you know, everybody goes out and they try and sell memberships and members have a value beyond the membership that they buy. But the longer a campaign goes, the more you&#39;re reaching past your your first targeted set to your second targeted set to your third targeted set. And the incremental value of the members being added in the fifth month is pretty minimal. minimal and oftentimes it is exactly the wrong type of membership for the party. I would love to see very quick two and three month leaderships, even a month and a half. We have at our fingertips the best communication tools we&#39;ll ever have. The problem is that campaigns need some time to spin up to raise money. But if you knew you were doing a month and a half leadership, they&#39;d spin up their money really early. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, and look, people are deadline-driven, so you&#39;re going to have that surge at the membership deadline, whether that membership deadline&#39;s in one month or in eight months. That&#39;s just the reality of things.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, if I had my druthers, I would mandate that every Canadian political party move to a shortened cycle and a delegated cycle. This one-member, one-vote cycle is the death knell of political parties.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And we kind of saw it last time with an unexpected leader, Andrew Scheer, and we might see it at this time for some people, especially, you know, for those who might be surprised and are not paying attention that Aaron O&#39;Toole could end up being that leader. So let&#39;s talk about that a bit more, because O&#39;Toole&#39;s been doing some interesting things, at least from the public facing standpoint. He talks about the party wanting to take climate change seriously. And until we get serious on climate change, we&#39;re not going to be in government. Surprising, one might say, considering he&#39;s the more further right of the two candidates with McKay and him being the top two. But let&#39;s talk about the O&#39;Toole strategy right now. Corey, I&#39;m going to to go to you on this first. If you&#39;re him right now, you know, outside of turning out the vote, are you looking to do anything else? Is there some version of an October surprise you&#39;re trying to throw into the mix? What&#39;s O&#39;Toole doing right now?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So that is something you can do with the time between the end of the membership and, you know, the shooting actually happening, the ballots actually being counted. If you think you are going to win, you can start positioning yourself for that general election, for that broader conversation with Canadians, if you don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to trigger an election. And it does seem like he&#39;s taking a bit of a pivot towards the center. Even if you argue that it&#39;s not a big policy shift for him, he hasn&#39;t exactly had a change of heart around the carbon tax, for example. The fact that he is talking about an issue that so many Canadians place so highly, but is clearly not geared towards diehard conservative voters tells you, listen, if you didn&#39;t believe me saying, hey, I&#39;m talking to insiders there who who think he he thinks he&#39;s going to win i think those actions show you that he thinks he&#39;s going to win he&#39;s starting to think about how he gets that broader tent built and he knows part of it has to be a climate change policy this is a glaring</span>

            <span class="text">yeah it was the reason i think the conservatives did so poorly in the last election it was the climate change election and they didn&#39;t have a real climate change policy if if they bring in a decent decent climate change policy um you at least check that box and realistically it&#39;s going to happen you know everybody&#39;s going to be asking for that policy anyways so get ahead of the game this is the the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So to that point, then, Corey, do you feel like this is a good strategy by O&#39;Toole? Like, the conventional wisdom is that for him to win this thing, he obviously needs McCain not to win on the first ballot. And then he needs the social conservatives that would come with Lewis and Sloan to follow him through the subsequent rounds. With that being said, there&#39;s something like, you know, bringing up climate change into the into the zeitgeist of the race help him or is that just a risk right now as you see it well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well it&#39;s impossible to know without knowing his numbers if he feels like he&#39;s going to win 55 60 percent of the vote maybe it&#39;s the time to do it maybe it&#39;s to start bleeding a tiny bit of that back and uh and position yourself for what could be a snap election if we get to we maybe we&#39;ll talk a bit about some of the the timing questions around there but um you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know You know, it&#39;s also quite possible because he comes baked in with it. It&#39;s the only Nixon could go to China thing. Maybe Aaron O&#39;Toole is the conservative who can talk about climate change because his bona fides are not really in question here. People do tend to see him as a true blue conservative. So, again, they would have numbers that would let them know that. They would have some research and some insight into that. So it&#39;s tough to measure from the outside. I would say it&#39;s not inherently a bad strategy. It really depends on what they&#39;ve got. what they understand the lay of the land to be. Carter,</span>

So if he can&#39;t pick those significant votes up, then he needs to be in a position where he can win on the first ballot. I mean, let&#39;s assume that just for fun, 40% of the third and fourth candidates, Sloan and Lewis, drop off completely. Then you&#39;re left with 60% of the total. are you getting one of three of those ones if you&#39;re peter mckay maybe if you&#39;re lucky maybe it&#39;s one in five so the math on it is pretty pretty tough it means that mckay has to be uh</span>

If they feel like they&#39;ve got that their win behind the back, you&#39;re the O&#39;Toole campaign. They feel like they&#39;re shifting to the center. What would you add to Carter&#39;s strategy about get out the vote?

The guy is full of shit. he&#39;s not actually a true blue conservative to use that phrase again so uh i i&#39;m playing my game i&#39;m not playing o&#39;toole&#39;s game um my read of this race and it could be totally wrong because everything is through a fog hearing about it on a different continent you know by sailors who pass by here but i think mckay sold the most memberships uh i think he&#39;s got an enthusiasm problem i think I think the O&#39;Toole campaign believes they have them when you consider the enthusiasm, plus, you know, plus the number of people who came maybe through McKay&#39;s membership portal, but aren&#39;t necessarily intending to vote for McKay. And if you&#39;re McKay, you got to get your vote out. You&#39;ve got, if you&#39;ve got lower enthusiasm, you got to work harder on GOTV.

            <span class="text">let&#39;s talk about everyone&#39;s favorite, cognitively brilliant President of the United States. The Donald Trump saga continues as we know it has, and as we have, I would say, rightfully ignored over the past couple of weeks for other more pressing issues. But it has not changed. The level of news coverage for Donald Trump in the United States is still in rapid fire. You know, what are we seeing recently? Well, we&#39;re seeing that his campaign is now coming out explaining why he is lost for an election that&#39;s still 100 days away. We&#39;re seeing his campaign come out and talk about polls being falsified and not counting the strong GOP enthusiasm. He&#39;s also fired his campaign manager, which, by the way, this is where you guys take a bow around the Strategist podcast being the first and only political podcast to talk about that. So take that, Canada land. By the way, let me just tell you something. When people say, why are we so petty and taking a shit on Canada land? The answer is we will not stop until we are dominating the market. And that will continue. I feel like that&#39;s just on brand. So anyways, I&#39;m going to leave that bracket on Canada land open. But anyways, no one else predicted it except us. The campaign managers fired. And now Hill Republicans are also distancing themselves from Donald Trump. Corey, what</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">even. I was going to say like 2000, but we are a frog in water. The fact that all of this has become normal is probably the most abnormal thing about it all. All of this is so deeply weird and so deeply disqualifying in any other time that it&#39;s actually a bit hard to process and it&#39;s certainly disorienting. And people talk a lot about whether Trump is crazy or crazy like a fox. Like I&#39;ve said before, I think he&#39;s just a cornered animal. I think he&#39;s just a fox, right? But when</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when you see some of these things like, oh, that&#39;s not counting the GOP support, that&#39;s not counting the GOP enthusiasm, every Republican campaign that&#39;s been losing, every presidential one in modern times has said a version of that. The Romney campaign said that. The McCain campaign said that. Do you remember the website UnSkewed Polls where they would take the support and say, well, more of the population is Republican, so let&#39;s just add Republicans into the – spoiler alert. The polls were not wrong in that case. And by the way, for everybody pointing to a polling miss in 2016, it wasn&#39;t exactly a huge miss. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. It came down to relatively few votes in the Midwest. And Nate Silver, God love him, said there was a 30% chance this would happen. And then it happened. And people were floored. You know what? Next time you go and you put money on like the first 12 on roulette, you made the same bet that Nate Silver did that Trump was going to win. So let&#39;s give credit where credit&#39;s due there and let&#39;s not take a round out of the pollsters for last time. So all to say, he&#39;s losing. He&#39;s losing right now and it may be exacerbating some of the weirdness we&#39;re seeing. In some ways, I think our best hope is he loses big because he&#39;s also making noise about maybe not accepting the outcome of this election. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m back and forth on both sides of that, because I think if he if he loses and it&#39;s close, he&#39;s going to say that it was obviously rigged. Look, we lost by a small number of votes. And if he loses and it&#39;s big, then he&#39;s going to say to his supporters, there&#39;s no way this could have happened. It&#39;s so obviously rigged. And if you look at the some of the polling has now started to ask the question, you know, is there a possibility that this election could be could be pulled or could be rigged? Most not quite most yet. I think it&#39;s 44 or 43 percent of Republican voters. Trump voters feel that this election is rigged and it is being stolen by Donald Trump. And he&#39;s got 100 days left, 100 days as of today to further that narrative. Then he gets another 100 days or thereabouts from the election until the swearing in of Joe Biden. And during both of those 100 day periods, we&#39;re going to see a misinformation campaign that is truly Trumpian because he is the king of misinformation. information. He</span>

So let&#39;s start here. Give me some headlines. What would you be doing differently if you were in the Trump bubble right now, right? And I know he does, of course, doesn&#39;t prescribe and have the values that you share, but let&#39;s say you&#39;re hired to do this.

I actually don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bad message to hit on. Corey, same question to you. Do you want to both responding to Carter? It seems</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">seems pretty clear to me that was Trump&#39;s strategy, and it&#39;s getting harder and harder to ignore COVID. And so now he&#39;s having to look at it a bit more broadly. Let&#39;s get into tinfoil hat reckless speculation here. But the other thing that occurs to me when Trump says all of a sudden COVID is a big problem is you can&#39;t cancel elections or make it hard to vote if COVID is under control and no big deal. But if the disease is terrible, if all of a sudden things are very very bad. You have a basket of tools, and they don&#39;t necessarily need to take the form</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">of outright cancelling elections. But it could be, oh, no, this is very hard. You cannot vote in person like this. And you can only vote in these ways that&#39;ll make it less convenient for you if you&#39;re of a certain demographic. So if you&#39;re lower income, and you can&#39;t take time off work, if you&#39;re a minority who is in an area with fewer voting stations and has to travel to vote, I think that in some ways him saying the disease is terrible puts some of those things on that couldn&#39;t have been on under his previous strategy. So if I&#39;m a Democrat, I&#39;m watching very, very carefully because I am a suspicious man. And if my son shall be struck by lightning, I&#39;m going to hold some people in this room accountable.

And only the ballots mailed to the zip code 20500 are going to count in this election. any any ballots mailed somewhere else aren&#39;t going to count um the states are have have invalidated their right and it wouldn&#39;t and i&#39;d watch a bunch of sycophantic republican governors line up and say it&#39;s the best idea they&#39;ve ever heard um and then the democratic governors lose their mind um supreme court would lose their mind i would hope um but it would still still be a split decision because the supreme court&#39;s a disaster but you know this is that</span>

If you are working for, let&#39;s say, one of the senators in a pretty Republican state right now, are you leaning into Trump knowing that this is a sinking ship? Are you still trying to do a slight pivot where you&#39;re distancing? What are you kind of doing if you&#39;re a Hill Republican or a Senate Senate Republican in a pretty strong Republican area. And let&#39;s be clear, Trump is losing in a lot of polls that have been traditionally very strong Republican areas. So how are you kind of distancing yourself without getting the wrath of the president for those who are going to show up for him at those polling stations? Carter?</span>

Do you feel like the issues management team within the PMO just didn&#39;t know all the facts so they couldn&#39;t dump it all out? Or do you feel like this is moving so quickly? Or this can&#39;t be strategic, I guess is what I&#39;m trying to say.

It just bothers me that this culture has happened at the Liberal Party where they don&#39;t have the foundation. Someone should walk into the minister&#39;s office, you know, whether it&#39;s the prime minister, whether it&#39;s the finance minister whether it&#39;s uh another minister you walk in and you say tell me everything now and if you don&#39;t tell me tell me everything there is to know and write your resignation letter i&#39;m not walking out of this office until i have both of those things and if something is not in you know if you haven&#39;t told me everything and something else pops up i&#39;m handing your resignation letter to the prime minister thank you we&#39;re done wow</span>

            <span class="text">yeah look i mean absent a time machine after last week he had to go to the committee if they had done radical transparency up the top and dropped everything and he could say credibly to the canadian people there&#39;s nothing left to find out here you know for weeks there&#39;s been no new details then you can get away with with trying to avoid a committee appearance but the fact that we are learning details about this so regularly just it makes it look like he&#39;s trying to hide if he doesn&#39;t go to committee so he&#39;s got to go i mean he&#39;s got to do that and And when he&#39;s there, he&#39;s got to hope there&#39;s nothing new. Now, if I&#39;m the conservatives, there&#39;s going to be something new. If they haven&#39;t held back a bit of ammunition for this, this is the show. This is the prime minister on the stand.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i mean i think the problem with that strategy is that i think canadians would only be satisfied with maybe maybe three different names uh the finance minister the prime minister and the chief of staff and i&#39;m not sure that any of those three want their heads to roll and i&#39;m not sure the prime minister wants any of those three heads to roll um so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh i don&#39;t think so maybe it would be an interesting play at this point because i don&#39;t know that it would stop the bleeding it might actually just exacerbate it because all of a sudden um well your problem fundamentally is that the most damning story story is, maybe Morneau is creeping up there with the $41,000, but the most damning story is still the prime minister&#39;s family, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Like this is, you know, the $41,000 is not even nearly, it&#39;s not even a fifth of what the prime minister&#39;s mother was paid by this organization. So it&#39;s tough to say what Morneau did was wrong, but what Trudeau did was fine. And I think that that&#39;s the challenge that they&#39;ve ultimately got right now. So I think they&#39;ve just got to, I</span>

And I want to look at the other stream very quickly of this WE scandal and saga, and that is WE themselves, the organization. So the Kuehlberger brothers will also be appearing at Finance Committee. But I want to not focus on that as much as I want to focus on their messaging and their communications. So when we chatted about them previously, last three weeks or so, we talked about, you know, what media advice we would give to them. They came out with their Globe and Mail piece. The word we is killing me right now. Oh, yeah. I&#39;m just going to say it over and over again. It is going to be the bingo card word of the show and all subsequent episodes, Corey.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">of us talked about what they were doing in terms of media strategy. Well, it turns out as soon as they did their initial apology tour, we&#39;re going to focus back on our, you know, get back to the roots of our organization. They have since moved on to a much more offensive strategy. They&#39;re going after journalists. They&#39;re going after Brian Lilly at The Sun, calling him out for a little bit of misinformation and misreporting that he had to apologize for. They&#39;re going after Charity Watch for the letter grade that Charity Watch gave them. And they&#39;re, of course, going after CanadaLand and Jesse Brown, who arguably was the first to introduce WE into the public zeitgeist. What do you kind of make of the organization&#39;s pivot from an initial, we need to introspect, we need to be true to ourselves, we&#39;re going to go back to our fundamental roots, and now saying, fuck all of you, we&#39;re just going to take as many shots as we can and go down swinging? Any kind of thoughts that you have on what you&#39;re seeing from WE?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the opening with Sunshine and Roses and then punching everybody in the face is aggressive PR in that sense. That combo is a hallmark of Navigator, a PR firm in Toronto, who I believe has been hired by WE. And you can expect to see more of that when you start thinking about a bunch of different, yeah, I&#39;m not even going to get into it, but like just Google Navigator and look at how they&#39;ve dealt with some of their PR candidates.

And I suspect that you are going to see we continue to be aggressive and continue to try to move the spotlight from them to their accusers and make people doubt whether those accusers have anything legitimate to say. That coupled with their, look, we are taking an honest look at ourselves is kind of that, you know, hug and punch strategy that Navigator is famous for. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s not such a bad strategy to deal with that, because you are not actually trying to win over the public writ large at this moment. You are trying to keep the lights on, and that means keeping the boards from moving rashly.

And now they know that they&#39;re punching people. This is, you know, they were going to be in trouble. I thought that the strategy of really reinvesting in the good work that you do, so you could go back to your corporate sponsors in six months, months, nine months, and say, look, we&#39;ve really refocused ourselves on the good work that we do overseas and for children. It&#39;s hard for corporate sponsors, I think, to walk away from good work. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s hard for corporate sponsors to walk away from a fistfight. And they&#39;re in a fistfight.

For a Gigi who does not understand the job, is wanting more from the staff. I&#39;ll tell you something, the regal representative, that is not the bright center of the universe. That is not where you get the comms people who are working until midnight each night. And if that&#39;s her expectation of them, that&#39;s because she thinks she&#39;s in politics and she&#39;s not. And so I think the misalignment actually makes me think that there&#39;s a bigger problem that you&#39;ve got to keep your eye on with the Gigi. And it&#39;s not about her being a bully. It&#39;s about the fact that she does not know what her job is.</span>
