        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dig into Alberta's latest separatist referendum push and ask the two questions that actually matter: is it inevitable, and is it likely? They break down the math behind the new 177,000-signature threshold, the organizational reality facing separatist groups, and why last summer's "Forever Canadian" petition may have been lightning in a bottle rather than a new normal.</p><p>What political price does the UCP pay for flirting with separatism? Do pro-Canada forces need to organize again, or is ignoring the petition the smartest strategy? And if this thing somehow makes it to a referendum, which of the three hosts is least emotionally prepared to live through the campaign without yelling at strangers on the internet? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p>You can also watch our episodes on YouTube.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod</a></p>

It was there There were a lot of adults kind of in the steering committee, people of all kinds of political persuasions with a lot of expertise and a lot of experience in politics and in law and, you know, really good faith, great Canadians were kind of behind it, helping it along, ensuring that they won every single one of the legal fights, you know, the interpretations with elections, none of that horsepower exists in the separatists. And in fact, you&#39;re going to get competing conspiracy theorists and turf wars and all kinds of people live streaming their grievances and not a lot of organization. And so finding that message and that one messenger is going to be really, really difficult for them. And I don&#39;t think that they can find someone who can kind of straddle that world of the soft separatist or the, you know, the sort of like the person for whom the Venn diagram, you know, they&#39;re going to vote UCP and they don&#39;t maybe mind Carney too much. They&#39;re grumpy a little bit, but they want to send a message. Finding those voters is going to take a specific kind of message and mobilization. And I don&#39;t see that coming from a bunch of a merry band of conspiracy theorists. Carter,</div>

That is a strategic problem for the New Democrats. And I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s going to, you know, work itself out.
