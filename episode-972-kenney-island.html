There&#39;s two things that the people love. The people love the nonsensical games that we play. How dare you call them nonsensical, Dan Arnold. And secondly, the people, they love the Patrick Brown content. Stephen Carter, this is no surprise to you. No,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, two big lessons is maybe when you&#39;re doing a new segment, start with like four doors instead of eight, just maybe for a time thing. Why?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Why? Why? I&#39;m not asking for feedback. I&#39;m asking for reaction. That&#39;s very different. If I wanted feedback, you could leave it on the Apple Podcasts app with a five-star review and just a gentle nudge of feedback, Corey. That&#39;s not, we don&#39;t do feedback here. We do reactions. actions i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah why would you need me you could have just pieced my track and just follow it along i mean it&#39;s you don&#39;t need me for that that&#39;s why i thought you guys were doing it and then when i seen saw nothing come out i was like a lot of work just absolutely</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay yeah carter I know you shy away from work. We&#39;ve got a lot to talk about. We&#39;re going to focus the bulk of our attention to our home province here in Alberta. Let&#39;s make it to our first segment. Our first segment, making sense of all the horseshit. Oh, guys, there is so much going on. There is the price of oil. There is the Kenny Leadership Review. There is the early election rumor mill that keeps churning out more. Well, what does a rumor mill churn out generally? Heat? Noise? Electricity? It&#39;s turning out noise, heat, and electricity. But where should we start, guys? I want to start with, you know, perhaps going back a little bit to what has made this interesting, which is the budget and the price of oil. And Corey, you know, we are now seeing the price of oil in Alberta near record, if not at record highs. Give me your reflections on that from the political perspective that is Jason Kenney&#39;s survivability heading into April 9th.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well um the most obvious answer is it&#39;s good for it because it provides him both a balanced budget which is good for him and it provides money that you can then splash around not to mention even if you step outside of government land it means profits are up for a lot of oil and gas companies it it means all sorts of money is splashing around alberta in a way that it hasn&#39;t been for a few years here so price of oil short term pretty good uh for the province of alberta you You have, I mean, WCS, literally, literally two years ago, people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people would have paid you to take it if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">if you were in Alberta. If you had the ability to take it, you could have actually charged them to do so. It&#39;s like garbage, right? Because that&#39;s what we do with garbage. We pay people to take away garbage.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Now, WCS is over $100 US a barrel. I mean, it&#39;s quite a wild turnaround and, you know, all good in the short term if you happen to be the government of Alberta. long</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">term maybe not so good because this will accelerate people looking for alternatives to oil and gas and obviously that was one of the one of the things that caused a lot of anxiety last time we saw wti around these numbers um but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but yeah i mean if you&#39;re if you&#39;re entirely focused on april 9th a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a high price of oil in the province of alberta doesn&#39;t offer a lot of downside although obviously if you hit the gas pumps and you see it at you know a buck 60 i think it was as i was driving here that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s um that&#39;s a problem garter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">garter talk to me about the relationship cory&#39;s given to it given it to a straight right higher price of oil for kenny surplus</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">surplus budget equals good news heading into april 9th is it is it that do you agree that that&#39;s the basic sort of template here because then i want to kind of stress test it a bit well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i&#39;m not sure that i i do necessarily agree that it&#39;s the provincial</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">provincial budget moves on oil and gas so if you ever want to balance the provincial budget without incurring pain, then you have to hope and pray for high oil and gas prices. That has been the pattern that has existed since, you know, Peter Lougheed. And the Alberta advantage that Ralph Klein always talked about was a low tax environment offset with a high resource revenue environment. So if you want to be popular like Ralph Klein, who got 55% in his his last leadership review, then yes, you can, in fact, just count on high oil prices. And so maybe high oil prices will give him the requirement he needs on April the 9th. But high oil and gas prices in and of itself are not some sort of magic recipe for happiness within the province of Alberta. We have been unhappy before in booms when we don&#39;t think that we&#39;re being served properly. Alice in Redford, you know, barely hung on. And in 2012, we barely won that election over Danielle Smith, because people didn&#39;t like the way we were managing our oil and gas revenue. There are many, many challenges that come with having a balanced budget. Or so it&#39;s balanced now. But if we were to look into Corey&#39;s cracked crystal ball about where we&#39;re going to be moving in the future, one imagines a significant surplus in in the next budget that comes just before the election. And by significant, just to put just to put a frame around it, we&#39;re talking five to ten billion dollars or more or more because no one projected. So, this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this budget that we&#39;re working on right now is based approximately on $70 WTI, so West Texas Intermediate. And Corey mentioned WCS, which is Western Canada Select. These are the different types of product that you can buy and sell. Western Canada Select is not as good a product. What</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">What are you going to do?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">close enough. They&#39;re reference barrels. Like, oil is different. Oil is going to have different levels of sulfur. So we talk about how sweet or sour it is, and oil is going to have different gravity, API gravity. We talk about it in terms of light or heavy. And so WCS is the price of a barrel that&#39;s pretty heavy and pretty sour in Hardesty, Alberta. WTI is a barrel that&#39;s pretty light and pretty sweet in Cushing, Oklahoma. So like there&#39;s – There&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s big differences between the products, but they&#39;re the same product, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I want to talk to you about if the product has an impact in this leadership review. Here&#39;s where I was trying to get to with this question after getting your initial comments, which is we&#39;ve often talked about how for many heading into April 9th, the date of Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership review, viability will be for his ongoing leadership will probably be based on a couple of metrics. And you guys have brought up polls quite often. Has he bottomed out and is he rising in the polls? Does he sense that we&#39;re now going up? The question I have is, does this recent budget and the associated price of oil, which are interlinked, right, to be very clear, are interlinked for our listeners across the country in many ways, does that override things like the polls? Does that override things like the membership counts? Like, how good is this news for Jason Kenney is what I&#39;m trying to get to. And maybe I&#39;ll kind of throw a double barrel question here, oil pun intended, which is, if you are wanting to replace Jason Kenney, if you are someone who&#39;s thinking about it, flirting with it, and you&#39;re going to see that this surplus may be bigger, that these macroeconomic conditions may just go on, is it now a great time to get rid of them? You can back yourself into the same, quote unquote, good economy that he might have as a gift on the back end of this review. So I wanted to get that sense. How good of news is this? And then let&#39;s talk about the alternatives from the political side. Corey, I&#39;ll let you take a stab at that first. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I would say not good enough. One of the challenges Jason Kenney has in terms of the narrative around the balanced budget is that oil has now gone so high, like, you know, just through the stratosphere. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was looking at some of the, you know, outside of market hour pricing that we have right now.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s totally mental. I mean, we may very well be hitting the highest prices of oil before the end of the week that we&#39;ve seen and in kind of like not, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">adjusted terms, but maybe even adjusted terms here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That doesn&#39;t help him so much. In some ways, he almost needs oil to be a little lower, like $80, $90 a barrel where people are like, yeah, no, maybe it&#39;s good leadership. Maybe it&#39;s good stewardship they got here. But it&#39;s so high</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">high into the stratosphere. Everybody understands that the price of oil is what&#39;s driving these good times. Right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right. So he doesn&#39;t want to get the credit for it in that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that sense. Yeah. It takes some of the credit away because we&#39;re all talking about the price of oil. Like if we weren&#39;t talking about the price of oil, he could have maybe seized a little bit more of that. The other problem is, and I mentioned this or hinted at this, was the gas pumps. It&#39;s much more expensive. Our bills, when we get our heating bills here in Alberta, most heating is done by natural gas. Well, that&#39;s also going to be something that people&#39;s eyes pop out of their head and say, what the fuck? How is this so expensive? And then cost of living becomes a consideration as well. And there is an NDP opposition that will very ably beat them to death on the cost of living arguments, right? Which is, I think, why Jason Kenney has made some comments about looking for ways to reduce the price of gasoline for Albertans over the next bit here. Carter,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, talk to me about Corey&#39;s statement here, which is he says it&#39;s not good enough. If it was kind of lower, he might be getting credit for it entirely rather than us just, you know, all rushing towards the macro trends and the global issue that is oil supply and pricing. pricing how good is the news for jason kenney on the record high prices of oil well</span>

Earlier this week, when asked by a reporter what the threshold for victory was, Jason Kenney said, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here, in a democracy, it&#39;s 50% plus one. I think we, you both, I shouldn&#39;t say we three, but you both had stated that that is more than likely the bar he was going to go with. Still the right move, flashing forward a month from when we&#39;d recorded that last podcast. Do you agree with what Jason Kenney did, setting the bar, well, so low for himself?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. He needed to set the bar so low. What he did not do, which we recommended, was to tie it to the new constitution, you know, to the constitution that was just recently agreed to by the members of the party. This is the members&#39; party, and I will always respect the members&#39; wishes. The members chose 50% plus one to be their threshold. I&#39;m going to abide by that because I think that that&#39;s in the best interest of the party, and that&#39;s what the members wanted. They easily could have set it at 65, 68, 78. It could have been any of those numbers. They chose 50% plus one because in our party, we respect democracy. democracy. He skipped that part, and he just did the 50% plus one is the rules, and I&#39;m going to follow the rules. Kind of a weak moment for him, because I think that he could have done it a lot better.

If this is the number you&#39;re going to go, he did it in a presser, if I&#39;m not mistaken, where he was asked a question by someone. one would you tell me about the tactical execution of something like this of setting the frame from strength despite it maybe not being a strong point what else would you have done the</span>

Not brought by Flair Airlines. Corey, 50% plus one. Is that right? Is that still right, I guess, right? And then let&#39;s get into the nitty gritty of how he did it. And the second number I was going to throw on the table for you guys was 2,900, which was the membership or the amount of people registered. But, Corey, go back to 50% plus one. Let&#39;s talk about that. What could have made it better? Was it still the right number? Then let&#39;s talk about all the ramifications of what 2,900 could mean as we jump into perhaps the speculation game a bit. I</span>

Before we talk about what 2,900 members might lead to in terms of an outcome, Carter, let&#39;s say he does get 50% plus one. Let&#39;s just throw out a number. Let&#39;s say he gets 55. Yeah.</span>

And I&#39;ll put it in historical context. When Alison Redford lost basically the confidence of her caucus in 2014, she very easily could have, you</span>

If he loses confidence of the House after April the 9th, then he&#39;s going to go to an election. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true. I think that that&#39;s a threat. But 55, if I were advising him, I would say, you know, 55, you know, it&#39;s not enough. enough. Ralph Klein couldn&#39;t stick with 55. You&#39;ve got to go. And you ain&#39;t no Ralph Klein, sir. So that would be my advice. But I&#39;m not sure where the number is, Zane. You picked 55. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;d pick 58 if I would have said the same thing.

I mean, you could have a weird situation where the caucus says, actually, we don&#39;t have confidence in you. But you do that through voting non-confidence. And that&#39;s where we get into some weird situations, right? Right. Like, is the UCP going to vote? Is the UCP caucus going to vote non-confidence in their own premier, which would, you know, conventionally then trigger either an election or going to the leader of the opposition?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, yeah, for sure he can. And we&#39;ve talked about this in different contexts. But one of the interesting things about our system of government, which is kind of this hybrid of the traditional British system and the American system with primaries and all of that, and even, you know, it&#39;s just constantly evolving, I guess is what I would say. The way we elect leaders and way we depose of them is very different. And that asymmetry allows each side a lot of very interesting strategic options. So if you are Jason Kenney and you believe in a one member, one vote, anybody can show up context, you&#39;ve got a better chance. Well,</span>

I only got, I got 49.8% of the vote or whatever it ends up being. I know I started by saying a loss is a loss, but if it&#39;s really close, this is a choice that you&#39;ve got. But big</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">big caveat here, Jason Kenney also controlled the board, which chose the leadership review rule. So if he believed that was the most advantageous system for him, I suspect we&#39;d already be using that system for the leadership review. Good point. Because that&#39;s certainly possible. And, you know, on the other hand, when you have a new leader, and that&#39;s a popularly elected leader, but it&#39;s delegates who then get to review it, you</span>

            <span class="text">can have interesting strategic choices the other way. In Jason Kenney&#39;s case here, though, I think knowing that he got to pick the most advantageous means for him and that he would still lose, I don&#39;t know why he would then go to a leadership contest because, you know, unless the ground has changed so fundamentally since he made that initial calculation or if he decides that calculation was wrong, it just seems like a way to lose bigger.

I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s as big as the biggest stuff that, you know, Ralph Klein was overseeing in the heyday, or Peter Lougheed. You know what?

And, you know, I had a bit of a little tweet thread about this the other day, but there&#39;s a couple of other numbers, I think, that need some context.

Are you leaning into potential leadership replacements? Like, what are you trying to do right now with about a month to go with some of the dribs and drabs that you have? Let&#39;s say this number is good for you. Let&#39;s just go with that assumption. What are you trying to do by showcasing the numbers, showcasing the size?

I&#39;ve seen all the kids come off the buses from the Catholic private schools in rural Alberta. I&#39;ve seen, you know, I&#39;ve seen them attack, you know, Sandra Jansen. If, you know, Jason Kenney can organize big numbers. So if I&#39;m on Team Rebel, I&#39;m making telephone calls saying we are behind. We are, but we&#39;re in it. We are 100 votes back. We can totally get ahead of this thing. We need the numbers to be 6,000 if we&#39;re going to be able to compete because that guy can pull 3,000 votes minimum. So we need to get at least our 3,000 people there as well.</span>

            <span class="text">back together. Carter, talk to me about messaging from your perspective. There&#39;s two things that I think Jason Kenney has in the messaging quiver that he&#39;s been putting out. And let&#39;s be clear, he&#39;s publicly campaigning for this, right? Things have been lining up, both on timing and on message. But two things I want you to address as leader of the official rebel opposition, which is number one, he&#39;s characterizing this as a moderate conservative himself versus a far right. Curious to get your take on that messaging. And number two, he&#39;s talking about the economic growth under his watch. How are you undermining both of those points?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I would say that this isn&#39;t about economic performance. It&#39;s not about any, you know, any minor uptick that&#39;s been caused by external factors. I mean, sure, COVID was an external factor. Yes, this is an external factor with the oil price. That doesn&#39;t matter how big the external factors are. What matters is how will we respond to them. And Jason Kenney cannot respond to them. I mean, there&#39;s been 18 months of polls, 18 months of polls back to back to back to back to back with the UCP in second.</span>

Because the numbers need to support a story. It&#39;s got to support a narrative. And you&#39;ve got to be careful because a poll that says we&#39;re not losing by as much is maybe not very helpful for you in the narrative.</span>

In a perfect world, if you had a poll that showed the UCP back in the lead, then for sure you&#39;re going to find a way to get that out in some way, shape or form and say, yeah, see, happy times are here again.

Or is there any sort of persuasion? I mean, the weekend will be focused on persuasion, ironically right speeches commentary like i&#39;m assuming video highlight reels like the leader will speak we&#39;ll have the general metrics of the leader speaking how many people sit on their hands but what do you what are you looking for in terms of april 9th for you from a raw political organizing sense is it strict activation mobilization ensure people got out yeah</span>

I think it&#39;ll be changing on peer to peer relationships. So you&#39;re going to show up and you&#39;re going to walk in the door and you&#39;re going to see Fred. And you haven&#39;t seen Fred for four years. And you move your cane a little bit and he moves his cane a little bit.

Well, those were our principles then and these are our principles now. And let&#39;s stay to those principles and both vote the same way.

Do you agree with Corey&#39;s analysis that the early election is a post-leadership review mechanism for Kenney and not a pre? Or do you think there is merit to the pre-leadership review, call the trigger, finest justification election call? I&#39;m curious to get your thoughts on this.</span>

            <span class="text">There are only two times for an early election. So there&#39;s three election times in my mind. The first is immediately after when he loses. Like if he wins the leadership, you hear 55% examples and it&#39;s probably the best one. 55% Jason Kenney wins he still loses some people who essentially walk to the other side of the house, they lose a confidence vote, they immediately go into an election. That is one I could see I don&#39;t think it&#39;s high probability the higher probability early election is that a new leader is selected in June, the new leader or July or whenever the hell they pick it and then the new leader says I was not elected, I need need a mandate and they ride that that significant piece and sometime in september october we have another election and then of course the third most and and the most likely in my mind election time is the uh is the the set date in in april of 2020 2020 whatever it is three four to three</span>

I can only have success with that in a negotiation context if I have evidence that this house is behind me. So I need a vote of this house that says that I have the support of the house, right? And I expect it to be unanimous from my side of the caucus, or else there&#39;s just no point in doing this, right? Right. Really try to raise the stakes even beyond kind of a literal confidence vote, I think, but make it exclusively about confidence in Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership. Right. All of these clouds over this, how ambiguous this is, you know, this leadership review, which, you know, is in the future. Like all of this impedes me from being able to do the things I need to do for Alberta. And the higher you can make the stakes on those things for Alberta, the better. I think some stuff around pipelines would be him going back to a well he&#39;s gone to many, many times. if you want to talk about negotiating the end of RCMP providing provincial policing perhaps that becomes one if you want to talk about an Alberta pension plan perhaps that becomes one I think those two are perhaps too unpopular to go into a general election on though so my suspicion is it would have to be something that was more universally</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, so on scale of 1 to 10, the scale does start at 1, what do you give Jason Kenney for his strategy and message on saying that ending global dependence on conflict oil is essential for international peace. Alberta can be part of that solution as he subtweets and talks about the crisis in Ukraine, many calling it opportunistic, others saying this is exactly what we need. What would you give Jason Kenney on a one to 10 scale for the strategy to come out ham fistedly about conflict oil and lean into his long term narrative that he&#39;s been talking about reethical oil?</span>

Things are going great for you. Things are just going great. Why are you putting the knife in everybody else&#39;s back? This is going to turn too. Corey mentioned it at the beginning. What&#39;s good for Alberta today leads towards things being worse for Alberta in a shorter term. Germany is talking about a 15-year ramp up on its removal of fossil fuels. fuels. We&#39;re going to see car companies moving. You know, they were 2030, they were trying to sell more electric vehicles than fossil fuels. Watch that shift. Watch that shift to 2028, 2027. We&#39;re going to see massive shifting. And I&#39;m not just saying that with confirmation bias, because Corey and I both want to have an electric vehicle.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s all about the most domestic of domestic politics. It&#39;s about leadership politics. It&#39;s about party politics. It&#39;s not even about the province. And when you consider it through the lens of that audience, it makes sense. If you want to consider it through the lens of kind of common sense, the general Canadian public, something like that. Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s really it&#39;s not helpful for a couple of different reasons here. It&#39;s never been that clear to me that it&#39;s a particularly realistic idea that we were going to ship oil across the continent to the east, incurring those shipping costs, then upgrade it at a refinery in</span>

            <span class="text">in New Brunswick, and then put it on a boat and then take it across the ocean. I mean, that&#39;s a pretty complicated flow. It seems more likely that it would stay on the continent, it would offset oil elsewhere.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And all of this would take years and years and years. I guess That&#39;s the thing I want to underline here. So when we talk about the immediate crisis, none of this is going to help. None of this is going to help in any way, shape, or form. And so I think that&#39;s why people say it&#39;s opportunistic. Now, if</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Probably still not. Like, you know, I don&#39;t think Europe was ever a big market under consideration for us. So it doesn&#39;t even feel like Monday morning quarterbacking. It just feels like trying to shoehorn your issue into somebody else&#39;s issue. And the common thread is oil, sure.

Now, I don&#39;t know if anything&#39;s happening on the 9th, but April 10th, I can give you possession.
