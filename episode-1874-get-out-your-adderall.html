If you don&#39;t, you need to ask yourself about your life choices. If you don&#39;t have 10 or 15 people that that you could phone up just at the drop of a hat to be like, I have this problem.

I&#39;ve said it before that I suspect that Donald Trump has a lot more respect for Mark Carney than Donald Trump has for anybody else, because Carney comes from the world that Donald Trump admires and envies, and that&#39;s for people who&#39;ve made money.

I would actually put it just beyond the NATO summit, Heather, And because there&#39;s going to be these big things in the air, right? And even if communities, organized labor, others start to really say, like, what are you doing on these tariffs? What are we doing to respond? Or start really ramping up the pressure on Carney to talk about publicly or even with smaller groups of people what is actually happening in these negotiations. He still has a bit of air cover of, you know, big lightning in the sky files. The NATO summit&#39;s going to be a big defense push from them. And so he has a bit of time. But if the opposition&#39;s smart, they&#39;re going to be starting to, as I said last week, starting to talk about unemployment across the board, right? Because these job losses are in private sector, highly unionized sectors. So that&#39;s the first thing.

I also understand that Trump has decided not to attend the G20 this year. So what Carney&#39;s kind of doing is essentially like inviting the whole world. In other words, sort of like diluting him and kind of making it a little mini G20, right? He&#39;s got the Aussies there. He&#39;s got obviously India. He&#39;s invited Claudia Scheinbaum. That&#39;s right. Yeah, but I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s coming. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s, but and so, you know, okay, I understand what we&#39;re trying to do here. But, you know, if you&#39;re trying to dilute Trump or add larger economies, I mean, I can think of some that haven&#39;t meddled in our elections or killed our citizens on our soil. And so I would be looking at, you know, why not invite a South Africa, Brazil, you know, there are other countries in the bricks, not just India. There are other large economies with whom we can expand our trading relationships. That&#39;s what I would be looking at doing. I just don&#39;t think that</div>

Anyway, whenever he won the leadership in 22 and the election, people got a good look at him. And now that&#39;s the outcome of it. And so they&#39;re going to have to be really mindful of that and make sure that they have a plan in place, that they are cutting their caucus in on that plan, because this stuff will bubble over the summer. and they better have a plan for some rehab in September and October on his image, his tone, his substance, all of it, because they can&#39;t.
