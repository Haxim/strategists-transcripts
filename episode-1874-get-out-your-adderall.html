And so I&#39;m going to go back and forth and you&#39;re just going to try to throw rules at me. Just simple, easy to understand rules from an elected official side and then Carter from a practitioner, staffer, whatever you want to call it, side, in terms of how to win a political breakup.</span>

Like this must not have been a situation where it was a mutual parting of ways. Someone was fired. Someone was let go. Timing is a very interesting one. Right.

So Elon, Trump, strong, like not equivalent, but strong brands, Carter and principal, insert principal X here, like you&#39;re a well-known political commodity. Now, not as much as the mayor, but to those that matter, you are well-known in a sense. So, like, I think you can borrow this, but there are other political staffers that are also well-known. What do you kind of make of some of the rules both of you have put on the table when the brands are perhaps a little bit more equal than not, where advantage is not just default to the politician?</span>

And by extension, you may know know where i&#39;m going and you feel free to answer whatever you feel comfortable with did you ever consult external advice when in any of the situations that you found yourself in from a maybe legal shore but i&#39;m thinking more communications in that regard oh</span>

It is important to make sure that there is accuracy in that you stand up for yourself. As for talking to outside people, like I said before, like, hopefully, good heavens, if you are a political person, either on the staff or the elected side, you have a friend or two that is a professional that you can talk to. If you don&#39;t, you need to ask yourself about your life choices. If you don&#39;t have 10 or 15 people that that you could phone up just at the drop of a hat to be like, I have this problem. Do you have 10 minutes to talk to me? I want to know what you think I</span>

            <span class="text">do. If those people aren&#39;t in your phone, question your life choices and go make some friends. Because if you&#39;ve been in this business for, you know, five plus years or, you know, and that&#39;s like at the bare minimum, if you&#39;ve been in it much longer, like Carter and I have, you better have those people. And they should come from all kinds of different perspectives on the the ideological spectrum and elsewhere. You should know people, and you should have a good enough relationship with them that they want to do you a solid of listening to you rant for five to seven minutes and then giving you their take on what you should do next.</span>

And if they&#39;re not, the vacuum seems to be saying, oh, these are related, and this is not going well for Carney, so to speak.

I would actually put it just beyond the NATO summit, Heather, And because there&#39;s going to be these big things in the air, right? And even if communities, organized labor, others start to really say, like, what are you doing on these tariffs? What are we doing to respond? Or start really ramping up the pressure on Carney to talk about publicly or even with smaller groups of people what is actually happening in these negotiations. He still has a bit of air cover of, you know, big lightning in the sky files. The NATO summit&#39;s going to be a big defense push from them. And so he has a bit of time. But if the opposition&#39;s smart, they&#39;re going to be starting to, as I said last week, starting to talk about unemployment across the board, right? Because these job losses are in private sector, highly unionized sectors. So that&#39;s the first thing.

And he has to find a deal that doesn&#39;t drive Canada into a permanent situation with an unstable White House and another, what, like six, eight months until the politics and the bid terms start to turn up?

But would a G7 deal on home soil with the US, obviously there&#39;s dramatic flair to it and Carney&#39;s not immune to that.

I get it. I also understand that Trump has decided not to attend the G20 this year. So what Carney&#39;s kind of doing is essentially like inviting the whole world. In other words, sort of like diluting him and kind of making it a little mini G20, right? He&#39;s got the Aussies there. He&#39;s got obviously India. He&#39;s invited Claudia Scheinbaum. That&#39;s right. Yeah, but I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s coming. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s, but and so, you know, okay, I understand what we&#39;re trying to do here. But, you know, if you&#39;re trying to dilute Trump or add larger economies, I mean, I can think of some that haven&#39;t meddled in our elections or killed our citizens on our soil. And so I would be looking at, you know, why not invite a South Africa, Brazil, you know, there are other countries in the bricks, not just India. There are other large economies with whom we can expand our trading relationships. That&#39;s what I would be looking at doing. I just don&#39;t think that</span>

However, Canadians got a good, solid look at that guy in a way they didn&#39;t even between when he won in whenever it was 2020, like 22, 23. Anyway, whenever he won the leadership in 22 and the election, people got a good look at him. And now that&#39;s the outcome of it. And so they&#39;re going to have to be really mindful of that and make sure that they have a plan in place, that they are cutting their caucus in on that plan, because this stuff will bubble over the summer. and they better have a plan for some rehab in September and October on his image, his tone, his substance, all of it, because they can&#39;t.
