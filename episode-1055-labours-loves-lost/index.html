        <p>The gang talk go through a grab-bag of political issues that include A.I. generated ads, the muted response by opposition leaders on the VW battery plant and the CBC president's letter to Pierre Poilievre before diving into the ongoing public sector strike.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter perform a “strategy check-in” on the CBC, A.I. in politics and more before turning to the ongoing PSAC strike in the federal public service. Are Justin Trudeau and Doug Ford in a full-blown “bromance”? Can PSAC keep the public on their side during a prolonged strike? And where can we find the audio files Stephen Carter is creating of Zain and Corey? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">Yes. And I think the bigger problem is that politics can get away with not being truthful in their advertisements. But, but ultimately, I think that there&#39;s a certain art to it. And I don&#39;t really care if you used AI, or if you rotoscoped it, or if you animated it, or you used any of the other number of storytelling tools we use, that&#39;s not of concern to me. And your eyes deceive you all the time. Frankly, AI is a little easier to see that you&#39;re being deceived than than a lot of the other more sophisticated tools that we use currently. Carter,</div>
