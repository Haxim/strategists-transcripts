If they don&#39;t put the notwithstanding clause in, then they run afoul of the courts, which have ruled on very similar type of ideas in British Columbia. Am I correct in that, Shannon? That&#39;s right. So I throw back to you, but ultimately, they have to go the route of the notwithstanding clause. They have to remove fundamental rights that are yours and mine that will not apply to teachers starting as soon as this act is passed. And I don&#39;t think that people really understand. I think that when you think of back to work legislation, you think, well, you know, the government can order someone back and that&#39;s fine. fine um but if you&#39;re having to invoke the notwithstanding clause then people start to wonder okay well what is it that we&#39;re giving up and i think that that&#39;s what ultimately</span>

And I also want to tease the fact that there is a leaked memo memo that was provided to the broader media and political ecosystem a few months ago in regards to Daniel Smith using the notwithstanding clause on the trans legislation, the three trans bills. So this is not that, to be clear. That is still coming, this session. So there&#39;s a chance the notwithstanding clause makes a two-time appearance in the next, what, week?</span>

            <span class="text">It is also a question for broader civil society and the broader labor movement. And it really depends on what the response is and how swift it is, how decisive it is, how it stretches across the economy, and how it reaches into people&#39;s lives, to Carter&#39;s point. And we have yet to see that, but we won&#39;t see it until they&#39;re moving through the stages of the bill, which is happening as we speak. And once it passes, I think we will see the labor movement take some significant steps. But it&#39;s a question of how actors use their power in the system. Power sloshes around a system. And it&#39;s not fixed at any one time. So, yeah.</span>

Whether you were expecting it today or not, whether you thought this was going to be, you know, done slightly differently, whether this happens again next week on the Trans Right stuff, let&#39;s talk about the most strategic, optimal</span>

            <span class="text">optimal response, Carter. And I do want to include the groups that Shannon has mentioned. Let&#39;s talk about the New Democrats. Let&#39;s talk about labor. And then let&#39;s give the third bucket to civil society, which I think can include the broader populace, nonprofit groups, those that are tangentially related, unrelated to this, just people, people who are active, mobile, partisan, nonpartisan. I&#39;ll put that in the third civil society bucket. Shannon, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s how you would define them. That&#39;s how I would, too. OK, let&#39;s start with the New Democrats, Carter. Carter. And let&#39;s start with what they need to do as it relates to in the legislature and then outside of the legislature, because they&#39;ll have a process here, I imagine, and both of you can tag team on this. I imagine it won&#39;t be a successful process, but they&#39;ll have things that they do. What do they need to do inside the legislature here? And what do they need to do outside? And then let&#39;s go to union labor, union slash labor, and then let&#39;s go to civil society. Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I mean, ultimately inside the legislature, they need to raise their voices and fail because ultimately they will fail in the legislature. So failing isn&#39;t necessarily bad. Failing is part of this. But when you fail, you must be able to point your finger at someone else and say that it&#39;s their fault, right? I failed, but it&#39;s ultimately Danielle Smith&#39;s fault. This is bad. This is going to hurt people. This is a bad direction to go in. So that&#39;s what I&#39;m anticipating from inside. What I don&#39;t want them to do is to think that the whole world lives inside the legislature. I don&#39;t want them to start thinking the solution to this is filibustering the rest of the legislation or to try and hold things up or</span>

Let me throw things out right in the in the United States. They&#39;ve done live streams of the Democratic sort of establishment, you know, staying up all night and, you know, you know, doing midnight sort of things.
