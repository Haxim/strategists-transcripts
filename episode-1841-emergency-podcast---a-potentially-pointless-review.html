You&#39;re doing a lot of political gimmicks with my portfolio. I don&#39;t enjoy your full confidence. See you the fuck later. Also, this happens to be the day that I deliver the Fez. P.S.

Yeah, she has a bit of a list of the various things that she thinks Canadians need at this particular moment. And then goes on to say, I think Canadians would appreciate if a government addressed these things and took these actions. I know Canadians would recognize and respect such an approach. But there&#39;s such an approach that she lists ahead of time includes things like working in good faith and humility with the premiers. years so this i&#39;ve never seen a letter with so much subtext and actually i gotta tell you one of the things that i just love as a comms professional is she&#39;s really showing the power of the written word and like very carefully choosing words for maximum intrigue maximum damage maximum discussion she has crafted in one page a real masterpiece of a very professional go fuck yourself justin oh</div>

Look, you can&#39;t script these things. and um and so you know doug forrest saying like oh you know i really like christia i talked to her earlier today i put i put her on speakerphone so all the other premiers could talk to her too like imagine that like he&#39;s on speakerphone being like guys i&#39;m not gonna be around anymore and they&#39;re like don&#39;t go christian or whatever the fucking conversation was yeah it&#39;s crazy courtesy was not applied to the cabinet or the caucus one would imagine oh no oh no and you know so So that does, you know, letting it sit out there, let everybody react to you.

Carter, it seems like one of the miscalculations was is that as soon as Chrystia Freeland stepped into that room virtually or over the phone or in person with Justin Trudeau, they never viewed her as an opponent, despite what the news was.

If you have ambitions of leadership going forward, you have just done yourself a massive service.

You resign and you prorogue, which allows you then to have a leadership contest in some way, shape, or form, and you try to do it fast. Actually, it&#39;s so interesting to think about because we&#39;ve still got this tariff challenge that we&#39;re staring down here, right? But I think that that has to be the bundle. And maybe it&#39;s prorogation and you resign, you basically let it be signaled all in, like we&#39;re going to start this leadership contest after the swearing in of the president and once we get there. I don&#39;t know, but like they go together. There&#39;s no reason in my mind to prorogue unless</div>
