            <span class="text">That&#39;s not bad. I call it the ideal, the model way to quit, which is give your boss the middle finger, flip over his desk, and leap through the window with a parachute. Stephen Carter, Christopher Freeland has done all of that. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">yeah even carter let&#39;s talk to me about this letter it&#39;s a one One pager by Christopher Freeland. Here are the beats. You told me, Prime Minister, to take on another cabinet position on Friday. I&#39;m now saying I can&#39;t do that. My only path is to resign. You&#39;re doing a lot of political gimmicks with my portfolio. I don&#39;t enjoy your full confidence. See you the fuck later. Also, this happens to be the day that I deliver the Fez. P.S. I&#39;m running in the next election. Did I miss</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No. There&#39;s one thing that you didn&#39;t miss, but you kind of breezed over, and I want to just stop for a minute. Tariff? Yeah, she has a bit of a list of the various things that she thinks Canadians need at this particular moment. And then goes on to say, I think Canadians would appreciate if a government addressed these things and took these actions. I know Canadians would recognize and respect such an approach. But there&#39;s such an approach that she lists ahead of time includes things like working in good faith and humility with the premiers. years so this i&#39;ve never seen a letter with so much subtext and actually i gotta tell you one of the things that i just love as a comms professional is she&#39;s really showing the power of the written word and like very carefully choosing words for maximum intrigue maximum damage maximum discussion she has crafted in one page a real masterpiece of a very professional go fuck yourself justin oh</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">oh this this is this is probably one of the best if we make a coffee table book, which we will, of Go Fuck Yourselves. We&#39;ll obviously have some of the classics. This is the cover, though. This might be the cover. Certainly, Carter, it will be in a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">worksheet that people can have, because it&#39;s, of course, going to be a coffee table book where you can detach it and do your own fuck you letters. Stephen Carter, here&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Here&#39;s the thing. Let&#39;s talk about the content of her letter, sure, but I also want to talk about the strategy energy of her letter, because she has caused maximum chaos. And the question I have for you before you talk about this is, if you were strategically advising her, could she have done it in any other way to create more maximum chaos? Or was this a masterclass, not just in content, but also in strategic execution?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t think that there was any way of causing more chaos, but was it intentional? I think that yes, on some levels, it was intentional, because Because she could have resigned tomorrow. She could have sucked it up for a little while and done her economic update. She chose to go today. That has put the Prime Minister on the back foot, to say the very least. The entire government is, frankly, on the back foot. And this is the signal to the rest of caucus, to the rest of government, that things are way</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">before just moving them out of cabinet i think this is a a major major blow uh to to justin trudeau and i don&#39;t think it could Could have been struck with that. There&#39;s strategy questions</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">questions on both sides. His strategy, and did he screw this up, and her strategy, and did she nail this? Corey, respond to her strategy first. Did she just nail this from a strategic perspective if her goal was pure chaos and maximum hurt and pain for the PM? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think that I would agree that this is about as good as it gets, and I&#39;ll tell you why.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, walk me through it. Because of the second part, the part that we&#39;ll get to in a minute here, but the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the prime minister, I&#39;m sorry, he did this to himself in the sense that he handed her the mother of all bats to hit him with. And so it&#39;s not the letter, it&#39;s the letter at this moment, and it&#39;s the letter at this moment with no notice, which causes the chaos, and that&#39;s what&#39;s so lethal. On the day</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">day of the Fez. This is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is it. We&#39;ll talk about the Fez in a minute here, right? But you have a situation where the opponent really handed you everything you need to make them really hurt about it. And so then she executed the tactics, I think, really well. I mentioned the written word that&#39;s there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, really controlled her message going out like that. I think it was super smart of her not to put herself in front of a camera, let her words speak for themselves, let her friends and colleagues speak for her qualities. And I mean, even Doug Ford today, which, by the way, some of the drama involved, all the premiers were meeting today as this is all going down. Look, you can&#39;t script these things. and um and so you know doug forrest saying like oh you know i really like christia i talked to her earlier today i put i put her on speakerphone so all the other premiers could talk to her too like imagine that like he&#39;s on speakerphone being like guys i&#39;m not gonna be around anymore and they&#39;re like don&#39;t go christian or whatever the fucking conversation was yeah it&#39;s crazy courtesy was not applied to the cabinet or the caucus one would imagine oh no oh no and you know so So that does, you know, letting it sit out there, let everybody react to you. Just even the message that she sent later or her team sent later when they asked, who&#39;s giving the update? Who&#39;s giving the FIS, the fall economic statement? And the response back is, I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s up to the prime minister or the Department of Finance. I think she ran until minutes before. Right. So it&#39;s just really</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">really crazy and it&#39;s really big. But it would not have been possible without the prime minister and the prime minister&#39;s team having the absolute hubris, the total arrogance, the incompetence of firing her three days before she&#39;s supposed to give this update. That is unconscionably bad tactics there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And to what end? You know, like, you know, to the end that you&#39;re going to have a cabinet shuffle prior to Christmas? like we talked about whether or not the you know this could be done in the in the in early january of course it could be done in early january absolutely let her do the update and then take her knees out you don&#39;t have to take her knees out before christmas you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">grinch did did cartney cartney needs to be we&#39;ll talk about cartney in a second because he&#39;s now also embroiled in this very directly um but carter i think there&#39;s cory had a lot of you know statements around around incompetence, arrogance, etc., there&#39;s also just a pure miscalculation where Corey says that, you know, you&#39;ve given the opponent everything that they need. Carter, it seems like one of the miscalculations was is that as soon as Chrystia Freeland stepped into that room virtually or over the phone or in person with Justin Trudeau, they never viewed her as an opponent, despite what the news was. Do you think that was a fundamental miscalculation? And is there a lesson to be learned here? Because I think there&#39;s something interesting in even how Corey phrased his comments. So Carter, first of all, I&#39;ll come to you, Corey. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s fascinating. I mean, this kind of core assumption that you can fire someone and have them not turn into your enemy.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s an interesting assumption. I&#39;m not sure that many people can make that assumption. Oh, I just fired them. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be best friends and we&#39;ll probably still be invited to Christmas dinner. Any lived</span>

He was told that Christian was fine with it, that Christian wanted to put her focus elsewhere. He had no idea this was happening. He&#39;s aghast at what happened. Absolutely aghast. But he also knows this is too sensitive a time, too important a time. We&#39;re one month to Trump&#39;s tariffs coming in, theoretically. Canada needs a finance minister and experienced one. He thinks he can be that person. He thinks he can serve. He&#39;s not thrilled to serve in this way, but he&#39;s not going to let the country down at this point.</span>

So I think if this is the plan and if he&#39;s in on it, you still make him finance minister and you bring him there.

You resign and you prorogue, which allows you then to have a leadership contest in some way, shape, or form, and you try to do it fast. Actually, it&#39;s so interesting to think about because we&#39;ve still got this tariff challenge that we&#39;re staring down here, right? But I think that that has to be the bundle. And maybe it&#39;s prorogation and you resign, you basically let it be signaled all in, like we&#39;re going to start this leadership contest after the swearing in of the president and once we get there. I don&#39;t know, but like they go together. There&#39;s no reason in my mind to prorogue unless</span>

There are resignation or there are rumors that that the prime minister has already decided he wants to resign.
