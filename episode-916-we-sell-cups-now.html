We&#39;ve seen provinces that are now thinking about opening up. We&#39;re now seeing this crossroads of vaccines that are later than we expected, a new variant entering our shores that perhaps has a greater likelihood to spread. What do you kind of think the federal government response here should be? Is this kind of a moment that they find themselves in that is unprecedented? And And are they thinking of a new game plan or are they now trying to figure out how they kind of impose their will upon the provinces?

It turns out that the strains of the flu that we&#39;re getting are most likely strains of that 1919-1918 flu, but it has become less deadly. Because in order to protect itself and ensure that it could spread, it became less deadly, so it didn&#39;t kill its hosts. Very clever of it. This one is becoming more easily spread.

We&#39;re seeing this slow car crash coming towards us with a delayed vaccination timeline, though that milestones still may be met alongside this new variant. Should the government just continue, federal government, continue printing money and step up in a much bigger way to keep our businesses closed for longer as we kind of try to, to Carter&#39;s point, nip this in the butt, try to get to our finish line?</span>

That&#39;s that&#39;s not so far from the truth. But ultimately, it is not the truth. We are borrowing money and that money does need to be paid back. And when we&#39;re paying back money, you</span>

What I am not so convinced of is that more activity by the federal government would fundamentally change the conversation that Stephen just described there. The provinces are like Zane Velji.

And it&#39;s not just about wanting to get out of the house to keep restaurants afloat. It&#39;s about wanting to get out of the house. And unfortunately, we don&#39;t seem to have leaders who are willing to do what other leaders have done in other parts of the world to get us right out of this thing. And as I&#39;ve said in the past, I&#39;m not even sure we could because we are not an island like New Zealand or Australia. We share a border, quite a porous one with the United States of America.

            <span class="text">Printing money, borrowing money, could it actually help? And the reason I ask here is there is a really interesting brand question for Team Trudeau. We&#39;ve talked about Team Trudeau brand quite often. Initial praise for handling of the pandemic in the later sort of innings here, not getting so much praise for the vaccination rollout. A third wave and a spike in territory we haven&#39;t found ourselves in could be disastrous to the Trudeau brand. That alongside the fact that Canadians historically, in most recent polling, care about debt and deficit the least they ever have at this moment. So I want to qualify that to Corey&#39;s point at this existing moment from what we&#39;ve seen from some polling. With that being said, do you feel like there is a value in trying to take on a disproportionate, larger, bigger role than they have, as we&#39;ve seen the second wave kind of blow out of proportion?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So when vaccination is being done, they are being judged on vaccination. And when we are done being vaccinated, they will immediately be judged by the Canadian public on the economic recovery. And the economic recovery means that you must have viable businesses. We were talking with my daughter and her boyfriend today about, you know, businesses and how many businesses are going to be in a position where they can actually survive this particular pandemic. Well, because the economy doesn&#39;t rebound if small and medium enterprise doesn&#39;t rebound first. That is the driver of the economy. And that</span>

            <span class="text">be rescued in no small part by little government bailouts. The stuff that Jason Kenney did, I mean, Jason Kenney might get one word of praise from me. The small amounts of money that went to small businesses, I think it was up to $20,000 per small enterprise. That was life-saving for a lot of small enterprises. That kept the lights on. It kept the employers being able to have an income, and it kept their rent paid. So I think that that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to be evaluated on. No one ever cares about debt and deficits. Even people who pretend to care about debt and deficits, if you give them even the most simple stacked question where they have to put one thing above the other, debt and deficit very quickly drops to the very bottom of the pile. It&#39;s just not something that people judge themselves on or actually make anything vaguely resembling informed decisions outside of the very few people who are real true fiscal conservatives.</span>

Because if that does occur, and if we do end up in, I still don&#39;t think a spring election is off the table. I know Carter feels differently. But if we end up in a situation where where we are then vaccinated, let&#39;s just assume that everything we&#39;ve heard, it remains the case that we&#39;re going to get our quarterly numbers and then some over the next couple of quarters. Then people are going to say, what the hell did you spend all of that money on? Because the moment of anxiety that we feel right now about being so far behind in the vaccine race will be gone.

I have if I&#39;m Justin Trudeau, I have control over perhaps the people who are entering the country through now one of those four airports that that he&#39;s designated for travelers to come in internationally.

So you&#39;ve got to do whatever you can, pull whatever levers you have available to make sure that our total vaccination time happens rather concurrently with the United States. These early months, this is a problem, but ultimately it&#39;s a surmountable problem. Make sure your supply chains are in line, provide any assistance you can to the provinces so that when these vaccines start flowing, they are getting into arms because that is the next thing. It&#39;s one thing to get the vaccines. But several months ago, we</span>

But that means also, you&#39;ve got a different logistics chain all of a sudden. So make sure that all of those things are managed and managed well, and that the minute these vaccines start flowing in volume, they&#39;re getting into arms in volume, so that we can conclude this exercise roughly the same time the United States of America does.</span>

Is this a good strategy for if you&#39;re a premier right now, trying to show Show strength, trying to know, you know, signal what is in your domain versus what isn&#39;t. Trying to buy a vaccine candidate, if you are Brian Pallister, if you are perhaps another premier. Is this good strategy from a provincial level or does it depend on who you are and which premier you are and what your aims and ambitions are? Or is there a blanket approach that you would take knowing that, you know, Pallister has led on this if you were another premier in this country? Oh,</span>

And the idea that you would purchase a vaccine that I believe the federal government has also already purchased. Should it, should it hit? Maybe not. It doesn&#39;t matter. And, and that, that this would pay dividends. The fact is these timelines are pretty far out and the entire thing could have been framed perhaps a little bit differently. And maybe Manitoba wanted to invest their money a little bit differently. Say this is about long-term security of, of supply for things like this, But the suggestion that you are somehow breaking the logjam by doing this when there&#39;s not Health Canada approvals, when this thing is not going to flow to you first anyhow, it&#39;s kind of silly. And it does just sort of reek of partisan politics, like, oh, I&#39;m going to do the thing that Justin Trudeau couldn&#39;t, going to roll up my sleeves. Now what&#39;s next? Now they&#39;re going to blame the government for not acting fast enough to approve the Manitoba vaccine. I know it&#39;s a vaccine made here in Calgary, but a vaccine purchased by the province of Manitoba. It&#39;s not helpful.</span>

A story&#39;s come out that both in Canada and the United States, doctors and nurses are trying to build confidence online in COVID-19 vaccines through social media, mounting coordinated campaigns to combat anti-vaccination forces prevalent on the platforms. Their main strategy is to monitor hashtags and keywords used by individuals individuals on social media, and then from there, flood social media posts with supportive messages countering vaccine opponents. So we&#39;ve talked about vaccine communications in the past. I&#39;m going to have a special episode for us as we deep dive on it in terms of how to get more and more people to adopt it. But at this current junction, Stephen Carter, for you, are you A, surprised that we&#39;re in this state where doctors are now taking this into their own hands, And B, do you like their strategy of if someone speaks negatively, you kind of get your Instagram or Twitter hive or Facebook hive to come flood them with positive comments en masse? Do you feel like there&#39;s efficacy in that? I want to talk about the calm strategy a bit with both of you on this before we close it off on this segment.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that the science of defeating this has been relatively clear. Experts don&#39;t do it. It&#39;s peer-to-peer that does it. uh so the idea of being flooded with positive comments if those comments are coming from peers i think that would be very effective if it&#39;s coming from um you know a hundred different white coats uh with just stethoscopes i mean you know no one&#39;s going to care that you know four out of five dentists recommend people still buy the other fucking brand so it doesn&#39;t you know like this is this is not something that people do um and it&#39;s not going to be uh it&#39;s not going to help. I mean, I have noted that as there has been vaccine scarcity, people are seemingly more willing to get it. That also might just be a bump because of, you know, the proximity to getting it and watching other people get it. No one&#39;s, you know, the negative outcomes seem to be minimal. At this stage, though, here&#39;s my thing. I care very little about vaccine hesitancy. I care almost about – as much about vaccine hesitancy</span>

I get frustrated when children get rubella. I get frustrated when easily prevented childhood diseases are passed on. But this is really interesting with COVID.

Being behind our peer countries on this matter allows us to have an awful lot of examples to look at and pick from on vaccine distribution and look at what works. If you look at the UK, for example, they&#39;re seeing much higher uptake than they originally planned, and maybe we can learn something from them. If we want to look at the United States, there are 50 states that provide us various models for vaccine distribution that we can learn from. So I don&#39;t know. This is outside of my area of expertise. The logistics of vaccine distribution are not something that I learned in business school. But, you know, I do like what Stephen has said about the</span>

            <span class="text">here&#39;s Yeah, so here&#39;s my hot take. This was the best example of leadership I have ever seen from Mitch McConnell. I think Mitch McConnell wanted to vote to convict. I think Mitch McConnell hates the guy. I don&#39;t mean leadership in a broad sense, by the way, I mean, leadership of the Republican conference here. He voted to acquit to</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">to give cover to his party to vote to acquit because Because he was worried about senators who would otherwise be in these primary situations that would just get wrecked by the Donald Trump supporters, the Trumpsters that are out there. He&#39;s not in that position. He could have easily voted to convict, and I think he wanted to vote to convict. But I think he knew as leader, him voting to convict makes it much more difficult for them not to. And so what he did is he walked this line and he gave kind of intellectual air cover to this notion that you can loathe Donald Trump. You can actually call for him to have criminal charges against him, because McConnell&#39;s not worried about the consequences down the road to that, you know, to him and his primaries. But he gets to put voice to that, and then say, but I still voted to acquit because I think that you can&#39;t do this to a private citizen. So he&#39;s created a landscape that allows his conference to pick and choose the elements that they want and that they need in order to be successful themselves. So I, you know, give credit where credit&#39;s due. The guy knows the game. He is a very savvy political operator. He&#39;s got no soul. He&#39;s an evil man. But he&#39;s a very savvy political operator. Carter,</span>

Let&#39;s talk about President Biden. He issued a statement several hours later. I want to actually make note of the time right on after the verdict and highlighting the bipartisan nature of the conviction, bringing up McConnell&#39;s comments, obviously not bringing up the fact McConnell voted in the way he did, but bringing up McConnell&#39;s very clear comments. And then keeping with the stated, you know, desire to see the country overcome its divisions, talked about this is how we heal and move forward, and that we have as leaders have a duty to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. So several hours later, bipartisan nature, you know, a strong criticism around Trump and defeating and defending the truth. But then also talking about let&#39;s, you know, use this as a flashpoint to start beginning our healing, put it behind us. What do you make of that statement? And I&#39;ve given you just a small amount of it, so granted, but from what you saw and what I&#39;ve said, what did you kind of make of that approach by President Biden? It</span>

He knew exactly that this verdict was going to come in this way at this time. It&#39;s not as though they had to scramble for some sort of unknown outcome. They did it so that the news cycle would move on and write their stories and build their commentary without Joe Biden weighing in on it there. And the entire statement</span>

And by pointing to Mitch McConnell&#39;s comments, insofar as he attempted to influence the news cycle at all, it was, go look at what Mitch McConnell has to say. So this was the smart play. You do not want to make this a part as you want to make this as unpartisan an issue as possible, nonpartisan as possible. And you have no interest in dragging yourself into what is ultimately still, at the end of the day, a political loss. They did not convict Donald Trump. Right,</span>

What do you think of that? He knew he was going to lose. He probably knew from the start he didn&#39;t have the votes, that they were not going to come, but wanted to kind of make this a moment for long-term reflection that would cast a stain on anyone that voted to acquit.
