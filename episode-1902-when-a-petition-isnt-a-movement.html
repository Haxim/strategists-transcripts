In fact, it will be the only thing on the show next year is what I&#39;ve decided. Guys, let&#39;s talk about the separatist referendum there. Their clock has started on their petition, signature petitions, and you are seeing online, through the news, through social media, that they&#39;re collecting signatures. And I&#39;ve got two top-line questions I want to grapple with.</span>

            <span class="text">in this separatist referendum at this moment, sitting on their hands and waiting for this group to do what they do in four months and then fighting the fight once it happens? Or is there something we need to do now? So I&#39;m almost giving you the outline of the show as I I think of it. But let&#39;s start with the inevitability question, Carter. Is this inevitable? Lukasik got twice the number in one less month. Does that mean that this number, 177 in four months, is just inevitable for the separatists?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No. In fact, it&#39;s still a tremendous organizing challenge. It&#39;s not the only petition that&#39;s going to be approved. I know that they&#39;re going forward with the coal petition as well. It&#39;ll be underway. It will have to seek 177,000 in four months. It is a huge organizing structure. It requires significant organizing capacity, and it requires the connection and the mobilization of a significant portion of the population. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s inevitable at all that they&#39;re going to be able to get the signatures. I think that the signatures, this is, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, I said it before when Thomas was undertaking it. I said it was impossible. I will say now it is not impossible, but it is highly unlikely. I think all we have to do is look at the recalled MLA&#39;s petitions that are underway in, what was it? We figured out like 13 individual writings where they&#39;re being recalled. I don&#39;t think any of them are going to succeed. seed uh i think that we saw the lightning in a bottle with thomas and i&#39;m not sure that we capture the lightning in a bottle the second time it&#39;s just a huge organizational ask shannon</span>

And it&#39;s just so much harder, so much more time consuming to find individual people or pockets of people. And so that message is going to be really important.

It was there There were a lot of adults kind of in the steering committee, people of all kinds of political persuasions with a lot of expertise and a lot of experience in politics and in law and, you know, really good faith, great Canadians were kind of behind it, helping it along, ensuring that they won every single one of the legal fights, you know, the interpretations with elections, none of that horsepower exists in the separatists. And in fact, you&#39;re going to get competing conspiracy theorists and turf wars and all kinds of people live streaming their grievances and not a lot of organization. And so finding that message and that one messenger is going to be really, really difficult for them. And I don&#39;t think that they can find someone who can kind of straddle that world of the soft separatist or the, you know, the sort of like the person for whom the Venn diagram, you know, they&#39;re going to vote UCP and they don&#39;t maybe mind Carney too much. They&#39;re grumpy a little bit, but they want to send a message. Finding those voters is going to take a specific kind of message and mobilization.

And that&#39;s why I think the messaging structure is infinitely more complicated for the separatists than it was for the anti-separatists.

So as much as I agree, Shannon, that there&#39;s a lot of folks in this tent, some conspiratorial, others trying to seek a rich vein to try to maximize signatures, others trying to dilute it and make it about something, there is a world for me, and I&#39;m curious to get your guys&#39; thoughts on this, that these coalitions that say, if this is about the immigrants for you, then you got to sign. If this is about Alberta education getting too woke, you got to sign. If this is about equalization and us getting fucked over, you got to sign.

            <span class="text">i mean like i think we need to understand what their motivations are and how what game they&#39;re trying to play where the public opinion environment for the other stuff is so the to the first uh to the point that carter was just uh responding to i think what we need to understand about uh cpp or rcmp or that kind of basket of grievance issues is that almost none of them rise to the level of even 50 so if the ucp themselves are at a 50 public approval uh rating public support those basket of issues don&#39;t rise to that uh they are not super animating for more than about 30 of the population right and so you have uh even within the ucp coalition uh it&#39;s you know those are still uh at positions that are not necessarily held by the majority of them right</span>

            <span class="text">They get the signatures and then there&#39;s a vote. Like that&#39;s a huge political price. However, in more conventional political terms, like this is something no one on the 80% of Albertans, 70 to 80% are not asking for, not wanting. Do you think, given the conventional dynamics of paying a political price, the UCP pay a pricier for spending so much political capital energy time on this?</span>

            <span class="text">I think that their popularity, Daniel Smith&#39;s popularity and the popularity of the UCP will go down if this thing starts to actually get momentum. But I don&#39;t think that necessarily, it all depends on how successful the campaign is in and of itself. If it starts to push off those softer conservatives that are voting UCP because they just can&#39;t see themselves voting for the NDP, right? They just can&#39;t see themselves voting for them the second time because the world price of oil dropped during Rachel Notley&#39;s first term. So obviously, you know, Rachel Notley is a terrible premier in the NDP just to destroy the economy.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that this is a potential problem for the for the UCP if it starts to pick things up, because I think those voters will shift away and just say, Jesus, you know, because the problem is what? what shannon alluded to a second ago which is there are separatists in the premier&#39;s office the separatists exist you know this there are separatists within the caucus um danielle smith is doing this to appeal to that 20 percent of albertans she has almost every decision that she has made uh has been about the 20 percent not about the 80 percent and the fact that nahed nenshi and the ndp haven&#39;t been successful in in capturing that is really a testament to their failure um but now maybe this is the the piece that starts to push uh people back to the ndp um or at least into some sort of middle zone uh with the alberta tories or some other uh vehicle that we can&#39;t even imagine yet um maybe that happens i i don&#39;t know but i i do think that there there is a political price that should be paid by the ucp for flirting uh with separatism um ultimately</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

I know that&#39;s not what you&#39;re referring to, but that&#39;s probably the dynamics of UK politics right now. Now, Shannon, the same question to you, like, what&#39;s</span>

No. And I am figuring out how to mobilize that 70 to 80% of Albertans against the, and branding those as separatist ideas, branding those as anti-Canadian ideas, and that are more to the point, though, and less esoterically, about taking something away from you, right?</span>

            <span class="text">hard i guess i guess let me let me let me pause it a thought if if the separatist pathway beyond the low hanging fruit is through the urban centers, right, or at least a sliver of the urban centers, is there something you can do to create an immunity response there or inoculate there as a pro-Canada movement? And part of me thinks it doesn&#39;t need to start, maybe not end, at anywhere beyond people once again demonstrating their canadianness and ensuring that that you know you you as a as a convoy of separatist signature collectors coming into the big centers will not be met positively that that that even any license for social acceptability does not stand here when you come to us in late february march april right</span>

That might work. But again, why? The pro Canada experience already happens during the Olympics. All you have to do is amplify it. Just let it be what it is.

Goal one still remains the same, but I&#39;ve given you a 1A goal. Does that change anything for you, Carter?</span>

Look at them struggle. Look at them have difficulties.
