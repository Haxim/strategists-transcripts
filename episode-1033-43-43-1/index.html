        <p>The gang* work through the improbable - but possible - situations that could come out of Alberta's upcoming general election.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter continue their Alberta 2023 election preview by talking about the improbable - but still very possible scenarios that could play out over the next few months. Could the NDP win an outright majority of the popular vote and still lose the election? Is Danielle Smith going to nationalize the oil industry? Will she be leader at all? Is Drew Barnes about to be the most powerful politician in Alberta? And how long until Stephen Carter buys a Diamond Jubilee medal on eBay? Zain Velji and Annalise Klingbeil, as always, aren't here.</em></p></blockquote>
