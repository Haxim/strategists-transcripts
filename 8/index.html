        <div class="desc"><p>It's Friday. Annalise, Zain and zAIn all have the night off. But there are Alberta Pensions to plan and a failure of climate leadership to follow, so Corey and Stephen spring into action.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter, just two regular Gen-X guys, break down advice for NDP leadership aspirants, the start of Alberta's legislative session, Justin Trudeau undermining his own carbon tax. How does a freshman MLA put themselves on the leadership radar? Does Justin Trudeau regret the carbon tax? And do all speeches need to be given from a lectern? Jeremy Nolais guest stars.</em></p></blockquote></div>

How frustrating.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Ontario NDP caucus expelling Sarah Jama from their ranks, the MPs who signed a letter calling for ceasefire, the head of the Alberta Pension Plan panel expressing surprise at the pension analysis and much more in a supersized edition of "Fine, Fabulous, or F--ked". Will the Ontario NDP regret their decision? What's the gang's advice for the CPPIB? And what is to be done with the "Freemasons on the Land"?

Amazingly, the PCU responded promptly in full. The rest of the episode guest stars.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives drama, the Canada Speaker of the House of Commons drama and a week of developments in Danielle Smith's crusade to introduce an Alberta Pension Plan. Has U.S. leadership politics succumbed to a "tyranny of the minority"? Will advertising be successfully shift a skeptical province into supporting an Alberta Pension Plan?

Pharmacare and the Supply and Confidence agreement guest star.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss 5/7ths of the Supreme Court ruling against the Impact Assessment Act, 81% of the NDP endorsing Singh in his leadership review and the NDP convention's unanimous support to create a red line on the Supply and Confidence agreement. Has the Trudeau government been delivered a black eye by the Supreme Court? Should Singh be worried that even with no organized opposition one in five delegates voted against him?

And why is the Notwithstanding Clause a tool used by politicians? And can Zain dominate the podcast outside of the hosts seat?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the "cost of living politically", unpacking Pierre Poilievre's equivocating on "parental rights", Chrystia Freeland's chief of staff announcing her MP candidacy and the opportunity and burden of historic candidacies such as Wab Kinew's. Why are we seeing process stories about the Conservatives debating support for transgender youth? Is moving from senior staffer to (aspiring) MP really a promotion?

        <div class="desc"><p>In the first Stephen-Carter-free episode since 2013, the gang talk the evolving wind-and-solar moratorium story and Corey's ability to see Taylor Swift concerts anywhere in the world.</p><blockquote><p><em>Zain Velji and Corey Hogan discuss continued reaction to Alberta's moratorium on wind and solar before turning their attention to the increasingly vocal discontent of Liberal MPs with the cabinet shuffle. Is Alberta Premier Danielle Smith feeling her way to a publicly acceptable answer? Was the cabinet shuffle doomed by bad communications advice? And how long until Taylor Swift does a show in Calgary? In a significant upgrade, the role of Stephen Carter this episode will be played by Annalise Klingbeil.</em></p></blockquote></div>
