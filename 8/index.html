But there are Alberta Pensions to plan and a failure of climate leadership to follow, so Corey and Stephen spring into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter, just two regular Gen-X guys, break down advice for NDP leadership aspirants, the start of Alberta&#39;s legislative session, Justin Trudeau undermining his own carbon tax. How does a freshman MLA put themselves on the leadership radar? Does Justin Trudeau regret the carbon tax? And do all speeches need to be given from a lectern? Jeremy Nolais guest stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Will the Ontario NDP regret their decision? What&#39;s the gang&#39;s advice for the CPPIB? And what is to be done with the &#34;Freemasons on the Land&#34;?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the U.S. Speaker of the House of Representatives drama, the Canada Speaker of the House of Commons drama and a week of developments in Danielle Smith&#39;s crusade to introduce an Alberta Pension Plan. Has U.S. leadership politics succumbed to a &#34;tyranny of the minority&#34;? Will advertising be successfully shift a skeptical province into supporting an Alberta Pension Plan? And is Stephen Carter really just pretending to be a jerk? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here.

Has the Trudeau government been delivered a black eye by the Supreme Court? Should Singh be worried that even with no organized opposition one in five delegates voted against him?

And why is the Notwithstanding Clause a tool used by politicians? And can Zain dominate the podcast outside of the hosts seat?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the &#34;cost of living politically&#34;, unpacking Pierre Poilievre&#39;s equivocating on &#34;parental rights&#34;, Chrystia Freeland&#39;s chief of staff announcing her MP candidacy and the opportunity and burden of historic candidacies such as Wab Kinew&#39;s.

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Danielle Smith&#39;s play for an Alberta Pension Plan - and to take half the CPP with her on the way out the door - before turning to Doug Ford and a stunning Greenbelt reversal. Does Danielle Smith actually think she can get her hands on half the CPP, or is there something else going on? Has Doug Ford stopped digging down?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Stephen Carter rode a mountain bike and at his age is regretting it. Zain Velji and Annalise Klingbeil showed up to have the tables turned on them. The gang discusses the role of media - journalists and commentators - when it comes to platforming views and the changing nature of journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zain Velji and Annalise Klingbeil unpack the strategy of hosting, tackling issues like building rundowns and executing transitions before a deep dive into the changing nature of journalism and a host&#39;s obligations when interviewing controversial guests. Where is the line between responsible journalism and irresponsible platforming? Is journalism evolving or dying? And why wasn&#39;t Vivek invited to do the podcast? Corey Hogan turns the microphone on the two hosts and Stephen Carter isn&#39;t here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang use the most recent federal cabinet retreat - and its focus on housing - to talk about cabinet retreat composition, guests, and (of course) the politics of housing in Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about cabinet retreats - and how housing experts are feeding into Justin Trudeau&#39;s cabinet get-together in Charlottetown. How and why are experts deployed in cabinet retreats? Are the Liberals poised to do something big on housing? And should we be concerned that the goal is to get to the peak of &#34;Mount Stupid&#34;? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Donald Trump&#39;s Georgia arrest, the strategy of mug shots and Chrystia Freeland&#39;s speeding ticket reaction. Did Trump get the picture he was after? Why did Freeland dial the contrition for speeding up to 11? And when will we hear more about Carter&#39;s monthly nut? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Will Canadians side with the government over access to news posts in an emergency? Is the conservative solution to climate change just hoping for the best? And how long until the boat lobby comes for Carter? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she&#39;s got you covered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

What ads work, what ads don’t and how far does three million bucks actually go these days? And how will a giant scandal about the Greenbelt and how much money is going to private developers impact Doug Ford? And why is Zain wrong? Annalise guides us through the first of three Hogan-less episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Is Alberta Premier Danielle Smith feeling her way to a publicly acceptable answer? Was the cabinet shuffle doomed by bad communications advice? And how long until Taylor Swift does a show in Calgary? In a significant upgrade, the role of Stephen Carter this episode will be played by Annalise Klingbeil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>
