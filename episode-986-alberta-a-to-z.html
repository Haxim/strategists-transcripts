            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I want to talk about a few things that have happened here in Alberta, but let me start with this particular story, which I know both of you have been, at least in the Twitterverse, giving some red hot takes, or maybe it is in the Twitterverse, maybe it&#39;s on our WhatsApp chat. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I want to talk about cabinet confidentiality. Alberta&#39;s chief medical officer of health can&#39;t claim cabinet confidentiality to prevent the divulging of some of her closed-door recommendations on the COVID-19 restrictions a judge has ruled. The ruling came amid a court proceeding whose plaintiffs are arguing Alberta&#39;s pandemic public health orders overseen by Dr. Dina Hinshaw violated constitutional rights. rights. The judge has asked three questions. This is Justice Barbara Romaine proposed asking Hinshaw three questions in a private hearing before deciding whether to make the answer to those questions public. And as part of the hearing evidence, the three questions, just so folks who may not have been tuned into this story, are number one, did the premier and cabinet ever direct you, Dr. Hinshaw, to impose more severe restrictions in your chief medical officer of health orders than you had recommended to them? Question two, did Cabinet ever direct you to impose more severe restrictions on particular groups such as churches, gyms, schools, and small businesses than you had recommended to them? And finally, question number three, did you ever recommend to Cabinet that restrictions should be lifted or loosened at any period of time that the recommendation was refused or ignored by Cabinet?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, we have talked about this topic before in relation to a leak that came from a cabinet session and then reported on by a media outlet. I have not seen anything like this before. I might be wrong where a justice is ultimately ordering, in this case, Alberta&#39;s chief medical officer of health to potentially not have the protections of cabinet confidentiality. Have you seen something like this before?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s generally not something that gets pierced because it is an essential part of governing. And I know that when we do this on the Twitterverse, we get all the people who say that we should be making every decision fully and completely in the public eye, and that&#39;s just lunacy. Um, because not every decision is easy.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I used to say that, uh, you know, the stuff that was easy, this, the, the 80, 20 stuff, or even the 60, 40 stuff that was all managed by cabinet ministers. That was easy stuff. The stuff that lands 51 49, and you don&#39;t really know which side the 51 49 is on those go to cabinet and those go to the premier&#39;s office. Um, those ones you get, you don&#39;t just get, here&#39;s the recommendation. Here&#39;s the black and white recommendation. recommendation. This is what exists. Uh, you will do this or you will do nothing. Um, that doesn&#39;t exist. You get an array of options.

And all of them fall behind whatever the decision is ultimately. Even if they voiced strenuous opinions through the conversation, they all fall in line.

The Twitterverse was like cabinet is going the wrong way we should be putting in more restrictions where&#39;s dr hinshaw she should resign because these restrictions aren&#39;t enough and this questions are the questions are did should there have been more restrictions should we have put in you know like or should we have ended the restrictions quickly quicker should we have had fewer restrictions did cabinet go too far in imposing these restrictions that to me is the exact opposite of what the twitterverse thinks that they&#39;re seeing, right? The Twitterverse is expecting some sort of bombshell where they could have been protected from this by Dr. Hinshaw. When, if this comes out, I mean, depending on what is said, you know, Cabinet may have protected us from Dr. Hinshaw, which is fascinating because it&#39;s not the answer that, you know, the left, especially the left.

            <span class="text">there&#39;s a lot of stuff that&#39;s happening as it relates to policy, as it relates to ramifications on workers&#39; rights. One of the things that we&#39;ve been talking about is, is there a deliberate or perhaps not so deliberate strategy here, Carter, on shortages, CB teachers facing teacher shortages as substitutes can&#39;t cover absences? We&#39;ve seen that story. We&#39;ve seen more family doctors, a dramatic drop in family physicians accepting new patients has left many Albertans without a family doctor to call their own. We&#39;re also seeing discussions between crown prosecutors in the province are ongoing with hopes of preventing a mass strike action that paralyzed the justice system.</span>

And this is one of the through lines that I think is worthy for us to discuss. So maybe I&#39;ll get your take. Do you feel like there&#39;s a deliberate strategy of scarcity or shortage that is being implemented by this UCP government?</span>

We&#39;re seeing teachers leave the teaching profession. How this particular government tends to respond to these things isn&#39;t particularly positive. We can see better responses around the world, but these are worldwide phenomena of changes that are happening because people have taken a look at their lives and said, is this what I really want?</span>

I mean, we went through the brain drain, right? I don&#39;t remember which decade that was in. Ironically, probably around the time that Corey was born.

Or is there a case to be made that as they fight multi-front wars, it&#39;s better to come and consolidate and be part of a coalition that fights back so that your issue is one of several that are part of a fight back strategy? And I think of unions, of course, here. I think of professional organizations and associations. Are you in it for yourself? And is accepting the premise of a multi-front war actually victory for the government because it just kind of tires out at least some of the groups? Or is there a strategy here that is better done together? Is it better to come together? I&#39;m kind of curious that these seem like disparate issues and disparate professional groups and disparate professions, but what&#39;s the value in terms of not accepting the government&#39;s premise that they want to fight you on your terms and you kind of come together with other groups and build a coalition?

Beginning to end, A to Z. We do it for you, Carter. We do it for you. I want to talk about the story about a veteran conservative activist, Al Brown, who&#39;s now fed up with the UCP. He&#39;s saying that he is tired of making excuses for the people who ask why the government is doing stuff. He feels like people are worn out. He&#39;s been a longstanding PC UCP volunteer. I want to focus less on Mr. Al Brown here, the veteran activist of the conservative movement here in Alberta. Carter, what I want to focus on is what we expect now in terms of the drumbeats, in terms of the storylines, as we look into the next 17-ish days heading into Wednesday. We have seen some stories that we&#39;ve predicted and we knew were going to happen, and we&#39;re going to see more of those. Those fall into the category of, oh my God, the world is on fire. Someone received two memberships. Someone received two voting cards, someone who did not sign up received a membership, and the media is covering those individuals. And I&#39;m not trying to minimize those, but those happen every single time. And whether those are a big deal or not, we can discuss. We see stories like this, where someone who conveniently comes out 16, 17 days before the vote says, I&#39;m done with this, cover me in an opinion column, cover my story to create a movement of momentum, proxy perhaps for the other side.
