Plus - the announcement of our live show in Calgary taking place on April 2, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use the Ontario Liberal Party leadership campaign and the Toronto mayoral election to dive deep on the topic of politicians running for one political job while they hold another. What do the candidates need to consider? Is it appropriate? When and how do you tell your current leader?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Like last year&#39;s eggnog you just found at the fridge, our annual Holiday Spectacular is a tradition that only gets better with age. Hear Zain, Stephen and Corey talk about the worst political delays, best political landings, the things they liked, the things they didn&#39;t - plus the ever popular political eulogies for those whose careers ended in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check the roof for reindeer and break out your performance turtlenecks because it&#39;s time again for The Strategists to unpack the year that was in their annual Holiday Spectacular. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the best and the worst of the year, write political obituaries and talk about the year-to-come in this regular-length special. Our discount airline sponsor* picks the topics while Zain Velji keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Enjoy our rundown of the value of year-end political rituals plus find the Zodiac-style message Corey hid in the episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss year-end interviews and how politicians use the holidays to convene and convince. Do year-end interviews serve a purpose in 2022? Does Pierre Poilievre have a problem with female voters? And has anybody ever done worse at Christmas than Joe Clark?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Alberta&#39;s attack on long-gun police action and how Justin Trudeau should respond to provocations from the province of Alberta. Is Alberta trying to strengthen the case for a province police force? Should Justin Trudeau turn the other cheek or lay down the hammer? And did we actually get to hear all eight of the criteria through which we should judge the Cactus Club?

Quotes from the movie &#34;Dave&#34; guest star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter, in an annual Strategists tradition, are subjected to the very-misleadingly-titled &#34;strategy sprint&#34; where Zain asks them to work together define goals, strategies, tactics and messages for politicians from across North America. Can Jagmeet Singh take the mantle of Canada&#39;s universal health care champion? Will we be talking about President Kyrsten Sinema in 2025?

Meanwhile: Stephen Carter gives insights on the Sovereignty Act and Corey Hogan remembers the Ontario NDP are actually the official opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the continued rollout of the Alberta Sovereignty Act and the coronation of Marit Stiles as Leader of the Ontario NDP. How does Alberta Premier Danielle Smith declare victory and move on from the Bill&#39;s no-good very-bad introduction? Do leadership coronations hurt parties? And why was the studio audience so against Stephen Carter? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Were the new cabinet authorities a complete accident? Should Justin Trudeau jump in or lean out? And when did Saskatchewan become the responsible province?

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;After a long wait, the Alberta Sovereignty Act is finally out. Is it as destabilizing as feared? Worse? Better? Different worse? Stephen and Corey use Zain&#39;s absence to discuss this plus what the LG might be asked to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan deconstruct the bill-destined-to-become the Alberta Sovereignty Act - what it means for Alberta, for Canada, for parliamentary democracy and how everybody might respond. What does the Bill do to Canada-Alberta relations? How are the federal government and the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta supposed to respond? And is there any more chilling hypothetical phrase than &#34;You are doing something not considered by the current constitutional order and I require you to get a mandate from the people?&#34; The gang (minus Zain) discusses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>
