          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about Trump and Trudeau's reactions to the moment and each other. How long will Trudeau taking a knee be remembered? How do we ensure statements of support become guarantees of action? And does Stephen Carter own a garage full of "Romney 2020" bumper stickers? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

The protests continue in the United States, expand into North America, Europe, even some countries in Asia. The world is now marching to the protest beat of Black Lives Matter across the world, an unbelievable sight. But what I want to hone in on today is the symbolism, and more specifically, the symbolism of two world leaders. One of them is ours, Justin Trudeau. And one of them is, of</div>

So with Trump, you had him effectively tear gassing civilians to get to a church to hold up a Bible weirdly. And with Trudeau, you had two moments. You had him taking the knee at the Black Lives Matter protest in Ottawa, but then also the now infamous 21 second beats before he moments of silence, so to speak, before he answered a question. So I want to kind of first compare these pieces of symbolism. So maybe, Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. Which one wins the day in the sense of its powerfulness? Which one will we be talking about in the broader scheme of both the political arc, but perhaps even the historical arc as we go forward?</div>

As soon as you get into that kind of negotiation, governments in return will want assurances. They will want to make sure you stand up and say, I am with the government on this. The government is doing the right thing. If the government feels they will do this and the goalposts are immediately going to move, they&#39;re not going to do this. Right. Right. And it&#39;s not even because they wouldn&#39;t necessarily agree with that course of action in in kind of even the short term, middle term or long term. It&#39;s because of the of the challenges of essentially always having to chase the next promise. Right. And in those cases, they will then just say, OK, we&#39;re going to do a task force. We&#39;re going to do what it takes to get out of the moment and we&#39;ll end up doing exactly where you think you want to go or maybe three quarters of it down the road.</div>

So I want to talk about three white dudes currently in public office, whether here in Canada or in the United States, who are bucking the trend with some of the, I guess what I say, the trends that are happening in the last couple of weeks. And I wanted to start with this guy. I wanted to end with this guy, but I&#39;m going to move him first, which is the mayor of Minneapolis. Now, I don&#39;t know if you guys had a chance to see this, but he was, the Black Lives Matters protests were outside of his apartment in Minneapolis. They elicited this mayor out to get him out of his apartment. He came out on the street and they asked him point blank, right?</div>

            <div class="said">right? Just as we were just chatting about, will you defund the police? police and a yes or no question on the street, cameras everywhere. And he ultimately gave a rambling response. And for some context for individuals, this is a progressive Democratic mayor, 38 years old, civil rights lawyer, probably one of the more progressive mayors that the United States has, especially in a place like Minnesota, broadly. But he says, ultimately, no, after two minutes, I will not be defunding the police. So I wanted to talk about this. And I&#39;m not sure if if you guys even had a chance to see this, I didn&#39;t give you any warning, but that&#39;s the nature of this podcast. But I wanted to talk about this because this is exactly what you&#39;re talking about. In theory, this is the movement now holding them to account, but it&#39;s missing a critical piece that Corey talked about, which was those goalposts. And there was no real reward because it was you either answer to us right now as a yes, or we&#39;re going to primary you out. We&#39;ve got the election.

And we talk about that in peace times, right, how you go and advocate to government to push through legislation and, you know, policies that that you want legislated. Does that all change now? Like, is it is it now like, rather than any sort of carrot, it&#39;s just pure stick, like you either do something or it&#39;s over? Is that the right tact in this moment in time? Because it seems to be working, at least it did in Minneapolis, they didn&#39;t get the mayor. But to your point, you know, they got city council, it&#39;s happening in LA, it&#39;s happening other places. Is it now just just a stick that you go with? to get this change done?</div>

            <div class="said">The stick has been pretty effective, so I don&#39;t want to totally disparage it, but it&#39;s really the difference between compliance versus commitment, right? If governments are terrified, they will do exactly what they think they need to do to manage the moment and keep the public on side. But the minute the light is off that there is going to be a thousand small ways they are going to start to erode those commitments. Defund the police all of a sudden becomes, yeah, we&#39;re just renaming the police force, right? That&#39;s how it happens. and it happens faster than you can possibly imagine. The best way to get a government on side for the long term is to align your interests with their interests. And that, at the end of the day, means sharing some of the credit for the good things you&#39;re doing with them to make them invested in this being a long-term solution.</div>

Now that this concept of defunding the The police is out there. The ask is being made of municipal leaders, sometimes point blank on the street while cameras are being recorded. Does the ask have to now be universally that or can they can they layer in can the movement layer in other elements into it? Like, I&#39;m just trying to understand. And I know we may not have the answers, but I want to think us think through this is if you&#39;re leading the movements right now, are you layering in other asks after you get a few yeses in L.A. and Minneapolis and other cities?

Because ultimately, they&#39;re usually built less around a concrete deliverable and more about an outcome. And often that outcome is rather visionary. It is, you know, the world they want. It&#39;s the city on a hill, right? And so, of course, as you start getting success, you follow up success with additional requests. You move the conversation forward. You try to change the overall landscape. And by doing that, you&#39;re not just trying to push further, but you&#39;re helping secure the gains that you got. Because</div>
