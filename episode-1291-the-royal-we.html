The surgery seem to be somewhat sudden again not a lot of details and it seemed to go on for a longer recovery period than anybody envisioned given that events are now being cancelled a little bit later on and nobody has seen her since then and why this is particularly noteworthy is this is a woman who within like hours of giving birth was wearing a dress and holding her newborn baby and waving you know outside of the hospital where this occurred here so it&#39;s not as though the royals are particularly camera shy at moments where you would expect normal people to be camera shy so</span>

And so the speculation of where is Kate, which has always had a bit of a conspiratorial bend, people saying, did she leave William? Did she she die you know to kind of talk about the kind of the things you were alluding to like some really kind of like i&#39;ve seen stuff that is kind of like quasi seriously presented insofar as like she&#39;s imprisoned by them because she tried to leave william all sorts of crap right and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, the Lieutenant Governor is probably going to be approached by media all day long tomorrow about this, especially after this episode. And my recommendation would be, don&#39;t speculate. Make sure you say the truth with authority. And that truth is that she&#39;s been abducted by aliens. So make sure that that That truth is said with authority, because if you if you sound if you make it sound like it was a joke or something, it won&#39;t play. She&#39;s been abducted by aliens and obviously Williams in on it. He probably asked the aliens to abduct her. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hearing.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ll just say that Occam&#39;s razor probably applies here. It&#39;s probably pretty simple. she probably had a worse go of surgery than was reported the recovery time is probably longer she&#39;s probably not at all fucking feeling that she&#39;d be in the media probably a combination of things like i&#39;m not going to play these petty royal games right now william i&#39;m sick of this shit and it&#39;s just kind of elevated now into some sort of wild thing but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but this is where we&#39;re at and we&#39;re at a situation where people are dissecting footage of her in her car going places and asking things like, is that really her? And do you think that that&#39;s, like, is she being weakened at Bernie&#39;s? You know, like, it&#39;s just like some of the nonsense is</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Tell me this, because I&#39;ll be serious for a second. I think there are things that really apply to our lane of strategy and communications, Carter. And let me start here, which may not be the natural point to start, but I think it&#39;s interesting, which is, what has the last week week or so taught you about virality or change your opinion around virality, especially when you have an issue that comes up that has been an undercurrent, potentially niche, and then goes mainstream like this. I find this so fascinating. Any thoughts to that from your perspective as you think about it as a comm strategist around when we talk about going viral and the current nature of viral? This is a very interesting version of it because it&#39;s almost building on, Corey used the word truther, but like, you know, internet sleuths one upping one another and like kind of undercover, you know, people are deep into this in a really interesting way.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, first of all, never leave this space for rumors to develop. Always get a definitive answer. And I think that the palace has always taken a really lax view towards giving a full and complete answer on things that they just don&#39;t want to answer um in today&#39;s society historically</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s a really interesting distillation, that virality is the story, that something going viral is covering it for that rather than what&#39;s perhaps deeper in it, and at least for a first round of media. Corey, do you agree with that? And I guess what lessons has this taught you about modern-day virality? Because we&#39;ve had that term kind of statically applied for the past decade, and I&#39;m just wondering if a story like this clarifies what virality means in a calm sense today so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so i agree but i think it&#39;s more than that it&#39;s more than what steven said one of like i don&#39;t know when you all became aware of kind of the kate middleton rumors for me it was why</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">why does her name keep trending on twitter it wasn&#39;t a big conversation for me it was suraya like</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">like my wife was like yeah and i&#39;m like i don&#39;t know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about so right but so i clicked</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">clicked and i saw some of these stories and i sort of understood it but it was all internet rumors still So when I say it&#39;s more than that, there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that all of Fleet Street, all of the UK press has been talking and speculating about what the hell&#39;s going on with Kate Middleton. But there&#39;s no way to write that story, right? There is no way to write that story. And so they were waiting for an opportunity to actually say something. And by the way, we&#39;ve done this. Like, remember that episode we did in December about the NDP leadership? It was like a two hour banger. We were waiting for a piece.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, mark us off. We needed something, because everybody knew who was actually in, like at least everybody who&#39;s sort of orbiting around it. Everybody&#39;s having those conversations. Nobody is putting it out there, and we didn&#39;t want to be the people. And at this point, the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">race wasn&#39;t official, sort</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sort of thing. The race was not official. Rachel had not announced she was stepping down. And so we were waiting for something that would justify us saying it, that it didn&#39;t make it just sound like a bunch of rumors. And they got that with the kill notice, with the photo and the kill notice. And I actually think that that&#39;s one of the more interesting things here, is that if the Royals had not done this, if they had just stayed a little bit more in their lane, put out a text tweet where people would say, why can&#39;t we see you or whatever, right? Right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The media would not have had this hook. But the minute that there was actual news and let&#39;s be clear, a kill notice about something coming out from the royal family that is speculatively like manipulated propaganda imagery. That is actually a story. Right. So once they had that story, it allowed them through innuendo to fill in the backstory. And so that I think is an important part of what&#39;s occurred here too. But I also think it is a bit of a template now that media know or hear more than they can actually report on, and they love these hooks that allow them to actually address the rumors, as Stephen said, without addressing</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">veracity. With some scaffolding, that justifiable or not with some scaffolding. And so if we talk about, if we keep it on strategy, Carter, what was the lesson here around like, and I guess you said, in this age, you need to respond to the mob in some way, you need to be accountable to them in some way. I&#39;m paraphrasing you, feel free to correct me. but don&#39;t you think that the proactive action by kensington palace to release a photo was the pent-up sort of like this is our response to the mob leave us the fuck alone here&#39;s a photo she&#39;s alive and well like did they like in your mind don&#39;t you think that was exactly what they did and now are facing a series of perhaps</span>

            <span class="text">the law continue to do so, right? Right. Like, I like your advice of like, hey, the rules apply to you. But what if the client today asks you, Carter, I&#39;ve never had to follow the rules and your job is to tell me the rules don&#39;t apply to me. Modernize whatever you need to do, but make sure the rules don&#39;t apply to me. What if that&#39;s the scope of a client and you&#39;re a high paid strategist for Kensington Palace to be like, I agree, world&#39;s changed, but I&#39;m not going to get into the fucking dirt. Like, that&#39;s not what we do, our bar is that we always fly above. If that&#39;s the scope given to you, are you turning down that contract, Carter, and saying, fuck that? You know, the world applies to everyone. And Corey, same question coming to you in a second.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">similar types of issues. I mean, Donald Trump is kind of the exception to every rule, right? We know that that Donald Trump is, you know, the where&#39;s Melania trope predates this where&#39;s Kate problem, right? Like, where is Melania? Did they replace her? Is she a body double? All the same questions, right? We&#39;ve seen all the exact same questions about Kate as we see with Donald Trump. And he weathered it, but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but he weathers it at a cost, right? Right. If you&#39;re prepared to pay Donald Trump costs, which is, you know, lighting your hair on fire every time you open your fucking mouth, then you can get away with anything because now people come to see the circus.</span>

I&#39;ll take that contract and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll light your hair on fire every three days, which you&#39;re pretty much doing anyways. You know, like the royal family is pretty much taking the light your hair on fire, and everybody will pay attention to you a little bit too seriously. So</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">my advice to them, though, would be, listen, if you want to have a normal existence, then you got to stop being the royal family. You don&#39;t have to be the royal family. But if you want to be the royal family, then this is the price. Because your royal family isn&#39;t the royal family of Sweden, right? It&#39;s not the royal family of Denmark. It is the royal family of the United kingdom and the commonwealth and because with that comes a whole lot more attention uh than you know the princesses and princes of monaco um this is just a totally different world so um if you want that attention and everything that comes with it then you got to play by that attention&#39;s rules period end of sentence cory</span>

The initial badge of honor was to say, we&#39;re everywhere. Where you are, we are. Early politics, early companies, it was about meeting you where you&#39;re at.

And so that is one of the virtues of the channel. It&#39;s a lower stakes wire service. It&#39;s not actually lower stakes, but it kind of feels like it is and it feels a little more ephemeral.

And not to say it&#39;s a direct response to that. I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re going analog. But there is a movement here.

WhatsApp groups, discords, even Facebook groups that have closed off. You are seeing the walls come up as people decide they don&#39;t want to deal with the world outside of them. And they would rather have these conversations with people that they kind of want to be around. And often that is tied around</span>

            <span class="text">challenge you have as an institution is that best practice is rarely available to you, because it usually requires a singular voice. It requires a personality. That personality often is edgy or provocative, and it has a very strong feel and sense of self to it. And there&#39;s back and forth. And institutions have a problem with that. institutions might need to be celebrating a funding agreement in the morning and talking about a death in the evening they they need to have so many different tones they can cover institutions have all sorts of approval levels the institutional account&#39;s not going to engage in a back and forth with somebody and they&#39;re not as a result going to be able to drive that kind of engagement and move it forward and institutions don&#39;t tend to shitpost right Right. You know, Wendy&#39;s can talk about round hamburgers. The government of Alberta can&#39;t take that kind of edge to things as they move along there. So that&#39;s that&#39;s a challenge. I&#39;m kind</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Institutions lumber. And one of the challenges institutions have, and this is broadening to your point about the royals here, is that because of the things that make them institutions, actual things, real things, they&#39;re not just being bad at these things. They have to act in certain ways, for certain very legitimate reasons. The government of Alberta Twitter account just can&#39;t start randomly spouting stuff off. It could be market moving, it could have major consequences in people&#39;s lives, right? But because of those things, they are often judged as like, not up to the moment, or like, man, what a lame account or something like that, right? And this is fundamentally, I think, an exacerbation of a bigger communications problem that exists all the time, but is worth actually thinking about for a minute here, which is that you often have the biggest tensions in communications when the audience expectations and your actions are the most misaligned. And if you&#39;re an institution and you&#39;re on a social media platform that is a fucking shit-flinging free-for-all, you are going to have those challenges more often, right? And if you&#39;re an institution like the Royal Family, they don&#39;t get much more institutional than that. So that&#39;s a bit of a challenge. They have exacerbated that, however, by carrying this sort of feeling through more broadly, this idea that they don&#39;t need to play by the rules. So the rules is just another way of saying expectations, because there are not actual rules in this case.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">They&#39;re going to pay a price. Maybe they think they get more than they lose, but they&#39;re going to pay a price for that. We are seeing that price right now. This is the consequence of that kind of approach to communications, where you say, fuck the audience. It&#39;s a bit interesting to see, and you rarely get a case study this pronounced.</span>
