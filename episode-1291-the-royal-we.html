Why are the Prince and Princess of Wales breaking all of the rules of communications? Can the Royal Family win the game by not playing? Can other organizations learn anything from all of this? And has the great domain war of 2024 begun? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

So make sure that that That truth is said with authority, because if you if you sound if you make it sound like it was a joke or something, it won&#39;t play. She&#39;s been abducted by aliens and obviously Williams in on it. He probably asked the aliens to abduct her. That&#39;s what I&#39;m hearing.</div>

I find this so fascinating. Any thoughts to that from your perspective as you think about it as a comm strategist around when we talk about going viral and the current nature of viral? This is a very interesting version of it because it&#39;s almost building on, Corey used the word truther, but like, you know, internet sleuths one upping one another and like kind of undercover, you know, people are deep into this in a really interesting way.

But there&#39;s no way to write that story, right? There is no way to write that story. And so they were waiting for an opportunity to actually say something. And by the way, we&#39;ve done this.

And so we were waiting for something that would justify us saying it, that it didn&#39;t make it just sound like a bunch of rumors. And they got that with the kill notice, with the photo and the kill notice. And I actually think that that&#39;s one of the more interesting things here, is that if the Royals had not done this, if they had just stayed a little bit more in their lane, put out a text tweet where people would say, why can&#39;t we see you or whatever, right?

That is actually a story. Right. So once they had that story, it allowed them through innuendo to fill in the backstory. And so that I think is an important part of what&#39;s occurred here too. But I also think it is a bit of a template now that media know or hear more than they can actually report on, and they love these hooks that allow them to actually address the rumors, as Stephen said, without addressing</div>

It&#39;s not the royal family of Denmark. It is the royal family of the United kingdom and the commonwealth and because with that comes a whole lot more attention uh than you know the princesses and princes of monaco um this is just a totally different world so um if you want that attention and everything that comes with it then you got to play by that attention&#39;s rules period end of sentence cory</div>

That personality often is edgy or provocative, and it has a very strong feel and sense of self to it. And there&#39;s back and forth. And institutions have a problem with that. institutions might need to be celebrating a funding agreement in the morning and talking about a death in the evening they they need to have so many different tones they can cover institutions have all sorts of approval levels the institutional account&#39;s not going to engage in a back and forth with somebody and they&#39;re not as a result going to be able to drive that kind of engagement and move it forward and institutions don&#39;t tend to shitpost right Right. You know, Wendy&#39;s can talk about round hamburgers. The government of Alberta can&#39;t take that kind of edge to things as they move along there. So that&#39;s that&#39;s a challenge.

          <div class="said">Institutions lumber. And one of the challenges institutions have, and this is broadening to your point about the royals here, is that because of the things that make them institutions, actual things, real things, they&#39;re not just being bad at these things. They have to act in certain ways, for certain very legitimate reasons. The government of Alberta Twitter account just can&#39;t start randomly spouting stuff off. It could be market moving, it could have major consequences in people&#39;s lives, right? But because of those things, they are often judged as like, not up to the moment, or like, man, what a lame account or something like that, right? And this is fundamentally, I think, an exacerbation of a bigger communications problem that exists all the time, but is worth actually thinking about for a minute here, which is that you often have the biggest tensions in communications when the audience expectations and your actions are the most misaligned. And if you&#39;re an institution and you&#39;re on a social media platform that is a fucking shit-flinging free-for-all, you are going to have those challenges more often, right? And if you&#39;re an institution like the Royal Family, they don&#39;t get much more institutional than that. So that&#39;s a bit of a challenge. They have exacerbated that, however, by carrying this sort of feeling through more broadly, this idea that they don&#39;t need to play by the rules. So the rules is just another way of saying expectations, because there are not actual rules in this case.</div>
