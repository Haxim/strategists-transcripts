            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, this is the time to be talking about it. This is the time to be acknowledging it. And I think that the best thing that can happen is that we don&#39;t just talk about it in this, in these moments, but that we actually work to, uh, to understand it and use the show in some fashion to, to push out a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">a broader understanding. I think we made the point in the last, the last time we dealt with this, not that that long ago, sadly, with the Kamloops situation, that this is news to people, but it shouldn&#39;t be. This is something that we should know. And I think that the 715 unmarked graves found today just show, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, just are beginning to show the depth of this, beginning to show how far it reached. And I think beginning to show how much we&#39;ve covered it up.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Corey, you know, I I often start most of these segments with the very basic question, when a news story happens, which is, were you surprised, right? It&#39;s usually when I start teeing up a news item. In this case, Carter&#39;s just mentioned to us that, you know, even before the Kamloops discovery, that this is something that was well documented in our Canadian history. But I&#39;ll ask you the question regardless, like, were you surprised when you heard</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">mostly know a little bit of yes a number that big has shock value i think that uh you know you can you still feel a gut punch even though you can intellectually know that that there are numbers like this coming uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh but you know one of the things about this that i&#39;ve been reflecting upon is here we are talking about it uh we haven&#39;t talked about residential schools or for Indigenous Canadians and the relationship with it since the last time we talked about it. And Carter talked about not</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">not just reacting to the moments, but carrying this on further and making it more deeply embedded in the conversations that go on. And I think that&#39;s absolutely true. I mean, one of the things that&#39;s going to be, I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think, tough for a lot of people to process, and maybe I&#39;m talking about myself as much as anyone here, is that we, like, how many thousands How many thousands of graves are we going to find over the next bit?</span>

            <span class="text">This is not one of those situations where it&#39;s like, okay, we&#39;ve searched two locations and that&#39;s it. That&#39;s a full accounting of the situation. We know very well that&#39;s not the case. In fact, here in Alberta, the premier just announced $8 million to search in Alberta on these</span>

            <span class="text">you know, what is the proper response? Is it outrage? Is it sorrow? Is it a combination of those? Certainly, it&#39;s got to be more than just for the news cycle and then move on. What are we doing to listen and understand and do better and grow and commit ourselves to reconciliation? affiliation.</span>

We haven&#39;t figured out, you know, our First Nations relationships at all. And I think the easiest thing that we&#39;ve been doing is just passing the buck. You</span>

I guess we better start figuring it out. Because it&#39;s not going to it&#39;s not going to pass the muster for the strategists just to sit there and say, time and again, well, this is a tough one.

And I&#39;ll caveat this with the respect that this is not a strategy question, but it&#39;s a question for policy for our leaders, which is kind of borrowing from a question that our mutual friend Rob Brown on CBC asked our panel today, which was, there&#39;s no template for this around federal leadership if you&#39;re a federal politician. What does it look like for, you know, Corey, if you&#39;re right, that unfortunately,</span>

            <span class="text">start it there with some initial thoughts as we kind of hopefully keep this conversation going beyond this episode as well. Corey, can I go to you first on that and then loop back in with you, you, Carter?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">politicians are used to making sweeping statements, taking action, moving goalposts, declaring victory. And this issue doesn&#39;t lend itself to that. I think both the severity of the matter at hand makes politicians draw short breaths and say, you know, this is not the time for this. I mean, there&#39;s an interesting question there about why we play so absurd with so much of politics. But the other thing is the cycles are so long. nothing</span>

The recent polling has found that, you know, 68% of Canadians feel responsibility to resolve the inequities that Indigenous people face, that that may not be fleeting. To that same question, though, I asked Corey, though, you know, in terms of the template plate for leadership. What does it look like? Any thoughts for leaders that, whether they be in this cycle or to Corey&#39;s point, down the road, think about dealing with this issue?</span>

What we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;ll park the headlines till the end, but there&#39;s a few items that I feel like are very relevant and critical to the discussion we&#39;ve just had. So let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Oh No Canada. Guys, Aaron O&#39;Toole has accused activists of quote-unquote tearing down Canada after towns across the country have cancelled Canada Day events. Now, these calls are getting louder and broader across the country after the events of today, unsurprisingly, with the discovery of these unmarked graves. But let me give you some context, and let&#39;s talk about the politics here. Conservative leader Aaron O&#39;Toole today said he&#39;s troubled by the cancellation of Canada Day celebrations in some municipalities and accused a, quote, small group of activist voices of continually talking down the country rather than acknowledging its many successes. In a speech at the final Conservative caucus meeting before the House of Commons, he said that while Canada&#39;s history is littered with injustice and wrongdoing, that doesn&#39;t justify cancelling the nation&#39;s birthday, a time to give thanks for living in the greatest country in the world.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I probably would. I probably would have advised him to suggest that every candidate today needs to have a First Nations focus this year. You know, this is, you know, there may have been great achievements in our past, but there have also been great tragedies in our past. And if we solely focus on the successes, as he said in that earlier statement, then we are never going to address those things that we have failed at. And this is an opportunity, I think, to address the failures. I&#39;m not a big fan of just walking away from Canada today. I think that, you know, there is an opportunity to grow and to use this as a moment</span>

            <span class="text">to move that 68% number that you talked about in the previous discussion to 78% or 88%. uh, Canada Day could, could help us get there. Um, so I don&#39;t know that we just necessarily want to walk away from it, um, because walking away from it, it doesn&#39;t get us to the place where we&#39;re actually addressing things. So I would suggest that, you know, if I was writing it for O&#39;Toole right now, I&#39;d say, uh, we cannot alone look at our successes without, uh, being aware of our failures as a country. While Canada may be the greatest nation on earth, uh, for us Now, it was certainly not the greatest nation on earth for many, many people in our past. Let&#39;s use this moment of Canada Day to reflect both upon those great successes as well as our great failure.</span>

            <span class="text">there were a lot of people who were very angry about it being a renunciation of our past, of Canada&#39;s history. And it was trying to just ignore all of all of the historicalness that Canada had gone through. And arguably, some did. Some wanted that break with the past. Certainly, Canada Day was seen as more bilingual. It was seen as more inclusive. Dominion was seen as too British. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">things evolve, things change. And maybe there&#39;s an opportunity here to rethink exactly what Canada Day is. Like the Holidays Act doesn&#39;t say much. It says, hey, we&#39;ve got a holiday. It&#39;s called Canada Day.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And there&#39;s a question here. It&#39;s like, what are we celebrating when we say we&#39;re celebrating Canada Day? Are we celebrating our past? Is it enthusiasm for the future? Is it just pride in Canada? is it is it all of the above and then some other things is it just a reason to drink on a dock and watch fireworks i</span>

            <span class="text">i don&#39;t know and i i think that it is kind of in the eye of the beholder and it&#39;s part of why people have reacted to the idea of canada day at this moment differently right because depending on what you think you&#39;re celebrating you may or may not think that it is worthy of celebration for example you think it&#39;s just a party celebrating canada&#39;s history uh yeah maybe maybe it doesn&#39;t seem very cool to do it in the context of exactly what we&#39;ve discussed here But we have walked an interesting journey on it. And I think it would be interesting to see some politicians see if maybe there&#39;s not an</span>

Because certainly that&#39;s happened in my lifetime, happened in Carter&#39;s lifetime, hasn&#39;t happened in Zane&#39;s lifetime. But, you know, Canada Day is not so old in story in itself that we couldn&#39;t talk about what does it really mean to celebrate this nation on this day. And this</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Sorry, Zane. This doesn&#39;t ring true. Like the MPs from the Conservative caucus in the last couple of years have been, you know, we have to go back to our history. We have to go back to Dominion Day. It shouldn&#39;t even be called, you know, Canada Day. And, you know, they were perfectly willing to fight for our past before. And now that it&#39;s politically inconvenient because of the deaths of thousands of children, they&#39;re now all of a sudden standing up for Canada Day. I mean, it&#39;s hypocritical at the minimum, and it&#39;s somewhat offensive when you kind of piece it all together like Corey has started to there.</span>

            <span class="text">So, Tug, walk me through this. Walk me through this from the frame of our prime minister, actually, right? So he&#39;s sitting in government. There&#39;s a call to cancel Canada. Let&#39;s move the spotlight off O&#39;Toole for a second. I really like this frame that Corey&#39;s talking about. Let&#39;s add some definition. Let&#39;s add some real, maybe heft or focal point to Canada Day. How do you go about doing that, Carter? And how do you go about doing it in a way that doesn&#39;t make you seem politically opportunistic? Like, oh, there&#39;s a call by activists that&#39;s spotlighting one of the darkest chapters of our collective history. Let me do what I do well, which is symbols, and try to add some definition to Canada Day. How does one actually achieve this transformation or what could it look like from the confines of government? And I know that&#39;s a very tough question and a very broad question, but I&#39;m curious to go down the path that Corey&#39;s introduced to us.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I mean, I&#39;m just trying, I was just kind of looking to see what New Zealand has done. You know, New Zealand, I think, has arguably one of the better relationships with its First Nations or its First Peoples. And part of that is a recognition that some of the days needed to be changed, right? Right. Some of the days needed to shift to reflect the traditions of the country before it was a country in the in the in the European sense of the of that word. So I think that that&#39;s where we could go. I mean, I think that Corey&#39;s point about what is the day is really interesting to me. You know, I</span>

Canada Day, it doesn&#39;t need to be a big day celebrating our history. But if it is going to be a historic day where we are celebrating our history, then we better find a way to bring in all the elements of our history.</span>

I think that there&#39;s something there. And I don&#39;t have it here. I don&#39;t have a private members bill for anybody to sort of just determine it and redefine it.

You know, a generation&#39;s issues cannot be just solved with a stroke of a pen, that that advocacy and activism was required. If you were advising people to get loud, as you have said in the previous segment, Carter, in our introduction, would you advise them to rally around Canada Day as like that wedge to make that point, to make this serious, to make politicians act or no?

            <span class="text">i&#39;m going to leave that segment there let&#39;s move it on to our next segment single shingle i want to talk about the lone uh independent mp out in vancouver the former justice minister jody wilson raybould i want to talk about her a little bit more broadly but i&#39;m going to use the incidents of today if i can call it that in the exchange for today that she had with uh crown and indigenous relations minister carolyn bennett uh so So there&#39;s a bit of context here. Jody Wilson-Raybould put out a tweet saying that, you know, Justin Trudeau, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here because I don&#39;t have the tweet in front of me, but saying Justin Trudeau, rather than trying to jockey for an election, should implement the, you know, massive legislation regarding Indigenous rights that he has promised. She then got a text message from the minister, Carolyn Bennett, aforementioned, with a question that attached that tweet and a question that said pension, question mark. She screencapped that tweet. She put it on Twitter. The context around pension, question mark, just so everyone is aware, as we&#39;ve discussed on this show, there is a calculus perhaps around going to an election before October because those who serve six years as members of parliament as of October are qualified for their federal pension. And that number out of a House of 300 plus is somewhere in the 150. So there&#39;s a long list of individuals, independents, liberals, conservatives across the board that are impacted by going to the polls before October. If they go and win and come back, it&#39;s not an issue. But for those that lose, they don&#39;t get access to that pension. So that&#39;s the that&#39;s the preamble. That&#39;s the context here. This, of course, blew up. Jody Wilson-Raybould taking this screenshot, posting it online, criticizing the minister who was her former colleague of racism, saying that, you know, this leans into a trope where all Indigenous people, all they care about is money, et cetera, et cetera. The minister then responds. Let&#39;s talk about this issue first, and then let&#39;s talk about Jody Wilson-Raybould, because that&#39;s what I want to spend this segment on. On the issue, Corey, I&#39;ll go to you first on this. um clearly</span>

Like you&#39;ve got a former Liberal Cabinet Minister running in Vancouver, Granville, clearly a name that many people in the political class know. She&#39;s done well for herself in the last, you know, six months, you know, coming out with the book announcements, getting into the media a few times with, you know, today&#39;s story, aligning herself to Annamie Paul, as we discussed last week on her criticisms of Justin Trudeau. But I want to talk about the strategy here for an independent MP and maybe one that has almost her unique profile, which is, how does she kind of come out ahead? And what does it look like for her if she&#39;s running her style of race? I know we are going to discuss political strategy of every political party, but I find it fascinating to discuss the strategy of a single MP here, especially one that&#39;s got this national profile. And I&#39;m curious if you&#39;ve had any upfront or top line thoughts if you were advising her on her race. race?</span>

            <span class="text">Fundamentally, you got to ask why people elect independent MPs. They&#39;re never going to be in government, right? Even if you&#39;re a third party, you can kind of aspire either to be in government or significantly influence things. We have had situations in recent history where independent MPs have changed the balance of power in Parliament. So I&#39;m not going to say that never happens, but it&#39;s not very likely that your independent MP is going to kind of wield any sort of power. So in many ways, they are quite often a protest vote, a protest vote against the party in power, a protest vote against the system, saying this is somebody who I think represents me better than any of the options that actually have a chance of governing here. And it&#39;s a big middle finger to the entire apparatus that is government. So, if that is the case, like, let&#39;s just say, accept that as a hypothesis for a moment, then that&#39;s the job of an independent MP. It&#39;s to stand up and call the system bullshit and to call out moments like this when a liberal cabinet minister with a great deal of power fires a text of pension, question mark, suggesting that would be the rationale at a moment when there&#39;s so much rationale for holding off on an election.

Right. It&#39;s this very weird like running for leader, but you don&#39;t get the halo effect of a party and everything to push you forward.

            <span class="text">i find that fascinating i&#39;m I&#39;m going to leave that segment there, leave our segment single shingle, move on to our next segment, double dipping. That is right. We&#39;re going to a story coming out of, well, no other place, Corey. It&#39;s Ottawa, the center of the world. The Liberal Caucus Office has hired a firm that helps run the party&#39;s digital campaign. I want to talk about this. So the Liberal Research Bureau, a taxpayer-funded office that supports the Trudeau government MPs, used parliamentary money to hire a company that plays a key role in re-electing Liberal candidates. This same company, Data Sciences Incorporated, runs the digital operation, the ads, the website, the whole overarching support for the federal campaigns and has been doing so for the last few of them at least. East. It&#39;s run by a close friend of the prime minister&#39;s. And simultaneously, the same firm is providing support to not just the Liberal Party, but this public taxpayer-funded Liberal Research Bureau to the tune of $75,000 to provide IT support and back-end office support. I don&#39;t want to talk about an HR and procurement contract here, but what I do want to talk about is this sort of relationship. And I think that&#39;s probably the right word, Corey, relationship between party and taxpayer funded extension of the party, what maybe even some MPs feel it&#39;s that, versus relationship between this firm and the prime minister, very close with the individual that runs this firm. And maybe get a sense of, A, A, how common is this? Is this actually scandal worthy? And B, is there any sort of political meat on the bone here? Or is this something that, you know, every political party kind of engages in if they&#39;ve got the opportunity and, you know, stones</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s not uncommon. And I think part of the reason is caucuses live in this hazy ground between you know government public and the political party like the caucus exists to grind an axe and it carries more more</span>

            <span class="text">more political messaging or more partisan messaging than say you know the government of canada ever could and as a result they want people who reflect their views and reinforce their views like you&#39;re not gonna you&#39;re not just you&#39;re not just buying off the shelf here you need somebody who actually supports the liberal vision and that&#39;s true whether you&#39;re at the caucus office or at the party office, and that starts to narrow the number of suppliers you have available to you. And so I think that there&#39;s actually pretty natural reasons why caucuses and parties often end up using the same suppliers, because they both need to be champions of the cause, or practically speaking. I mean, I know some people could say, well, for shame, the caucus shouldn&#39;t do that. But I mean, welcome to the real world population, a little over 7 billion, right? But there is a bit of an interesting thought experiment here for you, which is if the liberal party buys office 365 from microsoft can the caucus well sure i don&#39;t think anybody would object to that right well how about bell mobility okay</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">could say, okay, we&#39;re going to pay you out of the caucus budget the equivalent of $200 an hour, and we&#39;re going to pay you out of the party office about $100 an hour, but it all nets out to about $150. Because that is basically stealing $50 an hour from the government of Canada, even though it is money that they&#39;re allowed to use for more political</span>

            <span class="text">purposes, I guess I would say, than the other money. So that&#39;s the complication. That&#39;s the difficulty. But the reality is the general public doesn&#39;t have a great understanding of the delineation between party, caucus, government, individual to begin with. So it&#39;s hard for me to imagine this is going to be like a fatal, fatal issue, especially because I think if you start working through some of those contracts, not that you could, because parties don&#39;t have to release those lists, you&#39;d see a lot of crossover between caucus use and party use for the reasons I said.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it is a concern. I&#39;m not sure how common it is anymore. It used to be very common. It used to be that you worked on a leadership campaign or you worked on an election campaign, and the contracts would then flow. I mean, in Alberta, we have a long history of that under Klein as premier, and things started to get kind of cleaned up in the 2000s. Corey has made the point at my expense before that corruption&#39;s not that long ago in Canadian politics. I was trying to argue that we&#39;re not seeing much in the way of corruption. I&#39;m not going to argue that this is corrupt necessarily, but it certainly isn&#39;t great. I mean, you know, Thomas Pitfield, the person who is leading this organization, ran Justin Trudeau&#39;s digital campaign in his leadership. He&#39;s been with him through the 2015 election. The 2019 election, I argue, you know, will likely be with him in the 2021 election. You</span>

And that&#39;s not even starting to cover off the relationship with the president of the party. Right. Like this is this is a relationship that goes layers deep.</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s right. Yeah. The partner of the individual who runs the firm was the former president of the Liberal Party. So Carter&#39;s mentioning there, Corey, you know, I guess the question I have is, where&#39;s the political opportunity here? If you&#39;re a tool like what What he&#39;s trying to go after is trying to make this about, you know, the key word here, relationships. He&#39;s trying to say, Tom Pitfield, lifelong friend of Justin Trudeau, another unethical relationship dealing like this, you know, trying to create a pattern here. Is that where the political opportunity lies? If there does, and would you, if you were advising the NDs or the conservatives, look at that as fertile ground to make some hay from?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s more brushstrokes on the painting in Justin Trudeau&#39;s attic, right? It&#39;s the unethical, bloated, awful look that Aaron O&#39;Toole is trying to paint for this prime minister of ours. And in that sense, I think it&#39;s more kind of the, I can see some smoke, there&#39;s a bit of noise, pick your metaphor here. But ultimately, it&#39;s less about the specifics of this and more about the general overall vibe you get, or at least that Aaron O&#39;Toole wants you to get when you think about the Liberal Party of Canada, right? right? A little too cozy with their friends, a little too free with money that they shouldn&#39;t be so free with. They can&#39;t really see the difference between party and government. And, you know, who loses at the end? All of us, right? All of us lose for any number of reasons. There&#39;s the ethics of it. There&#39;s the actual cash involved. All of us. So I don&#39;t think that we are going to be talking per se about the specifics. But absolutely, I think if the The conservatives could turn, you know, turn it into a buzzword, you know, just almost like a just say it, you know, say the name. And then all of a sudden everybody gets gets upset at a rally. I&#39;m sure they would be happy to do so. But ultimately, it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just layering paint on paint. It&#39;s the fine strokes. It doesn&#39;t fundamentally change the story that Aaron O&#39;Toole is trying to tell. It&#39;s just more texture.</span>

What I wanted to talk to you guys about here is how common is this? I know we talk about polling from the purposes of the horse race, but Corey, maybe I&#39;m going to start with you. Governments polling on a singular phrase and a brand, common or is this overwrought and out of the ordinary from your tremendous wisdom and experience?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s not uncommon. It&#39;s not uncommon. Governments have an awful lot of mechanisms available to them to poll. I think there&#39;s a couple of things I would observe. One is the bigger the project, the more likely this kind of polling is going to be. And there is no bigger project than how are we going to spend all of these billions of dollars and get Canada out of COVID-19 doldrums. The second thing I would say is governments have an awful lot of mechanisms that just pass through them regularly, monthly surveys, bi-monthly surveys, quarterly surveys, particularly at at the federal level where there&#39;s a little bit more money to put towards those projects. And it&#39;s not a particularly difficult task to just say, we&#39;re going to do a bit of, we&#39;re going to add to that. We&#39;re going to augment, we&#39;re going to plus on to the previous focus groups or polls we were doing. And I haven&#39;t seen enough to know for certain whether the details were a totally distinct project. I think it probably was based on the fact it came through, but not uncommon. common. Polling is just very normal in politics these days, doubly so at the federal level, because again, the scale is just so big. But even in Alberta, I can tell you, we had daily tracking on government approvals at various points. We had flash polling we would do when there were major issues available. We had polling that was on a monthly basis that provided some some sort of consistent baseline. And we had regular quarterly and annual polls that dealt with matters like this. And we would just bolt on questions in addition to various project work that would occur. So not shocking to me at all.</span>

            <span class="text">In a funny way, I think message testing gets a rap as the most nefarious government testing because it feels like it&#39;s manipulative, right? It&#39;s people trying to make you feel a different way about something based on the words you choose. I look at it a little bit differently. In some ways, I feel message testing is the most innocuous testing because you&#39;re not even talking about the policy, you&#39;re talking about how you frame a certain policy, but you&#39;re going to do the policy anyways. And so you&#39;re not just being a weathervane where you&#39;re just picking your policy based on what the majority opinion is, but you&#39;re thinking about these things consistently. Message testing, though, is funny because many people will say that&#39;s more appropriately done by political parties. But I can tell you, as somebody who&#39;s been a professional communicator in many contexts, in many organizations, message testing is done to to make sure that the thing you are trying to say is heard by the audience that you need to hear it. And there&#39;s not anything inherently wrong with that, right? It&#39;s about clarity. It&#39;s about making sure that the thing you say conveys the thing you want it to say to the people that you&#39;re talking to.</span>

So suppose someone came to you with these three options, right? Build back better, first place, you know, Green New Deal was also polled. We need a more resilient country. tree we need to build back better uh those were like the the the suite that were tested what were some of the the questions you would ask to that group that would kind of bring that to you let&#39;s say they gave you that one sheet and said cory we&#39;ve got a winner this one&#39;s it uh what would you kind of ask them what would you kind of follow up with what would some of the contours that you and nuance you would add with your communications head on if this was you know your department uh that you were given this uh this responsibility charged to</span>

            <span class="text">So that&#39;s an excellent question. And I think the first thing I would say is rarely do you get a clear winner on these things, right? You will define – you&#39;ll probably have multiple focus groups. You&#39;ll have focus groups that represent, say, women in downtown Toronto. And you&#39;ll have another focus group that is rural men. And you look at how they react to it. And there&#39;s a – this is where it becomes as much art as science, even putting aside whether it&#39;s statistically representative to get a focus group together, right? And you say, well, they liked that one. The other group liked that one. uh but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but i you know and and they each dislike the other one but that one just seemed to dislike it more and i think that there&#39;s more ability to move it or that was less offensive to them and i think we saw some of that in the idea of the green new deal reporting since people saw it as an assault on alberta yeah that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s right so for all we know it was absurdly maybe it was the most popular with certain demographics right but it was just decided it was too negative with other demographics and it moves forward so the questions you&#39;re asking is first</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">first of all how who liked it right you also would do a bit of a stress test on how did you determine whether they liked it or not did you just give them three slogans and say hey how do you feel about these why don&#39;t you just on the chart put the words that come to your mind for each of these slogans did you have a conversation ahead of time that primed the pump pump</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">pump what did that conversation look like did you do any kind of quantitative polling to back up what the focus groups opinions sort of moved into because it&#39;s It&#39;s very common to have the conversation in a focus group and then validate it with a broader population by doing a quick poll on it, right, either on one or multiple options just to see that you&#39;ve got something that&#39;s a little more statistically significant. And then ultimately, it does come down to kind of personal preference of politicians, what we&#39;d call in a corporate setting, managerial preference. Managerial preference matters. At the end of the day, is Justin Trudeau comfortable saying, green new deal, or is he comfortable saying, build back better?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And, and there is, there is that element of it that comes into it as well, as well as kind of forecasting how you might need to use these slogans in the future. So, I mean, I guess what I would say about any kind of testing of this nature is, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">political people don&#39;t do as good of a job as I would want them to, to follow data, right? To say, okay, they said that, so I heard them. Because they&#39;ll quite often try to contort</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">contort themselves into why the thing they always wanted was the thing that the focus group said. Or, yeah, but did you see that? And, you know, there&#39;s this little glimmer of hope there or whatnot. But as much as you should follow your data, you should be aware that it is just one input. And while a very important input, it needs to be weighed against a variety of other inputs that are available to you as well, particularly in message testing, because there&#39;s a poetry to language. And there&#39;s the fact that very few people are going to see the slogans on their own. They&#39;re going to see them in the context of other things. And I guess</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">guess I jumped the path of saying, but I also want to say, the messenger matters, too. So you might come with a message that works, and people might be like, love that message. But when they hear it&#39;s from the conservatives, they&#39;ll react differently than if they hear it&#39;s from the liberals, the exact same message.</span>

I would imagine that most people, you know, there may be a small group of people who who choose not to get vaccinated.
