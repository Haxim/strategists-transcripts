        <p>Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter discuss a Conservative movement that has decided it will not pivot, will not moderate, and absolutely does not care who hates it for that choice. What does it mean when a party re-ups the leader voters say they don't like, even after winning the argument on the issues? Is wrapping yourself in the flag a real political move or just vibes? And did Stephen Carter get something right even with his brain frozen? Stick around to the end to find out.</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

Pierre Polyev gets just sub 88 percent, besting Stephen Harper&#39;s 84 percent from 2005, the last time a conservative leader had to have one of these. Carter, the speech was did. The people were excited. Pierre Polyev effectively said, there are too many of them out there, these people who want us to abandon our conservative principles, his own convenient, poetic way of saying, fuck you, I&#39;m not changing. That is my takeaway. Stephen Carter, was that your takeaway? And I want to very quickly, before we jump into the majority of this episode, which I want to spend on separatism related to this conservative convention, tell me what you thought of Pierre Polyev and his tact there to ultimately say, you were right. You have re-upped the messenger. Oh, and by the way, you&#39;ve also re-upped the message, just so you, if there was any illusions, you know, you&#39;ve also re-upped the message that you got prior to this.</div>

It didn&#39;t start with a seven and nearly approached a nine. A nine would have been better, but it was good. It was solid. The room was with him. What it wasn&#39;t was a speech that was trying to take on Carney&#39;s Davos speech. I remember, Carter, you said, you know, this will be a speech that tries to, you know, compare the two. It was not that. And what it was wasn&#39;t an acknowledgement to maybe many people outside of that room. So I&#39;m curious how you read it. There&#39;s much. That speech. But the real nub of it for me was people want us to change. We&#39;re not going to change. You have re-upped me and you have re-upped the message by extension. Was that your takeaway? And what do you think of that strategy for Palliev as his go forward plan?</div>

Like doesn&#39;t really have any sort of claim to that. So those two things are new. Especially after the reporting came out from the Financial Times. As we discussed on our Patreon episode. That said that the separatists had met with the American State Department. And that they had acknowledged that MLAs from Danielle Smith&#39;s caucus were on it. So Danielle Smith&#39;s now come out. Saying she doesn&#39;t want to demonize the 30% of all burns. This is Justin Trudeau&#39;s fault. That this, that there are folks potentially on the list. I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t care.

          <div class="said">penalty. Fault. Issue. Or follow-up. Regarding her MLA signings petition. And then similarly. I want you to look ahead. So Shannon. Can I start with you? And maybe let&#39;s focus on this comment. Of Danielle Smith. Saying. Yeah. I don&#39;t know if my MLA&#39;s have signed it. They&#39;re free to do whatever the fuck they want. Like. And that&#39;s it. End of question. And even after being pushed. No real change in response. What do you think of that strategy? What would make it better for her? If your job. Is to help her and advise her. Which I am making it. For the purposes of this segment.</div>

And I&#39;m out. Of this conversation. It is the. Easiest question. To answer. So. She is afraid. Of. Probably. A good chunk. Of the caucus. If she. Is afraid. That tells me. That if you are. Running scared. Like that. Then you are doing. What you absolutely. Have to do. It may be. Also. That she actually. Believes this. And that. That. This strengthens. Her hand. Vis-a-vis.
