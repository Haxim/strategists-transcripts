        <p>Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter discuss a Conservative movement that has decided it will not pivot, will not moderate, and absolutely does not care who hates it for that choice. What does it mean when a party re-ups the leader voters say they don't like, even after winning the argument on the issues? Is wrapping yourself in the flag a real political move or just vibes? And did Stephen Carter get something right even with his brain frozen? Stick around to the end to find out.</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

Pierre Poliev effectively said, there are too many of them out there, these people who want us to abandon our conservative principles. His own convenient, poetic way of saying, fuck you, I&#39;m not changing. That is my takeaway. Stephen Carter, was that your takeaway? And I want to very quickly, before we jump into the majority of this episode, which I want to spend on separatism related to this conservative convention. Tell me what you thought of Pierre Polyev and his tact there to ultimately say you have re-upped the messenger.

It didn&#39;t start with a seven and nearly approached a nine. A nine would have been better, but it was good. It was solid. The room was with him. What it wasn&#39;t was a speech that was trying to take on Carney&#39;s Davos speech. I remember, Carter, you said, you know, this will be a speech that tries to, you know, compare the two. It was not that. And what it was wasn&#39;t an acknowledgment to maybe many people outside of that room. So I&#39;m curious how you read it. There&#39;s much to that speech. But the real nub of it for me was people want us to change. We&#39;re not going to change. You have re-upped me and you have re-upped the message by extension. Was that your takeaway?

I&#39;ve been a New Democrat a long time and we&#39;ve been talking about the thing that people want to talk about and yet people don&#39;t vote for us. So we need to think about why. Yeah, no,</div>

          <div class="said">no, you make such a good point, especially with that history of experience with the New Democrats, because you could argue that the electorate sent a very clear message, which is Pierre-Paul Lievre, we already bought your issue set. Thank you for elevating it. Thank you for putting it on the agenda. The liberals just promised that they will take care of most of those for us.

So I&#39;m not saying that what I&#39;m trying to posit is where their headspace is at, but I think given the fact that a lot of these folks, their job is to self-preserve and preserve Pierre Pauliev, they might just be waiting for another issue set or the same one to emerge again.

          <div class="said">some of the things that have happened over the last three, four days, over the weekend, where we look provincially, it&#39;s focused provincially. Danielle Smith is now on the the record thanks to some comments that she gave at the convention once again repeating the release valve line that the separatist referendum is a release valve saying that she doesn&#39;t really want to police her mlas for signing the referendum she doesn&#39;t know she hasn&#39;t audited she doesn&#39;t whatever like doesn&#39;t really have any sort of claim to that so those two things are new especially after the reporting came out from the financial times as we discussed on our patreon episode that said that the the separatists had met with the american state department and that they had acknowledged that MLAs from Danielle Smith&#39;s caucus were on it. So Danielle Smith&#39;s now come out saying she doesn&#39;t want to demonize the 30% of all burns. This is Justin Trudeau&#39;s fault that there are folks potentially on the list. I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t care. I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t seen the list. That&#39;s where she&#39;s at. Simultaneously, the New Democrats, they&#39;ve</div>

We&#39;re proud Canadians, right? It&#39;s really actually really probably the easiest thing in the world to just, you know, answer the question with no, I stand on guard for thee and I&#39;m out of this conversation. It is the easiest question to answer. So she is afraid of probably a good chunk of the caucus if she answers it in any other way. So that tells me that if you are running scared like that, then you are doing what you absolutely have to do. It may be also that she actually believes this and that this strengthens her hand vis-a-vis the federal government going into the MOU. Because like a lot of the MOU outcomes are quite imminent, right? April, May, June, essentially. essentially. So she figures that her approach to tantrum federalism has yielded results, and she&#39;s going to keep riding that until she gets what she wants out of the MOU,</div>

Shannon, coming back to you, you made a tweak going backwards in terms of what it might look like. You&#39;ve also suggested you probably want a few of your MLAs to come with some Canadiana.
