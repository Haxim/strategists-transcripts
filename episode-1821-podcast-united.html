I don&#39;t even remember, but I&#39;ll tell you this. It wasn&#39;t some great day where we stormed a Bastille or put put up a flag or signed any kind of declaration. No, it was a very administrative date. It was the beginning of a fiscal year. It&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Once again, theoretically, if you—theoretically. Or you could buy a Patreon membership to our podcast, which we&#39;ll only record around special occasions such as this. But there is an extensive back catalog back when we had more ambition. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, this is true. We&#39;ve all lost ambition and have gotten lazier but smarter. So it&#39;s really a tradeoff for the listening crowd, Carter. Here&#39;s what they&#39;re doing. One, they&#39;re offering a $1 base airfare for passengers flying to Canada from Sun Destination. So you already got to be in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, or Mexico. And on your way back, Carter, you can fly theoretically for $1. Now, that&#39;s just a base fare. Tell me, tell me this. The sponsor has back-channeled to me with two requests. Number one, mentioning this amazing promotion that everyone should try out, Corey, and everyone should take advantage of. Okay, they&#39;ve wanted me to mention this. But they&#39;ve also asked me if this is a fucking stupid idea as well. They&#39;ve also asked me to comment on that. Now, this is why they back channel. This is why they&#39;re not like any other sponsor. They want everyone to know about this. But they also want to know if this is fucking brain dead from a marketing perspective. So, Carter, have at it. How dare you? Is this gimmick by our presenting sponsor, Flair Airlines, a stupid deal?</span>

I can go bike riding any day. This is exactly what Flair Airlines should be doing. Flair Airlines. I mean, frankly, the fact that they&#39;re not paying you to get onto one of their planes is a giant victory for Flair Airlines.

And sort of one by one, Western provinces have either dropped or the voters have just absolutely moved on from their liberal parties. And BC was kind of this one exception. So the parties, none of them on the prairies except for Manitoba had any kind of official affiliation with the Federal Liberal Party. They all unaffiliated over the decades, right? right?

I encourage everyone who is supporting this party, which has been dwindling, to Corey&#39;s point, in the last number of months in terms of its public polling support. He formally said, fuck it, support the conservatives, support the guy I kicked out or that we kicked out as a party from the BC United slash BC Liberal Party, who now leads the conservatives. that&#39;s where you should put your attention your time your money and perhaps maybe even some of our candidates will be some of their candidates he effectively strangleholded his strangle held his his party live at a press conference steven carter i&#39;m giving the broad strokes</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but it can&#39;t survive a bad leader and the combination of a name change. And I&#39;m not convinced it would have done particularly well with a great leader and a name change. You know, I&#39;m going to throw what I&#39;ve come to believe on the table here, and then I&#39;ll go back to your question. But that is that name changes do not work. We have exactly one example of a name change that works in Canadian history. This is my argument. We can go back to that. You can say, what about X? What about Y? But it&#39;s when the PC party changed their name to the Yukon party in the Yukon in 91. Hardly a massive shining example that everybody can follow. But I believe that is the only successful name change I can think of in Canadian political history. And one of the reasons why a name change doesn&#39;t work, and one of the reasons why a name change is actually quite dangerous, as we&#39;ve seen with BC United, is it demands a lot of the voters. senators like there&#39;s a lot of polling that shows a huge chunks of bc didn&#39;t even know the name change occurred even now you know after all of this advertising all of this money spent and so when they get asked on a poll hey who are you going to vote for and bc unite is an option even if it even if the pollsters done the charity of saying formerly bc liberals right they&#39;re like what the fuck is that i don&#39;t know what that is and uh and they move on with their lives and unfortunately um there is no such thing as a lifelong bc united voter you&#39;ve actually given everybody an excuse to go drift off somewhere else right bc united as a name we have dissed on this pod a lot like going back to the start we said it was a fail not just because it sounds like a soccer team but because it was about their internal politics it was saying like we&#39;re united which means absolutely fucking nothing to a voter like oh you&#39;re a bunch of people who are not at each other&#39;s throats guess you got my vote right that doesn&#39;t mean anything right it wasn&#39;t about the province it wasn&#39;t about its philosophy for governing it was</span>

There is, Corey is correct. There is no Canadian precedent other than the Yukon party in the Yukon, which, let&#39;s be honest, isn&#39;t really a precedent when we really start talking about Canadian political parties.

Like, maybe this is the thing you do literally day one of a new election campaign. So everyone&#39;s tracking the ball understands your BC liberals right up to the last moment. And then when everyone&#39;s keyed in, and paying attention, and it&#39;s like, as of today, as of this election, we are not BC liberals, we are BC united, and we&#39;re united to change this province for the better. And we invite everybody in British Columbia who is interested in changing this province for the better, who wants to bring free market values and a social compassion to government and common sense to come join us and unite with us in changing this government. I think that could have worked too, but I actually think they picked the worst fucking time to do it, which is after enough of the people who were quote-unquote conservatives drifted away, but before anybody else in the province was paying any attention to this. And I do think that the polling sort of backs that up. So I would just say the doldrums is not a time where you want to be doing something like this.

            <span class="text">to myself. That&#39;s good. Here&#39;s the thing I would say. The equivalent would not be United Conservative Party, which was a merger of the PCs and the Wild Rose. And that was, let&#39;s not forget, the PCs were the third party at the time. The Wild Rose was the second party. It would be like if Jason Kenney took over the PCs and just renamed the PCs the United Conservative Party, and there was still a fucking Wild Rose. That would be the comp, right? Right? The Saskatchewan Party, everyone&#39;s forgotten because of how it&#39;s evolved, but the Saskatchewan Party was a merger of four liberals from the Liberal Caucus and four PCs from the PC Caucus into this eight-person caucus that was the Saskatchewan Party. The PC Party of Saskatchewan contested elections for the next, they limped along for years after that, you know, very ineffectually, but they still existed. The liberals still existed. It was not, to Stephen&#39;s point, a name change. It was a new political entity, and it was arguably a merger of two political caucuses. So, like, the idea that you can just say, oh, all we need to do to merge the quote-unquote right in BC is just to say we&#39;re the merged right and not do the work behind it? That&#39;s why this thing fucking failed, right? You know, it was never about the name. The name was the last thing on the journey. The name was the thing that they had to decide at the end of the road, not at the start of the road. And it&#39;s crazy to me that people look at these examples and say, yeah, perfect example of name change, because it wasn&#39;t even a name change in either of those two quote unquote successful cases. places.</span>

It&#39;s a strategy question around how to be a consultant around this stuff, how to be a good consultant around this stuff.

You know, the three of us are often quoted in newspapers and radio, etc. This person worked on the rebrand, okay, for BC United through their firm, and then went on to pretty much take a shit on the leader, saying he didn&#39;t listen. He had a committee of people responsible for the name change, didn&#39;t listen to them. I&#39;m sure that those staff and caucus people, we&#39;ve seen more over the conservatives, move over to the conservatives that made the decision to the party. They weren&#39;t listened to either. You could design a great logo. You could put out some ads, but it didn&#39;t answer the problem which the party had, which is where do you stand on the political spectrum? What do you believe?</span>

            <span class="text">But the strategy of someone who worked on this going on the offensive against the leader, now the former leader, I think that&#39;s really interesting to me. And has that ushered in like a new era of politics and decorum for those that kind of work on campaigns versus the leader, the power balances and dynamics? dynamics would you do something like this if you were kind of and i suspect this person is maybe being not blamed but you know it&#39;s well known that they were probably part of it they&#39;re probably trying to defend their reputation i find this to be really interesting and i don&#39;t think this is going to be talked about on any other podcast except ours which is what are the rules and the strategic plays and how the decorum and like the unwritten rules of how to navigate something like this do you go out in fucking canadian press and go on the offensive against a leader who was was responsible for this name brand as much as you were potentially?

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, just to finish off what Carter&#39;s saying, he might be a community leader. You can make the case that he&#39;s a leader in some sort of diplomat sense, right, in some sort of statesperson sense. I&#39;d entertain it. I&#39;m not sure I would agree. He&#39;s not a party leader. You know, he no longer leads a party. He led a party into the ground. That party functionally does not exist anymore. And so I think that is going to be coloring the commentary coming from a lot of of people who have been very committed to this now you&#39;ve you&#39;ve both been involved in political parties i&#39;ve been involved in political parties there are true believers there there are people who in life find religion and there are people in life who find politics and if you assault their political home you might as well be assaulting their identity entirely and this person destroyed it like he destroyed their political identity these people are having a crisis of faith that very few people can actually understand unless they&#39;ve had you know been involved in some very very crazy or very unfortunate situations. And so you can expect a certain amount of lashing out like this. What I will also say more prosaically is that some people will</span>

And much, much money was spent, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, and nothing moved. And at a certain point, you&#39;ve got to look around and say, is money coming in?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

They almost always regret it right because once somebody has shown that they&#39;ll be disloyal like that at one point they will be again in the future almost certainly and so you you try not to go out that way you don&#39;t want to be the person who is sour grapes even when people are blaming the last guy if you&#39;re the last guy you don&#39;t want to stand up and defend yourself and say no fuck this person too it&#39;s just it doesn&#39;t necessarily serve you well if you want a future in politics But some</span>

            <span class="text">because nothing in life is as good or as bad as you think it might be. But that&#39;s probably what they&#39;re feeling right now. And so now they&#39;re thinking, what can I salvage? I&#39;m going to try to salvage my judgment. So people think that I have good judgment, knew this was coming. I want to salvage my professional competency. I tried to execute this better, and I just was unable to execute it. And yes, I&#39;m not going to be able to salvage my sense that I&#39;m a team player. But frankly, Zane, most jobs in the world, you don&#39;t have to worry about your subordinates going to the Canadian press and saying bad things about you. The Canadian press isn&#39;t fucking interested, right? It&#39;s just not a story. So, you know, the requirement that somebody be able to be a team player on the macro scale and like that fear that somebody might come and bite you like in politics just doesn&#39;t exist in a lot of other workplaces. So, well, nobody I think in any workplace wants somebody who is going to be considered disloyal. The calculation does fundamentally change depending on what you want your future to be.</span>

And there&#39;s probably a bunch of people right now that are going to be stained with the longer-term Falcon-BC United demise. Even, frankly, I would argue, Carter, even if they were involved in the high-water mark of the BC liberals when they were in government, now that this enterprise. So what advice would you give to a Corey Hogan or a Corey Hogan equivalent who&#39;s saying, Stephen, fuck me, man. man. Like BC, the conservatives aren&#39;t going to touch me because I was really going ham for BC United. I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;ve got a future in this thing.

And Stephen raised, I think, probably too important It&#39;s an important point to have come up with the 45-minute mark, which is he did this on his own. He didn&#39;t bring in his party. He didn&#39;t bring in his organizers. He didn&#39;t bring in anything except for what I imagine was a very small circle because it didn&#39;t leak really ahead of time either before then. And so what do they owe the man who didn&#39;t even get their opinions on this, right? This was a unilateral action by a leader taken, I&#39;m sure, in a way that was very frustrating. And well, I suspect a couple of MLAs were maybe canvassed or maybe the ones closest to him. This can&#39;t have been something that was broadly canvassed or else, well, we know it wasn&#39;t. We know from all of the reporting it wasn&#39;t. And so if somebody, again, let&#39;s go back to that, you know, some people find religion, some people find politics thing. If somebody gives away your church without even talking to you, how much loyalty do you owe them at that point? Like the compact is, and</span>

That&#39;s probably, I didn&#39;t want to lose. And then his secret heart hidden away from the world, right? And I think in his secret heart, he really didn&#39;t want to fucking lose. Like he was mortified that not only would he lose, but he would go into the election with no ability to run the campaign pain whatsoever and so i&#39;m sure that you know the party lines so to speak you know his line i guess more accurately is it&#39;s for the good of bc we gotta stop new democrats uh you know we agree with them 75 of the time them being the bc conservatives we&#39;ve just gotta suck it up on the other 25 to stop the socialists who are flooding our streets with drugs and who don&#39;t understand business and are watching the slow decline of the bc economy and uh you know that the social disorder that has taken hold as a result of the British Columbia New Democratic Party. And so that&#39;s, of course, going to be the party line. I&#39;m sure people within the party are well aware that they were not positioned to do anything better than hold on to a couple of seats in a near wipeout, at least where the polls were currently.</span>

So if the BC Conservatives win, I&#39;m sure he can find himself to be a statesman and be considered a statesman going forward where people will say, well, good for him. He put the province ahead and, you know, the BC Conservatives will probably be very nice to him going forward. Although I got to say, it was pretty funny to see their social media saying like Kevin Falcon made the right choice in this instance or something like this. Like they couldn&#39;t even be gracious to him as he was wrapping up his fucking party. Pretty, pretty amazing. It tells you a lot about the BC Conservatives. But, you</span>

It&#39;s possible the comp is not Alberta in 2019 with the United Conservative Party, but the comp is 2015 in Alberta, where half the Wild Rose crossed to the PCs, leaving the Wild Rose theoretically for dead.

And certainly, when I think about the BC, and it&#39;s basically done, like I wanted to get their slate done this weekend&#39;s my understanding, but I would have, and so this is probably all moot at this point, but But I would have been thinking about it in terms of, well, don&#39;t give anybody a seat where they might just be totally out of it to the NDP at some point. They think that they have to kind of attack their own party from the left of their party along the way. And I would be thinking about those dynamics as I went through.

But this time now you either want them to go stay home or go to the BC NDP. Like that is not fundamentally a different strategy, right? I don&#39;t believe for a minute that the BC NDP strategy before was to take the fight to Kevin Falcon. That&#39;s just, if it was, that&#39;s crazy, right? That&#39;s just not the fight.

            <span class="text">tactics different outcome but same tactics same strategy with with very little nuance i think in there so uh yeah you can have a bit of a skunk works where you&#39;re trying to provoke some of the things that i cautioned the bc conservatives about you know those internal tensions and implosions uh which might help tell you that overall story but the overall story is the same these guys are nuts and so if you&#39;re on the left of that coalition if you&#39;re dipping your toes into that pool. We want you to yank your toes out and come running to us. And so I don&#39;t know that it needs to change at all. That said, I&#39;m sure when this happened, there was some butthole puckering, right? Like there was a lot of, holy fuck, this is not the election we thought we were going to have. And if all of this vote coalesces behind the PC conservatives, we might be screwed. And so I suspect that probably the best advice that the BC New Democrats need to hear is, and i don&#39;t know if this this is what they&#39;re organizing to tell them you got this nothing&#39;s changed you&#39;ve got to do the same things you needed to do the day before so execute on your plan do it well don&#39;t lose your fucking head obviously look for opportunities as you move forward but this is great for you and the debate that is great for you you know you&#39;ve got one less person beating up on the premier you&#39;ve got an opportunity to really have it focused on on um You know, the NDP versus conservatives. And by the way, this also entertains, this creates a huge opportunity with getting the green voters to come scared running to you, right? So like, I don&#39;t think this is all bad. And I think, by the way, Carter, part of why you&#39;re not seeing the tightening that you&#39;re talking about is there is a bit of a reshuffling on the left to don&#39;t discount the effect that BC Greens can have on some of those, especially top line numbers.</span>

He was coaxed to become the leader of the Conservative Party federally, and he accepted on the condition that it become the Progressive Conservative Party. Are we going to call that a success?
