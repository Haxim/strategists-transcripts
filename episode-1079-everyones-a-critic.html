I didn&#39;t do an in-depth analysis on the poll-by-poll results. You&#39;re going to be shocked to find out I didn&#39;t care that much. The election was over. I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You and in-depth do not go together. But I believe, based on Brad Levine&#39;s tweet, so if I&#39;m wrong, it&#39;s Levine&#39;s fault. But I believe that it was the advance polls that were so significantly in favor of Chow. And those just came in a little bit late. I don&#39;t think it was the endorsement from Tory. Corey, I just think that the recognition of who was the person who everybody was going to get behind to stop Chow came in just a little too late. People just didn&#39;t quite quite figure out who they were supporting in time.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, maybe not five days, because if it was the advance polls, that was, in fact, a little bit longer still than that. But maybe five days, maybe if that had been able to propagate a little bit more through the city of Toronto. But I agree with Stephen. I mean, ultimately,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">ultimately, we got to a point where people knew who the alternative was. There was a consensus alternative candidate. But as we said on the last pod, it was just a little too late. Politicians assume that there&#39;s this perfect transfer of information that simply does not exist.</span>

Every single person on that team has a role, has a role that has been outlined to them. Some of them have critic roles that have been divided in multiple files, multiple finance roles, multiple energy roles, I believe multiple health roles, if I&#39;m not mistaken. And then you&#39;ve got house leaders and deputy assistant house leaders. We can get into the details, and we will in a second. But I&#39;m talking strategy here. I&#39;m talking strategy first.

We don&#39;t know, but that&#39;s certainly a strong possibility. You don&#39;t necessarily want to look like you&#39;re putting your thumb on the scale and only giving some people that limelight and some people not.

What if that happens in three independent meetings they&#39;re not aware of where they&#39;re playing with live ammo and they&#39;re reacting to issues they don&#39;t even know the others are reacting to and they&#39;re saying different things?</span>

But now everybody just has to kind of fall down the line of, well, that&#39;s my responsibility. That&#39;s not my responsibility. Everybody&#39;s being given official roles, which means that everything that&#39;s not in their official role arguably isn&#39;t part of their purview.

You know, the new leader comes in and says, actually, you know what, guys, I have watched this in question period. And we do have some people who have higher skill levels than others. And so I&#39;m going to resort this so that those people get the opportunities to actually shine, and now you&#39;ve got a caucus uprising. But I always got to ask questions under Notley. Yeah, but you were an idiot, and you actually didn&#39;t ask questions very well. Well, Corey doesn&#39;t say I&#39;m an idiot. Well, Corey&#39;s also an idiot. You should listen to Carter.

And then the next thing that I would be doing is saying to people, you have to perform in question period here, here&#39;s the theatrical requirement. And I would say it that bluntly, it is a theatrical requirement. Each of you is going to get the opportunity to be, uh, in the theater and, uh, and ask the question, you know, ask the questions, but if you&#39;re not good at it, um, this is a temporary position you will keep your critic role but you will lose your house um spotlight if you are unable to perform if you&#39;re unable to ask the questions if you&#39;re reading questions when you&#39;re in the in the ledge if you&#39;re not able to stand and and address your question in such a fashion that it&#39;s actually seen by the cameras and seen outside of the the legislature then we&#39;re going to have to address that this is your opportunity to learn if you are uncomfortable with that here are some resources that can help you but this is part of the gig and maybe we didn&#39;t explain that to you when we signed you up but now you&#39;re here and now you understand uh what the role looks like cory</span>

Well, that&#39;s all going to happen through the leader&#39;s office. That&#39;s all going to happen through staff. This goes back to my point of this strengthening of leader-centric politics. By dividing these jobs so much, you&#39;re basically demanding a coordinating body that is going to be, by default, the leader and the staff.

How do you make sure that they actually have range of motion, authority to make decisions, authority to speak for their party?

Are we allowed to do this? Right. Or do I need to pass this over to Big Shot Sarah? Like, what&#39;s the plan here? And so, you know, that that&#39;s the thing that I would want to fight.

Like in some ways, you can make the argument that you&#39;ve got a bunch of people elected MLAs who are going to catch up to speed on their files, so easier on the staff. In the other case, as you were just talking about coordination right now, which is where the question came in, that&#39;s a lot to coordinate. So I&#39;m kind of curious your take on what pressure, more or less than a, let&#39;s say, a standard 12 or 15 person shadow cabinet? Does this kind of mean on the political staff and the resource?

I might have even said something along the lines of, I might have even considered combinations, right? And having fewer critics than there were ministers.

And in certain cases, by not having people not have critic roles, you don&#39;t give them an opportunity to simply just be a workhorse to get shit done. You almost position them to have to do questions or other sort of things. and it kind of reminds me of that. What you&#39;re trying to say is an extension of that point in some way. Carter, finish us off here. I&#39;ve got some follow-up questions on this, but I&#39;ll ask them in the over-under lightning round.

This segment could either be 45 minutes or 45 seconds, and it is upon you guys to decide. Because is there any political strategy to the fact that, yes, and maybe for the first time, but it&#39;s noticeable that Pierre-Paul Lievre, at least in his most recent press conference, ditching the glasses. He&#39;s done it a few times lately. Okay, perfect. So they might be trying something, okay? They are trying something for sure. Okay, well, talk to me about it. Do you think they&#39;re actually trying something? Do you feel like this is similar to Trudeau&#39;s, you know, when the election&#39;s coming, I&#39;m getting rid of the beard, I&#39;m getting rid of the certain haircut sort of thing?

Like if you&#39;ve got a job interview, wear your glasses if you flip back and forth between them because you look more serious and more studious and they age you up. And so there are benefits to glasses as well. But when you think about what politicians want to be known for, approachability, trustworthiness, warmth, well, then, you know, there are certain things that push you in a different way.

I mean, the guy was walking around wearing basically, you know, top siders and rolled up ill-fitting pants for most of his career and changing him into, you know, the guy who wore purple suits took quite a while.
