Plus: Pierre Poilievre isn't wearing glasses these days and that seems like a choice we should talk about, having a bigger conversation about political image consultants.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Alberta NDP critic assignments (everybody gets one!), Pierre Poilievre's new look - and the role of image consultants in politics. Is putting all of their MLAs into critic roles savvy politics and caucus management by the Alberta NDP? Do image consultants rely more astrology than science?

But I believe that it was the advance polls that were so significantly in favor of Chow. And those just came in a little bit late. I don&#39;t think it was the endorsement from Tory. Corey, I just think that the recognition of who was the person who everybody was going to get behind to stop Chow came in just a little too late. People just didn&#39;t quite quite figure out who they were supporting in time.</div>

But now everybody just has to kind of fall down the line of, well, that&#39;s my responsibility. That&#39;s not my responsibility. Everybody&#39;s being given official roles, which means that everything that&#39;s not in their official role arguably isn&#39;t part of their purview.

          <div class="said">was going to go to a question of how you guys would have formulated this now having the playing a bit of you know thursday night quarterback which i&#39;ll let you do in a second actually but i&#39;ve got a more maybe this is more of an interesting question if you were faced with this this roster um 38 this strategy it was explained to you it could have been one of the things you guys put out there today in terms of why they did it you really don&#39;t know um what would your advice be on next steps on this to prevent some of the things that you&#39;ve talked about uprisings um you know to prevent from some of the the pitfalls you see of this right what remedial or and it can be through a series of time it doesn&#39;t have to be like shut it down tomorrow like let&#39;s you know bury this to do that. I&#39;m not thinking about that sort of strategy. I&#39;m talking about like, how do you kind of, what&#39;s your graduated next step? Maybe that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to say. That is strategically aligned with what you have to work with, which is right here. What would you do next in order to avoid some of the pitfalls both of you have outlined over the course of your criticism of the critics? Carter first. I</div>

          <div class="said">I would do, the very first thing I would do is set up clear expectations of what the critic role looks like and how it&#39;s going to function when the legislature comes back in the fall so you know the critic role um is kind of twofold one one piece of it is to meet with stakeholders and understand those stakeholders uh you know develop alternate opinions to the government hear uh where the government is failing directly from the stakeholders themselves i&#39;d probably you know i&#39;d make sure that every state that there was a clearinghouse for stakeholder kind of relationships and meetings um in in calgary that might be the southern alberta uh, uh, you know, like the, the caucus staff is going to be at the clearinghouse of these things. And then the next thing that I would be doing is saying to people, you have to perform in question period here, here&#39;s the theatrical requirement. And I would say it that bluntly, it is a theatrical requirement. Each of you is going to get the opportunity to be, uh, in the theater and, uh, and ask the question, you know, ask the questions, but if you&#39;re not good at it, um, this is a temporary position you will keep your critic role but you will lose your house um spotlight if you are unable to perform if you&#39;re unable to ask the questions if you&#39;re reading questions when you&#39;re in the in the ledge if you&#39;re not able to stand and and address your question in such a fashion that it&#39;s actually seen by the cameras and seen outside of the the legislature then we&#39;re going to have to address that this is your opportunity to learn if you are uncomfortable with that here are some resources that can help you but this is part of the gig and maybe we didn&#39;t explain that to you when we signed you up but now you&#39;re here and now you understand uh what the role looks like cory</div>

          <div class="said">Well, the challenge I have with Stephen&#39;s strategy, which is, I think, generally pretty good. You talk about having a clearinghouse, coordinating. Well, that&#39;s all going to happen through the leader&#39;s office. That&#39;s all going to happen through staff. This goes back to my point of this strengthening of leader-centric politics. By dividing these jobs so much, you&#39;re basically demanding a coordinating body that is going to be, by default, the leader and the staff. And again, I think that that&#39;s unfortunate for the role of MLA, which I</div>

And so that&#39;s what&#39;s in my mind as I think about what those next steps need to be. I&#39;m thinking, how do you empower MLAs? How do you make sure that they actually have range of motion, authority to make decisions, authority to speak for their party? And for me, that is about having conversations, conversations, not so much about clearing housing, but like, okay, if</div>

          <div class="said">well, I don&#39;t even know who the other critics are in the energy space right now. But the idea would be, you are super specific about who&#39;s got the right to kind of talk for the party in those particular moments, and give them the authority to actually move the ball on their own court, rather than having to go back to the league and saying, saying, hey, hey, is this OK? Are we allowed to do this? Right. Or do I need to pass this over to Big Shot Sarah? Like, what&#39;s the plan here? And so, you know, that that&#39;s the thing that I would want to fight.

You guys have both worked in this role. I&#39;m kind of curious, like how you would think about this. Like in some ways, you can make the argument that you&#39;ve got a bunch of people elected MLAs who are going to catch up to speed on their files, so easier on the staff. In the other case, as you were just talking about coordination right now, which is where the question came in, that&#39;s a lot to coordinate. So I&#39;m kind of curious your take on what pressure, more or less than a, let&#39;s say, a standard 12 or 15 person shadow cabinet? Does this kind of mean on the political staff and the resource?
