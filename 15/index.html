        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk strategies of the week (O&#39;Toole on guns, Trudeau on anti-vaxxers, Singh letter), come back home to Alberta to discuss new vaccine incentives and measures and then provide debate advice to the federal leaders. How does Singh have a &#34;breakout moment&#34;? Is the PPC momentum real? And is Stephen a default character on everybody&#39;s enemies list? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk TVA debate, Liberal platform launch and a messy week in the 2021 federal election. Can the Liberals tie the Conservatives to anti-vax protests? Should the NDP have seen the Liberal endorsement ambush coming? And how many minutes does a Peanut Buster Parfait take off your life? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about political horserace polls, protests at Trudeau events and - through the lense of a game of &#34;Yes, and...&#34; the NDP counterstrategy to Liberal attempts to consolidate anti-Conservative vote. What do the polls say about momentum in this campaign? How does Erin O&#39;Toole keep from being tied to anti-vaccine protesters? And Carter&#39;s not serious about his strategy recommendation, is he?

Is accusing O&#39;Toole of wanting private health care a good attack? Is the NDP affordable housing plan smart strategy? And could anybody else go for a Terry&#39;s Chocolate Orange right about now?
