But the way it&#39;s being filled, and the nature of it, and the conversation around it, and some of the commentary from people like Dominic LeBlanc saying, no, I&#39;m going to be finance minister until the election. On one hand, of course, that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to say. That&#39;s what you have to say. But on the other hand, you</span>

            <span class="text">yeah a couple of lessons come immediately to mind for me one maybe i should make it the second one but i&#39;m going to start here he&#39;s taught us there is no liberal party right it only justin trudeau He&#39;s recreated it to such an extent that there is no infrastructure to keep him in check because in a more functional political party, and this is true, by the way, of Donald Trump and the Republicans as well, but in a more functional political party, there are checks on the leader&#39;s authority. The leader&#39;s office is not so all-powerful. Ministers have authority that they&#39;re able to exert. They have a voice they&#39;re able to use. The party apparatus has an ability to step in and the executive can lay pressure on. Donors used to be able to lay pressure on. This is another one of those changes that is, I think, subtle and unappreciated. But when we went to grassroots donations like this, we&#39;ve changed that particular check too, where large interests used to be able to come in and say, you know what, bud, no more. And not all good. I&#39;ll be the first to say that. But we&#39;ve lost a check on the leader&#39;s power as well, when you no longer have donors who can move in and move their heft around. So there&#39;s no Liberal Party anymore. There is Justin Trudeau, and there&#39;s the apparatus that Justin Trudeau has created. So I think that&#39;s lesson one.</span>

It&#39;s going to be shorter than our standard, but, you know, still give us time to have a good, robust discussion about the future. So it&#39;ll be a five-month contest. That&#39;ll take us to around July, right, to be able to assist us with that contest. We will prorogue Parliament, and we&#39;ll bring them back in August. we know we&#39;ve got an election in the fall but you know we&#39;ve got work to do and we appreciate that we can&#39;t hold off the business of the people for that long so we&#39;ll prorogue until august and i&#39;ll continue to be prime minister until then and then there you go all of a sudden you&#39;re there two moves and you&#39;re there right and people can grumble about them but at that point there with</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, this is the challenge, right? So you said people, if somebody is in cabinet right now and wants to run for the leadership, that&#39;s just going to be another hole to plug in a couple of days if he is thinking of resigning in the next couple of days, which is part of, I think, what&#39;s giving everybody a little bit of pause because you have to imagine some of the conversation with cabinet. And maybe there has been, maybe they&#39;re just keeping it very quiet. Maybe everybody&#39;s being very professional about it, but it would be, hey, are you planning to run if leadership opens up, if the answer is yes, I can&#39;t put you in cabinet, I hope you understand, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

You know, if there&#39;s some surprises in that sense, that&#39;s probably a huge indication that he is actually going and he is having those conversations. But if we don&#39;t see that, then I think that becomes more reason to doubt that</span>

And ultimately, if it was me, I would probably take it for a bunch of reasons. One is what Stephen talked about already, right? Like the honorific, the fact that you get to have this prestigious position. There are certain roles. We worked at a company where it was not nonpartisan, it was like multi-partisan, it was Hill and Knowlton, like there were everybody who had their like different political stripes, where that becomes almost a selling point. Like, oh, we&#39;ve got a former liberal minister, we&#39;ve got a former former conservative minister, we&#39;ve got Jagmeet Singh. He&#39;s great, you know, whatever it is, right?

Like, they&#39;re just leaving, leaving. That&#39;ll tell us something. And then I think also whether there are any changes to the portfolios, because if it&#39;s just the same portfolio, it&#39;s a lot easier for me to believe it&#39;s caretaker. If he&#39;s creating a new fucking portfolio, something along the lines of like that middle class one that they&#39;ve got there or they&#39;ve had,</span>

He knows he&#39;s powerful, but he doesn&#39;t act particularly like he&#39;s powerful. That&#39;s an interesting point. He is the key to a lot of people&#39;s potential success because I suspect they think that a kind word from Dominic and all of a sudden you&#39;re in cabinet or a not so kind word from him and all of a sudden you&#39;re not in cabinet. it. He is seen to be the prime minister&#39;s best friend in government, and that&#39;s going to make it easy for people to like him, because they have to. Because they have to, Zane.

            <span class="text">level of the tide, so to speak, well then, yeah, then all of a sudden you&#39;re in a lot of trouble, and then it looks like maybe you could lose it, right? I also thought that the UCP would throw a lot at it, and while it&#39;s true that Lethbridge West is a battle, or like a, I can&#39;t call it a battleground, whatever, a fortress for for the NDP.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s not true of basically any other geography around the area, right? And so it did seem to me that the UCP were better positioned to pull resources in than the NDP were at that particular moment. So that all weighed on the like, geez, I don&#39;t know, man, that seems like I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if the NDP lost it. Now, they didn&#39;t. They won it and they won it by just as much. And that matters because that tells us at the very least, the one data a point we have suggests that Nahid Nenshi can hold the Notley Coalition, which for me was not a given in any way, shape or form. And especially when we throw in all of those other things I&#39;ve talked about, I think that that&#39;s pretty good. And it&#39;s to say nothing of that province-wide advertising campaign about Nahid Nenshi going on.</span>

Because I&#39;m also curious how much Danielle Smith&#39;s Team USA approach, and I&#39;m not being charitable to her here, but seeming to be the premier who was most willing to play ball with Donald Trump, might have also played a little bit of a part here.

            <span class="text">That was one of the big hinge points about how they go around firing people, and now Now they were potentially going to have to fire people on a screen and how outrageous that was. And I do still actually believe that it is outrageous to fire somebody over a screen if it can be avoided. But also, it&#39;s not. So this is why I think it&#39;s egregious again.</span>

That there was going to be Monday, but it had to happen on the Friday for some reason for them. It wasn&#39;t like Friday or Monday, both are equally good. No, no, no. Friday was chosen, and the hurdle of, you guys aren&#39;t even in the same place, was solved by technology. Someone had</span>
