          <div class="said">that&#39;s fine i mean i i mean unlike every other episode the banter on our holiday spectacular it&#39;s free form it&#39;s supposed to be lively and we&#39;re not living up to it but do not worry because we&#39;ve got our first segment, like always. Every single year we do it. We do it first to calibrate us. Our first segment, How White. Now, this is the segment that you&#39;ve all been waiting for. If you&#39;re new to the show, welcome. If you&#39;re new to the Holiday Spectacular, welcome. This is a very simple segment. You know, there&#39;s been only one surefire way to predict if we&#39;re going to have a white Christmas, and it has been through this 10-question test that we give Stephen Carter each and every year. And here&#39;s how it works. For the past 11 years, if Stephen scores under a 5 on this 10-question test, regardless of geography, we&#39;ve had a white Christmas. It is a surefire predictor of how white a Christmas it is. And the way we predict how white a Christmas it is is we understand how white Stephen Carter is. So it&#39;s effectively called how white for that very reason. I mean, a longtime listener, you know that. So here&#39;s how it works. We&#39;ve got 10 questions that I asked Stephen Carter. They&#39;re actually relatively simple questions about individuals in this current 2020 climate, most of them political. And Carter has to give me an answer. He gets, he starts at zero, and he loses half a point for, he loses a full point if he gets the answer wrong. he loses</div>

          <div class="said">loses half a point okay if he pronounces the name of the person wrong okay how white so the questions are relatively easy until you get to uh a position where steven of course as you have heard on the show historically struggles with the pronunciation of some of our our most common melania</div>

I mean, not even just the way that we record this podcast, but, you know, every day I&#39;m following the COVID news. I&#39;m paying attention to the COVID news. I think it has to be considered are the biggest story of the year but then i i really want to include trump losing uh you know if in 2016 uh you know when we were doing the pod we said that trump winning was the biggest story of the year i think him losing has to also be the biggest story of the year so i want two big stories of the year because uh i think that um</div>

          <div class="said">I think you would just have to be hopelessly contrarian if you chose anything besides COVID for 2020 story of the year. Even Donald Trump, the way that election played out, that is so deeply tied into what happened with COVID and, you know, the consequences of having to vote remotely and all of that just fed into some of those narratives that Donald Trump was able to spin. Maybe he actually would have been in a better position. God help us. Maybe he would have won if it wasn&#39;t COVID. You know, the U.S. economy was doing gangbusters. That does tend to to be a bit of a leading indicator there but you know it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s the story of the year now living through it that&#39;s that&#39;s obvious and that&#39;s self-evident um but how is this not going to be the story of 2020 going forward as well the consequences all of the things that happened here good and bad over the past bit let&#39;s take the good we managed to create a vaccine from scratch in a year that&#39;s amazing and you know it really tells us the leaps that scientific uh you know discovery have taken. But then on the bad side, all of the money we&#39;ve spent on the more ambiguous side, it&#39;s really changed people&#39;s relationship with government. When we talk about politics, when we talk about the fundamental subject matter of this podcast, people have different expectations of government as a result of 2020. It&#39;s going to change the way we look at a lot of things for an awful long time because no longer can we really say, yeah,</div>

So let&#39;s call this an incomplete for me, because if he manages to land all of these labor fights that he started in a way that&#39;s favorable to his worldview, it&#39;s going to be very tough to say that he did this wrong, knowing that 2023 is still quite a few years out.

And what Jason Kenney needs to resolve to do in 2021 is ship. He has started so many different files. He has begun so many projects.

You know, another non-denominational year passes us by and where we wish you a non-denominational celebratory of celebration. I don&#39;t know why we call it that, but we do. It has been filled with ups and downs, lefts and rights, alt-lefts and alt-rights, and it has been good people on both both sides. So with that being said, we&#39;ve been so happy to give you both sides of this podcast for 2020. Of course, those sides being the self-righteous self-importance of Corey Hogan and the meetings with Mad Canada that Carter has brought you into. So with that, with me as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter, thank you for attending our Holiday Spectacular and we&#39;ll see you in 2021.</div>
