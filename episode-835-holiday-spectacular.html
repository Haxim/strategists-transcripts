            <span class="text">that&#39;s fine i mean i i mean unlike every other episode the banter on our holiday spectacular it&#39;s free form it&#39;s supposed to be lively and we&#39;re not living up to it but do not worry because we&#39;ve got our first segment, like always. Every single year we do it. We do it first to calibrate us. Our first segment, How White. Now, this is the segment that you&#39;ve all been waiting for. If you&#39;re new to the show, welcome. If you&#39;re new to the Holiday Spectacular, welcome. This is a very simple segment. You know, there&#39;s been only one surefire way to predict if we&#39;re going to have a white Christmas, and it has been through this 10-question test that we give Stephen Carter each and every year. And here&#39;s how it works. For the past 11 years, if Stephen scores under a 5 on this 10-question test, regardless of geography, we&#39;ve had a white Christmas. It is a surefire predictor of how white a Christmas it is. And the way we predict how white a Christmas it is is we understand how white Stephen Carter is. So it&#39;s effectively called how white for that very reason. I mean, a longtime listener, you know that. So here&#39;s how it works. We&#39;ve got 10 questions that I asked Stephen Carter. They&#39;re actually relatively simple questions about individuals in this current 2020 climate, most of them political. And Carter has to give me an answer. He gets, he starts at zero, and he loses half a point for, he loses a full point if he gets the answer wrong. he loses</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">loses half a point okay if he pronounces the name of the person wrong okay how white so the questions are relatively easy until you get to uh a position where steven of course as you have heard on the show historically struggles with the pronunciation of some of our our most common melania</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">uh you wish it was going to be that easy i got cory of course now i don&#39;t think it&#39;s a surprise uh to most people on this show you are a bit of a know-it-all uh so you are going to be both uh keeping score uh as well as correcting steven uh if he does make a mistake but of course you are just the guy who said milk to me so i don&#39;t know what the fuck this is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">already deteriorating that&#39;s pretty white very quickly no it&#39;s pretty wrong okay there&#39;s definitely</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">no way so here&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna do carter you start at zero okay if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">if you nail it both the answer and the pronunciation you stay at zero if you get the whole question wrong minus one if you get the question right but pronounce it wrong minus a half if we are below minus five white christmas all around i don&#39;t care where you&#39;re listening to us from if you&#39;re in dubai you are gonna get snow okay that is what&#39;s gonna happen this is a surefire way to make this happen cory do you Do you have any comments about your role before we move on?

I mean, not even just the way that we record this podcast, but, you know, every day I&#39;m following the COVID news. I&#39;m paying attention to the COVID news. I think it has to be considered are the biggest story of the year but then i i really want to include trump losing uh you know if in 2016 uh you know when we were doing the pod we said that trump winning was the biggest story of the year i think him losing has to also be the biggest story of the year so i want two big stories of the year because uh i think that um</span>

That&#39;s blind ass faith. This is I suspect that given the way he&#39;s leaving the White House, he has no intention of of going off towards the sunset.

            <span class="text">Corey, same question to you. Story of the year. Carter put out COVID and Trump losing. Respond to those or insert your own or perhaps a slightly different shift. What do you think? What&#39;s the story of 2020 for you?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think you would just have to be hopelessly contrarian if you chose anything besides COVID for 2020 story of the year. Even Donald Trump, the way that election played out, that is so deeply tied into what happened with COVID and, you know, the consequences of having to vote remotely and all of that just fed into some of those narratives that Donald Trump was able to spin. Maybe he actually would have been in a better position. God help us. Maybe he would have won if it wasn&#39;t COVID. You know, the U.S. economy was doing gangbusters. That does tend to to be a bit of a leading indicator there but you know it&#39;s not just that it&#39;s the story of the year now living through it that&#39;s that&#39;s obvious and that&#39;s self-evident um but how is this not going to be the story of 2020 going forward as well the consequences all of the things that happened here good and bad over the past bit let&#39;s take the good we managed to create a vaccine from scratch in a year that&#39;s amazing and you know it really tells us the leaps that scientific uh you know discovery have taken. But then on the bad side, all of the money we&#39;ve spent on the more ambiguous side, it&#39;s really changed people&#39;s relationship with government. When we talk about politics, when we talk about the fundamental subject matter of this podcast, people have different expectations of government as a result of 2020. It&#39;s going to change the way we look at a lot of things for an awful long time because no longer can we really say, yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah, that level of intervention seems seems unlikely. We&#39;ve seen intervention beyond what I ever thought was going to be practical in a short-term period. So when everything sort of settles,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re still going to be thinking about how dramatically things shifted as a result of COVID-19 and how it forced governments to work together, how it forced governments to react, how it laid bare how hollow a certain brand of conservatism is, this notion that we&#39;ll just step out. You&#39;re all on your own. You&#39;ll figure it out. we can trust you to make right decisions in aggregate. No, it turns out we actually need to collectively make decisions and then enforce them through the state in order for anything to get done.</span>

So let&#39;s call this an incomplete for me, because if he manages to land all of these labor fights that he started in a way that&#39;s favorable to his worldview, it&#39;s going to be very tough to say that he did this wrong, knowing that 2023 is still quite a few years out. So it&#39;s an interesting one for me. If this was the year before an election, this would be an abysmal performance.
