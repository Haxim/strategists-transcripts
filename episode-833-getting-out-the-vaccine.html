          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter rate coast-to-coast COVID-19 strategies and then dive deep on government strategy for vaccine distribution. How does government convince the vaccine hesitant to roll up their sleeve? What did we think of Pallister's "cancelling Christmas"? And why, exactly, does Corey want to privatize misery? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

It was 14 degrees here in Calgary, Zane. So I might actually even steal the Stephen Carter bit and talk about outdoors. It was crazy. I would walk out of my garage into my backyard and I would get hit with waves of warm air. And it is December 6th today in Calgary, Alberta, which is cold as fuck and very far north. So I was pretty stunned.</div>

So if you&#39;re new to the show, here&#39;s how this will work. I will alternate between Stephen and Corey. I will give them a item that happened this week and the political response or strategy that was instilled with it. So for example, the first one we&#39;ll get off the top, I&#39;ll just preview for you guys, is the federal fiscal update. We&#39;ll talk about what some of the material elements of that was, the vagary, why so vague. And I might go to Stephen and he&#39;ll give me the response between 1 to 10, if he likes the strategy, and what would make it better. So very simple. One is, I didn&#39;t love this at all, 10, this was a strategic masterstroke with what the government of the day or the politicians of the day&#39;s strategy or message was. And then you&#39;re going to give me some feedback as to what would make it better, what you would have tweaked, what you would have done, not done, etc. So you&#39;re giving me a scale between 1 to 10. 1 is not very clever, not very strategic, not great at all. 10 is that masterstroke. And then you&#39;re going to give me your additional comments and feedback. Does that sound good?</div>

            <div class="said">Corey, kick us off here. The federal fiscal update was earlier this week. Christopher Freeland, finance minister, indicated that the deficit will reach $381 billion by the end of March 2021. She also mentioned that the liberal government is preparing to spend nearly $100 billion to kickstart the post-pandemic economy. But for many, the details that were required for the Green Plan that was going to be instilled, how this recession, which is much more oriented and damaging to females, how the big ticket items in the speech from the throne were all going to be funded, solved in the timelines, were pretty vague so my question to you cory on a scale of one to ten what did you think of the liberal government&#39;s fiscal update and what would you have done differently either on the message or the substance from uh from what you saw well</div>

I&#39;m the guy stealing Christmas to keep you safe and you need to know this. And then he also added at the end, you know, stay safe, protect each other. I hope you don&#39;t need to like me, but I hope one day you respect me. This emotional sort of appeal, two minutes or so in length, that kind of took off for him.

What do you make of the strategy for Premier Kenney saying that this is nothing to panic about, this is a response, it&#39;s responsible, what we&#39;re doing, we have to have these contingency plans. If the hospitalization numbers go up, given the new cases, this is something we need to just contend with the fact is our reality.

So your entire take is a shift in message, which I heard, but it was also for me to clarify and for everyone to hear as well, was that you would have actually been proactive with this because this was ultimately a news story broken by the CBC. So you would have taken ownership of this. Corey, I want to ask you about that. Would you have have suggested the same thing right so i asked you if the story had break what would you have responded but from a let&#39;s say a higher order strategic scale would you agree with carter and say i you would have been proactive with this and put it out there i</div>

            <div class="said">Let&#39;s go from Alberta back to the federal scene this week. Aaron O&#39;Toole, leader of the Conservatives, sidestepped questions on Tory MP Derek Sloan, also a former leadership candidate, who&#39;s sponsoring a petition questioning the safety of COVID vaccines. On Thursday, day, O&#39;Toole refused to say whether he has a problem with Sloan&#39;s sponsoring of an e-petition that falsely cast doubt on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines at a time when the Tory leader himself is pushing to see vaccinations in Canada. Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you on this one first. What do you make of Aaron O&#39;Toole sidestepping, not giving a direct answer? On the strategy scale, one to 10, what do you think and what should he have done or what could he have done to make it better?</div>

            <div class="said">I think this is a one. I think we&#39;ve talked about getting Sloan out of caucus for for quite some time. I mean, who defined the Conservative Party of Canada when Scheer was the leader, right? Michelle Rempel-Garner, Pierre Palliev, and Derek Sloan. You know, in fact, Derek Sloan didn&#39;t because Derek Sloan was a non-entity. Now under O&#39;Toole, those three same people are still defining the Conservative Party of Canada. And that can&#39;t be good for O&#39;Toole. He needs a new Conservative Party of Canada that people would consider for for government. And I think that if you&#39;ve got Derek Sloan running around talking about the dangers of human testing is vaccination, like, dude,</div>

The conservatives are having their cake and eating it too right now. This seems to be this, we absolutely must get vaccines that absolutely nobody should be required to take line is well not is not exactly inconsistent. It feels deeply inconsistent, right? Like these vaccines are so bloody important. How dare you, Justin Trudeau? have us wait for even a minute for them um and then uh on the other hand this is human testing right so which is it like how is it can&#39;t really be both it can&#39;t be human testing that we&#39;re desperate to do and so i i think that he&#39;s blowing off his own foot on this one because as much as i think as we talked about last week that a lot of the conservative protests about us being back in the line on vaccines have have turned out to not at all be the case um you&#39;ve really deeply undermined that message.

On Friday, I believe that the LCBO and Skip the Dishes had entered into a partnership together to allow Ontario residents to have liquor delivered delivered to their home using Skip the Dishes, the popular food delivery app. It was then on Sunday, i.e. today, told to be paused by the provincial government, where Doug Ford said, restaurants still need our support. So myself and I&#39;ve asked the LCBO to pause their recently announced delivery plans with Skip the Dishes. I want to get your comments. What do you think of the Premier&#39;s move here? obviously a bit different their whole setup than we have here in alberta uh you know with uh with liquor and such so i want to get your thoughts on on what his uh what what you thought his message was on that one to ten scale with his support for restaurants oh</div>

I&#39;d privatize liquor. I&#39;d tax the hell out of it. And I would say my hands are as clean as they can be in this moment. So, you know, I don&#39;t oppose the idea that Skip the Dishes would bring you liquor through the LCBO.

It was when they&#39;d be delivering us the first sort of batch of vaccines. He then laid out who the priority folks would be in Alberta. What do you make of Jason Kenney&#39;s very specific date that he put on the table and then very much pointing to the federal government as like, they have told me that this is when we will get our first dose of vaccines.

Now, never mind the journey we took to get to this point. The fact is, it reinforces this narrative that perhaps we are not first in line to get vaccines. So, yeah, I mean, Trudeau is just going to – I think it&#39;s not just him not wanting to politicize COVID, I guess, is what I would say to Stephen. I think it&#39;s also a certain amount of self-preservation to say, well, I&#39;m just going to keep my mouth shut on this. And by the way, we</div>

            <div class="said">Let&#39;s finish off this segment with this final one. Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you. The federal conservatives are calling for a parliamentary committee probe of the liberal government&#39;s plan to refit a National Research Council in Montreal to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. So this was a partnership that was announced in May, a nearly $50 million partnership that fell apart in August after the government confirmed that the Chinese government, which they were partnering on, blocked shipments of vaccine samples meant to be used in the clinical trials. The Conservatives are now calling for a parliamentary committee probe. What happened here? Why did this fail? You know, as vaccine politics heat up, trying to perhaps capture that moment. Corey, to you on this, what do you give the Conservatives on that one to 10 scale with calling out and more specifically trying to encourage a parliamentary committee probe on this partnership that fell apart? So</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">So it&#39;s Schrodinger&#39;s score. I&#39;m giving simultaneously a 2 and an 8. If it turns out that we do have a problem getting a vaccine, if we open the box and we find it&#39;s empty and there are not vaccines for the good people of Canada, then it&#39;s an 8, right? Because you have given something very concrete that the federal government could have done that would have allowed us to have vaccines. This is the route we took. This route fell apart. part this is why we are all suffering when our allies across the world are now starting to get you know their needles and they&#39;re starting to be able to resume their lives however if things roll out the way it looks like they are which is we will get some of those early doses here in canada i mean i think it was either today or yesterday we saw what another six million doses of the pfizer vaccine they&#39;re saying yeah we&#39;re basically ready to roll within 24 hours of when that comes from health canada then</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">then it&#39;s a two because who the who the hell cares right we&#39;ll We&#39;ll be arguing about whether or not this vaccine bet hit. And the argument that the federal government is going to say is we put a lot of bets on the board. We did that for Canadians. We knew that things like this would potentially fall through. And that&#39;s why we have so many bets. And by the way, enjoy your Pfizer vaccine. Enjoy your Moderna vaccine. It almost becomes reinforcing of the government&#39;s narrative because rather than making one bet, they made many. And yes, this one didn&#39;t hit, but look at all the other ones that did.</div>

To Corey&#39;s point, this is both a two and an eight. It&#39;s a two if it fails, it&#39;s an eight if it works. Right now, they are basically betting their future on the Liberals screwing up this vaccine rollout. They&#39;re going to try everything in their power to set it up politically divisively, and they are going to push to do that using all the means available to them, which is fine. That&#39;s maybe what they should do. I mean, we saw Andrew Wilkinson try and play nicely with BC&#39;s NDP and absolutely get hammered for it. So I would think that this is what we expect from politicians now. out and if it works great and if it doesn&#39;t then they are off to the next the next accusations i mean they&#39;ve they&#39;ve run away from the we foundation there&#39;s nothing left there so they may as well try uh vaccine gate is that what we&#39;re going to go with what vaccine gate um they&#39;re setting it up and they&#39;re hoping for it to fail and</div>

This is a question that countries across the world are going to face. What is the right instrument to ensure that vaccine adoption is as high as it can be? We&#39;ve got, you know, individuals that perhaps belong to both sides of the political spectrum that would classify themselves as being anti-vax. We&#39;ve We&#39;ve got a swath of individuals that perhaps are maybe across the spectrum that would be skeptical of vaccines and their safety, as we&#39;ve seen. And we have a country that when H1N1&#39;s vaccine came out, six out of 10 of us did not take it. So, Carter, explain to me how big of a problem this is in your mind from a political level and from a political sort of problem as well. We&#39;ll have the vaccines on shore, hopefully early part of 2021. But if they&#39;re not adopted, if they&#39;re not taken, how big of a problem does that pose to to the public health and for the politics of of our leaders, both provincial and federal? Well,</div>

The second part is how do you lack of a better term, right to Corey&#39;s point here, here, inoculate against the folks that may not want to, that may be in that mushy middle right now, right? Before even we have vaccines coming to our proverbial shores, how do you ensure that we&#39;re not in a position where 40% of people are not wanting to take this vaccine? And then it&#39;s dealing with the folks that are anti-vax, right? Do you communicate to them at all? What do you kind of do? So maybe we split it up into these three buckets. And Corey, I&#39;m going to go back to you on this. So if take these three buckets, right, that you have, you inoculate, you have this group that&#39;s never going to want to take it, what time and effort do you spend on them?

            <div class="said">you need to inoculate against them to continue the medical terms. What you cannot have is that anti-vax group starting to scare the vaccine hesitant group and moving them into anti-vax. Into their camp, right. That&#39;s right. And on that vein, you really need to think about the messaging the pro-vaccine group has too, because it will not be overly helpful if the pro-vaccine group goes in and starts beating the tar out of the vaccine hesitant group that may push them to anti-vax. So you need to be thinking about the messages that your champions are carrying and how you can arm your champions with the right messages that help your overall landscape of communications rather than just the messages that they&#39;re going to want to say. Because I&#39;ll tell you, like I have arguments with vaccine hesitant people on occasion. Many of the arguments I give them about like all of the safety protocols that have been put in place, let&#39;s be honest, they don&#39;t really apply here, at least not as we&#39;ve normally understood them because things have moved very fast. fast and again i will be one of the first people to take that vaccine if i get the opportunity to do it and everybody who works in those vaccine and health spaces will say they&#39;re moving fast but they&#39;re they&#39;re not cutting corners that they think you know could be cut right so i i don&#39;t want to sow vaccine hesitancy i guess is what i&#39;m saying but realistically there will be vaccine hesitant people out there what you can&#39;t have is the pro-vaccine people going out and saying well you&#39;re just an asshole who hates your children and society if you&#39;ve got anxiety about this vaccine. That will not be a helpful message. And that will polarize things and potentially make it less likely for people to take that vaccine.</div>

And he said, the answer to people with anti-vax beliefs is to address their cause of anger. Why are they so angry right now? Why are they there at these anti-mask protests, assuming that there is a correlation between anti-mask and anti-vaccine, which there seems to be in some small data studies across the continent. What do you think of that?

            <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, this goes really far back. Catherine the Great took a vaccine to prove that vaccines worked when vaccines were brand new. And in fact, her doctor, after giving the vaccine to her was was ready to be rushed out of the country if something went wrong because people didn&#39;t actually know if it was going to work or not. But, you know, when people see their leaders doing it, they say, well, I guess that makes sense. I guess they think it&#39;s safe, so it&#39;s probably safe. And there&#39;s some value in that. But again, we shouldn&#39;t assume that that value is the same for everybody out there. I strongly doubt that the people who are marching in downtown Calgary</div>

Because, you know, Carter, you mentioned some really interesting ideas, right? A little portfolio of key messages that you can fan out, a little bit of a social media campaign that could be organized, right? You know, one of the things when I run campaigns, I tell everyone who&#39;s being supportive of a particular candidate or cause is that you come here as a volunteer, but you leave this room or this physical space as the campaign manager of your social network. And if you make that mindset shift, we have tremendous potential just within the small 20-person room here, because you are the hub of your social network. And that&#39;s pretty much what you&#39;re saying here as well. Corey, let&#39;s continue Free Idea Sunday, right? What else do you got, right? Because I want to actually put some stuff on the table so we can pick on it next time before we get into the work that governments can do in this case.

And if you try just to create a public health campaign for vaccines based entirely around fear, I think that that&#39;s destined to fail, right? It can&#39;t be so punitive.

You&#39;re going to go to seniors&#39; residences and long-term care facilities. You&#39;re going to go and try, because there&#39;s a lot of votes there. You&#39;re going to go to temples. You&#39;re going to go to churches. You&#39;re going to find places where there is significant communities, and you&#39;re going to start working with them to try and motivate and push out this vaccine from their community. And I would think of it the same way we think of the GOTV. Very small groups, but where can I get the best return on my investment? Where am I going to find the most likely sections of the population that will take this?</div>

They need to be nimble. They need to be data-driven. They need to build it to last a moment, not a lifetime, because the situation will change dramatically over the next couple of months. So my advice is listen to the expert campaigners, not the senior bureaucrats. This is a time for us to be thinking about it like the GOTV frame.</div>

And to see what sort of tools they&#39;ve built, if they go in with a top-down model or if they are, to Stephen&#39;s point and to your point, Corey, empowering people along the way that are going to take this vaccine to be distributors of that message going forward.

            <div class="said">I&#39;m sticking on the federal side, and Corian, I&#39;m going to stick with you. This week, it was announced by our Indigenous Services Minister that the Trudeau government won&#39;t meet their promised drinking water targets in Indigenous communities. The political cost of this, what do you think this looks like for the government? I&#39;m going over under on seven. Ten is a significant political cost. One is not so much of a political cost. What are you giving the Trudeau government on this? Well,</div>

            <div class="said">Well, you&#39;re talking political cost. Unfortunately, probably under. And I think that&#39;s a real shame. That&#39;s, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a total outrage that doesn&#39;t, this is not shocking news. But the fact that we as a first world nation, one of the wealthiest nations on earth, have have pockets, you know, whole communities where drinking water is not potable is is effing insane. And while I do applaud the government on making some strides in the past few years, some strides is not enough. enough we this is this is kind of a very fundamental thing whip out your copy of maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs guys see where water is on this is fucking ridiculous but um you know unfortunately i just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to have a a huge political effect carter</div>

            <div class="said">it&#39;s under um there will not be a political cost i think that one of our biggest challenges in canada is our first nation or not our First Nations, the First Nations of our country. We struggle. We have not done a good job. Every action that we have taken has created tremendously negative consequence. So it seems like we&#39;ve given up taking actions. And I think that this is our Achilles heel. This is what stops us from being a great nation. And if we don&#39;t start thinking of actual solutions, we&#39;re going to have real problems. But there is no political price to pay for it. And as long as there&#39;s no political price to pay for it, chances are we&#39;re not going to solve it.</div>

            <div class="said">Carter, I&#39;m going to stick with you for starting off our last one. Conservative MP Eric Duncan, the first openly gay conservative MP, laced into the federal health minister last week over the Liberals&#39; failures to end a ban on gay men donating blood. This is a campaign promise that the Liberals made in 2015. They reduced the five-year limit to a year. They&#39;ve recently reduced it to three months, but they still have not outright banned it ever since they made that campaign promise in 2015. Carter, give me your A to F political score for Eric Duncan on bringing this issue up and trying to hold the liberals&#39; feet to the fire on this issue.</div>

            <div class="said">I think it&#39;s an A. I mean, I think that this is something that he gets to do because it&#39;s a tragic policy, and it&#39;s a policy that Trudeau said he was going to fix. I mean, Trudeau also said he was going to plant 2 billion trees. That was also put under the update that we got last week, that they&#39;re still going to plant 2 billion trees. I don&#39;t know why you have to wait to start planting 2 billion trees, but whatever. This was a knee-jerk reaction in 1992, and no one&#39;s undone it. So Trudeau said he was going to undo it. He hasn&#39;t done it. So this is a good strategy.</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;ll give them an A. I give the liberals an F on this. It&#39;s just embarrassing. And they were so righteous and high-minded during the 15 campaign about how they were going to fix this. And then I believe Jane Philpott was the Minister of Health at the time. And it was just, it was embarrassing. Like the stance that the government has taken is embarrassing. And one year, three three months, I don&#39;t care. It&#39;s an embarrassing stance. The idea that gay men cannot give blood if they have been sexually active, but heterosexual men can, is nonsense. You&#39;re screening the blood anyways. What you&#39;re saying is just, is deeply offensive. Fucking get your house in order, Government of Canada. I don&#39;t know who is standing up and opposed to this, but take them aside and give them a stern talking to. Now, as far as the Conservatives go, this helps the Conservatives not look like cavemen. This helps that re-skinning of the Conservative Party that&#39;s going on under Aaron O&#39;Toole.</div>
