        <p>The gang discuss the merger talks in BC between BC United and the BC Conservatives - plus co-chairs, reversal on decriminalization and a debrief of Stephen Carter's performance when being interviewed by the Prime Minister.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the utility of regional co-chairs before turning their attention to right-wing-party merger drama in British Columbia. Do campaign co-chairs have a role in 2024? Is David Eby now in a one-on-one electoral fight? And who else remembers 2&amp;7 Sports at 11? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Historically, that job has also included chairing the Green Light Committee. So going through the candidate vetting process, meeting with those candidates that have come forward through the various mechanisms that are available. I don&#39;t know, even in my time, that was getting much more centralized. So I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s a huge part of the job now. But there&#39;s still work to be done.

The entire show is for you. About time. Yeah, you&#39;re really fading here, so let me get the most important questions out of the way, Carter. Overrated or underrated, the political hurt EB is going to feel, you think, heading into this election on the recriminalization. So this is after weeks of troubling stories about the problematic street drug use in hospitals, parks, bus stops. B.C. asked the federal government to recriminalize the use of drugs in these public spaces. How much is this going to hurt? Is this an overrated political story or is this an underrated political story as it relates to EB&#39;s and the NDP&#39;s political future?</div>

          <div class="said">I think it&#39;s underrated. I think that organizations that don&#39;t understand that addiction is not a criminal issue, it&#39;s not a mental health issue, it&#39;s an addiction issue. Addiction is troubling. It is impossible to manage for other people. It&#39;s hard enough to manage for yourself. And this idea that decriminalizing was going to solve an addiction issue hasn&#39;t done so. and it hasn&#39;t made the streets safer and it hasn&#39;t made uh crime go down it hasn&#39;t made everything work the way it should so my thinking is that uh you know eb is going to be dealing with this for quite some time because it was absolutely the wrong call in in the same thing with oregon i mean um or oregon oregon um you know this is it&#39;s not a question of whether it&#39;s legal or not not the addiction doesn&#39;t care. Addiction doesn&#39;t care if it&#39;s legal or not. So, um, you better be able to find ways to manage the consumption, manage the addiction, manage the, the, the drugs. And I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s going to happen, uh, with this new set of drugs that have happened that are, that, that they&#39;re beset upon our population. I&#39;m tremendously</div>
