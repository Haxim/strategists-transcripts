          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss political trial balloons and give their feedback on political strategy in the return of "Fine, Fabulous or F*ckd". When and why do governments use trial balloons? How should oppositions respond to them? And has there ever been a better metaphor than a bunch of MAGA boats at the bottom of a lake? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

When we were talking about the initial – so this is in particular, just to give a bit of background on it, this is Telford&#39;s husband, Rob Silver, reaching out to people in the PMO and PMO adjacent, being sent to the finance uh ministry to to argue his case for changes to serve i believe it&#39;s servers sues i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know which one of these but uh one</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">approached ahead of time. They created additional walls, additional screens, even beyond what the ethics commissioner required. And so what what the hell is the story here?</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">This is different. This is now actually pointing to a concrete example of somebody using their influence, allegedly, in order to get something to their benefit. And it might not be okay, what he did. There&#39;s not enough details. And there&#39;s a lot of ambiguity about who was in the job, when were they a PMO staffer or not. And, and so, you know, let&#39;s see where the details fall on this. But it is by no means clear cut that this is not a a problem, shall we say. So I think it&#39;s fine.</div>

            <div class="said">Corey, you know, I&#39;ll follow up with you very quickly before going to Carter. We talked previously about some of the items against the liberals that the conservatives were waging as diluting the story on we. Is this fundamentally different? Is we still the focal point this much time elapsing? Or are you okay now focusing on different issues to try to generate a pattern? I wanted to kind of try to see if we could square those two thoughts that we&#39;ve had in previous episodes well</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">well let&#39;s be really clear here that that still is good advice you&#39;ve got to keep focused on the real scandal and not have fake scandals but if you have two real scandals that both fundamentally tell the same story which is the prime minister&#39;s office is going to go out of its way to help its friends then you don&#39;t actually have a distraction you have something that reinforces that story and builds a stronger narrative, to your point.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">And that could be quite helpful to the conservatives, because it&#39;s not just a question of we at that point, it&#39;s a question of multiple actions in a very short window of time here. And by the way, they share some commonalities, like this was just money flying out the door, COVID response, it was going to the Prime Minister&#39;s friends, the Prime Minister&#39;s friends were the first who were able to have the conversation in order to see if that money was available for them. That is fundamentally the same story. What is not the same story is when you start digging</div>

            <div class="said">well it&#39;s fucked i mean cory may have done a fine job contextualizing it but he&#39;s again missed the forest for the trees um the problem with this is that they&#39;re going to the ethics commissioner they&#39;ve already gone to the lobbying commissioner which is where they should go because ultimately this is a uh lobbying breach potentially by Rob Silver, not an ethics breach by Katie Telford. By jumping in and now getting a clean sheet of paper for Katie Telford, they&#39;re undermining their own story. This is essentially the conservatives being the hammer that they are, searching for a nail and running to the ethics commissioner. This is the equivalent of my youngest brother running to my mom and dad every time I got in trouble. You know, Stephen&#39;s done something wrong. Stephen&#39;s done something wrong you know sometimes they&#39;re just not going to care after it you know just shut the fuck up and that&#39;s how i&#39;m feeling right now about the conservatives in the law and the and the ethics commissioner you went to the right place you went to the to the lobbying commissioner wait for that report because that report could be significant now you&#39;ve undermined it by going to two commissioners who are going to look at the same thing from different points of view with totally different mandates and the result is going to be one of them is going to go oh i don&#39;t like this and the other The other one&#39;s going to go, my office has nothing to say. And who&#39;s the liberals going to pick up? And they&#39;re going to wave it to the Canadian public. Oh, we have nothing to say, nothing to say at all.

We can&#39;t have a story so big being a Comey-like thing that distracts from the election. We now need to compel the sources to be named. What do you think of that political strategy? Fine?

Carter, I&#39;m going to actually stick with you on this one for our next one, which is about the conservatives. Our federal conservatives here under the new leadership of Aaron O&#39;Toole have said, just like the liberals, that they&#39;re going to stop taking the wage subsidy going forward. But unlike the liberals have said, they&#39;re going to pay it back. So I&#39;m curious to hear what you think of that strategy. Fine. Fabulous. Fucked.</div>

Usually, when the prime minister has to actually say that they support you, that means that your support is pretty tenuous, because people are asking questions about it.

Last one on Donald Trump. A political article today coming out saying that his focus is now shifting from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris and starting to brand her as the individual who is going to drag Joe Biden to the left. So as you know, he&#39;s been trying to paint Joe Biden as the mayor of the civil unrest that we&#39;re seeing in our urban centers. But I think the focus of the campaign, according to this article, is now going to be on Kamala Harris as the reason he&#39;s starting to make that radical leftist shift.

Guys, I want to talk about, I want to talk about trial balloons and I want to take a little bit of a step back because I think we&#39;re seeing something interesting happening in the dog days of summer, both in our home province here in Alberta, where this term trial balloon is being floated recently. And on the heels of prorogation, this concept of a trial balloon by the Trudeau government is being floated. So before we get into these trial balloons and assessing whether they are what they are, let&#39;s talk about what a trial balloon is, because I don&#39;t think we necessarily have a crystal clear definition, how to define whether one is or not, what some of the rules are, what it actually defines. So maybe Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. And I think this is where I can heed your guys&#39; expertise in governments, running offices, running comms for a province. What is a trial balloon, Stephen? And what constitutes it? And what are some of the kind of the scaffolding or the rules that define what a trial balloon in public looks like?</div>

            <div class="said">A trial balloon in public is simply testing the waters and testing out whether or not an idea is going to be palatable to the general population. So one of the things we try to do is poll on something. So we poll on something and we determine whether or not an idea is successful or not. But the problem with that is that a lot of ideas don&#39;t mature until they&#39;re out into the public and the public is talking about them. So that maturation is what we&#39;re looking for in a trial balloon, because something may be completely unpalatable</div>

So the opinion leader would put out the literal opinion, and then people would evaluate that against that. The important thing about a trial balloon is it has to be big enough that people know it, and it has an impact within the general population, but not so big that it, you know, kind of forces the government&#39;s hand. You&#39;re not trying to put yourself into a corner. You&#39;re You&#39;re trying to figure out whether or not doing something is right or wrong. You want to have both options available to you.

The reason people are calling it a trial balloon, well, at least why us internally feel like it&#39;s a trial balloon, is because it&#39;s got a lot of the number five in it, which is, if you go back to our special episode in the poll that Corey got, also had a lot of number fives in it.

And Carter, I&#39;ll go to you because we have Daniel Smith putting out a op-ed, which has three steps to it. Number one, to liquidate the Heritage Fund here in Alberta to pay off our COVID deficit. Number two, to establish a sovereign wealth fund where every dollar of resource revenue goes into that until we can reach $100 billion and then comfortably generate $5 billion in interest-based income from it. And then finally, balance the budget by increasing taxes, which is almost a political no-go for someone like Danielle Smith until now, and reducing spending in equal measure. $5 billion a pop. So yes, a provincial sales tax, and yes, reductions in health and education. So using some of the assessments and the rules that we&#39;ve just laid out, A, do you think this is a trial balloon? And B, do you think they used the right voice if it was?</div>

We start talking 5-5-5 and then, you know, then people are talking about it. And I&#39;m not going to say we take credit for that in the zeitgeist, but you know, a lot of conversation in Twitter spurred as a result of all of this. The other thing is there&#39;s components of her plan that I just can&#39;t imagine the government being remotely interested in first and foremost is the liquidation of the heritage fund that&#39;s not easy you know investments of that size and scale you don&#39;t just say to your banker like hey okay i just want that all in cash like just make the check out to cash for that 20 billion dollar you know sovereign wealth fund that that doesn&#39;t make an awful lot of sense to me as well what is the point of taking all of that money out just to start putting all of that money back in because Because you are then talking about building up essentially the Heritage Fund again to $100 billion. Why not start one-fifth of the way there? Especially where interest rates are on borrowing versus what we&#39;re getting from the stock market, which is phenomenal returns still. There&#39;s probably a stronger argument to be made to borrow as much as possible and invest it in the stock market, frankly. Not suggesting that. That would expose the government to a lot of risk.

But let&#39;s leave this bracket open for a second and open up the federal bracket, because I want to close both of them at the same time. On the federal side, we are now seeing the prime minister, his ministers out there telegraphing greening of jobs, child care, basic income, guaranteed federal income, housing. These big social programs have been touted and telegraphed in multiple publications. And we&#39;re now starting to see what I guess is a political class responding, right? A couple of op-eds today in the last couple of days saying, well, Trudeau needs to be careful about his activist agenda. Here&#39;s the opportunity for the conservatives. So we&#39;re starting to see some response on this. So same question. With the rules that we just talked about, do you feel like what&#39;s happening on the federal side is the government testing their appetite or their ability to actually go big with an activist agenda?

On a scale of 1 to 10, what did you make of Jason Kenney? What I&#39;m assuming was a forced retirement for his friend Paul Bunner, his speechwriter who got into a lot of hot water earlier this summer for his past comments. Retirement was the exit ramp that they decided to take, as you say, as a party. 1 to 10, what do you think of that political strategy? I</div>

            <div class="said">I was fascinated by it. I think that Mr. Bunner is probably looking for a severance package somewhere along the way. I&#39;m not sure you get the same package when you retire. And I&#39;m not sure that he would have been fully vested into a pension. So this would be a fairly significant financial step for him. But it was a way that Jason Kenney got to ease out a staff member that was causing him nothing but pain. You know, unfortunately, they just slide another one right in. So, you know, the problem is that they just keep putting people like this into positions of power. So one moves out, another one&#39;s moved in. And the NDP and the opposition will find another whipping boy here pretty soon.</div>

            <div class="said">There&#39;s two ways to look at the issue. One of them is from the public point of view. And on that, it&#39;s a bit of a fail, right? Because you got the abuse and you&#39;ve still lost the staff person. You know, you took for multiple months kind of the attacks that you have a racist speechwriter, quote unquote racist speechwriter there, right? And, you know, that hurts. But there is also the staff management and the team element of this, which I think are very easy to discount from the outside. And I didn&#39;t know he was almost 65, and that might have changed even my thinking about it when we talked about it a couple of months ago. But you can easily see either him or his chief of staff or somebody saying like, we can&#39;t fire Paul. He&#39;s three months to retirement age. That would just be so brutal. Can&#39;t we let him leave with a little bit of dignity? Doesn&#39;t he deserve – I mean, he&#39;s been here. He&#39;s been a trooper, whatever it is. Like, these are people you work with every day.

They&#39;ve been outspending him on Facebook, but they expect to outspend him three to one, if not four to one, according to some of the recent tracking that we&#39;re seeing from the digital analytics.

And I&#39;m not saying which one it is, but it&#39;s, it&#39;s horrible. And she watches it every day and she skips over the commercials every day. But when she&#39;s figured out how to skip over the commercials, then everybody&#39;s figured out how to skip over commercials. That&#39;s just where we are in today&#39;s broadcast world.

And, Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you over under on four. Or there&#39;s an update in Alberta&#39;s inquiry commissioner regarding our foreign funding against Alberta, against the lifeblood of our province. It now turns out that after getting an extension on timeline, after getting a change in scope, and after getting another million bucks, Steve Allen has yet to decide as to the process of inquiry for his work for whether Alberta is being targeted by eco-terrorist organizations and such.

There&#39;s a lot to unpack here. I hate handing in things late. It happens all the time in communications. You&#39;re waiting for something that doesn&#39;t occur. Because the minute it&#39;s late, the expectations get higher, right? It&#39;s no longer, hey, here&#39;s the comms plan. It&#39;s here&#39;s the world&#39;s greatest comms plan is the expectation there. And so I just – that&#39;s just sort of human nature. If you ask for an extension, it better be pretty good when you get it because then the understanding is you&#39;ve had the time to do it right. There is no indication that this is either going to be timely or competently done at this point because they haven&#39;t even started is what we&#39;ve learned here. And this is just a dumpster fire. And every time they extend it, it becomes more of one. Now, so much of this was actually – like the actual inquiry was based on the work of somebody in BC who I will not call a journalist named Vivian Krauss who came up with all of these connections between these large US foundations and environmental activity in Canada. Well, fucking newsflash. Environmentalists spend money on protecting the environment worldwide, right? Right. But, you know, Vivian Krause&#39;s theory is that this is a concerted effort by the like the Hewlett&#39;s and the Packard&#39;s because they&#39;ve got oil in California still and they&#39;re trying to shut down Canadian oil for the benefit of American oil.</div>

I mean, Vivian Krause, as I believe I said on this podcast once before, did all of this work from her dining room table. able uh what is taking steve allen so long why is he unable to put forward a decent report and why is he not able to give in a court document this isn&#39;t just him saying on twitter well i&#39;m not going to answer the question right now this is a court document being unable to answer the question of how we&#39;re going to let people that are like the organizations named in the report</div>

            <div class="said">Nicely done, Corey. Let&#39;s end it with our listener question for the week. Our listener question coming to us from PB&amp;J1983. Thank you for your five-star review and your question. The question is, as such, do you feel the conservatives, federal conservatives, that is, are missing either willfully or otherwise important context when they referred to the last federal election as missing an empty net? And what implications or impacts do you think that mindset might have going forward? So we now have a new leader. You recall that comment, missing an empty net was a Peter McKay line when he criticized Andrew Scheer, saying all he had to do was just score. Of course, irony is that Peter McKay had an empty net in his leadership race and loses that. But the question is really about what mindset do you think that that could have or what impact that could have if that&#39;s the current conservative mindset heading into the next federal election, whenever that may be. Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you.</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">Well, I think that, first of all, elections aren&#39;t empty nets. No one ever pulls the goalie. You know, there are two sides and they are going to, well, there are more than two sides. There&#39;s, you know, multiple parties. Each one&#39;s fighting for every inch of opportunity, every seat. There&#39;s 338 different ridings where you&#39;ve got a different campaign being undertaken with all kinds of different pressures. It looked like an empty net if you&#39;re in Alberta. But, you know, you&#39;re running a, we&#39;re running campaigns from across the country. This was not an empty net for the Conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. And by putting that kind of pressure on it, I mean, is</div>

            <div class="said">win elections in order to be successful? There is no question. But how you lose also should say a lot about the party. And this particular party in that election, was the failure entirely the Conservatives Or was there some opportunism from the Liberals? And I think that for the most part, it was just another Canadian election. And to put this empty net modifier on it is just – it&#39;s missing the entire context of the election.</div>

            <div class="said">Parties can&#39;t buy their own press. They can&#39;t start believing the caricatures they peddle. This notion that Trudeau is an empty suit, utterly incapable, and should have lost that election 10 days out of 10 is not real, right? He is a talented politician. He has a significant amount of charisma, certainly compared to Andrew Scheer. I mean, it wasn&#39;t an empty net. There were certainly a number of problems that the liberals had that were unique to that particular moment that made it seem like how in the world does</div>

If anything, they imply it the other way, that Trudeau is going to coast to a re-election here. And as</div>
