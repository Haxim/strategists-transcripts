            <span class="text">This is The Strategist, episode 820. My name is Zain Velji. With me, as always, Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan. Guys, what is up?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Sunday night. This is a big night. It&#39;s Sunday. I&#39;m very excited. You know, long weekend and you still managed to make it, Zain. Only 12 minutes late.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This is kind of the dog days of fall, I guess. Summer still. I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s both lots going on and nothing going on. And it&#39;s a really dismal day weather-wise in Calgary. So small talk is going to be even better than usual, I think.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Well, here&#39;s what makes it better than usual is that, Corey, how long did your mustache last? 18 days? 19 days? And why is it now gone? Not a long time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It didn&#39;t have a constituency back in it. And so I found that it couldn&#39;t survive a confidence vote. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I didn&#39;t want to risk it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">And you didn&#39;t know that from the initial polling that was offered to you? Not even taken, but politely and gently and then aggressively offered to you?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I felt that if I just stayed the course, you know, did it early in my term, that my wife would ultimately just get used to it before it came up to an election. That was my big hope. It didn&#39;t happen that way. Even</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Even I predicted that thing wasn&#39;t going to make it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">That is excellent. Corey making the novice mistake as hope as a strategy and just falling flat on his face. Of course he would. Of course he would. Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Guys, it&#39;s a goodie. It&#39;s an oldie. Our first segment is Fine, Fabulous, or Fucked? Oh, my God.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">God. It&#39;s been years. It</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">It has been a very long time, and we&#39;re bringing it back. For those of you new to the show, first of all, where the fuck were you? Secondly, welcome. Here&#39;s what this segment usually entails. I go through a list of items that are currently in the political zeitgeist, decisions that political parties or politicians have made, and Stephen and Corey tell me whether that strategy is fine, fabulous, or fucked. Fine is meh, fabulous is excellent, and fucked is very fucked. So that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">And we&#39;ll start with you, Corey, because your enthusiasm seems sky high from what seemed to be a very lukewarm start from you. You are now just, I could just see the energy on your face. It seems like you&#39;re ready to go. And we&#39;re going to start</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">start with this. You can see his face. It&#39;s a step forward. This</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">This is true. This is true. Corey, the first one for you. Fine, fabulous, or fucked. Conservatives. Are federal conservatives requesting another ethics probe into Katie Telford and the PMO? What do you think of that political strategy in what you&#39;ve called the dog days of summer, early days of fall? Fine? Fabulous? Fucked?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s fine. When we were talking about the initial – so this is in particular, just to give a bit of background on it, this is Telford&#39;s husband, Rob Silver, reaching out to people in the PMO and PMO adjacent, being sent to the finance uh ministry to to argue his case for changes to serve i believe it&#39;s servers sues i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know which one of these but uh one</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one of the acronyms that would have benefited uh mcap and ultimately he was unsuccessful but there is a um there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is all sorts of questions as to whether that conversation should have happened at all uh whether they would have even even entertained it were he not a friend of the PMO, so to speak. Why I think this strategy is fine and why I think it is fundamentally different from the conversation we had previously is that previously there was a media report that isn&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">isn&#39;t his employment suspicious. And there were all sorts of details like the ethics commissioner had been approached</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">approached ahead of time. They created additional walls, additional screens, even beyond what the ethics commissioner required. And so what what the hell is the story here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This is different. This is now actually pointing to a concrete example of somebody using their influence, allegedly, in order to get something to their benefit. And it might not be okay, what he did. There&#39;s not enough details. And there&#39;s a lot of ambiguity about who was in the job, when were they a PMO staffer or not. And, and so, you know, let&#39;s see where the details fall on this. But it is by no means clear cut that this is not a a problem, shall we say. So I think it&#39;s fine.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you know, I&#39;ll follow up with you very quickly before going to Carter. We talked previously about some of the items against the liberals that the conservatives were waging as diluting the story on we. Is this fundamentally different? Is we still the focal point this much time elapsing? Or are you okay now focusing on different issues to try to generate a pattern? I wanted to kind of try to see if we could square those two thoughts that we&#39;ve had in previous episodes well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well let&#39;s be really clear here that that still is good advice you&#39;ve got to keep focused on the real scandal and not have fake scandals but if you have two real scandals that both fundamentally tell the same story which is the prime minister&#39;s office is going to go out of its way to help its friends then you don&#39;t actually have a distraction you have something that reinforces that story and builds a stronger narrative, to your point.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that could be quite helpful to the conservatives, because it&#39;s not just a question of we at that point, it&#39;s a question of multiple actions in a very short window of time here. And by the way, they share some commonalities, like this was just money flying out the door, COVID response, it was going to the Prime Minister&#39;s friends, the Prime Minister&#39;s friends were the first who were able to have the conversation in order to see if that money was available for them. That is fundamentally the same story. What is not the same story is when you start digging</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">digging around to anybody who has ever gone to a WE charity event, or frankly, anybody whose spouse has a different job, right? So that is the fundamental difference here. But this could be</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">be compounding. However, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it could also not be compounding when all of the facts come out, which is why I&#39;m not going to say it&#39;s fabulous.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, same question to you. Corey, you did a great job of contextualizing the story appreciate that as well fine fabulous or fuck the conservatives asking for an additional ethics probe into katie telford and the pmo well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well it&#39;s fucked i mean cory may have done a fine job contextualizing it but he&#39;s again missed the forest for the trees um the problem with this is that they&#39;re going to the ethics commissioner they&#39;ve already gone to the lobbying commissioner which is where they should go because ultimately this is a uh lobbying breach potentially by Rob Silver, not an ethics breach by Katie Telford. By jumping in and now getting a clean sheet of paper for Katie Telford, they&#39;re undermining their own story. This is essentially the conservatives being the hammer that they are, searching for a nail and running to the ethics commissioner. This is the equivalent of my youngest brother running to my mom and dad every time I got in trouble. You know, Stephen&#39;s done something wrong. Stephen&#39;s done something wrong you know sometimes they&#39;re just not going to care after it you know just shut the fuck up and that&#39;s how i&#39;m feeling right now about the conservatives in the law and the and the ethics commissioner you went to the right place you went to the to the lobbying commissioner wait for that report because that report could be significant now you&#39;ve undermined it by going to two commissioners who are going to look at the same thing from different points of view with totally different mandates and the result is going to be one of them is going to go oh i don&#39;t like this and the other The other one&#39;s going to go, my office has nothing to say. And who&#39;s the liberals going to pick up? And they&#39;re going to wave it to the Canadian public. Oh, we have nothing to say, nothing to say at all. And it&#39;s going to undermine the Conservatives&#39; own actions.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve realized, but Corey and I running around giddily and screaming, Stephen&#39;s done something wrong. It was pretty much the entire premise of this podcast. Yeah, I know. I&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">angry about it, Jane. I&#39;m angry. angry the entire</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">entire advertising strategy this podcast is based simply on that uh and i use advertising as a loose concept uh carter i&#39;m sticking with you on this one and then cory i&#39;ll go to uh for for this for this next one fine fabulous or fuck trudeau telegraphing uh to the public and to the media in these dog days of summer that he doesn&#39;t want another election what do you think of that strategy fine fabulous fucked i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think it&#39;s fine i mean i think that if he were the one who was he should be dragged to an election kicking and screaming. The idea that he&#39;s going to go</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and vote, you know, vote down or allow a confidence motion to fail or something to get to an election. He shouldn&#39;t. He&#39;s the government and he&#39;s got enough seats that he can govern as a majority. We&#39;ve talked about that incessantly. He should not be trying to get to an election. And if he does get to an election, he wants to be appearing like he&#39;s reluctant even if he&#39;s skipping all the way through the garden um because this is a uh for him this is a a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">problem um you know if he looks like he&#39;s calling the election early and he wanted the election early uh the canadian public tends to to punish us uh when we call elections outside of the normal uh the normal quad cycle so if if he does find himself in a fall or spring election election, he should be dragged there kicking and screaming.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It would be fine if those were his only comments, but they&#39;re not. He follows it up with additional comments like, hey, look, I&#39;m, you know, and we&#39;ll see. And it&#39;s a huge dramatic change. And we got to see if Parliament supports us. And if not, I guess there&#39;s, you know, and in that sense, I think it&#39;s kind of fucked. I mean, he&#39;s essentially telegraphing that he&#39;s willing to go to the polls in such a big way that I do feel that he risks a backlash. He&#39;s got to to moderate it a bit and unfortunately for him this is a box he put himself in when he prorogued it you</span>

          <div class="turn">

Now, the NDP may just capitulate and support this throne speech and then no problem. But if there is a reason to go to the polls as a result of this throne speech, I don&#39;t think the liberals come out of this clean.

So we&#39;ll keep that thought in mind. Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you for our third one. And we&#39;re moving to the United States. So on the heels of the article by The Atlantic where Donald Trump was quoted saying that anyone who&#39;s served with the U.S. military were suckers and losers and a very extensively detailed article damning the president and his views on military personnel and those who&#39;ve served the United States, now Trump&#39;s surrogates are coming out and saying that the only thing we need is we need to ensure that the sources are named. We can&#39;t have a story so big being a Comey-like thing that distracts from the election. We now need to compel the sources to be named. What do you think of that political strategy? Fine? Fabulous? Fucked? It&#39;s fucked.</span>

And that&#39;s not good for Donald Trump. I understand what he&#39;s trying to do, which is sort of so this idea that maybe it&#39;s bullshit. But there&#39;s just there&#39;s too much smoke for there not to be fire. And he&#39;s just drawing attention to these comments. It&#39;s a crazy idea.

This is Donald Trump, you know, trying to push back on every accusation that&#39;s made about him in the exact same fashion that Hillary Clinton tried to do the same, you know, four years ago. And it failed four years ago. It&#39;s going to fail now because we&#39;re on to the next cycle. He&#39;s kept the cycle going. Is this believable? Yes. How do I know? I&#39;ve read his tweets. I&#39;ve listened to him. I&#39;ve watched his videos. I mean, this is not exactly outside of the scope of his language. This feels exactly true. And therefore, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s true. If it feels true, then the population just runs with it. You know, for example, a pizzeria with child sex slaves, you</span>

That the the same political strategy that Trump has employed to get into office, where if it feels close to the truth, right, if it feels like it could be true, then it probably is. And it&#39;s been what his supporters have accepted. It&#39;s now I&#39;m not saying that his supporters are turning against it, but it&#39;s the same notion that the believability factor doesn&#39;t need to be at 100 percent. It&#39;s as long as it&#39;s in the range. People like, yeah, that sounds about right. That&#39;s that that that reconciles with the man that we know or the man that he projects himself to be. Carter, I&#39;m going to actually stick with you on this one for our next one, which is about the conservatives. Our federal conservatives here under the new leadership of Aaron O&#39;Toole have said, just like the liberals, that they&#39;re going to stop taking the wage subsidy going forward. But unlike the liberals have said, they&#39;re going to pay it back. So I&#39;m curious to hear what you think of that strategy. Fine. Fabulous. Fucked.</span>

I think that just signals that Aaron O&#39;Toole is going to be able to turn the fundraising machine on. The fundraising machine for the conservatives has been turned off.</span>

So I certainly wouldn&#39;t sleep a lot better as the GG being like, oh, the prime minister&#39;s got my back. This is great because that&#39;s not the way these things work. Usually, when the prime minister has to actually say that they support you, that means that your support is pretty tenuous, because people are asking questions about it. So, you know, he didn&#39;t, there&#39;s nothing else he could say until the decision is made one way or the other. But it doesn&#39;t mean anything. anything</span>

Last one on Donald Trump. A political article today coming out saying that his focus is now shifting from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris and starting to brand her as the individual who is going to drag Joe Biden to the left. So as you know, he&#39;s been trying to paint Joe Biden as the mayor of the civil unrest that we&#39;re seeing in our urban centers. But I think the focus of the campaign, according to this article, is now going to be on Kamala Harris as the reason he&#39;s starting to make that radical leftist shift.

It&#39;s fine, because I&#39;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they&#39;ve probably done some polling and seen that that will have some sort of resonance with their audience.

Guys, I want to talk about, I want to talk about trial balloons and I want to take a little bit of a step back because I think we&#39;re seeing something interesting happening in the dog days of summer, both in our home province here in Alberta, where this term trial balloon is being floated recently. And on the heels of prorogation, this concept of a trial balloon by the Trudeau government is being floated. So before we get into these trial balloons and assessing whether they are what they are, let&#39;s talk about what a trial balloon is, because I don&#39;t think we necessarily have a crystal clear definition, how to define whether one is or not, what some of the rules are, what it actually defines. So maybe Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. And I think this is where I can heed your guys&#39; expertise in governments, running offices, running comms for a province. What is a trial balloon, Stephen? And what constitutes it? And what are some of the kind of the scaffolding or the rules that define what a trial balloon in public looks like?</span>

            <span class="text">A trial balloon in public is simply testing the waters and testing out whether or not an idea is going to be palatable to the general population. So one of the things we try to do is poll on something. So we poll on something and we determine whether or not an idea is successful or not. But the problem with that is that a lot of ideas don&#39;t mature until they&#39;re out into the public and the public is talking about them. So that maturation is what we&#39;re looking for in a trial balloon, because something may be completely unpalatable</span>

So the opinion leader would put out the literal opinion, and then people would evaluate that against that. The important thing about a trial balloon is it has to be big enough that people know it, and it has an impact within the general population, but not so big that it, you know, kind of forces the government&#39;s hand. You&#39;re not trying to put yourself into a corner. You&#39;re You&#39;re trying to figure out whether or not doing something is right or wrong. You want to have both options available to you.

And it says, how have you tried to actually put this thing out to see how people will react to this? Like where, if at all, right? Has this gone out? Have people talked about this? And generally speaking, it will be about, is this an issue at all? Has the government talked about this needing to be addressed? So both the issue and then the solution. Has the solution been discussed at all? Has the solution been addressed at all? And</span>

            <span class="text">And what has been the reaction to that? And so when you&#39;re building a comms plan, part of what you&#39;re trying to do is saying, do we need to understand that before we move any further? Is there any gating that occurs where we essentially need the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the minister to drop it in a speech and see how they react at the chamber? Or to have an op-ed go out by a friendly party that says – and you&#39;ve got to keep in mind when you&#39;re the government, you&#39;re not necessarily going around to a million different people. You play it a little bit straighter, right? It&#39;s more, have we dropped it into a speech? Have we talked to the media about it in this context?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But that is something that public service communicators are considering in communications plans. The trial balloon that people are more familiar with, like the big policy shift, or let&#39;s put out the idea of getting rid of the GG, or something like that, that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that tends to happen at the political side. The chief of staff, the principal secretary, the comms director calls a minister or calls the media and plants this thing, puts it out there. and uh and then the rest of us in the public service just react to it so probably a good place where i can hand it over to political staff uh</span>

            <span class="text">oh you there it&#39;s absolutely formalized you cannot solve a problem that people don&#39;t know that there is right so you have to explain the problem and preset the problem. And oftentimes government doesn&#39;t want to be leading the charge to the solution. We want to be dragged to the solution, right? We want people to be out front of us and saying, this is where the solution needs to go. And then we just miraculously arrive to the same place. Because whenever we&#39;re being, you know, Ed Stelmack&#39;s government used to be like this. They would often solve a problem that no one knew that we had. And so you&#39;d be like, what the hell was that why were we solving this problem what is it um and and people would be trying to catch up and at the risk of sounding modestly repetitive our 0.05 legislation was exactly that we did not what mad think</span>

We are really bad at this and we need to solve it. But because we hadn&#39;t gotten out front, we hadn&#39;t put out the trial balloon, when we did propose the solution, we were immediately behind the eight ball. We were no longer able to explain why we were doing it because we were just trying to push back</span>

So we can have a residence if we tell the population why we need a residence and we tell them what other provinces have a residence. If you do all of that work in advance and get the population on your side, then maybe you can have a residence. If you trial balloon it and it performs horribly, then you can walk away from the residence and you don&#39;t wind up with your Sky Palace plans being leaked to the media.

            <span class="text">Yeah, Stephen talked about validators, and I think that&#39;s a really important thing to talk about when we talk about foreshadowing an issue. So we talk about trial balloons. The other thing you&#39;ll sometimes hear it referred to as running up the flagpole, right? And the full sentence is run up the flagpole to see who salutes. And the idea of putting something up, the flagpole and trial ballooning this issue, whatever, just to mix my metaphors here is you</span>

            <span class="text">And if you get that understanding, that allows you to inform your communications going forward, allows you to build those validator lists, and allows you to have a more robust rollout when these things happen. Because then the government can come and make the announcement and point the media to the 14 people they already know are going to say nice things because they&#39;ve made comments about it because it&#39;s already been out there in public discourse. course.

            <span class="text">I want to talk about the two live wires that we have in Alberta and then across the country with with the Trudeau government, with prorogation of the upcoming throne speech, which have been classified, at least in our political chatter as trial balloons. But before getting to that, there&#39;s one final thing, Carter, you tweaked on, which I want to talk about, which is voices. Who do you get to put this out there? And I&#39;d love to kind of hear some of the consideration from you, Stephen, as to, you know, you were in government at that moment in time, But you also have experience with this, with how oppositions work. How do you kind of strategize which which voices put this out there, whether it&#39;s a minister, whether it&#39;s a friendly op ed? What are some of the calculus that goes behind who puts it out there and who puts out trial balloons? I&#39;d love to kind of hear some of your thoughts on that. Well,</span>

You don&#39;t want to put up a trial balloon by someone who looks like they&#39;ve been dragged to a hanging. You need to put that person out there who actually looks like they&#39;d be legitimate.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. And every government has a multitude of ministers. Now, the problem is, if you use a minister, you&#39;re using political capital from your own bank account. So sometimes that&#39;s really well, that&#39;s really worth it. Like if we&#39;d done the .05 legislation properly, we would have done that from our own bank account. We knew we were going to follow through on it. We would have been trial ballooning it, you know, expecting</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">Outside of that, you might want to go to a chamber of commerce. So the chambers of commerce were very, very useful. Alberta has a chamber of commerce. Every city has a chamber of commerce. They all have policy wings. Who&#39;s been talking about it in the past? Who&#39;s going to be talking about it in the future? And would it help, for example, if a minister showed up for a lunch that day? and at that event when we&#39;ve dragged all the media there all of a sudden the head of the chamber of commerce throws out a trial balloon uh that gets a ton of coverage um and</span>

The reason people are calling it a trial balloon, well, at least why us internally feel like it&#39;s a trial balloon, is because it&#39;s got a lot of the number five in it, which is, if you go back to our special episode in the poll that Corey got, also had a lot of number fives in it. This is a little bit different, but Corey, maybe let&#39;s get your general thoughts on voices and then let&#39;s get into the Alberta-specific conversation. I can contextualize that a bit more at that point.</span>

It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s Doug being told by the premier&#39;s office to go float something. Because that&#39;s the other thing about a trial balloon we haven&#39;t really talked about.

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s happening here in Alberta then. And Carter, I&#39;ll go to you because we have Daniel Smith putting out a op-ed, which has three steps to it. Number one, to liquidate the Heritage Fund here in Alberta to pay off our COVID deficit. Number two, to establish a sovereign wealth fund where every dollar of resource revenue goes into that until we can reach $100 billion and then comfortably generate $5 billion in interest-based income from it. And then finally, balance the budget by increasing taxes, which is almost a political no-go for someone like Danielle Smith until now, and reducing spending in equal measure. $5 billion a pop. So yes, a provincial sales tax, and yes, reductions in health and education. So using some of the assessments and the rules that we&#39;ve just laid out, A, do you think this is a trial balloon? And B, do you think they used the right voice if it was?</span>

And yes, I think they used the right voice because they&#39;ve taken somebody who has been seen as a right winger, who currently hosts a, you know a radio show that is is possibly the the most right wing in in alberta which is saying something well you know that is a a fairly significant uh hurdle</span>

So I, you know, I&#39;m just adding that as additional context. But same question to you. Is this a trial balloon in your mind from the government? through Danielle Smith?

We start talking 5-5-5 and then, you know, then people are talking about it. And I&#39;m not going to say we take credit for that in the zeitgeist, but you know, a lot of conversation in Twitter spurred as a result of all of this. The other thing is there&#39;s components of her plan that I just can&#39;t imagine the government being remotely interested in first and foremost is the liquidation of the heritage fund that&#39;s not easy you know investments of that size and scale you don&#39;t just say to your banker like hey okay i just want that all in cash like just make the check out to cash for that 20 billion dollar you know sovereign wealth fund that that doesn&#39;t make an awful lot of sense to me as well what is the point of taking all of that money out just to start putting all of that money back in because Because you are then talking about building up essentially the Heritage Fund again to $100 billion. Why not start one-fifth of the way there? Especially where interest rates are on borrowing versus what we&#39;re getting from the stock market, which is phenomenal returns still. There&#39;s probably a stronger argument to be made to borrow as much as possible and invest it in the stock market, frankly. Not suggesting that. That would expose the government to a lot of risk.

But let&#39;s leave this bracket open for a second and open up the federal bracket, because I want to close both of them at the same time. On the federal side, we are now seeing the prime minister, his ministers out there telegraphing greening of jobs, child care, basic income, guaranteed federal income, housing. These big social programs have been touted and telegraphed in multiple publications. And we&#39;re now starting to see what I guess is a political class responding, right? A couple of op-eds today in the last couple of days saying, well, Trudeau needs to be careful about his activist agenda. Here&#39;s the opportunity for the conservatives. So we&#39;re starting to see some response on this. So same question. With the rules that we just talked about, do you feel like what&#39;s happening on the federal side is the government testing their appetite or their ability to actually go big with an activist agenda?

So what are some of the general rules you have as to responding to trial balloons? Or do you just wait until this is in the public? How are you kind of navigating that if you&#39;re sitting either in Alberta here as the provincial NDP, or if you&#39;re the federal conservatives, to your guys&#39;s point, hearing some of this ground softening happening by the liberals?

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to you first, because I know you&#39;re going to have the most vibrant answer on this, or at least I suspect. On a scale of 1 to 10, what did you make of Jason Kenney? What I&#39;m assuming was a forced retirement for his friend Paul Bunner, his speechwriter who got into a lot of hot water earlier this summer for his past comments. Retirement was the exit ramp that they decided to take, as you say, as a party. 1 to 10, what do you think of that political strategy? I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I was fascinated by it. I think that Mr. Bunner is probably looking for a severance package somewhere along the way. I&#39;m not sure you get the same package when you retire. And I&#39;m not sure that he would have been fully vested into a pension. So this would be a fairly significant financial step for him. But it was a way that Jason Kenney got to ease out a staff member that was causing him nothing but pain. You know, unfortunately, they just slide another one right in. So, you know, the problem is that they just keep putting people like this into positions of power. So one moves out, another one&#39;s moved in. And the NDP and the opposition will find another whipping boy here pretty soon.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s two ways to look at the issue. One of them is from the public point of view. And on that, it&#39;s a bit of a fail, right? Because you got the abuse and you&#39;ve still lost the staff person. You know, you took for multiple months kind of the attacks that you have a racist speechwriter, quote unquote racist speechwriter there, right? And, you know, that hurts. But there is also the staff management and the team element of this, which I think are very easy to discount from the outside. And I didn&#39;t know he was almost 65, and that might have changed even my thinking about it when we talked about it a couple of months ago. But you can easily see either him or his chief of staff or somebody saying like, we can&#39;t fire Paul. He&#39;s three months to retirement age. That would just be so brutal. Can&#39;t we let him leave with a little bit of dignity? Doesn&#39;t he deserve – I mean, he&#39;s been here. He&#39;s been a trooper, whatever it is. Like, these are people you work with every day.

It&#39;s, it&#39;s, oh, my God, that was, that was cold. You know, he let him go for a bunch of things he knew about. And he was only three months to retirement, right?

But when she&#39;s figured out how to skip over the commercials, then everybody&#39;s figured out how to skip over commercials. That&#39;s just where we are in today&#39;s broadcast world.

Because the minute it&#39;s late, the expectations get higher, right? It&#39;s no longer, hey, here&#39;s the comms plan. It&#39;s here&#39;s the world&#39;s greatest comms plan is the expectation there. And so I just – that&#39;s just sort of human nature. If you ask for an extension, it better be pretty good when you get it because then the understanding is you&#39;ve had the time to do it right. There is no indication that this is either going to be timely or competently done at this point because they haven&#39;t even started is what we&#39;ve learned here. And this is just a dumpster fire. And every time they extend it, it becomes more of one. Now, so much of this was actually – like the actual inquiry was based on the work of somebody in BC who I will not call a journalist named Vivian Krauss who came up with all of these connections between these large US foundations and environmental activity in Canada. Well, fucking newsflash. Environmentalists spend money on protecting the environment worldwide, right? Right. But, you know, Vivian Krause&#39;s theory is that this is a concerted effort by the like the Hewlett&#39;s and the Packard&#39;s because they&#39;ve got oil in California still and they&#39;re trying to shut down Canadian oil for the benefit of American oil.</span>

            <span class="text">It&#39;s nonsense. It&#39;s total nonsense. But this inquiry was in no small part based on this. The other thing that happened today that I feel is somewhat related to this is the Minister of Energy in Alberta actually had to go on Twitter and say this rumor that Vivian Krause just put out about who was doing well cleanup in Alberta because there was a suggestion it was SNC-Lavalin is false. So, like, there&#39;s just so much drama and poetry in all of this. I&#39;m going to let Stephen take it from there because he&#39;s going to do a better job. I</span>

Environmentalists spend money on the environment. The United States has some of the most charitable giving in the world. Therefore, they spend much of their money around the world. They have tremendous influence worldwide with their charities. It is not unexpected that you would see money from the United States in Canada for</span>

            <span class="text">So this is an inquiry that was started badly because the premise of the inquiry was wrong. It needed an extension in the middle, plus an extra million bucks. I mean, Vivian Krause, as I believe I said on this podcast once before, did all of this work from her dining room table. able uh what is taking steve allen so long why is he unable to put forward a decent report and why is he not able to give in a court document this isn&#39;t just him saying on twitter well i&#39;m not going to answer the question right now this is a court document being unable to answer the question of how we&#39;re going to let people that are like the organizations named in the report</span>

            <span class="text">Nicely done, Corey. Let&#39;s end it with our listener question for the week. Our listener question coming to us from PB&amp;J1983. Thank you for your five-star review and your question. The question is, as such, do you feel the conservatives, federal conservatives, that is, are missing either willfully or otherwise important context when they referred to the last federal election as missing an empty net? And what implications or impacts do you think that mindset might have going forward? So we now have a new leader. You recall that comment, missing an empty net was a Peter McKay line when he criticized Andrew Scheer, saying all he had to do was just score. Of course, irony is that Peter McKay had an empty net in his leadership race and loses that. But the question is really about what mindset do you think that that could have or what impact that could have if that&#39;s the current conservative mindset heading into the next federal election, whenever that may be. Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that, first of all, elections aren&#39;t empty nets. No one ever pulls the goalie. You know, there are two sides and they are going to, well, there are more than two sides. There&#39;s, you know, multiple parties. Each one&#39;s fighting for every inch of opportunity, every seat. There&#39;s 338 different ridings where you&#39;ve got a different campaign being undertaken with all kinds of different pressures. It looked like an empty net if you&#39;re in Alberta. But, you know, you&#39;re running a, we&#39;re running campaigns from across the country. This was not an empty net for the Conservatives by any stretch of the imagination. And by putting that kind of pressure on it, I mean, is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is the next election going to be an empty net? Like, do you have to win</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">win elections in order to be successful? There is no question. But how you lose also should say a lot about the party. And this particular party in that election, was the failure entirely the Conservatives Or was there some opportunism from the Liberals? And I think that for the most part, it was just another Canadian election. And to put this empty net modifier on it is just – it&#39;s missing the entire context of the election.</span>

            <span class="text">Parties can&#39;t buy their own press. They can&#39;t start believing the caricatures they peddle. This notion that Trudeau is an empty suit, utterly incapable, and should have lost that election 10 days out of 10 is not real, right? He is a talented politician. He has a significant amount of charisma, certainly compared to Andrew Scheer. I mean, it wasn&#39;t an empty net. There were certainly a number of problems that the liberals had that were unique to that particular moment that made it seem like how in the world does</span>

            <span class="text">And so I can understand how people say, like, what, how, what the hell happened there? But I don&#39;t actually believe the conservatives have fallen into this notion that this is just a gimme. I don&#39;t think they think that. Certainly the polls right now don&#39;t imply that. If anything, they imply it the other way, that Trudeau is going to coast to a re-election here. And as</span>
