We&#39;ve got the war room pushing it. And then we&#39;ve got the future aspect of Carney having to burn a day. And then we&#39;ve got the broader strategy question, which is how do you clean up a mess like this? How would Stephen Carter clean up a mess if this article came out on a Sunday morning for you? So where do you want to tackle it? And then I&#39;ll kind of process the other elements of it thereafter.</span>

Or Andrew Scheer does, in my opinion, a cringeworthy ad about getting back with your ex at a bar having a beer, and you do your clapback version. Funny, cheeky, and maybe that&#39;s not a great example of the point I&#39;m trying to make, but they&#39;re responding to everything. These accounts are so good. These people are so nimble. They&#39;re so online. line they&#39;re so so gen z they&#39;re so with it that at some point that upside of being like everything the other side puts out we squash back may have a cost to it and i and i&#39;m not saying the button idea is a direct linkage to this but i think it comes from that culture of like oh yeah like they&#39;re actually like the people have shirt sweatshirts that are doing this and then this is going on and yes that&#39;s a media story but it&#39;s not something that people have already heard There&#39;s not enough soak time. There&#39;s still more runway available for people to see the conservatives torturing themselves. There&#39;s days left on that story because it hasn&#39;t gotten to the normal person.

Do you feel like we&#39;re in a campaign world, Carter, that that matters anymore, how the story comes out? Because there could also be a case around how modern day campaign media relations has done, especially from the oppo side, which is, do you feel like we&#39;re in a new reality where I could just put this story out myself with my partisan tinge, and it might have just as much mileage as a long, lengthy investigative piece put out by the CBC or Global News, for example?</span>

I&#39;m going to throw out a statement to you. Monday, Tuesday, if the trend that Ipsos and, I believe, Abacus, don&#39;t quote me on this, are reporting that the polls are tightening a bit, that that eight-point lead is turning into five, four, three, right? Let&#39;s say that replicates a few other polls that come onto our desks in the next 48 hours. Here&#39;s my strategic statement for you to agree or disagree with.</span>
