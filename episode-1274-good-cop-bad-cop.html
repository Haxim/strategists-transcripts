Why are you bringing this shit? Why are you bringing this filler to the show? Stephen Carter, I&#39;ve got one for you today. Start us off with. Bonnie Crombie, the liberal leader. She&#39;s written written a piece in the Toronto Star, an op-ed. She gets to write whatever she wants about Peel Region, in this case, not talking about the province really at all. She&#39;s talking about municipal leaders know their residents best and should make decisions about taxes, roads, etc. It&#39;s a two-minute long read from her, Bonnie Crombie, comma, contributor in the Toronto Star. Stephen Carter, the question here is very simple. Politicians sending in op-eds, getting covered directly by newspapers occasionally behind paywalls like this one is um or i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i guess is for some people to be to be charitable uh it is for me at the moment carter is this a practice that should die is this a practice that&#39;s normal and we should keep does this require examining am i barking up a tree that doesn&#39;t require examining carter the question is simple why the fuck do we still do this allow politicians to have however many inches they want to write their message and this is not just a bonnie crombie practice this is a Bernie Sanders writing in The Guardian, John McCain writing in The Washington Post, Barack Obama writing in The New York Times. I wanted to talk about this for a few minutes. Give me your thoughts first, and then I&#39;ll go to Corey.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m advising someone right now that I&#39;m advising to put together an op-ed and try and get it published in a local paper. That&#39;s a standard operating procedure because both parties want it to happen. Both parties, you know, the newspaper wants to have the readership. the readership. They want to be seen to be able to, to, to provide some sort of readership and the politician wants, um, more eyeballs. So they&#39;re going to say something modestly interesting. Uh, it has to be good. I mean, you know, the newspapers aren&#39;t just publishing, uh, opinions that, that don&#39;t have some sort of consequence, although one could seriously argue whether or not this Bonnie Crombie, uh, column reaches the level, but nonetheless, um, it&#39;s a symbiotic relationship. And as part of that relationship, both parties get something. So why wouldn&#39;t you continue to do it? I think that it&#39;s a great way of getting some free exposure and not having the media put their spin on to what you say, right? It is literally all your own words and no one else is competing with you. So as a politician, it&#39;s a great practice. I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s great for the publication. But for the politician, I think it&#39;s absolutely perfect. And that&#39;s why we keep doing it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But you may want to actually talk about that. The main sort of area I want to drive to eventually is the strategic value from the media side, and why do they end up allowing this practice? But Corey, your thoughts on why the fuck do we still do op-eds published by politicians?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">have been wondering this myself a lot lately obviously an op-ed is a pretty traditional tactic you often have people whether you are working on kind of consulting side or client side say oh we got to get an op-ed we got to get an op-ed out there and you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know a lot of work goes into them people really define what an opinion is it&#39;s it&#39;s a piece of tentpole communication i&#39;ve often talked about that having a value in its own right just because it it forces you to get things together but i&#39;ve really been wondering this myself a lot lately especially when you own so many channels as a politician um you yeah as a politician you can go out and you can put something on social and you can share it and it can go further and you might have a website and if you get them on your website not only do you get the eyeballs but you potentially get them down the funnel i think what i&#39;ve ultimately come to the conclusion of is um you it is not like reflexively a useful thing it does need to be thought of in the context of what you&#39;re trying to get out of it and you know carter&#39;s not wrong that you can get more eyeballs but i would expand on it and say you can get eyeballs you wouldn&#39;t normally get right because i suspect that the average barack obama actually gets more people reading a tweet than gets reading the new york Times but the benefit is you get both the aura of the outlet right and kind of this mark that oh look it&#39;s a prestigious like placement and this is a tentpole piece of communication that is you know the New York Times itself is running but you also it people who would never be on Twitter will see it and so I think when you&#39;re building an op-ed if it&#39;s part of a communication strategy you should really be thinking about the nature of the audience of that channel and just not reflexively thinking oh great i&#39;ve got an op-ed and if you&#39;re thinking about that audience and you&#39;re not just reflexively saying it&#39;s a great time for me to get my thing out there through somebody else&#39;s channel where i won&#39;t get the benefit of taking it down the funnel you&#39;ve got to use the strengths of that channel so it&#39;s not actually i generally think op-eds are best when they&#39;re almost like against type like it&#39;s in an outlet where you&#39;re not always going to be kind of carried or have a natural audience so people are forced to see your view the communication is the first step on that funnel, getting people to say like, oh, Bonnie Crombie, she&#39;s an interesting person. She&#39;s not quite what I expected. And avoid kind of the later in the funnel stuff where the next steps would be actions because then really, why didn&#39;t you just drive them to your own website, right? Like if this is to try to whip people up into donations, memberships, activity, post your own content on your own channels, whether it be social or otherwise. So just be strategic about it. I I think that it&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s unfortunate how many people think an op-ed is just good because it&#39;s an op-ed and don&#39;t really think of it enough in terms of what it offers versus other channels and what it doesn&#39;t versus other channels. Because again, you don&#39;t own it, which means you don&#39;t get to push them further down the funnel. Carter, are</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">are you a fan of cross-posting in this case? Before I ask you about what strategic value and why the fuck does the media still allow this practice or go along with it, and you&#39;ve given me a bit of an answer, are you a fan of cross-posting? Like to Corey&#39;s point, cover all bases, make this a news story within the bonniecrombie.ca or bonnie.ca, make it a news story around the Ontario Liberals sort of thing so you have a conversion ability, put it in the Toronto Star, put it in multiple places. Are you a fan of that or not so much in our modern sort of communications world?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i&#39;m a fan of of using the multiple mediums but i&#39;m not necessarily like i think that each one could be used in in sequence um like there is something to be said for using the uh the op-ed is as a beginning of a conversation and then moving to um you know moving to your website moving to a landing page doing something different as you move along through the communication structure but you know you don&#39;t necessarily want to launch your website with your the exact same op-ed right you it has to fit the medium if you will so when it&#39;s your own website you&#39;re going to post it differently you&#39;re going to engage with the audience differently if you&#39;re doing it on the socials the socials you know some of the socials might just be like a twitter might be linking to to your op-ed. Um, whereas an Instagram might be several slides, a key of key quotes from the op-ed, you know, each one is going to be a little bit different depending on what you&#39;re actually trying to communicate. So I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a case of, uh, cross posting where everything just kind of universally winds up in the same, you know, in different spots at the same time, but it&#39;s more a, um, you know, this</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is what we&#39;re posting here. This is what we&#39;re posting over And it all kind of builds together to create a comprehensive understanding of the issue.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, this opinion piece that&#39;s in the Toronto Star is referencing, the headline is not just let&#39;s get distracted and continue with the disillusion of Peel region. It&#39;s actually Bonnie Crombie going, let&#39;s not get distracted and has that title. It has her name three or four times within like the first couple of sentences, so to speak. speak. So that name recognition is certainly there. This is, you know, or her</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">name recognition, so to speak. When I look at this, and if I were on the other side of this, sitting on the Doug Ford team or even assessing this, being like, wow, that&#39;s a lot of, to Corey&#39;s point, halo effect that Tourstar gives her, and a lot of like Bonnie Crombie, someone who&#39;s, you know, some people know, but not everybody knows, that&#39;s getting a lot of splash for free.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="text">So the question really comes to you. I know you&#39;ve been thinking about this for a while. I assume you&#39;ve been thinking about it from the politician side and their strategic value. Talk to me about the strategic value and the practice and whether it should continue for media outlets.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that if you&#39;re a media outlet, there&#39;s a lot of reasons to really like the op-ed. Previously, it was a great way to sort of round out and defend yourself against opinions of your paper that it was too one-sided, right? So you would have other opinions opposite the editorial page that could carry other points of view, and that was great for you. It is also free</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">free content. It is content that you pay nothing for a lot of the time. And so, especially in this modern era where space costs nothing, you are trading space, which costs you nothing, in exchange for content, which would normally cost you something. And it&#39;s this aggregating effect, this network effect that allows both parties to benefit and neither really to be worse off because of this exchange. So yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah, I think it makes sense. Actually, I think it makes more sense for the media outlet than the politician. because what the politician is giving up is kind of control over everything around the piece of content and people want the content yeah</span>

Give us a bit of the background here, and then let&#39;s get into to what exactly happened and what we actually may speculate happened within the confines of this joint statement by Danielle Smith and the Minister of Environment, Rebecca Schultz, here in Alberta.</span>

And that&#39;s actually not what happened. While there wasn&#39;t the strongest statement possible, there were some ideas floated along the way about the phasing out of fossil fuels with stronger language. A day before the end of COP28, it looked like no statement. And then in the last day, they pulled together a consensus that effectively said the world is going to try to get off fossil fuels. now there were some provisos about you know various transition fuels and things of that nature but for the first time ever for the first time ever the</span>

This is a conversation that keeps going, hosted by different countries. You know, 28 years of these climate negotiations. At the end of the day, Carter, this is a negotiation forum. As much as it is a trade show and innovation and future progress and lobbying on the floor, this is a international negotiation. And at that international negotiation, Carter, Canada had some news. I suppose, Stephen Gilboa, our environment minister, said that he presented</span>

But my question to the two of you, which is why I wanted to bring this up, it&#39;s, you know, in some ways, this was expected, maybe not the fiery language against Stephen Gilboa, written in a statement under the headline government news, and as a release that hits 1000s of inboxes. Sure, maybe not that. But Carter, does it matter? Like, even if this was written on the day before, does it matter? And is it good strategy to say, who gives a shit? Let&#39;s just stick with this particular narrative? Or is this going to cost the Alberta government here in a way beyond like the political craft that we&#39;re talking about here of ignoring the reality of what happened on the ground at COP, knowing that most people have no idea what COP is, and have no idea what Canada committed to with the rest of the world.</span>

Not to say that&#39;s conventional wisdom, Carter, but we&#39;ve heard that as like table stakes on this conversation. Corey, you know, I think we were on a podcast, whether it was this one or somewhere else. And I said, at one point, you know, Alberta has got to be careful, because if they keep going so hard at the feds, there is an expiry date on that. And I think one of you cringed at me being like, what the fuck is this guy talking about? I want to reintroduce that notion again, Corey. Corey. Tell me about the conditions now, rather than when, but tell me about the conditions on when beating up on the feds starts having either negative or diminishing returns for the government of Alberta. Because it seems right now from a pure political basis, it&#39;s their only strategy across the board. And they&#39;ve got some wind behind their back with some Supreme Court decision, so to speak. But Corey, give me the conditions where it starts firing back. Because right now, we&#39;ve seen another escalation, if you want to add it to the pile of language against a minister in a government release, which we may have not, and we may have seen it before. But let&#39;s just say we haven&#39;t seen it before. I think that&#39;s a market escalation. We&#39;ve seen them now, you know, adopt this strategy across the board for everything. Give me the conditions when this is diminishing returns or negative impact. I want to ultimately give the UCP a pathway for them to understand where it starts maybe not making as much sense as it maybe does today on the politics, Corey.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, look, it&#39;ll take a while to get there because one of two things can happen in the next bit. Either the provincial government will be successful in the courts and warding off federal action, in which case uh you know they get to declare victory or they&#39;ll be unsuccessful in which case they get to declare an enemy and so in the short term it&#39;s hard to imagine that this is going to change fundamentally but over years i think we have to appreciate that especially if the government is successful and it doesn&#39;t have the federal government to blame and can&#39;t say like oh these policies have shackled us because either pierre poliev becomes prime minister and those policies don&#39;t exist or because um it just becomes so evident that the alberta way is just driving us into the ground in some way shape or form you know it&#39;s it&#39;s going to take time a lot of time and it&#39;s going to have to take a pretty fundamental rethinking of where we are and it&#39;s probably going to take some relative fall in standing but understand that even that doesn&#39;t guarantee we all of a sudden realize collectively that there was a problem here because there will likely be enough things out there that the government can point to to say this only happened because of the the treachery of the federal government i&#39;m using the word of continued treachery against our province is how they described us</span>

Yes, you could argue that that Danielle Smith presented a historical opportunity. But let&#39;s just say Economy and Smith cancel each other out.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Like, it&#39;s how do you, if anything, from a political strategy perspective, preserve Justin Trudeau? And right now, Carter, the question for you, Livewire, is, you know, an election is any time in a minority. Yes, we&#39;ve got this supply and confidence agreement. So we&#39;re probably looking at 2025. 25. When do you start planning for a post-Trudeau environment? Do you need to start fanning out and creating additional enemies right now so that you can hedge your bets a bit? Because their political strategy seems largely singular. So, Corey, I&#39;m going to throw a few of those things out there, get you to react to them, and let me take it to Carter after that.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No. I mean, so I actually do want to do the thought exercise of where would you point to to next if you didn&#39;t have these people to point to, but let&#39;s be really crystal clear here. It&#39;s 2023, and the UCP is still blaming Rachel Notley for what&#39;s happening in the province of Alberta because of the decisions that they attribute to the NDP, including, by the way, decisions the NDP were actively against, such as eliminating the capacity market plans, which the UCP have now decided to take up again here. You&#39;re assuming there&#39;s a consistency and a logic to politics that that bluntly is not required four years after pierre hey zane four years of pierre poliev they&#39;ll still be blaming justin trudeau we&#39;re still fucking blaming pierre in this province and</span>

            <span class="text">and that was 40 years ago like they&#39;re you know they&#39;re going to continue to have the same specters they&#39;ve always had because we&#39;re trained to fear those specters and they will always be there that is that is the tragic reality of our existence</span>

And you can recall it, National Energy Program, anyone, right? So I get that point, Corey. But Carter, like, isn&#39;t it more effective? Doesn&#39;t it have, doesn&#39;t to actually have the real person giving you new shit every single day that you can jump on, like an emissions cap for your oil and gas sector, or, you know, fucking you with their pension plan or whatever is going to be next that the federal government screws you over with like in some way as as a as a competent political office are you planning for your next enemy or are you planning for life after justin trudeau right now like in this moment in time is that is it would a competent political office be trying to figure out optionality against enemy right now carter that&#39;s the heart of my question as someone who&#39;s worked in that job</span>

Corey, Ontario consumers, they&#39;ll soon be able to buy beer, wine, and coolers at convenience and big box stores in addition to grocery stores. This was an announcement that Doug Ford made today. I don&#39;t really care about this policy because Doug Ford is obsessed with all things alcohol policy. It seems like it&#39;s his populist, his liquid populism that he goes to, so to speak. What I am interested in, Corey, is that this promise that allows 8,500 new stores across the province to sell alcohol doesn&#39;t take effect until 2026, but he announces it today, more than two years away from it. From a pure politics perspective, I&#39;m kind of curious to get both of your takes on this. Are you in or are you out announcing something that&#39;s got such a long runway in order to happen? And the reason, to be clear, is that he&#39;d have to break some contracts if he were to do it any sooner, and then that would cost him millions of dollars. They&#39;re not going to do that. But Corey, are you in or out on the strategy of announcing a promise so far in advance to its execution date?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for the type of change they&#39;re talking about for the for you know the consequences for the fact that all of these businesses they&#39;re going to need to retool coolers they&#39;re going to need to think about how they&#39;re going to manage all of these things. They&#39;re going to need to understand what the regulations are. Those regulations will take time to create and to refine. There&#39;ll have to be consultations with all of the potential convenience stores, big box stores, all of those. I can&#39;t underline enough how much time that takes. It takes literal years to figure that kind of stuff out because you want to do it right. The consequences of doing it wrong are high. And logistics. Logistics rule everything at the end of the day, and this is a great example of it. But there was no opportunity to say, I&#39;m going to hold this until 2025 and announce it then, because you wouldn&#39;t be able to figure out the things you need to figure out in that time. Sometimes you just need this kind of runway if this is what your ambition is, especially if you are essentially deconstructing a big government monopoly. And yeah, I mean, it&#39;s not quite the same with the beer store and all of that, but the consequences, the ramifications, they&#39;re big. Big things take big time. Government needs runway. way.

Doug Ford announced Thursday that 8,500 new stores will be allowed to sell alcohol by 2026, fulfilling a longtime campaign promise first made by the PCs in 2018.

This isn&#39;t something that they haven&#39;t seen coming since 2018 when the promise was first made. If the bureaucracy hasn&#39;t made steps towards actually achieving it, get yourself a new bureaucracy. There&#39;s probably some DMs you can grab out of Alberta that are looking to escape while the escaping is good. um so you know like i appreciate that it will take time but if i was running you know the new liberal leader bonnie crombie&#39;s world i&#39;d have her say you know uh this is ridiculous if i was you know this the ford government talks about moving at the speed of business or moving you know helping ontarians get their uh work</span>

            <span class="text">to achieve the best possible outcome for Canadians. And we forget that at our peril. And Andrew Scheer having to pay a fine, I mean, he&#39;s probably going to have to dig deep into his insurance background</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah Corey yeah look I think it&#39;s overrated but it&#39;s funny it is very funny because of course Scheer himself was a speaker and so there&#39;s a lot of things here that effectively give the liberals a bit of a rhetorical out gives the NDP a bit of cover for supporting Fergus here people can easily say you did the same thing you weren&#39;t supposed to do it ha ha ha I do believe the reality is a bit different between what you should expect of a speaker and what you should expect of a mp i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah but he&#39;s also former leader of the conservatives like we&#39;re not pretending that andrew sheer is is a non-partisan are we no</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right uh but but look uh yes everything steven said about how this place is supposed to operate is true i think the lived reality is a bit different partisan activity occurs just by dint of the mp being a partisan and hanging out in those offices so much. That&#39;s just a reality. The speaker is supposed to be different. The speaker is supposed to separate themselves. I do not think this is an apples-to-apples comp, but like I said, it is very funny.</span>

            <span class="text">now with all this call ben.ca talk you probably forgot about an even more important site telldave.ca now at telldave.ca you can tell Dave Cornway a noted political blogger historian of Alberta politics that the best political play of 2023 was us winning best political play of 2023 so let me just break this down for you you would be voting for something that hasn&#39;t happened yet yet. Okay, everything else that that&#39;s that&#39;s a finalist has already happened. So what you would be voting for is for us to win this category. And when that happens, that would be the best thing to happen. But here&#39;s the thing, your vote made it happen. Right? So you&#39;re influencing the future by negating the past. Okay, don&#39;t even try to work that out. It does make sense. And I need you to do it. You need to go to tell Dave.ca you need to make this happen. Not for me, but mainly yes for for me.</span>
