And we talked about this on our Patreon run episode if there&#39;s a space can you blame people for opportunism is this just another person saying fuck it like we&#39;re in this sort of political mode of reuse recycle sort of yes great party joke um where we&#39;re just allowing people yet you&#39;re welcome two in a row like i&#39;m killing it where we&#39;re allowing people to come back reinvent themselves or perhaps not even reinvent themselves but come back exactly who they were and say screw it there&#39;s a there&#39;s a need and I&#39;m here and you know me. Let me just fill that need. What do you think, Corey? Am I being cynical? Is this just an opportunism and we should just like the Horvath thing now running for mayor of Hamilton, just put it aside?
