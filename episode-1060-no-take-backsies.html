            <div class="said">so this isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve seen this uh this is populism at its core and alberta saskatchewan manitoba great histories of populism and populism can take many different forms but in this particular case it&#39;s taking a anti-vaccination pandemic i&#39;m getting screwed over type of populism that mirrors awfully an awful lot like what we saw in donald trump&#39;s world where there&#39;s a group of people who were advantaged and now feel that they&#39;re disadvantaged and because of that they have uh anger and that anger can be marshaled and pointed in directions and david parker is excellent at that the other person who was really good at that was preston manning preston manning created the reform party uh the late 80s and early 90s and and he did the exact same thing that david parker is doing he went around from community to community especially small communities don&#39;t go to the big ones you&#39;re not going to do well in calgary on these things when you start and you find their grievances and then you amplify their grievances you know who else did this fairly well danielle smith did this really well during the electricity debates when she went from town to town to town with with her quote-unquote experts and they they spoke to people about how they were getting getting screwed. They were getting screwed over. And then they talked about property rights. You&#39;ll note that Danielle Smith began her career as a property rights advocate, because that&#39;s how you do these things. You go from town to town to town, and that&#39;s how your populism grows. And so Danielle Smith&#39;s done it. David Parker&#39;s doing it. Preston Manning&#39;s doing it. William Abraham did it. These people have built these movements based on sometimes religiosity, sometimes anger, sometimes whatever it may be. But what is fascinating about them is how does the actual anger get used, right? So if the anger is being put together in a kind of coherent and pointed fashion, you get the outcome like Brian Mulroney&#39;s wins when we were discussing free trade. When it&#39;s put together like Preston Manning did it, you see the collapse of the conservative movement and the the utter devastation of the progressive conservatives in Canada, where the further right you are, the more likely you are to lead. And David Parker is now taking this one more step. He knows exactly how to control things. Because when you control a political party,</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, I can&#39;t disagree. One of the interesting things about politics, we often talk about these war metaphors, you know, generals and politicians are always trying trying to fight the last war. Well, part of why that&#39;s true is because it&#39;s an ever-shifting rule set and there&#39;s an ever-shifting, you know, set of guards at the gate or not for various things, right? And we kind of lose focus on certain things. We don&#39;t have the protections we once did. We welcome everybody into the gates as we&#39;ve done with one member, one vote, and you lose control of your city all of a sudden here. And what David Parker has observed and identified and in many many ways stoked himself, is that the political party is relatively easy to take over compared to a province. But once you have the political party, the province just kind of shrugs. That seems to be the times that we&#39;re in. And I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a unique to Alberta thing. We certainly see this with the Republicans down in the United States. But there&#39;s</div>

            <div class="said">The public is going to be much more moderate than the party. And so when you&#39;re a candidate for the leadership, when you&#39;re an MLA, you are going to be a little bit more moderate than your core wants you to be. And that&#39;s always been a bit of a moderating influence on party politics. But if you&#39;re David Parker and and you say, fuck elected politics, I&#39;m only interested in the back rooms, I&#39;m only interested in taking over the party, you are going to be running a totally different playbook, one that has no regard for that moderation of the public. And you&#39;re just going to say, I can get you animated because I can be angry about an issue, because you&#39;re angry about that issue, and he&#39;s angry about that issue, and she&#39;s angry about that issue. And if we get in a room, that&#39;s our board, and that&#39;s one board down. And you know what? We get 44 more of those, and we got 45. That&#39;s a a majority. I mean, in fact, that&#39;s majority plus one. And then we can do whatever the fuck we want with this party. And that&#39;s what Take Back Alberta&#39;s strategy has been. And I have to credit them. They&#39;ve identified a serious flaw in our political systems in this country, which is that they are very susceptible to takeover of this nature, and nobody&#39;s guarding that particular gate anymore.</div>

When you have the ability to control it, and you can take yourself outside of who would be advantaged by particular rules, and you can think for yourself what would be in the best interest of the party.

And so there&#39;s an important part of doing that. The second is you do actually need to put back up some of those gates and tell some people to get the fuck out. One of the most traditional ways to do that is delegates and And including within that superdelegates, the idea that you become vested in authority, because</div>

And if you have one really bad showing where you&#39;re asleep at the switch, you don&#39;t lose it all. You lose a third of it. You&#39;ve still got two thirds of it and you can regroup and you can get back in fighting shape and you can make sure you&#39;re not taken over.
