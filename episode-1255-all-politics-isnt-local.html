      <h1>Episode 1255: All politics isn&#39;t local</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">September 25, 2023</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Zain, armed with new grievances and looking to organize against Stephen and Corey, brings the gang through the domestic strategy of two big international issues - Ukraine and India - while also finding time to ask what Poilievre should do about the fever dream that is the Alberta Pension Plan.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss how Pierre Poilievre should address the Alberta Pension Plan proposal before turning their attention to the domestic consequences of Zelensky's visit and an increasingly heated dispute with India. Does the Canadian consensus on support for Ukraine mean there's less political "upside" of a state visit? Where are Canada's allies on the Indian affair? And after an 80-minute episode, how many quivers does Stephen have left in his bow? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

I heard you guys talked about the Alberta pension plan, right? You guys talked about scenario planning, strategy, et cetera. I heard it was quite a good episode, not just because I got out of the way and wasn&#39;t there. But I want to talk about this.

          <div class="said">So that&#39;s a fascinating question. I do think that Stephen&#39;s idea of saying, hey, what&#39;s going to get me votes where I need votes is probably sound. I think in reality, he&#39;s going to desperately try not to do that. I suspect when he comes out from underneath the rocks that he&#39;s been under hiding from this issue, he&#39;s going to say the thing we expect him to say, which is, you know what, it&#39;s such a shame what&#39;s happening in this country because of Justin Trudeau. You know, they no longer see the federal government as a partner. Like the root cause here is that Justin Trudeau is a terrible partner. The liberals are terrible partners. They&#39;ve been trying to run roughshod over Albertans. Albertans are rightly hurt. Albertans are rightly fed up and that they don&#39;t see the value in a federal government right now. And if I were prime minister, I would show them the value of a federal government that&#39;s a partner. These kinds of things wouldn&#39;t even come up. And then if pushed any further, say like, well, listen, I don&#39;t know the details on any of that. It sounds like an interesting story. Obviously, the core principle to me is that all Albertans or all Canadians are treated fairly. And then you just sort of walk away by saying all Canadians are treated fairly. You&#39;re both winking to Albertans and saying, hey, that&#39;s the deal. That&#39;s the fair deal that we give you your part. And you&#39;re also winking to everybody else and saying fair means that Alberta doesn&#39;t take more than half the fucking pension. So, you know, I expect a lot of skating from Pierre Polyev over the next bit as he tries not to antagonize his base or the people that he&#39;d really like to have on site.</div>

          <div class="said">yeah well good question and but i think that the answer is um it&#39;s not not just about the votes. Like Stephen talked about, hey, you can lose some votes in Alberta, but you&#39;ll pick them up in Ontario. And that&#39;s pretty good if you want to be prime minister. There&#39;s two things really that I think would drive Pierre Polyev to maybe be a little bit more gentle on this particular issue. The first is, let&#39;s face it, there&#39;s an awful lot of fundraising enthusiasm and just power in the conservative apparatus that comes from Alberta. And that&#39;s something that as the leader of the conservatives, he&#39;s going to think about and he&#39;s going to contemplate. And he just doesn&#39;t want to hear about it, I think. He doesn&#39;t want to be at war with Danielle Smith. It just doesn&#39;t serve his particular interests at this particular moment. He doesn&#39;t want to have a bunch of issues that he then, you know, is going to be called out on. So you&#39;re willing to stand up to her there, but not here, not on these other things. He&#39;d rather keep it a matter of provincial politics. But</div>

That might be the difference between majority government or not. And so he&#39;d rather not give an opening to the freemen on the land who think that there frankly shouldn&#39;t be any federal programs of this particular nature.

          <div class="said">after a couple of weeks of skating, if this ends up being an issue that looks like, hey, maybe it&#39;s even only 60-40 with 40% opposed, but it looks like with all of the power of the Alberta government, maybe the Alberta government could make that push to 50%, maybe they could get it, then I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to necessarily feel like he&#39;s going to come out strong against it. I think he will ultimately have to come out soft against it, though. I think that&#39;s just the reality as a federal leader. And so I imagine it&#39;ll be comments similar to my opening skating comments, except it&#39;ll be like, well, I&#39;m opposed to this. I don&#39;t think it makes sense. But we are only here because of Justin Trudeau and his broken federal government. You know how there&#39;s that old adage, nothing before the but counts? Watch carefully, because politicians know that&#39;s how people react to words before but, and they will create sentences where the message they&#39;re trying to bury is before the but, and the message they&#39;re trying to emphasize is after the but, even if it tortures the English language to get there. And I expect you&#39;ll see a lot of sentences like that, where he&#39;ll use every rhetorical trick there is to de-emphasize the words he said where he said he&#39;s opposed and throw everything back on Trudeau.</div>

During that visit, Rhoda said, Yaroslav Hanka was a Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero, and we thank him for his service. Those gathered in the house stood up and applauded. Well, turns out, Corey, he fought in a Nazi unit during the Second World War. So I&#39;m just going to go out on a limb, not the side that we would usually stand up for and applause.</div>

I&#39;m running to be president of the U.S. and we&#39;ve got some big fucking problems in the U.S. right now. I&#39;m not running to be president of, you know, whatever the fuck in Europe, right? And I&#39;m not saying we come that starkly with our rhetoric here, but you&#39;ve got cost of living candidate from the conservative side who could make a very domestic-first, Canada-first case. Do you see that rhetoric and even the light touch of that policy finding itself on the conservative side of the benches here in Canada?</div>

And I&#39;m being very simplistic to the point of reductive, but does that let the other players in this story start defining the situation while Canada&#39;s evidence trickles out there through third-party sourcing and journalists?</div>

You know, this conversation that is happening with the Sikh community, the broader Punjabi community, the Indian community in Canada is a complicated one. It spans many decades, right? This conversation of Khalistani independence, which is about wanting a Sikh state. As Corey, you alluded to, Modi and his government view that as extremism. There are many folks here who come from that broader community who also view it as extremism, others who view it as activism. It&#39;s led to a very tough to navigate soup of opinions, diverse opinions. But to Carter, your earlier point on a different segment, this concept of the cultural mosaic, what we&#39;re about in some ways, you&#39;re allowed to let those conversations flourish. But</div>

I don&#39;t even care what hat he wears, what color that jersey is. Around that sort of counter narrative that emerges in a delicate situation of which you are not one of those people, but you are the leader of this country. You&#39;ve just called out the Indian government on this. You know, this is not a question that you can answer probably immediately, but help me think through that. You work in the PMO. You see this happening. It probably doesn&#39;t align with your view of Canada that you&#39;ve had.

You&#39;re also clearly after the electoral outcome and want to make sure you don&#39;t screw that up, right? If you&#39;re being totally honest, your strategist and advisor would be like, enough with the sentimentality. There&#39;s also the electoral politics here to worry about.

What do you think of the rhetoric as you&#39;ve been seeing it? Overrated, underrated? Are you high marks to labor as you&#39;ve seen organized labor perform here? Give me your take.
