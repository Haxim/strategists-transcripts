            <span class="text">So that&#39;s a fascinating question. I do think that Stephen&#39;s idea of saying, hey, what&#39;s going to get me votes where I need votes is probably sound. I think in reality, he&#39;s going to desperately try not to do that. I suspect when he comes out from underneath the rocks that he&#39;s been under hiding from this issue, he&#39;s going to say the thing we expect him to say, which is, you know what, it&#39;s such a shame what&#39;s happening in this country because of Justin Trudeau. You know, they no longer see the federal government as a partner. Like the root cause here is that Justin Trudeau is a terrible partner. The liberals are terrible partners. They&#39;ve been trying to run roughshod over Albertans. Albertans are rightly hurt. Albertans are rightly fed up and that they don&#39;t see the value in a federal government right now. And if I were prime minister, I would show them the value of a federal government that&#39;s a partner. These kinds of things wouldn&#39;t even come up. And then if pushed any further, say like, well, listen, I don&#39;t know the details on any of that. It sounds like an interesting story. Obviously, the core principle to me is that all Albertans or all Canadians are treated fairly. And then you just sort of walk away by saying all Canadians are treated fairly. You&#39;re both winking to Albertans and saying, hey, that&#39;s the deal. That&#39;s the fair deal that we give you your part. And you&#39;re also winking to everybody else and saying fair means that Alberta doesn&#39;t take more than half the fucking pension. So, you know, I expect a lot of skating from Pierre Polyev over the next bit as he tries not to antagonize his base or the people that he&#39;d really like to have on site.</span>

Like Stephen talked about, hey, you can lose some votes in Alberta, but you&#39;ll pick them up in Ontario. And that&#39;s pretty good if you want to be prime minister. There&#39;s two things really that I think would drive Pierre Polyev to maybe be a little bit more gentle on this particular issue. The first is, let&#39;s face it, there&#39;s an awful lot of fundraising enthusiasm and just power in the conservative apparatus that comes from Alberta. And that&#39;s something that as the leader of the conservatives, he&#39;s going to think about and he&#39;s going to contemplate. And he just doesn&#39;t want to hear about it, I think. He doesn&#39;t want to be at war with Danielle Smith. It just doesn&#39;t serve his particular interests at this particular moment. He doesn&#39;t want to have a bunch of issues that he then, you know, is going to be called out on. So you&#39;re willing to stand up to her there, but not here, not on these other things. He&#39;d rather keep it a matter of provincial politics. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is he doesn&#39;t want to create an opening for right-wing opposition, right? He doesn&#39;t want to have the People&#39;s Party of Canada bleeding off five points. That might be the difference between majority government or not. And so he&#39;d rather not give an opening to the freemen on the land who think that there frankly shouldn&#39;t be any federal programs of this particular nature. And shame on Pierre Polyev for not standing up for us because C.1 about money and enthusiasm, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">after a couple of weeks of skating, if this ends up being an issue that looks like, hey, maybe it&#39;s even only 60-40 with 40% opposed, but it looks like with all of the power of the Alberta government, maybe the Alberta government could make that push to 50%, maybe they could get it, then I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to necessarily feel like he&#39;s going to come out strong against it. I think he will ultimately have to come out soft against it, though. I think that&#39;s just the reality as a federal leader. And so I imagine it&#39;ll be comments similar to my opening skating comments, except it&#39;ll be like, well, I&#39;m opposed to this. I don&#39;t think it makes sense. But we are only here because of Justin Trudeau and his broken federal government. You know how there&#39;s that old adage, nothing before the but counts? Watch carefully, because politicians know that&#39;s how people react to words before but, and they will create sentences where the message they&#39;re trying to bury is before the but, and the message they&#39;re trying to emphasize is after the but, even if it tortures the English language to get there. And I expect you&#39;ll see a lot of sentences like that, where he&#39;ll use every rhetorical trick there is to de-emphasize the words he said where he said he&#39;s opposed and throw everything back on Trudeau.</span>

He was responding to condemnation from Jewish groups and others stemming from a movement from a moment during President Volodymyr Zelensky&#39;s visit to Parliament on Friday. During that visit, Rhoda said, Yaroslav Hanka was a Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero, and we thank him for his service. Those gathered in the house stood up and applauded. Well, turns out, Corey, he fought in a Nazi unit during the Second World War. So I&#39;m just going to go out on a limb, not the side that we would usually stand up for and applause.</span>

What I do want to talk about is Zelensky visiting Parliament, what this means for Canada. Will we stick together on our commitments to Ukraine or will we divide like the GOP is starting to or fracture like the GOP is seemingly starting to? But let&#39;s start here about this moment. Who&#39;s to blame? There&#39;s a lot of blame going around today around what happened here. And so I want to talk to you guys about like procedures on this sort of stuff. You guys may have some insights on it in terms of who is actually to blame, right? Because at this point, the speaker, Carter,</span>

So you gave kind of the short version, but the longer version is we&#39;ve gathered in the chamber today a Ukrainian-Canadian veteran from the Second World War who fought for Ukrainian independence against the Russians and continues to support the troops today. So, you know, like, I actually do think that Stephen&#39;s answer of staff are young and people make mistakes is the right one. Like, ultimately, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind, you might be a staffer nowadays who was born after the year 2000, World War II, distant memory. memory right</span>

            <span class="text">nothing clear about some of those lines in ukraine in the second world war because there was uh you know stalin there was hitler and there were people cozying up to both sides and you know neither is is somebody that i think is super admirable but canada at the time was an ally of the russians of the soviet union the soviet union was fighting with nazi germany and i do think that um maybe uh somebody just had less than a perfect command of the basic facts at play here and so and you know listen i&#39;m not giving anyone a pass because that that&#39;s kind of pretty foundational to your understanding of world war ii russians nazis different sides of the war right but um but</span>

What a useless body that is. Why are you putting so much money into trying to get to the UN Security Council in the first place? But it&#39;s so much part of our identity that we are embedded in these international bodies, right? You know, we were one of the founding nations of the United Nations, of course, the Suez Crisis and the creation of peacekeepers and so on and so forth. We do tend to be joiners as a country. And I just don&#39;t know that there&#39;d be an awful lot of upside for a conservative government, certainly not, or a conservative government, conservative party, certainly not a party that aspires to be government and a majority government of taking like a, we&#39;re going to back away from the world approach.

Escalations all week. Visas, advisories, back and forth rhetoric. America, UK and the other five eyes, despite being aligned with Canada, not really speaking up.

But one may argue, maybe not in a timely sense, Corey, like, do you feel that risk that the Prime Minister, whether we say he had to do this, Do you feel that risk is growing or shrinking for him with that vacuum of evidence and what that allows India and the other sort of players, the multiple players in this story? And I&#39;m being very simplistic to the point of reductive, but does that let the other players in this story start defining the situation while Canada&#39;s evidence trickles out there through third-party sourcing and journalists?</span>

This conversation of Khalistani independence, which is about wanting a Sikh state. As Corey, you alluded to, Modi and his government view that as extremism. There are many folks here who come from that broader community who also view it as extremism, others who view it as activism. It&#39;s led to a very tough to navigate soup of opinions, diverse opinions. But to Carter, your earlier point on a different segment, this concept of the cultural mosaic, what we&#39;re about in some ways, you&#39;re allowed to let those conversations flourish. But</span>

I don&#39;t even care what hat he wears, what color that jersey is. Around that sort of counter narrative that emerges in a delicate situation of which you are not one of those people, but you are the leader of this country. You&#39;ve just called out the Indian government on this. You know, this is not a question that you can answer probably immediately, but help me think through that. You work in the PMO. You see this happening. It probably doesn&#39;t align with your view of Canada that you&#39;ve had.

You&#39;re also clearly after the electoral outcome and want to make sure you don&#39;t screw that up, right? If you&#39;re being totally honest, your strategist and advisor would be like, enough with the sentimentality. There&#39;s also the electoral politics here to worry about. And then there&#39;s just the right thing to do. As Carter&#39;s mentioned, he&#39;s put a couple things on the table. Your take on this, if you were advising the PMO on their responsibility, their scope of responsibilities, and how to think about the strategies here.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, here&#39;s what they got in Canada. 25% on the base rate, a reactivating cost of living allowance, 10K bonus, two new paid holidays and pension improvements. In the US, I just know the top line, they&#39;re asking for 36%. They seem to be making a pretty strident case as it relates to CEO compensation being their main metric. I guess the question I have is your thoughts on what you&#39;re seeing from the labor movement here, especially through this most recent struggle of autoworkers, overrated or underrated in terms of what you&#39;re seeing on the table in both Canada and the U.S.?
