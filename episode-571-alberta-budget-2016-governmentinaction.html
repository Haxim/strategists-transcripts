If we went to sort of the middle of the pack, we would be bringing in about $16 billion. Now let&#39;s put that in perspective. We have a $10 billion deficit and it&#39;s our largest ever.

It&#39;s part of why when Alberta went to a new, new slogan at some point in the past 10 years or so, everyone&#39;s like, what? We spent money on that? The last one, just some guy came up with. The Wild Rose has used some version of bring back the Alberta advantage before. It is definitely something that the right talks a lot about. Ralph Klein has moved into this realm of pure</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">People forget the fact that, as Stephen mentioned, Ralph Klein eventually went back and spent far more on services. And by the way, if you want to talk about why services are so expensive in Alberta, probably because in this boom-bust world, we&#39;re either hiring and paying hiring bonuses or firing and paying severance every year. Like clockwork. It&#39;s crazy. And we just need to get off that roller coaster and get something more consistent. But what do you do? I mean, yes, let&#39;s just throw this out here right now. We are more expensive. But, of course, Alberta also makes 50% more GDP per capita. We&#39;re going to be more expensive. Salaries are higher. You&#39;ve got to compete with the private sector here in Alberta if you&#39;re the government. And you&#39;re going to have to pay them a bit more money. That&#39;s the reality of the situation.

          <div class="said">the other things that in the budget had been announced before but i think really have to be talked about and where i disagree with steven a a bit is we he said off the top like this is not a big budget yeah it&#39;s true what we learned today is not big but this was also the budget that brought in the carbon levy and made real uh the work of shannon phillips&#39;s panel uh on on climate change and that is pretty big uh it is a lot of money it is a new tax it is supposed to essentially roll back to to lower income albertans in different ways offset some of business expenses in different ways pay for the greening of the the alberta grid etc etc and that&#39;s pretty transformational pretty fundamental and i love it i think it&#39;s i think it&#39;s a great piece of legislation because it also gives a bunch of tools to the government to then ramp up like it even says in the budget like hey we&#39;re going to set it at 30 but it may go up it will have to go up at some point but we&#39;re going to wait for the federal government and for our neighbors okay</div>
