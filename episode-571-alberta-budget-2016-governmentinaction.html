            <span class="text">got us here. First, what got us here? Okay, here&#39;s what got us here. We have had a revenue problem from some people&#39;s point of view or an expense problem for other people&#39;s point of view in alberta for the better part of 20 years this debate&#39;s been going on</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yes so let&#39;s just forget about whether it&#39;s a revenue problem or an expense problem okay and so let and let me break down for those listeners who who aren&#39;t in alberta or maybe who those albertans who haven&#39;t been paying attention bottom</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">bottom line we rely on resource revenue to balance our budget or to produce surpluses it has been as high as uh 12 or 14 billion dollars in a year or</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">or Or in another way of looking at it, some 40% of the overall budget or overall revenue that we have in the province of Alberta, it has been that high. And it has been as low as it is right now. In this projected budget, it is $1.4 billion. It&#39;s lowest number since 1974. Right. So we&#39;re talking like decades and decades of time since we have seen a number this low. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And even when it was high, we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we were having deficits. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the reason for that is that we created this so-called Alberta Advantage. So the Alberta Advantage that Ralph Klein created in the 1990s was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">was that we would have the lowest tax regime and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we would have all the same services.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So people remember Ralph Klein as the guy who cut the spending, cut spending, cut spending. And that was one Ralph Klein. But</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But there was a second guy. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The second Ralph Klein, the second coming of Ralph Klein and the second coming of Ralph Klein spent money like he was a drunken sailor and he escalated all of the spending. He gave back all of the money that he&#39;d taken from nurses, all the money he took from doctors, all the money he took from teachers. He gave that all back. Plus then some.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And we became the highest per capita spending province in the country on things like health care, education, human services. as we continue to be in that position now moving forward. Again,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Again, I don&#39;t care which side you want to be on. We&#39;re spending too much money? Sure, case can be made. We don&#39;t make enough revenue? Sure, a case can be made. All that really matters is the fundamental principle in accounting, which says that if your revenues are less than your expenditures, you have a deficit.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s where we are, and that&#39;s where we&#39;ve been in the province of Alberta for eight of the last nine years because apparently Corey has pointed out that we we managed to barely balance a budget one time in the last nine years the last nine years most of which were boom years in the province carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">carter is it fair to say that this concept of the alberta advantage has kind of stuck within the zeitgeist and has been a constant political sort of initiative that everyone&#39;s tried to go after is that true</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">here&#39;s our reality. We have published in our budgets and we have published in our, you know, we&#39;ve had spoken about many, many times the difference between the taxation rates in this province and every other province across the country. And even when we were showing massive deficits and today&#39;s massive deficit biggest ever. Yeah, we have we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for the exact same services. In fact, more expensive services than any other province. Yeah, we are taxing them less than any other province in the country. The next closest province, Corey, Saskatchewan.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a move that I can only assume came from some wonk in the finance department that really should have been killed by the political masters, but they put together a chart that showed if Alberta went to the tax rates of any other province where we would be, we were by far the lowest. if we went to the next lowest province&#39;s tax rate, Saskatchewan, we would bring in an additional $7.5 billion. If we went to sort of the middle of the pack, we would be bringing in about $16 billion. Now let&#39;s put that in perspective. We have a $10 billion deficit and it&#39;s our largest ever. The sky is falling, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I cannot understand for the life of me how you brag about a $7.5 billion tax advantage when you have a $10.4 billion deficit. That would be like like bragging about your house and failing to mention that it&#39;s in foreclosure. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I own a $1.3 million house, but I have an income of $148,000. I mean, this is the equivalent of what we&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re bragging about it. Sorry,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Sorry, I want to phrase this with the whole concept of the Alberta Advantage, Corey. We&#39;ve got this thing that we&#39;ve all been striving for. Take us to where Carter talked to us about the context to where we are today. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I hate that phrase, the Alberta Advantage. This was something that was cooked up by Ralph Klein. Legend goes around his kitchen table. It was the new slogan. It&#39;s part of why when Alberta went to a new, new slogan at some point in the past 10 years or so, everyone&#39;s like, what? We spent money on that? The last one, just some guy came up with. The Wild Rose has used some version of bring back the Alberta advantage before. It is definitely something that the right talks a lot about. Ralph Klein has moved into this realm of pure</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">People forget, for starters, that when Ralph Klein balanced the budget originally, it was with much, much higher taxes than we have now. People</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">People forget the fact that, as Stephen mentioned, Ralph Klein eventually went back and spent far more on services. And by the way, if you want to talk about why services are so expensive in Alberta, probably because in this boom-bust world, we&#39;re either hiring and paying hiring bonuses or firing and paying severance every year. Like clockwork. It&#39;s crazy. And we just need to get off that roller coaster and get something more consistent. But what do you do? I mean, yes, let&#39;s just throw this out here right now. We are more expensive. But, of course, Alberta also makes 50% more GDP per capita. We&#39;re going to be more expensive. Salaries are higher. You&#39;ve got to compete with the private sector here in Alberta if you&#39;re the government. And you&#39;re going to have to pay them a bit more money. That&#39;s the reality of the situation. So that&#39;s good.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter. I just want to go back to the Alberta advantages for two seconds. OK, why was the Alberta Advantage instituted? Why did we put in such a low taxation rate? Because I want to understand</span>

Alberta was playing around with the health care system and privatization. There was this sense the federal government could hold back money through the Canada health transfer. There was a lot going on. and uh and there was a lot of paranoia and there was a lot of ill will on both sides which which led to this notion of let&#39;s just give it all back let&#39;s lower taxes let&#39;s create this uh i don&#39;t know ayn rand style playground of alberta the problem that we have now today is that um we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the other things that in the budget had been announced before but i think really have to be talked about and where i disagree with steven a a bit is we he said off the top like this is not a big budget yeah it&#39;s true what we learned today is not big but this was also the budget that brought in the carbon levy and made real uh the work of shannon phillips&#39;s panel uh on on climate change and that is pretty big uh it is a lot of money it is a new tax it is supposed to essentially roll back to to lower income albertans in different ways offset some of business expenses in different ways pay for the greening of the the alberta grid etc etc and that&#39;s pretty transformational pretty fundamental and i love it i think it&#39;s i think it&#39;s a great piece of legislation because it also gives a bunch of tools to the government to then ramp up like it even says in the budget like hey we&#39;re going to set it at 30 but it may go up it will have to go up at some point but we&#39;re going to wait for the federal government and for our neighbors okay</span>
