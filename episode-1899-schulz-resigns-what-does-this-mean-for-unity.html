Oh, great. Because an hour ago, Rebecca Schultz has announced she is bye bye from cabinet in Danielle Smith&#39;s government. And in addition to that, she suggested she&#39;s looking for new career opportunities and she&#39;s leaving as an MLA in Q1 spring of this year. Here. Stephen Carter, the strategist, and Stephen Carter, the reckless speculator, help me both digest and analyze this. My eye is on early election. Is that where your eye is on? No, you know what? I don&#39;t even want to lead you. I don&#39;t want to lead this camel to a pond. I will let this camel roam free. One Stephen Carter, please.</div>

Unity both, I think, within the party, but also unity within Canada. so that&#39;s where i kind of went with it um uh i think that this is a larger play um where you know uh this will have something to this will have something to do with the election but i i think that uh for her this is you know reflects that she doesn&#39;t fit she&#39;s a puzzle piece that doesn&#39;t fit quite into this puzzle um i&#39;m sure that the premier is asking around if if you&#39;re planning to run in the next election, regardless of when it is.

Was this a spur-of-the-moment decision from your side, or was this a question that came from the Premier? Was there a reflection in the Alberta Next panel? You were involved.

So, Carter, maybe package those two questions for me in terms of analysis and a bit of strategy. Well,</div>

I personally liked the aggressive fuck you energy to it, but it did, to Shannon&#39;s point, have a bit of punditry element to it. Do you mind that yourself? Or would you have made that year ender about, you know, and I want to get to the Alberta next panel. And frankly, just a preview where I&#39;m going forward. Like there&#39;s a shit ton of things that the NDP opposition organizing forces can focus on. I want to talk about signal and noise in a second. But Carter, getting your take on just that, that, that, that pundit mode and how Nenshi ended the year off being like, we would fucking kick their ass and wreck them. What did you think about that?

So whether it is an organizing principle or a way to strategize this, how are you thinking about this? Because you also have on top of our main opposition party, literally tens of thousands of Albertans rearing at doing something. Something I think Recall, as we&#39;ve discussed, is a good indication of that.

And, you know, she&#39;s gone up and down on assuaging those fears for those voters. But now she is going full, fully straight at underlining that reputation. And so everyone in Alberta of good faith and good conscience, every patriot should be reminding voters that this is who she is. This is what she wants.
