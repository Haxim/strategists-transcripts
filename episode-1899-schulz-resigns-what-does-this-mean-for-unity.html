            <span class="text">And we&#39;ll get into that with the Alberta Next panel. But can I can I get into what is my favorite part of our podcast, which is Reckless Speculation, Stephen Carter? Oh, great. Because an hour ago, Rebecca Schultz has announced she is bye bye from cabinet in Danielle Smith&#39;s government. And in addition to that, she suggested she&#39;s looking for new career opportunities and she&#39;s leaving as an MLA in Q1 spring of this year. Here. Stephen Carter, the strategist, and Stephen Carter, the reckless speculator, help me both digest and analyze this. My eye is on early election. Is that where your eye is on? No, you know what? I don&#39;t even want to lead you. I don&#39;t want to lead this camel to a pond. I will let this camel roam free. One Stephen Carter, please.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that it was interesting in Rebecca Schultz&#39;s letter that she talked specifically about unity. Unity both, I think, within the party, but also unity within Canada. so that&#39;s where i kind of went with it um uh i think that this is a larger play um where you know uh this will have something to this will have something to do with the election but i i think that uh for her this is you know reflects that she doesn&#39;t fit she&#39;s a puzzle piece that doesn&#39;t fit quite into this puzzle um i&#39;m sure that the premier is asking around if if you&#39;re planning to run in the next election, regardless of when it is. And Rebecca Schultz might be the first casualty of those types of questions.</span>

Because these letters are so coded that even the three of us have to read into them in terms of what it could mean. What would you suggest people do when they see Rebecca Schultz next or the premier next or suggest a character in this story, Carter, around getting clarity? And then because I&#39;m curious if that is the next part here or will we never have clarity in your mind, Carter? I don&#39;t</span>

            <span class="text">don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever have clarity until sometime after, right? Sometime after, might be 10 years after, when you&#39;re sitting at a cocktail party and Rebecca Schultz walks in and you finally get to ask the question, you know, remember back at the end of 2025, what were you thinking? What were you thinking? And she actually is honest with you in that moment. But, you know, the follow-up questions that should be asked by media are, you know, does this, were you asked if you plan to seek re-election? Was this a spur-of-the-moment decision from your side, or was this a question that came from the Premier? Was there a reflection in the Alberta Next panel? You were involved. Does this have some impact? and uh what what type of um uh you know uh influence does the uh does the the referendum or the potential election have in this and ultimately you they can ask those questions i&#39;m quite certain that all the answers are going to be uh no comment or something uh benign i also expect that you know if they asked her about what where what job she&#39;s moving on to she&#39;s going to you know absolutely defer on that as well she will not be answering any questions honestly and truthfully because she published this letter this letter is not an honest and true reflection of why she&#39;s leaving i think that everybody can you know everybody who&#39;s been a part of writing these letters knows that these letters aren&#39;t done like this if we want to get an honest and true reflection of why a person&#39;s</span>

I personally liked the aggressive fuck you energy to it, but it did, to Shannon&#39;s point, have a bit of punditry element to it. Do you mind that yourself? Or would you have made that year ender about, you know, and I want to get to the Alberta next panel. And frankly, just a preview where I&#39;m going forward. Like there&#39;s a shit ton of things that the NDP opposition organizing forces can focus on. I want to talk about signal and noise in a second. But Carter, getting your take on just that, that, that, that pundit mode and how Nenshi ended the year off being like, we would fucking kick their ass and wreck them. What did you think about that?

So whether it is an organizing principle or a way to strategize this, how are you thinking about this? Because you also have on top of our main opposition party, literally tens of thousands of Albertans rearing at doing something. Something I think Recall, as we&#39;ve discussed, is a good indication of that. Where do they focus their energies when a half a dozen more things have been added to the fucking plate at the end of this calendar year? Who wants to get started? Shannon, Stephen?</span>

Anyway, the point here is, is that this is a basket of issues that are terrible, that make fantastic policy announcements from the opposition of we are day one, we are going to pass a law that nobody fucks with your pension. Day one, we are going to pass a law that we&#39;re not going to defund the RCMP, right? Right. Like you can do kind of a really cheeky stuff with this. And we are going like, you know, these are easy platform things that don&#39;t cost any money when you&#39;re trying to put together a very quick policy</span>

            <span class="text">policy offer that is coming. And it gets your base up in the morning to basically be running on the no campaign. It&#39;s great, because there&#39;s a very quick pivot to we are talking about taking away your pension instead of regulating your insurance. We are talking about taking away the police in small communities and spending billions upon billions of dollars to do it instead of making sure that your emergency room is open. It&#39;s great. It&#39;s a great contrast. You know, the Conservatives think they&#39;re being oh so clever, flooding the zone with shit, as Bannon would say.</span>

            <span class="text">say. But really what they&#39;re doing is providing beautiful contrast messaging at every available turn. And not just in the air, but on the ground. Because the forever Canadian boomers will absolutely be exercised by this. Number one is CPP. They&#39;re not going to tolerate it.</span>

Weird turn of phrase. Carter, your thoughts here? Like, to be honest, I would like to think it&#39;s as simple as Shannon is saying. I&#39;m not there yet.</span>

And it feels like you&#39;re just as out of touch as anybody else. I would say this is a massive opportunity for the NDP to double down on their core three, not necessarily an opportunity to say we&#39;re against this that the UCP is for.</span>

Some of the time, energy, and space we would have put on affordability to say, fuck it, if they&#39;re going to make this an issue, we&#39;re going to make it. That&#39;s the part of Shannon&#39;s argument that I do buy, that the NDP and certain things should say this is signal, not noise. Fuck it, we&#39;re going to take the opposing force on it.

There&#39;s still a good chunk of Albertans that are willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. Just for example, I&#39;m looking at affordability and questions of economy and I&#39;m going, OK, there&#39;s still a baked in trust of the conservatives that is higher than the new Democrats, depending on how you ask the question, certainly on economy, sometimes on affordability.</span>

It is one of the reasons why, again, you know, my sort of typology of, well, voter Chamber of Commerce conservatives are different than the ones in the UCP caucus, but votary PC types lent us their vote in 2023, in large part because Daniel Smith Smith was seen as a fucking separatist. And, you know, she&#39;s gone up and down on assuaging those fears for those voters. But now she is going full, fully straight at underlining that reputation. And so everyone in Alberta of good faith and good conscience, every patriot should be reminding voters that this is who she is. This is what she wants.
