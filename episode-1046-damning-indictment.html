      <h1>Episode 1046: Damning indictment</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">March 31, 2023</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>The Zain-free gang assemble to talk Alberta politics - specifically, the premier's ten minute bearing-of-the-soul with Artur Pawlowski - but also find time to talk Donald Trump's unfolding indictment and make a couple of other plugs for the Sunday, April 2 live show.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter briefly talk about the breaking news of Donald Trump's indictment before turning attention to Alberta Premier Danielle Smith's caught-on-tape moment chatting with "controversial street preacher" Artur Pawlowski. How much trouble is Danielle Smith in? Could Donald Trump's indictment lead to a constitutional crisis in the United States? And did Alison Redford ever take a ten-minute call with MADD without Stephen Carter present? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

You know, people who are being screwed over in their minds have access to a tremendous number of weapons have access you know they are angry they have been angry for years we are on the verge i mean cory and i have seen this and talked about this for quite some time that this is a powder keg and yeah you know it&#39;s kind of fun we think that trump&#39;s pretty corrupt we think that it&#39;s probably a good thing that he gets arrested um he&#39;s going to get arrested and he&#39;s going to most likely uh go to jail and i&#39;m not sure that his people would allow such a thing to actually happen i&#39;m not sure that i mean if it was any other state except new york i&#39;m not sure that he actually gets to the courthouse before something really really bad happens um with his supporters i think that we could see something really violent and that scares the bejesus out of me so</div>

          <div class="said">Well, it&#39;s ridiculous to me. I mean, and it&#39;s not like Smith&#39;s a Polowski fan, near as I can tell. I mean, the public information about, so around 2015 or so, Rick McIver got in trouble for spending some time with Arthur Polowski, because of course, this guy&#39;s a hate preacher. I mean, we can call him a preacher, we can call him whatever we want, but he&#39;s a hateful man. He has groups of people that he hates, and he preaches that hateful rhetoric under the auspices of being a Christian preacher. And he&#39;s a Christian, but it&#39;s just kind of a perverted form of Christianity, from my point of view, at least. But his Daniel Smith, when when Rick McIver did this, said that it&#39;s totally unbecoming of a minister to spend time with the likes of Artur Pulowski. Now that she&#39;s the premier, she somehow has found the time. Let me be very clear. Having been in a premier&#39;s office, premiers don&#39;t generally make telephone calls to Gen Pop. up um they&#39;re exceptionally busy and they&#39;re not calling people who have random uh concerns with the government nor are they calling people who face criminal charges uh generally speaking we staff that work out um you</div>

And let&#39;s be clear, too, this wasn&#39;t really a leaked document so much as it was a found phone call, because Arter, who obviously loves and respects this premier enough to immediately post the fucking conversation to YouTube. it</div>

If you&#39;re the premier, you just don&#39;t say something you don&#39;t want on the front page of the Calgary Herald.

And then another, after the story comes out, another statement comes from her office saying like hey nothing new here uh just forget it nothing new what what do you make like as strategist kind of thinking through those decisions that are being made on her team of this strategy to put out like the preemptive statement and then another one so</div>

          <div class="said">so um the preemptive statement is not inherently a bad strategy like if you know it&#39;s coming sometimes you get your own dirty laundry out right that&#39;s That&#39;s how you can help frame the issue as best as you can. I will say, if you find yourself in a situation where you need to apply that tactic, you&#39;re having a bad day. And so really, in terms of communications tactics, you&#39;ve got to judge it by that, though. I mean, I&#39;m being serious. It&#39;s like, you&#39;re not trying to maximize upside, you&#39;re trying to minimize downside at that particular moment. Did she minimize downside with that statement? No. So there were a couple of bad things that she did in that particular statement. You know, then there&#39;s a couple of small things like getting the dates wrong. But one is, she seemed to be responding to the charges she feared would be coming, rather than the charges that were actually made in the CBC article backed up by audio there. So she seemed to think it was going to be kind</div>

          <div class="said">kind of a continuation of the story of her interference in justice, perhaps from like an emailing point of view. Like, that&#39;s what the response read as, right? And there wasn&#39;t anything like that. You know, there was nothing about her potentially emailing Crown prosecutors or additional evidence of that. Instead, it was her own words that were being reported with video backing it up. So it does, and I said this on Twitter, it kind of reminds me of this time I was pulled over by a police officer in Calgary. And he said to me, do you know why I pulled you over? And I replied with, because I didn&#39;t signal my turn. And he said, no, because your registration has expired, but here&#39;s your second ticket for not signaling</div>

          <div class="said">your turn now. The challenge with volunteering what you think you&#39;re going down for before you&#39;re accused of it is you might volunteer the wrong thing. So that was a mistake. she should have been much narrower in her accusation or in her pre-rebuttal and it should have been specifically to the facts of whatever CBC&#39;s inquiry was they tried to read CBC&#39;s mind in the inquiry and that is a big mistake you don&#39;t try to do that you have to narrow the scope when you&#39;re trying to frame things out like that the second problem they had is that they then um they just started colliding statements on top of it and being utterly defiant and not changing approach When this happened, right? You&#39;ve got to be nimble enough to react to the facts as they are. And nobody really was. I mean, the way Rob Anderson was going on, again,</div>

When people get a reporter accusation and there&#39;s some truth to it, they read between the lines, they jump to conclusions, they start reacting to things that are not on the page in front of them. And I can&#39;t tell you how many times when I was a communications consultant, I would have to tell my clients, slow down, answer the questions asked, not the questions you think they&#39;re going to ask, and narrow. I mean, it happened all the time. It&#39;d be like, they ask question A, and it&#39;d be like, well, A&#39;s obviously leading to Z, so I&#39;m going to tell them Z, and I&#39;m</div>

And that&#39;s not, I mean, you expect a certain level of professionalism in a Premier&#39;s office communication staff, and they should have been able to stop that. That was a panicky preemption. And Carter&#39;s right. Like, this was not preempting on a track. This was not getting ahead of the train.

          <div class="said">i mean like this is i mean what can you say this is sad it&#39;s on a certain level it&#39;s just sad it it is it is really deeply sad that people believe this nonsense that they believe this is happening that they&#39;ve been taken taken in by these crazy conspiracy videos that are running through the Western world that have people convinced that teachers are showing pornography to six-year-olds. That&#39;s not fucking happening, people. That&#39;s simply not happening. And there&#39;s a hundred reasons why that&#39;s the case. There are an awful lot of, you know, checks and balances, shall we say, when we&#39;re dealing with young children. And when do you even think and how do you even think that would occur? These are ridiculous things to say. And to then conflate that with gender reassignment and then to make accusations more broadly and just blur all of the lines and just try to create this miasma of like you know sexual perversion and create these equivalencies between it&#39;s just gross it&#39;s gross behavior by these people and the fact that they&#39;ve fallen into this this trap for themselves and they&#39;re believing these things and they&#39;re in these facebook threads and these reddit threads and this is just who they are really depresses me right and so i&#39;m glad she&#39;s no longer a candidate i&#39;m i&#39;m really glad she&#39;s not a candidate anymore and i think it&#39;s really really unfortunate she even got to the place of being a candidate in the first place. Now, in terms of the UCP, I think Danielle Smith did learn something from 2012. She acted pretty quickly on this. She didn&#39;t let it become a lake of fire. And again, because it happened the same day that all this other stuff was going on, she could kind of do that and take a little bit of the pressure off her personally as she was dealing with the particular matter.

          <div class="said">happens when you don&#39;t want it to right like you just get a story established and all of a sudden something else happens and breaks and now you&#39;ve lost that that particular hook because the world has moved on to a new story um i think you&#39;re right the difference is the frequency right so we used to lose a story after about 24 hours sometimes 48 hours a really good story would go for three days now we&#39;re seeing stories that barely barely resonate for a couple of minutes i i this the trump thing could be one of the longest stories that we&#39;ll see. And it&#39;s going to go probably until Tuesday, Wednesday, like it&#39;ll be it&#39;ll be packaged in a couple different stories. I&#39;m dying to see how the networks carry it over through the weekend, like the CNN run a countdown to indictment or countdown to arrest. You know, like, I&#39;m really interested to see how we capture the public&#39;s attention. But one thing to keep in mind, even when all these stories are breaking at once, and all of us as news hounds are going holy crap that&#39;s so much stuff that&#39;s happening all at once the average person isn&#39;t seeing it that way the average person will wait and then the story will bubble up to them it isn&#39;t this immediate thing that we see as you know avid twitter followers and we&#39;re all paying for our you know elon musk blue check mark um we we we see things so much faster than gen pop because we&#39;re the only ones paying attention and i think that this type of stuff might be required to get the general population to even pay attention long enough to see it uh all unfold</div>

          <div class="said">right? But I&#39;ll say this, as we deal with more and more issues and less and less attention, really the importance of bundling them into bigger narratives grows. And that&#39;s kind of the point that I think needs to be underlined here. It&#39;s no longer about winning the issue. It&#39;s about making the issue part of a narrative and making sure that that narrative sticks. And you do that through earned, you do that through paid, and you do that through making sure that things build up to bigger things so when you&#39;re talking about danielle smith talking to arthur palowski you&#39;re also talking to danielle smith talking about uh not supporting ukraine you&#39;re talking about some of her previous comments on uh people who have been uh unvaccinated being you know the most persecuted a bunch group you make it a bigger story about judgment and you&#39;re constantly pushing bigger narratives and you&#39;re trying to reinforce those narratives on an ongoing basis based on the issues of the day that&#39;s your earned your paid media which is reminding people of these stories and keeping them in the foreground and your owned media so any splashy content you can create that you can then propagate out there and and just have exist when people look for things like danielle smith right and all of a sudden it&#39;s a little bit higher in search so i i mean again it&#39;s like it&#39;s a big question not not easy to tackle enlightening round but that&#39;s the nature of politics these days attentions low issues frequent go</div>
