            <span class="text">In the piece, Markosoff talks about Rachel Notley, the former premier, the current leader of the party. Corey, we on this podcast have talked extensively about if Rachel Notley will leave, what that looks like. Carter, we had a great episode where Corey was wrong, I was right around how she should leave, whether it should be a speech or a video. You can pick the winning team, and we know exactly what that is, Carter. It&#39;s a speech. That is incorrect. And Carter, that is wrong once again, but I get it. It&#39;s for sure speech. It&#39;s definitely not. So</span>

We&#39;re going to not talk about Rachel Notley. We&#39;re just going to enter a period right now where we talk about who can potentially take over. Because in this piece that Markosov has put out, there are a few candidates that have emerged within the current NDP caucus. He lays out three particular candidates. We&#39;ll talk about each one of them. He talks about what their pros are, so the pros of their candidacy, so to speak, PROS, I guess, rather than PROSE, just so folks know what I&#39;m talking about. out, what their viability might look like and how they might be angling for the leadership. I want to talk about the dynamics. There&#39;s so much to talk about in terms of right now, even prior to having Rachel Notley announce, is it valuable</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">valuable to have her name out in the media? What do each of these camps need to do? How do they need to position themselves? Do they need to position themselves? So many questions. But Corey, I&#39;ll give you the first word in terms of where we find ourselves right now now with rumors of Rachel Notley potentially leaving after a very storied tenure with the NDP and those that are within that caucus potentially looking to take her seat while she still has it.</span>

Because literally for months now, whenever this topic has come up, we&#39;ve not really had anything to anchor it on, and there&#39;s been whispers and rumors, but not like media conversation about this. I have no idea about the 100% veracity of what Jason Markasoff put out. There&#39;s a couple of various components in there that maybe can be pulled apart, but I can say- People should go read it,</span>

There&#39;s been other conversations out there as well, additional threads, additional people in the mix, but it is, by and large, what everybody&#39;s been talking about in in the back rooms for for months now and it kind of it kind of puts out there that narrative you know maybe not 100 perfect maybe not 100 complete but really pretty consistent with everything else that i&#39;ve been hearing through like the various you know hangers-on in politics if carter sort of wants to validate that let</span>

            <span class="text">People are getting started. And this type of an article is the standard media piece where they say, okay, this is something that&#39;s bound to happen. Who&#39;s going to run? What are their perceived weaknesses and strengths? I mean, it&#39;s just absolutely kind of pro forma for what we would expect for a known departure of a leader. And this one, to me, is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Corey&#39;s eager to get in. Yeah, jump in, Corey. Yeah, you asked why this matters, and I said why it matters for us, but let me tell you why it actually matters, which is, building on what Carter said, this has generally been a known but unspoken or often hedged with, if she decides to go, which I suppose we should still do, because Rachel Notley could decide not to go, but it has not been kind of publicly discussed in a way that would drive an article like this. So that matters because it&#39;s one thing for that sort of to be implicit, but the minute it becomes a little more explicit through articles like this, I think it starts to signal the end of something, whether you want it to or not, right? And people start acting differently and people start planning differently. But the other thing I want to throw on the table is now we have a couple of people, three people in particular, who have been explicitly named as candidates in this thing. And that matters too, because now the next time Sarah Hoffman makes a comment about municipal affairs, people are going to be looking at it through the lens of, well, is she saying this as an NDP critic and Rachel Notley&#39;s team, or is she saying this for herself? And it changes how everything is perceived from this moment forward, because we cannot help but think of Racky Serra and Kathleen as leadership candidates now. And that&#39;s just the reality that I think a lot of people have been struggling with. But that circle just got way bigger this weekend, even though it was kind of implied, but not necessarily explicit. Now it&#39;s pretty explicit. It is such an</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">an interesting conversation to me, Carter, what Corey&#39;s talking about here, between what the rumor mill churns out, and not even the rumor mill, but like the insiders, so to speak, and I use that term in the loosest fashion, right? The political insiders are the operatives and the activists and what they know, versus what happens when it sees the light of day through a news article or through a wider public domain. And I guess the question I have leads into exactly what Corey&#39;s talking about, Carter, which is now that you&#39;ve got three leading candidates within the Alberta NDP caucus named with Racky Pancholi, Sarah Hoffman, Kathleen Ganley, and like I said, I&#39;ll discuss each one of them. What does this do for them? Is this good for them? Let&#39;s start here. Or is it conditional on if it&#39;s good for them? And let me frame it in a sense, right? I said we don&#39;t want to talk about Rachel Notley, but it is important. And you still have a sitting leader. Is it good to have your name be openly discussed while there is a sitting leader? Are you from the school of thought that all press is good press? Is it conditional depending on who you are, so to speak? Give me your thoughts on like the top line. Now that you&#39;re named, is that a good thing? Or would you rather not be named, Carter? her yeah</span>

            <span class="text">will rachel notley be upset yeah maybe who cares right she&#39;s going to be the leader for a period of time but she&#39;s not going to be the leader forever so the punishments uh the punishment that she could dish out for the quote-unquote disloyalty that you&#39;re showing by enabling your name to show up um is relatively minimal um if rocky and sarah and uh kathleen have done their jobs properly they&#39;ve probably already had a conversation with her and said you know this is something we&#39;re considering and and uh you know we don&#39;t want to start anything before you give us the go so but just know that we&#39;re thinking about it and thinking about it in this context means making telephone calls and making sure that people are arranged and making sure that you know the the the organizers are aware that you might do it if the opportunity should arise and of course that gets interpreted as definitive right it&#39;s well Well, obviously she&#39;s going because she&#39;s making telephone calls. That is pretty much the standard operating procedure for a leadership. We see this even when the leader isn&#39;t saying that they&#39;re going to leave. We see this in Justin Trudeau&#39;s world. You know, telephone calls are being made. Organizations are being formed, even though there&#39;s no leadership race. And they may not come to be. But right now, it&#39;s fairly, it was always good money that there was going to be a leadership in the Alberta NDP.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you the same question. Can I ask you a derivative of it first? Which is, and I don&#39;t know if this, to be absolutely honest, I don&#39;t know this to be the case, but I like sometimes zooming out and talking about how you approach certain political strategy plays. Let&#39;s say this was the first time your current leader heard about you wanting to do this. What would you do?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Would you? And I guess the other way to look at that is that these rumors are probably known, right, to everyone, the insiders, including Rachel Notley and others. But it&#39;s really like a people management conversation, right? Being like, hey, I&#39;m hearing you&#39;re wanting to leave, potentially, maybe you want to respect that. How do you have that conversation? Even if it isn&#39;t on the back end of this Markasoff article, which I know is a little bit of a stretch to think that that would be the world that someone would be living in on the inside. but it might be the first formal time that you hear someone&#39;s name. How would you have that conversation? Or when you see them in the hall next time, or when you have that next caucus meeting or whatnot? I find these human dynamics to sometimes be the most uncomfortable, but it also shows a real deafness of being able to navigate leadership in a real way.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so it&#39;s super interesting when the leader has signaled that they&#39;re already going to leave, or when everybody expects the leader is going to leave, because there&#39;s almost like what&#39;s expected of you but what&#39;s expected of you and the and the part that each person plays in that conversation is not the real power dynamic anymore so let&#39;s start with what will happen in some way shape or form the leader is going to say either</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">either prompted by them coming forward ideally because that&#39;s that that&#39;s better and it looks better to say hey i&#39;m considering this i just wanted you to know no surprises right i would never do it if you&#39;re here all of the things steven&#39;s saying or</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">or the leader says hey i saw you in the paper we should talk about this there will be a conversation about kind of expectations, what you&#39;re allowed to do, what you&#39;re not allowed to do at the current moment that you&#39;re in, right? So I understand, but I want to be really clear. I haven&#39;t said I&#39;m going yet, and or I haven&#39;t pulled that trigger yet, and or even though you all know I&#39;m leaving, I expect you to act in this way if you&#39;re going to be part of my shadow cabinet and be using the caucus resources. And by the way, I expect caucus resources to be used in this way. And by the way, I expect you not to be leaning on staff to be part of your team. And by the way, And by the way, right? And the rules set out by the leader and perhaps the people around the leader saying, this is how we want you to comport yourselves as leadership candidates.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then the candidate is supposed to say, oh, yes, absolutely, Rachel, for sure. That&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be. Of course, you&#39;re still the leader. Of course, I&#39;m still a good team player. This sounds extremely scripted.</span>

They&#39;re holding a bunch of coasters. They&#39;re only leader in name at this point, right? And they are bluffing with somebody else and saying effectively, don&#39;t act in a way I don&#39;t want you to act. But the minute that there&#39;s this sense that the leader&#39;s gone, the dynamic is different. And people may decide to play it as though it&#39;s more cordial and friendly because that serves their benefit. They want to be seen as a team player. But that&#39;s because it serves their benefit at this point, right? The actual authority of leadership has shifted pretty significantly in these particular moments and things are going to happen. Things the leader said not to happen are going to happen. People who are told not to work on campaigns are going to work on campaigns. Leadership candidates told not to approach people are going to approach people. And that&#39;s the reality from this particular moment forward. And</span>

And so one of the things I&#39;m thinking of, Carter, is it as a sigh of relief being like, okay, I&#39;m out there, I&#39;m named, no reason to hide it, it&#39;s publicly open, let me just do my thing, run even harder.

And what I&#39;m trying to get to is that what I&#39;m really impressed with is that there&#39;s three women candidates wanting to be the next leader of the NDP. But in some ways, for the broadening of the tent, there&#39;s a school of thought that we have actively heard, and I want to test on this podcast, that this race needs other things. It needs an outsider, for example. It needs maybe a man to run, for example. It needs another candidate from Calgary. Are you a believer that in order for a race to be successful holistically, that the field needs to have different characters playing different roles, so to speak, to project something about the party? Or are you a believer that who gives a shit, it&#39;s only what comes out on the other end that matters? Give me your school of thought around this, even for this race, but also more broadly, because I think it&#39;s an interesting sort of examination of story and characters and role uh</span>

And that was classic fighting the last campaign stuff. And so when they simplify to that, they tend to also to go to that next logical step, which is, well, why did we lose last time? And so there&#39;s like the knee jerk, oh, not from Calgary. Boom. boom, all we need is a Calgary. No, well, that&#39;s not true.

And it&#39;s quite possible that you have an NDP candidate who can&#39;t afford to lose five seats in Edmonton that all of a sudden they&#39;re at risk because they&#39;re not like such a stranglehold on the scene, right? I get it, good point. Like, I just think my point is simply this, that oversimplification I think is very dangerous for a party and a party needs to sort of step back and say, what are we looking for in a leader? What are those fundamental leadership qualities we&#39;re looking for? What do we want our party to be? And that does sort of get me to what Stephen was talking about, which is this battle for the heart and soul of the Alberta NDP.</span>

Yeah, I know exactly what you&#39;re trying to say. Which is like Puritan, like federal NDP, copy, paste, that&#39;s one swim lane, right? That&#39;s where we need to go to. Everything that we&#39;ve done to moderate ourselves or bring ourselves to the center under Notley&#39;s leadership, there&#39;s that. Help me define the swim lanes. I&#39;m just giving you one example. Can we work together to define these lanes available? Because I think to Corey&#39;s point, we might be oversimplifying and conflating a few of them as well. And I think one of the conflations I saw in this article, which by the way, is a great article, is that Hoffman is like the back to old school NDP, but also Rachel Notley&#39;s pick. I think those are two separate things that, you know, that the Notley legacy can live on around many candidates. I could argue, one could argue. So Carter, I&#39;m kind of curious if you have a sense of what these distinct swim lanes are, at least ideologically, for the NDP that are available to particular, you don&#39;t even have to assign candidates to each, but let&#39;s start here. And then I promise I will get to these specific individuals we</span>

We are the new Democratic Party that is the old NDP, is what I&#39;m going to call it, just for ease of use. And then I think that the other swimline is the new NDP, right? Like the new, new, new, new, new, new Democratic Party. Because the new, new would be a redefinition in some fashion of what the party actually looks like, how it appeals to people, what it is that we say in some sort of division so we&#39;re not that anymore we&#39;re this and i think that that would be the first question and then what does this look like is</span>

Corey, do you have a few more for me? Because I do want to get into how we kind of subdivide new a bit more, too.

You know, one of my longstanding dreams, and I&#39;ve talked about this publicly, is that there are so many talented folks that the three of us know, in particular, but like the friends that we have also know, and they are part of that group. Like there is a abundance of uniquely talented, interesting people that can fill a variety of functions. And my thought has always been, why does no campaign just go out and grab all of them? Like, you know, if they&#39;re available, why don&#39;t you just like literally create the all-star team, both sides, East, West, International, USA, do it all, put everyone in the same tent? Why the fuck is this not possible? Is that a sign of success? And I&#39;m almost like deviating us from the topic. I know Carter&#39;s got takes on this. And Carter and</span>

And I think there&#39;s such a fascinating conversation we should have at some point around when a campaign says no to certain talent who wants to be slotted at certain – No, but who wants to be slotted at certain places in the campaign hierarchy. Because ultimately, what we&#39;re talking about here is that you may take the smart, young, dedicated, mission-centric person versus the one being like, I&#39;ve worked on 12 NDP campaigns across wherever. I&#39;ve worked on 12 PC campaigns. We all know this person, right? They&#39;re the institutional memory. They&#39;ve got half— It&#39;s actually you now, Zane. Yeah, you&#39;re the guy. Well, yeah.

So this concept of swim lanes that we discussed, it could be one of those swim lanes. It could be left, right. It could be old, young. It could be flashy campaign, not so flashy campaign. But Corey, Carter&#39;s put out opportunities. Add to opportunities. Get me started with risk. And then let&#39;s mold it into the pitch for each of these candidates. Let&#39;s leave on that particular note with each of them.</span>

            <span class="text">yeah look i i mean i think she&#39;s really fucking talented and really affable she also has an opportunity in that she wasn&#39;t part of the ndp government that&#39;s also a risk right she wasn&#39;t there for the 2015 to 2019 time but potentially it&#39;s a good way to frame things uh going forward there um and i&#39;m gonna sound something that might sound shittier than i mean it to the other Another opportunity for her is she clearly could have a better job than this particular job, right? And that&#39;s not always true of a lot of the other candidates that are there. So I think that affords herself some opportunities on kind of the economic, what I will loosely call, for lack of any other phrasing, like kind of economic New Democrat, blue New Democrat is available here. her big risks are two in my opinion you know there&#39;s like two and a half if you want to count the fact that she worked for laurie blake but against her i i don&#39;t and i think you can kind of work around that frankly listen god i was the executive director of the alberta liberal party i have a lot of sympathy for you know how opposition was organized that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">if it becomes a we need a non-edmontonian candidate or we need a Calgary candidate, that&#39;s a risk for her, right? If that becomes how simple the conversation is. I also think the risk for her is that she gets lost and she loses in a get-along club election where everybody is just sort of talking about how great each other are and how we all love each other and we all believe the same things. Because at that point, then all of a sudden you start saying, well, who&#39;s got the experience? Is it Sarah? Not only does she have 15 to present with the NDP, not only was she deputy premier, but she was on the school board, right? Well, was it Kathleen? Kathleen was justice minister. She was there 2015 to 2019. Maybe it&#39;s her turn if you want to do that. And a combination of these risks become</span>

            <span class="text">a problem. So I think in a funny way, she needs the election to be a little bit chippier, because A, that allows her to show how talented she is, right? She can really kind of put the the screws to some people. B, it allows her to define a difference that I think would be useful both with an electorate, you know, locally and more generally. But C, it avoids the get-along club problem. Because if everybody agrees, and if it&#39;s just everybody loves each other, then it becomes who&#39;s next. And she is not the natural who&#39;s next.

This X factor, we talked about it through particular candidates where there is like an attractiveness to their candidacy. You can&#39;t necessarily explain it, but how do you package that up? How do you bottle it? How do you sell it? Carter, you talk about boldness. I think that&#39;s really interesting.

Like I mean, in like a true human level, I don&#39;t mean she&#39;s always always going to agree with you politically or anything like that but seems to truly legitimately care about people in a way that still should matter in politics there so i want to say that i also think that she has an opportunity though that becomes a risk very quickly and that is kind of experience with the use with the ndp you know with her past in the school board all of that</span>

And even this column by Markasoff sort of hints at that and says, you know, it seems like Rachel might prefer somebody like Sarah. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true. I can tell you this, though.

She&#39;s exceptionally well known in the city of Edmonton. and more far more so than than raki or kathleen to this point so her opportunity is just to be the front runner right to be in charge to be the person who&#39;s winning on day one um i know that sometimes front runners get overtaken by the end uh but</span>

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s start with the easy ones that I agree with Stephen on. One is you manage the worry about take back Alberta at the candidate level. You don&#39;t worry about it at the membership level. Because also, these groups are so insular and weird, they&#39;re not even going to, even if they wanted to try to screw with your race, if you have three candidates, all of which are fine, they&#39;re not even going to know which one is good or bad for them electorally, because they&#39;re so mindlessly following one particular ideological path here, right? right? So yeah, maybe a year, maybe it&#39;s three years over the past 10 years. Maybe it&#39;s something that proves that this was a person who was in the NDP for some length of time. Donations count. Find a system to make sure it&#39;s actually somebody who cares about the NDP. But be mindful, especially if you make it, you must have had a membership. There may be some outsiders who won&#39;t hit that threshold.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Because they couldn&#39;t for whatever reasons or whatever, right? So that&#39;s a possibility there. But I do think that there are ways around that and just make really tight approving of candidates where you manage that particular issue. I also think you don&#39;t do points as a bit of a safeguard to that because Take Back Alberta will, especially if it&#39;s like 100 points for everybody instead of like that&#39;s the ceiling,</span>

Point systems will disadvantage Edmonton, almost certainly, because it will probably put a cap as to what an Edmonton vote is. And that is at least the current base of support. So maybe a better way to put that as a point system seems at least to me right now to most obviously disadvantage Sarah Hoffman, because she will only be able to get so many votes out of there. And maybe it might even advantage Kathleen Ganley, because Calgary will have a number of ridings where arguably you would think Kathleen would have a natural advantage. And they&#39;re going to have the same cap as like an Edmonton Millwoods, which will have, you know, a very or Mill Creek will have a very different view, or a number of members. So I</span>
