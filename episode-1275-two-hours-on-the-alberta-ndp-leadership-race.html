Corey, we on this podcast have talked extensively about if Rachel Notley will leave, what that looks like. Carter, we had a great episode where Corey was wrong, I was right around how she should leave, whether it should be a speech or a video. You can pick the winning team, and we know exactly what that is, Carter. It&#39;s a speech. That is incorrect. And Carter, that is wrong once again, but I get it. It&#39;s for sure speech.

We&#39;re going to not talk about Rachel Notley. We&#39;re just going to enter a period right now where we talk about who can potentially take over. Because in this piece that Markosov has put out, there are a few candidates that have emerged within the current NDP caucus. He lays out three particular candidates. We&#39;ll talk about each one of them. He talks about what their pros are, so the pros of their candidacy, so to speak, PROS, I guess, rather than PROSE, just so folks know what I&#39;m talking about. out, what their viability might look like and how they might be angling for the leadership. I want to talk about the dynamics. There&#39;s so much to talk about in terms of right now, even prior to having Rachel Notley announce, is it valuable</div>

            <div class="said">valuable to have her name out in the media? What do each of these camps need to do? How do they need to position themselves? Do they need to position themselves?

Yeah, you asked why this matters, and I said why it matters for us, but let me tell you why it actually matters, which is, building on what Carter said, this has generally been a known but unspoken or often hedged with, if she decides to go, which I suppose we should still do, because Rachel Notley could decide not to go, but it has not been kind of publicly discussed in a way that would drive an article like this. So that matters because it&#39;s one thing for that sort of to be implicit, but the minute it becomes a little more explicit through articles like this, I think it starts to signal the end of something, whether you want it to or not, right? And people start acting differently and people start planning differently. But the other thing I want to throw on the table is now we have a couple of people, three people in particular, who have been explicitly named as candidates in this thing. And that matters too, because now the next time Sarah Hoffman makes a comment about municipal affairs, people are going to be looking at it through the lens of, well, is she saying this as an NDP critic and Rachel Notley&#39;s team, or is she saying this for herself? And it changes how everything is perceived from this moment forward, because we cannot help but think of Racky Serra and Kathleen as leadership candidates now. And that&#39;s just the reality that I think a lot of people have been struggling with. But that circle just got way bigger this weekend, even though it was kind of implied, but not necessarily explicit. Now it&#39;s pretty explicit. It is such an</div>

            <div class="said">an interesting conversation to me, Carter, what Corey&#39;s talking about here, between what the rumor mill churns out, and not even the rumor mill, but like the insiders, so to speak, and I use that term in the loosest fashion, right? The political insiders are the operatives and the activists and what they know, versus what happens when it sees the light of day through a news article or through a wider public domain. And I guess the question I have leads into exactly what Corey&#39;s talking about, Carter, which is now that you&#39;ve got three leading candidates within the Alberta NDP caucus named with Racky Pancholi, Sarah Hoffman, Kathleen Ganley, and like I said, I&#39;ll discuss each one of them. What does this do for them? Is this good for them? Let&#39;s start here. Or is it conditional on if it&#39;s good for them? And let me frame it in a sense, right? I said we don&#39;t want to talk about Rachel Notley, but it is important. And you still have a sitting leader. Is it good to have your name be openly discussed while there is a sitting leader? Are you from the school of thought that all press is good press? Is it conditional depending on who you are, so to speak? Give me your thoughts on like the top line. Now that you&#39;re named, is that a good thing? Or would you rather not be named, Carter? her yeah</div>

That is pretty much the standard operating procedure for a leadership. We see this even when the leader isn&#39;t saying that they&#39;re going to leave. We see this in Justin Trudeau&#39;s world. You know, telephone calls are being made. Organizations are being formed, even though there&#39;s no leadership race. And they may not come to be. But right now, it&#39;s fairly, it was always good money that there was going to be a leadership in the Alberta NDP.</div>

Which is, and I don&#39;t know if this, to be absolutely honest, I don&#39;t know this to be the case, but I like sometimes zooming out and talking about how you approach certain political strategy plays. Let&#39;s say this was the first time your current leader heard about you wanting to do this. What would you do?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Would you? And I guess the other way to look at that is that these rumors are probably known, right, to everyone, the insiders, including Rachel Notley and others. But it&#39;s really like a people management conversation, right? Being like, hey, I&#39;m hearing you&#39;re wanting to leave, potentially, maybe you want to respect that. How do you have that conversation? Even if it isn&#39;t on the back end of this Markasoff article, which I know is a little bit of a stretch to think that that would be the world that someone would be living in on the inside. but it might be the first formal time that you hear someone&#39;s name. How would you have that conversation? Or when you see them in the hall next time, or when you have that next caucus meeting or whatnot? I find these human dynamics to sometimes be the most uncomfortable, but it also shows a real deafness of being able to navigate leadership in a real way.</div>

So I understand, but I want to be really clear. I haven&#39;t said I&#39;m going yet, and or I haven&#39;t pulled that trigger yet, and or even though you all know I&#39;m leaving, I expect you to act in this way if you&#39;re going to be part of my shadow cabinet and be using the caucus resources.

And they are bluffing with somebody else and saying effectively, don&#39;t act in a way I don&#39;t want you to act. But the minute that there&#39;s this sense that the leader&#39;s gone, the dynamic is different. And people may decide to play it as though it&#39;s more cordial and friendly because that serves their benefit. They want to be seen as a team player. But that&#39;s because it serves their benefit at this point, right? The actual authority of leadership has shifted pretty significantly in these particular moments and things are going to happen. Things the leader said not to happen are going to happen. People who are told not to work on campaigns are going to work on campaigns. Leadership candidates told not to approach people are going to approach people. And that&#39;s the reality from this particular moment forward. And</div>

But in some ways, for the broadening of the tent, there&#39;s a school of thought that we have actively heard, and I want to test on this podcast, that this race needs other things. It needs an outsider, for example. It needs maybe a man to run, for example. It needs another candidate from Calgary. Are you a believer that in order for a race to be successful holistically, that the field needs to have different characters playing different roles, so to speak, to project something about the party? Or are you a believer that who gives a shit, it&#39;s only what comes out on the other end that matters? Give me your school of thought around this, even for this race, but also more broadly, because I think it&#39;s an interesting sort of examination of story and characters and role uh</div>

I get it, good point. Like, I just think my point is simply this, that oversimplification I think is very dangerous for a party and a party needs to sort of step back and say, what are we looking for in a leader? What are those fundamental leadership qualities we&#39;re looking for? What do we want our party to be?

Yeah, I know exactly what you&#39;re trying to say. Which is like Puritan, like federal NDP, copy, paste, that&#39;s one swim lane, right? That&#39;s where we need to go to. Everything that we&#39;ve done to moderate ourselves or bring ourselves to the center under Notley&#39;s leadership, there&#39;s that. Help me define the swim lanes. I&#39;m just giving you one example. Can we work together to define these lanes available? Because I think to Corey&#39;s point, we might be oversimplifying and conflating a few of them as well. And I think one of the conflations I saw in this article, which by the way, is a great article, is that Hoffman is like the back to old school NDP, but also Rachel Notley&#39;s pick. I think those are two separate things that, you know, that the Notley legacy can live on around many candidates. I could argue, one could argue. So Carter, I&#39;m kind of curious if you have a sense of what these distinct swim lanes are, at least ideologically, for the NDP that are available to particular, you don&#39;t even have to assign candidates to each, but let&#39;s start here.

Like there is a abundance of uniquely talented, interesting people that can fill a variety of functions. And my thought has always been, why does no campaign just go out and grab all of them? Like, you know, if they&#39;re available, why don&#39;t you just like literally create the all-star team, both sides, East, West, International, USA, do it all, put everyone in the same tent? Why the fuck is this not possible? Is that a sign of success? And I&#39;m almost like deviating us from the topic. I know Carter&#39;s got takes on this. And Carter and</div>

So this concept of swim lanes that we discussed, it could be one of those swim lanes. It could be left, right. It could be old, young. It could be flashy campaign, not so flashy campaign. But Corey, Carter&#39;s put out opportunities. Add to opportunities. Get me started with risk. And then let&#39;s mold it into the pitch for each of these candidates.

And that&#39;s not always true of a lot of the other candidates that are there. So I think that affords herself some opportunities on kind of the economic, what I will loosely call, for lack of any other phrasing, like kind of economic New Democrat, blue New Democrat is available here. her big risks are two in my opinion you know there&#39;s like two and a half if you want to count the fact that she worked for laurie blake but against her i i don&#39;t and i think you can kind of work around that frankly listen god i was the executive director of the alberta liberal party i have a lot of sympathy for you know how opposition was organized that&#39;s</div>

I also think the risk for her is that she gets lost and she loses in a get-along club election where everybody is just sort of talking about how great each other are and how we all love each other and we all believe the same things. Because at that point, then all of a sudden you start saying, well, who&#39;s got the experience? Is it Sarah? Not only does she have 15 to present with the NDP, not only was she deputy premier, but she was on the school board, right? Well, was it Kathleen? Kathleen was justice minister. She was there 2015 to 2019. Maybe it&#39;s her turn if you want to do that. And a combination of these risks become</div>

She can really kind of put the the screws to some people. B, it allows her to define a difference that I think would be useful both with an electorate, you know, locally and more generally. But C, it avoids the get-along club problem. Because if everybody agrees, and if it&#39;s just everybody loves each other, then it becomes who&#39;s next. And she is not the natural who&#39;s next.

You don&#39;t worry about it at the membership level. Because also, these groups are so insular and weird, they&#39;re not even going to, even if they wanted to try to screw with your race, if you have three candidates, all of which are fine, they&#39;re not even going to know which one is good or bad for them electorally, because they&#39;re so mindlessly following one particular ideological path here, right? right? So yeah, maybe a year, maybe it&#39;s three years over the past 10 years. Maybe it&#39;s something that proves that this was a person who was in the NDP for some length of time. Donations count. Find a system to make sure it&#39;s actually somebody who cares about the NDP. But be mindful, especially if you make it, you must have had a membership. There may be some outsiders who won&#39;t hit that threshold.</div>

And they&#39;re going to have the same cap as like an Edmonton Millwoods, which will have, you know, a very or Mill Creek will have a very different view, or a number of members. So I</div>
