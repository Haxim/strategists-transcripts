        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the Liberal plans to introduce a new voting system. How would proportional representation or single transferrable vote impact election outcomes? Who wins if the decision goes to a referendum? And how long will it take the gang to find a way to game the new system? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Was it a single transferable vote? We&#39;ll talk more about that mouthful in a minute, I&#39;m sure. But Trudeau said, I think my preference is towards STV, single transferable vote. But it may be proportional. Who knows? And that was one of the promises that he was elected on. And if you believe that people vote for more than just hair, then you have to sort of say, OK, the liberals did say that was part of their platform. And they didn&#39;t say after a referendum. Actually, they said quite the opposite. No, this is it. This is done. This is the last election. This is going to happen. So now the conservatives are saying, murder,</div>

By the way, when the Socrids got rid of it, there wasn&#39;t any damn referendum about it. They just did it. Now, part of the reason they did it quite crassly was that it was not in their favor to continue. There were a number of seats where they got the most votes on round one, but then lost. And that was a pretty obvious reason why they&#39;d want to deal with that.

It&#39;s like some sort of post that would be in the ground. But bottom line, person who&#39;s got the most votes wins. And it&#39;s a very simple democratic concept. The problem is when you have a majority versus a plurality of votes cast for you. So a large number of MLMPs this year would have had a majority of the votes cast for them, 50% plus one. But</div>

So there is something to be said in a democracy for ideas. I think – is that fair to say? I mean I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an outrageous concept.
