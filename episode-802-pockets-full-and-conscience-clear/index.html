        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan discuss Trump’s channel-changing, Biden’s anti-KXL stance and Canadian government responses to COVID-19. Can Joe Biden run a presidential campaign from an undisclosed basement location? How are Trudeau and Kenney doing on their crisis response? And was Stephen Carter ever relevant? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
