Can I call it the episode? The pull aside that they had, the two leaders were in Bali for an international conference with the G20 Summit, I believe, or in Indonesia, if I&#39;m not mistaken. second. She chatted with Trudeau in Mandarin while a translator was translating about a leaked discussion. It was clear that she looked very upset with Justin Trudeau. And then Trudeau at the end of this 20, 30 second lecture that he was getting said, you know, in Canada, we believe in democracy, a very tense moment, a very, Corey, if I can say novel moment, at least on the international stage. What did you see when you saw that particular clip of those two world leaders, our world leader and Justin Trudeau, and arguably the most powerful world leader, one might argue, outside of the United States, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, in that particular clip?</span>

We don&#39;t govern in the dark. This is a democracy. So when something happens, there is kind of a general expectation that we talk about it. Not always true in matters of statecraft, though. But what we fundamentally saw was a very powerful world leader, a leader of a country of 1.2 billion people, leader of the second largest economy in the world, very intentionally take our prime minister to task for what occurred there. And it was a signal. You know, I think it was as much about future interactions as it was the past interaction. It was saying, this is not something i&#39;m going to put up with um i don&#39;t know what kind of games you&#39;re playing here but those games don&#39;t work for me not</span>

You know, many are saying that this is kind of what Corey has called previous things on this podcast, the Rorschach test, right? Where if you wanted to see a defiant, positive, upstanding, democratic defender in Justin Justin Trudeau, you saw that. Or if you wanted to see a strident dressing down of a prime minister of a country disproportionately smaller than China, you saw that.</span>

And instead of folding under that pressure, the prime minister just looks at him and stares right in his eyes and just takes whatever beating is coming his way and actually pushes back and says and doesn&#39;t accept the criticism. I mean, as much as the right is, you know, making a case to Corey&#39;s earlier point about, you know, this being a Rorschach test, I think it&#39;s actually it&#39;s valuable to see Justin Trudeau standing up for Canada and Canadian principles. I think that it did play. If we lived in any other time except the time right now where everything is political and everything must be interpreted in the left, my team or the other team kind of zeitgeist, I think that this would have been a really positive interaction for Canada. Forget about for Trudeau, forget about for the Liberals. This was a positive interaction for Canada to stand up to a bully. And this bully is someone that we&#39;ve seen bullying across, you know, around the world more and more. So being able to stand up to China, as we stood up to Russia, as we will, you know, stand up against those that try and oppress others, was really good on Trudeau. I thought it was excellent. one.</span>

But Justin Trudeau must have known the camera was on. This is why the segment is about candid camera, right? Xi clearly knew the camera was on, right? One had an agenda and other, to Corey&#39;s point, had to react to that agenda. I think that much is pretty much clear. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s debated. Tell</span>

Is that coached into a leader? Is that taught? Do you exercise that? I&#39;m just trying to think about what&#39;s the teachable strategic skill there. And one of my favorite parts of that video when you watch at the end is not exactly what Trudeau said, but how he walked away, kind of knowing that this was a moment that needed a conclusion and a finality. There&#39;s almost like a theater element to it. And you can almost see, I believe it&#39;s Katie. You can almost kind of see Katie also knowing that the camera is on and looking side by side as the prime minister walks away. Talk to me about what we saw there from the theater aspect, from the improv aspect, from the aspects of political, as Corey calls it, statecraft, but stagecraft in some ways, despite the fact this is not on a stage and a pull aside.

            <span class="text">It&#39;s one of the oldest improv games in the book, and it&#39;s a status game. and the status game is to try and have higher status than the person who&#39;s opposite you in the scene and in the games what you do is you take the status and you try and elevate it or lower it through the course of the of the game so in a true status game you would play it so that uh your status zane and i you and i are in the scene zane your status is going to start off super low is this an actual improv game this is an actual improv game this is definitely something that he has done before.

            <span class="text">So the actual game is to try and make yourself higher or lower status using the physicality and your voice and your eye and your presence so that you are trying to actually change your status through the course of a scene. So the traditional way of doing it is you start as low status, I start as high status. And then by the end of the scene, we will have reversed ourselves. selves you&#39;ll be the high status person and i&#39;ll be the low status person and of course comedy ensues but where that becomes valuable if you&#39;re uh approached with someone who&#39;s who&#39;s who&#39;s trying to bully you or trying to take a high status position is you actually know the physicality of a high status positioning you know to hold i you know to hold uh eye contact to lean in to be taller to be physically you know the stature that was presented to be ramrod straight those are are the types of things that that justin trudeau brought into this either instinctually or arguably from actually playing a status from playing a series of status games as part of his drama dramatic teaching and i will tell you that is something that i could see that</span>

            <span class="text">So the status game is to, or the status idea is to put oneself above the other, right? And to do that, there&#39;s a lot of people who have inherent status. We&#39;ve chatted with a lot of them. There&#39;s a lot of other people who have inherently low status. And it does not matter in terms of leadership. This is not a leadership skill but some people have high status some people have low status and each one can be used to generate outcomes from people that you&#39;re chatting with wait</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right so so you may meet somebody who&#39;s incredibly powerful in real life but they present themselves as low status just to be disarming and people don&#39;t know exactly what to make of them because that person is now low status. And so how am I supposed to treat them? How am I supposed to interact with them? Other people will put on an air, you&#39;ll see this in local politics. You&#39;ll go and meet with a local politician and this person has just been elected as counselor for, I don&#39;t know, Ward 7. And they&#39;re just sitting there and they&#39;re playing with their pencil, trying to show themselves, well, that one, you know, and they&#39;ll talk all all the way through the meeting because they have all the thoughts and all the information. And we&#39;ve seen these people. We&#39;ve met with these people. We know exactly who they are. And they&#39;re just playing a status game with us where they&#39;re trying to show us their high status. Ironically, that high status is then interpreted as low status by us. So both statuses can be used as a leadership or lack of leadership, depending on how they&#39;re utilized. So in my mind, Trudeau used his high status game to elevate himself in the eyes of Xi. And that, to me, was a pretty good use of some theater sports technique.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I just want to get your reflections on that. I mean, Carter clearly seemed to have a treasure trove of information on what I thought was a flyer of a question. But I&#39;m curious to hear your reactions to this. It does check out. You could see even in the physicality of Trudeau and how he leaned in, almost like he knew that he was armed with a response, that quiet confidence. You could kind of see that he knew the camera was on, that this was a moment that could make or break him, or at the very least, he&#39;d have to be neutral on it, that he couldn&#39;t lose this moment. So there&#39;s some of those elements that Carter&#39;s teased out that you could see. But your thoughts to Carter&#39;s sort of positioning here on high status, low status, and in your mind, did Trudeau kind of do a good enough job to neutralize the situation?</span>

Yeah, I would have probably used a metaphor like junkyard dogs. Everybody&#39;s jockeying and trying to show that they&#39;re the person who&#39;s in charge here. They&#39;re the person commanding the situation. And you talk about physicality. Can I just say, like, the one advantage our prime minister absolutely carried into that, above and beyond any improv training, is, like, he is physically much more imposing than</span>

You know, even leaning in almost becomes too much in some contexts, right? Because he&#39;s big, he&#39;s tall. We know that he knows how to throw a punch just based on the way he boxed with Brazeau. He&#39;s not a guy you&#39;re going to be able to physically intimidate. And I think if I was going to offer G</span>

And for the cameras, the prime minister ended up getting the upper hand because the prime minister had that sense of space. He was clearly not intimidated. intimidated. The other thing is, he has been prime minister for seven years. You mentioned off the top, he&#39;s been in his job almost as long as she&#39;s been in his. And that</span>

Have you ever had to strategize for this with a leader around, and maybe even more broadly, how to prepare for when the camera&#39;s always on and how to perhaps, you know, take advantage of that moment when knowing the cameras are on? You know, you can plan stagecraft, and we&#39;ll talk about that in a second with our next segment, in a highly produced way when you&#39;re giving a 20-minute television address, for example. But when it&#39;s a 15 second clip and the camera could be on, how does one prepare their principle? How does one prepare a politician for that? Because we know the world of presentation training. We know the world of delivering to a large room. We&#39;ve talked about how to deliver to a room of 10. We&#39;ve talked about how to be charismatic one on one. But how do you plan? How do you strategize in the unpredictable organic moments that actually might be disproportionately more important to your political career or maybe even more defining to your political career than all that formal training that you have going into it? Talk to me about that a bit, Carter. Well, you practice it just</span>

So you&#39;re at the car, you&#39;re not expecting a question all of a sudden. And the example we always used to use was Charles Rousnel here in Alberta. He&#39;s kind of a interesting</span>

You know, this is a man who&#39;s been in hand-to-hand combat and is harder to intimidate because he actually trained hand-to-hand combat. back.

And I&#39;m looking forward to Quarry&#39;s point of view as one of the people who would have have had to organize these uh as opposed to you know the the view that that i had is just i was uh peripherally involved with the allison redford uh bitumen bubble um experiment that we did uh that&#39;s where the the phrase bitumen bubble uh coined by stephan what was his last name but it was a um uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And the way they deliver that speech is going to affect how those clips come out. It&#39;s going to affect the way that it&#39;s packaged and as a result, the way it&#39;s received. And so the appeal of the State of the Province Address, if you&#39;re the premier of a province, is it&#39;s your opportunity before the throne speech to put it in your words with your spin. in. And you&#39;re also not stuck to this very kind of formal Westminster system where you can&#39;t put anything overly, not even partisan. I mean, political in the small piece and political in the voice of the vice regal representative here. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So having something produced where it is you as the premier telling the story of that session that&#39;s about to come up, the story of the government that you&#39;re going to lead is really nice. It also has another benefit, which is the throne speech is all about the bills that are coming, right? And we used to tie ourselves in knots creating a bill. Like it was just anybody who&#39;s worked in government, this will just, you bring you back sweats of what&#39;s bill one gonna be, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And you would often have, go ahead and go look in your province federally, look at what the first bill is. I guarantee you at least 30% of the time doesn&#39;t even need to be a bill. Could</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a reg, could be a policy of government. It was turned into a bill just to say, this is our first bill. because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because you are locked into only being able to talk about the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the bills. And so the state of the province also gets you out of that box. It allows you to say what you want about what you want. And there&#39;s some real strength to that. So I don&#39;t think the tactic is going away. I think the tactic has already begun to morph. I can tell you the streams of these in my time in government. I led government communications for almost four years between premiers Notley and Kenney.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah so when it&#39;s on ctv and global i assume i haven&#39;t dug into the details here, the government is almost certainly buying like a 10 minute block from each of those at the start of the hour. And then yes, they&#39;ll report on it as news at like the 610 mark and forward from there. But if the government is doing it in a way where it&#39;s entirely their message, entirely pre-recorded, government&#39;s almost certainly paying for that placement. If it&#39;s a situation where it&#39;s a news conference and they have the ability to ask questions of the premier afterwards, words, the government&#39;s probably not paying for it. And so there&#39;s often a bit of a negotiation because I&#39;ve defined two worlds, but there&#39;s often gray in between like, yeah, you can have a couple of questions or yeah, it&#39;s going to look like this, but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but generally speaking, it costs money. So that would be kind of my first point. You can&#39;t afford to do it every week. It is a fairly expensive tactic and it should be used sparingly. But the second point would be, it would not have nearly the impact if you did every week.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And just think about the premier&#39;s radio call-in show that Jason Kenney, and then Daniel Smith was doing. The first couple were news.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, talk to me about how you mold them. So if you&#39;re saying this is the right strategy, what does she need to do to make it the most effective use of the strategy? Give to me her playbook for what this should look like tomorrow evening. Let&#39;s actually remove message from it because I want to save that. But talk to me about the scaffolding around it. How long should it be? Talk to me about how it should be framed. Should there be people around her? Is Is it her just to the province? Are there others in it? How are they making use of companion websites and digital and clips? Like, talk to me about your framework and I&#39;ll get Corey to add or remove from that. And then we&#39;ll get into message what she needs to say. Personally,</span>

It should be no more than 12 to 15 minutes. And it should have a singular style of topic. When people walk away from it, they are talking about a single message. And this is very different than the speech from the throne, where the speech for the throne, as Corey&#39;s alluded to, has this overall, this is what we&#39;re going to legislate. This is the direction that we are going to go in. These are the bills that we&#39;re bringing forward.

That would probably be a throne speech of the past, but it&#39;s an example here. Similarly, I think you can say a lot of different things as long as there&#39;s a theme to them. And so look for Danielle Smith, I think, based on early reporting to have that theme be about affordability. And so if, for example, the Alberta Sovereignty Act comes up, it should be because we&#39;re trying to create the prosperity necessary to do the generous things or like, you know, they&#39;re going to bundle unlike topics together under a theme.

            <span class="text">And you generally want Albertans to have this feeling, not of paid placement, but the premier, to Stephen&#39;s point, interrupted the news because this is important to tell us about the things that need to happen. And I&#39;ve got a lot of sympathy for the communicating part of it. I mean, we are a democracy. I said earlier, we don&#39;t govern in the dark of a democracy. Government does have an obligation to tell you about the things it&#39;s planning to do so you can react to it. I don&#39;t have a big problem with this particular tactic.</span>

This is going to be Danielle Smith, Premier of the province. And there&#39;s a difference in terms of what things activate when she gives it from wearing that hat.</span>

So there&#39;s probably a bit of a brief where you&#39;re told these are the kinds of things I want in the state of the province. They may come with the speech. They may ask you to do a draft. Either way, there&#39;s an exchange of drafts at different points as you start thinking about how it&#39;s going to be built. But fundamentally, and to Stephen&#39;s point about the singular narrative, it&#39;s about a theme. It&#39;s about a story. What I would tell all to anybody making a presentation in any context.</span>

Once you&#39;ve got that, you&#39;ve got the speech. You&#39;ve already got an understanding of the audience. It&#39;s a general population audience, right? You know how they feel about you. You&#39;ve You&#39;ve built your speech. You start then putting on the production elements on top of it. Are there going to be charts that you need? Are there animations that need to occur to illustrate complex concepts? Same as if you were doing a PowerPoint at work, right? What do</span>

There&#39;ll be post-communications after the throne speech. Everything will all be put into a communications arc. It will include digital. It&#39;ll include, and this is really Corey&#39;s area. So Corey, I&#39;m sure is listening to correct me momentarily, but it includes all the various mediums that the government has available to it. And in a perfect world, you&#39;ve also, whatever she&#39;s going to talk about tomorrow, you&#39;ve got third party validators signed up, right? So that was always one of the biggest challenges.

And we took the money that would have gone to CTV and we put that entirely into boosting it through social. So all of a sudden, the state of the province is running on pre-roll for people. We&#39;re promoting it via Facebook. And that&#39;s what I mean when i say that those web channels were growing in importance because that became almost the third leg of the stool from</span>

And generally speaking, on the social channels, you would clip it. You would have the bundles. You would tell single parts of the story. But, yeah, there&#39;s the whole wraparound game that happens here.
