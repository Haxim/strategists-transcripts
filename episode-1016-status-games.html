        <div class="desc"><p>Zain Velji triumphantly returns to preview tomorrow's "State of the Province" in Alberta and pass judgment on Trudeau's exchange with China's Xi Jinping. Meanwhile: Corey Hogan gets the sound board working and Stephen Carter learns how to reboot his computer.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Xi Jinping's tense exchange with Justin Trudeau, "State of the Province" addresses - and the ways politicians assert themselves and their agendas. Can Trudeau credit "drama skills" for his showing in the exchange with China's leader? Are televised addresses from provincial premiers a dying tactic? And is Stephen Carter using dial-up internet his parent's basement? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

She chatted with Trudeau in Mandarin while a translator was translating about a leaked discussion. It was clear that she looked very upset with Justin Trudeau.

But what we fundamentally saw was a very powerful world leader, a leader of a country of 1.2 billion people, leader of the second largest economy in the world, very intentionally take our prime minister to task for what occurred there.

And instead of folding under that pressure, the prime minister just looks at him and stares right in his eyes and just takes whatever beating is coming his way and actually pushes back and says and doesn&#39;t accept the criticism. I mean, as much as the right is, you know, making a case to Corey&#39;s earlier point about, you know, this being a Rorschach test, I think it&#39;s actually it&#39;s valuable to see Justin Trudeau standing up for Canada and Canadian principles. I think that it did play. If we lived in any other time except the time right now where everything is political and everything must be interpreted in the left, my team or the other team kind of zeitgeist, I think that this would have been a really positive interaction for Canada. Forget about for Trudeau, forget about for the Liberals. This was a positive interaction for Canada to stand up to a bully. And this bully is someone that we&#39;ve seen bullying across, you know, around the world more and more. So being able to stand up to China, as we stood up to Russia, as we will, you know, stand up against those that try and oppress others, was really good on Trudeau.

Is that coached into a leader? Is that taught? Do you exercise that? I&#39;m just trying to think about what&#39;s the teachable strategic skill there. And one of my favorite parts of that video when you watch at the end is not exactly what Trudeau said, but how he walked away, kind of knowing that this was a moment that needed a conclusion and a finality. There&#39;s almost like a theater element to it. And you can almost see, I believe it&#39;s Katie. You can almost kind of see Katie also knowing that the camera is on and looking side by side as the prime minister walks away. Talk to me about what we saw there from the theater aspect, from the improv aspect, from the aspects of political, as Corey calls it, statecraft, but stagecraft in some ways, despite the fact this is not on a stage and a pull aside.

And then by the end of the scene, we will have reversed ourselves. selves you&#39;ll be the high status person and i&#39;ll be the low status person and of course comedy ensues but where that becomes valuable if you&#39;re uh approached with someone who&#39;s who&#39;s who&#39;s trying to bully you or trying to take a high status position is you actually know the physicality of a high status positioning you know to hold i you know to hold uh eye contact to lean in to be taller to be physically you know the stature that was presented to be ramrod straight those are are the types of things that that justin trudeau brought into this either instinctually or arguably from actually playing a status from playing a series of status games as part of his drama dramatic teaching and i will tell you that is something that i could see that</div>

We&#39;ve chatted with a lot of them. There&#39;s a lot of other people who have inherently low status. And it does not matter in terms of leadership. This is not a leadership skill but some people have high status some people have low status and each one can be used to generate outcomes from people that you&#39;re chatting with wait</div>

          <div class="said">right so so you may meet somebody who&#39;s incredibly powerful in real life but they present themselves as low status just to be disarming and people don&#39;t know exactly what to make of them because that person is now low status. And so how am I supposed to treat them? How am I supposed to interact with them? Other people will put on an air, you&#39;ll see this in local politics. You&#39;ll go and meet with a local politician and this person has just been elected as counselor for, I don&#39;t know, Ward 7. And they&#39;re just sitting there and they&#39;re playing with their pencil, trying to show themselves, well, that one, you know, and they&#39;ll talk all all the way through the meeting because they have all the thoughts and all the information. And we&#39;ve seen these people. We&#39;ve met with these people. We know exactly who they are. And they&#39;re just playing a status game with us where they&#39;re trying to show us their high status. Ironically, that high status is then interpreted as low status by us. So both statuses can be used as a leadership or lack of leadership, depending on how they&#39;re utilized. So in my mind, Trudeau used his high status game to elevate himself in the eyes of Xi. And that, to me, was a pretty good use of some theater sports technique.</div>

But I&#39;m curious to hear your reactions to this. It does check out. You could see even in the physicality of Trudeau and how he leaned in, almost like he knew that he was armed with a response, that quiet confidence. You could kind of see that he knew the camera was on, that this was a moment that could make or break him, or at the very least, he&#39;d have to be neutral on it, that he couldn&#39;t lose this moment. So there&#39;s some of those elements that Carter&#39;s teased out that you could see. But your thoughts to Carter&#39;s sort of positioning here on high status, low status, and in your mind, did Trudeau kind of do a good enough job to neutralize the situation?</div>

You know, you can plan stagecraft, and we&#39;ll talk about that in a second with our next segment, in a highly produced way when you&#39;re giving a 20-minute television address, for example. But when it&#39;s a 15 second clip and the camera could be on, how does one prepare their principle? How does one prepare a politician for that? Because we know the world of presentation training. We know the world of delivering to a large room. We&#39;ve talked about how to deliver to a room of 10. We&#39;ve talked about how to be charismatic one on one. But how do you plan? How do you strategize in the unpredictable organic moments that actually might be disproportionately more important to your political career or maybe even more defining to your political career than all that formal training that you have going into it?

          <div class="said">yeah so when it&#39;s on ctv and global i assume i haven&#39;t dug into the details here, the government is almost certainly buying like a 10 minute block from each of those at the start of the hour. And then yes, they&#39;ll report on it as news at like the 610 mark and forward from there. But if the government is doing it in a way where it&#39;s entirely their message, entirely pre-recorded, government&#39;s almost certainly paying for that placement. If it&#39;s a situation where it&#39;s a news conference and they have the ability to ask questions of the premier afterwards, words, the government&#39;s probably not paying for it. And so there&#39;s often a bit of a negotiation because I&#39;ve defined two worlds, but there&#39;s often gray in between like, yeah, you can have a couple of questions or yeah, it&#39;s going to look like this, but</div>
