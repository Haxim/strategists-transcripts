And why does Stephen have so little regard for everybody&#39;s time that he&#39;d bother to talk about the Alberta Party? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

Why do people go after political staff? Are you better off staffing an office with less-seasoned locals?

How does the Alberta government extract itself from the Allan inquiry? How might they position this to be a win - or at least not a loss?
