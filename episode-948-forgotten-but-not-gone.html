            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So what ended up happening at the end of the day was that like we almost lost and there was this cardboard cutout of a conservative. And so what we decided to do was that, like, rather than lose, was to win, but just narrowly enough that the cardboard cutout of a conservative looked viable when he really should not have.

You know, she had her own visions and her own ideas and all I needed to do was package them, which which is a lot of fun when you don&#39;t have to have a group of big arguments about policy and which direction to go. She knew where she wanted to go, so all I needed to do was package it into the right framing. God, he&#39;s spinning us already, Corey.</span>

So all of that targeting that we did for Nowhead Nenshi that was super identified and super strong, Richard Einerson, your partner at Northweather, Zane, did all of that targeting. It was amazing the work that he did of finding those digital audiences and making really micro buys that made unbelievable impact. fact, you know, like $25 on an ad or $5 on an ad. And he just pushed all these little buttons and every one of them seemed to work because he&#39;s kind of a, you know, a digital mind freak. None of that worked this time. All of this, when we bought our digital, it was almost like buying radio back in the day. We want to buy females 35 to 55.

            <span class="text">So when we talk about myth, what I mean by myth is that something takes on characteristics larger than the actual campaign or the actual things to support it. So in 2010, Nenshi&#39;s campaign took on a mythical level. 2011, Allison&#39;s campaign took on a mythical level. It was bigger than that which supported it. it and again in 20 2021 um especially in the last 10 days we were supported primarily by myth because we didn&#39;t have the same number of signs out that everybody else had we didn&#39;t have any tv ads we didn&#39;t have any radio ads we didn&#39;t have ads in in like we had digital and you know i think cory you saw a graph of our digital spend that you you retweeted out at one point um our digital spend was off the charts compared to everybody else&#39;s digital spend but in part that&#39;s because because I had to make a strategic decision on which medium to buy because I could not afford to buy three different mediums.

There was a race for mayor in Calgary that Nahid Nenshi ultimately won. And at just this moment over the summer, Kent Hare, the former MP, former MLA here, he was in the race for mayor and he was leading. And Kent&#39;s a good friend of mine. I&#39;ve known Kent for many, many years. And all of a sudden, Nahid Nenshi is in the race. And, you know, at one point, I think the hope was Nahid Nenshi would sort of help out Ken&#39;s campaign. That obviously didn&#39;t happen, right?</span>

We&#39;ve got Kent Hare over here. And this was before Barb Higgins joined the race, which added a whole element, for those of you who remember that and lived through that. It&#39;s like, Kent can win this thing, but he won&#39;t win this thing unless we&#39;re united. And,</span>

And I say, okay, smart guy, talk me through how Nahed Neji wins this thing. And I won&#39;t go blow by blow because I wouldn&#39;t do it justice, but Stephen then sits there for the next 10 minutes and tells me milestones, where they&#39;re going to be. Not total actual percents, but kind of like horse race numbers, you know, directionally where people are going to be. I&#39;ll be in the mix here, like all of a sudden polling in the crowd. And then just before this date, he&#39;ll be second or third. And then the idea is that will propel us going forward. And he just like really spelled it out. Talked about just before Thanksgiving, where it&#39;d be just at the start of the root period where Nahid was going to be, all of this. and i remember leaving thinking god steven is so full of shit um</span>

Has this changed from Redford? Has this changed from any of your other successes or failures in terms of how you&#39;ve scripted this thing? Was it you and the candidate? Was it you? Do you refine it with the team? I&#39;m curious what you did this time. I know you use sounding boards and smart folks around you, but how did this come together as a process? Less so what it was, but as a process? process um</span>

            <span class="text">right and and i was even doing it with you guys all the way through every time we were talking you know i&#39;d call you and say what do you think of this what do you think of that and so i would assemble a team in fact you can see on my wall there&#39;s a well maybe you can&#39;t see but on my wall over here there&#39;s a ton of of stickies and those are all the people that i would call over the course of a month to get their feedback on what i was doing or what i was thinking so i would test each of the elements So I&#39;d call you guys and say, OK, here&#39;s my thinking. It&#39;s going to freeze for the federal election.</span>

            <span class="text">And I would ask smart people to argue with me, smart people to agree with me, whatever it may be. But the actual writing of the strategy, the putting it down on a piece of paper was just me. And then I would just test each of the hypothesis spots. So there are tons of moments in a strategy where you are guessing. right? You are making that educated guess. And the educated guess, for example, is if we launch in February, right,</span>

How do we make sure that we&#39;re not overspending? So we put in unbelievably strict spending controls. No one could spend any money on this campaign over $500 unless</span>

And they could have been available to, you know, I will tell you that as as, you know, and I&#39;ve told you this privately, and I don&#39;t mind saying it publicly. I was one of the folks that came on late to your campaign and not even not even actually physically on your campaign to support your campaign in the 11th hour. And I was one of those people that may have been holding out for what I called a more progressive choice. Right. Because I was like, oh, it could happen with someone else, at least where I mark my ex. You&#39;d always had my support as a friend. But as it related to values, I was looking for other folks. And I felt like there&#39;s There&#39;s a few people in those. But when I canvassed people in my network two weeks before the election, they&#39;d already moved. Like, I was a late mover, right, in that final weekend. Like, I was one of the last people to be like, this is the choice. It&#39;s absolutely clear. This is what we need to do. So it did surprise me how quickly that migration happened, at least with a class of supporters in that arena. Corey, you wanted to jump in, maybe comment on that. Yeah,</span>

One of the things that I kept saying is I feel like the next mayor might come outside of council, right? That council has not been particularly popular in Calgary, if you look at it over the span of the last four years for sure. In the last year, I think fighting with the province, that&#39;s changed a bit of the dynamic there, because certainly the city has been more on side with the people of Calgary than the province has been, right?

            <span class="text">agree. I think the other untapped potential that he had was, you know, Carter, I&#39;ve talked to you about this often on the phone, which was the Olympics, right? The lesson we learned from the Olympics was that was not a left-right coalition. It was a top-bottom. If you were, you know, in the lower socioeconomic brackets of the city, you pretty much told the Olympics to go fuck themselves because you had shit to worry about that was not throwing a party. And we were congratulating ourselves during that campaign being like, look at this, we got like NDPers and like hardcore UC peers in the same room. There&#39;s no way this thing doesn&#39;t win. And I think it kind of showcased that there was a huge class divide. And that was something I expected Farkas to tap into extensively and often, especially considering, frankly, where he&#39;s come from geographically and the background. Like, I thought that was totally untapped potential, especially considering you&#39;re a candidate. Yes, well, a South Asian woman doesn&#39;t have the lived experience of perhaps someone from East Calgary, a very different sort of immigration and sort of educational trajectory in terms of that relatability. That was one element that honestly surprised me, even does now, that that was not a core part of the strategy. It</span>

Again, just the fact that, you know, I don&#39;t think that there was a branding document on the other side the way there was a branding document on our side.

But to me, that was a harbinger of power, money, optics, old boys club control. It&#39;s fascinating to me, because as much as Davison had them in his corner, and you knew that by that point, because he was in the race, it&#39;s not like you guys kind of said, fuck you to these people and moved on. So I&#39;m kind of curious, I just thought I wanted to throw that in the mix, kind of as Corey&#39;s comments about, you know, old school power in Calgary, where it stands, maybe throwing this sort of example to you as well from our conversations.
