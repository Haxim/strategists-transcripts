Did the takes improve? Maybe. Did they change? Probably. Do we have sound effects? Yes.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter follow up a morning media appearance by doing it all again, but better - discussing the Conservative Party debate and oddsmaking Jason Kenney's chances of surviving his leadership review next week. Was the "sad trombone" the best innovation since the Saturn V rocket? Do more signs point to Kenney winning or losing on the 18th? And how long until we can lose 36% of our money to crypto volatility directly from our nearest ATM machine? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We want a reflection of us to be our elected representative. Now, we could argue about whether that makes sense or not. I personally think it&#39;s ridiculous. You know, you want someone who is capable, not someone who is like us. You know, a lot of people aren&#39;t capable to be politicians. That&#39;s not an affront. That just is, it is just a different skill set.

A normal thing that you would do is if something was bad, you would try and do something different to avoid that in the future. And they chose things that made it worse. And that&#39;s where I think they&#39;re going to, you know, that was the suffering. If there&#39;s nothing between looking that bad and on both sides of this, right, if there&#39;s nothing in between it, then it&#39;s really going to be a hard thing to make the Conservative Party the vehicle that needs to achieve the next government, which we&#39;ve long held. held.
