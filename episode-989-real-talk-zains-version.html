We want a reflection of us to be our elected representative. Now, we could argue about whether that makes sense or not. I personally think it&#39;s ridiculous. You know, you want someone who is capable, not someone who is like us. You know, a lot of people aren&#39;t capable to be politicians. That&#39;s not an affront. That just is, it is just a different skill set. I&#39;m not capable of being a neurosurgeon. uh cory is of course i mean there&#39;s never been anything uh the man has failed at but everything else everybody else has things that they can&#39;t do but</span>

And think even broader than beyond the stage in some ways. I think losers as in the conservative party, did they need to make a better case for themselves as a collective? The viewing public, I don&#39;t mean to get into philosophizing too much about democracy and the politics of grievance that we saw in that stage with at least a few candidates, but who were the ultimate losers of something like what folks watched earlier this week?

            <span class="text">the one-two punch of the last two of the two debates was the Conservative Party of Canada, because the Conservative Party of Canada watched themselves kind of get ripped open and laid bare as the multiple kind of arms of the conservative movement that they actually are. They aren&#39;t a singular party. They represent all these different factions. And that was shown in the first debate. And in the second debate, they tried to mitigate that. A normal thing that you would do is if something was bad, you would try and do something different to avoid that in the future. And they chose things that made it worse. And that&#39;s where I think they&#39;re going to, you know, that was the suffering. If there&#39;s nothing between looking that bad and on both sides of this, right, if there&#39;s nothing in between it, then it&#39;s really going to be a hard thing to make the Conservative Party the vehicle that needs to achieve the next government, which we&#39;ve long held. held.

But certainly when you see numbers like 3,000 votes coming from Fort McMurray, where Brian Jean is the MLA, that&#39;s a reason to think that&#39;s 3,000 votes you probably don&#39;t have if you&#39;re Jason Kenney.</span>
