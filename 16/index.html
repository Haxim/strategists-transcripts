        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are subjected to a conversation on Trudeau&#39;s Governor General pick before turning to the 99% non-confidence vote teachers gave in Alberta&#39;s Minister of Education and getting into a fiery debate on the use of international consultants. Is there something wrong with hiring outside political talent? How can teachers build on their 99% vote? And if we have a fall election, can we expect a table full of dead cats this Thanksgiving? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. &lt;a href=&#34;https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</div>

What will it mean to federal politics if Quebec just declares itself a nation, constitutionally? Is tying Covid reopening to vaccines a good idea?
