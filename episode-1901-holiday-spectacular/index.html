Stephen Carter, Shannon Phillips, and Annalise Klingbeil try to make sense of the last year in politics.

It just You&#39;re sat there on the shelf, dusty, forgotten. And more importantly, you. Look at you. Your blood pressure, it&#39;s great. It&#39;s resting at a cool 110 over 70, I imagine. You haven&#39;t clenched your jaw in a while reading a post-media op-ed in six months. And your wallet, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s bursting. Your oil sand stocks are probably doing so well. You&#39;re welcome. Probably also doing fine with those tariffs. And wait, is that you by a fire? You look rested. Probably saying to yourself, wow, things are great before the water wars start. What a lovely, stress-free life you lead. It&#39;d be a shame if it really, you know, set in. So grab your kids, grab your lukewarm, inflation-adjusted, no-name eggnog, and grab whatever hope you briefly felt when Mark Carney rolled up his sleeves, and now burn it all. Because it&#39;s time for the Better Late Than Never Strategist Holiday Spectacular, brought to you by Flair Airlines. And welcome, Shannon Phillips, Annalise Klingbeil, and Stephen Carter.

So we forgot about the concept of floor crossing. But as soon as that stupid agreement was gone, what happened? We got back to the business of being a parliament. and it has already undermined Mr. Pugliavera&#39;s brittle leadership. This is fantastic. I want to see more of it. So much so that I hope somebody recreates Winston Churchill&#39;s famous quote, which is, you know, what was it? Anyone can rat, but it takes a special genius to rat twice because he, in fact, crossed the floor two times there and back. and so this is a long-standing tradition we we elect individuals not parties not leaders more of this please and I&#39;m so glad to see it back very</div>
