            <span class="text">Yeah, much earlier this year, and CBC reporting about it, I believe, this weekend, over the course of this weekend, which I think opens up a pathway for us to dovetail on Carter&#39;s commentary here to talk about campaign debriefs, their effectiveness, their usefulness, their purpose, when they&#39;re best done. But before I jump into that, I&#39;m actually going to stick with Carter for a second, Corey, if that&#39;s okay with you. Carter, you know, you are giving us some really raw reflections here. And I can&#39;t help but notice that this, I shouldn&#39;t say in contrast, but that the document produced by the NDP was a very methodical process. They kind of have an interview list of where they went, how they went. You know, they probably took some time over the course of the summer, over the course of the year, one would imagine, to kind of interview these people.</span>

            <span class="text">Give me your philosophy on how you&#39;re going to do the campaign debrief for your candidate and for your campaign in Surrey. Are you going to do an extremely methodical or are you going to be like the, you know, perhaps are you a subscriber to the viewpoint that the best insights are gleaned immediately? And let&#39;s document those right away in terms of Corey&#39;s point. What&#39;s going to be the teacher, the longitudinal methodological deep dive or like put it all on paper right now? Who cares if it&#39;s exactly perfect because that&#39;s the real teacher. I&#39;m kind of curious from your perspective, now that you&#39;re living kind of the moment that I want to examine in greater detail with the NDP.</span>

It&#39;s super duper hard, especially after a loss, to look internally and say, OK, where were the decision points and what decisions did we make? And you&#39;ll have to kind of go back and actually read through your notes and make sure you understand it. But you can&#39;t wait a long time. You know, this for me, I&#39;m flying home tomorrow. I&#39;ll have my notes of what we did wrong by the end of that flight. Because I&#39;m going to go back through my notebook and make sure that I understand where we made the big decisions. I already mentioned one, right? The big decision of when we launched. That&#39;s actually a conversation point in this NDP document.</span>

And I&#39;ll ask both of you about this, because let&#39;s get nerdy for a second. And I frankly think we can, because, I mean, we&#39;re not like other Canadian political podcasts. We do deep dive on the campaign side of it. Carter, you mentioned notes. Can I ask you, do you journal during a campaign? Like, Do you document key moments? Do you write down key reflections either on your phone, on paper? Because the entire thing can be such a blur. And even looking back on it in terms of just, in my case where I&#39;ve worked on campaigns where I&#39;m actually pushing out either products for advertising, you just produce so much you kind of forget about it. So even to look back on what you&#39;ve done or the decisions that you made, do you kind of in the moment in the campaign, uh, make note of that for, for kind of professional development, if I can call it as such?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, you know, Carter mentions a couple of things that are interesting, and I&#39;ll bring them up in conversation later, especially around the relationships and the people that you get from the campaign, win or lose. You can really run a campaign, Corey, in a sense of it could be for the binary outcome of win or lose, or it could be for maybe creating an ecosystem of people that you get to work with again or see again, or maybe give them the spark of what a campaign could look like and they go on doing their own thing. But I&#39;ll pose the same question to you around documentation. Campaigns can be a blur, especially when you have so much to do, so many competing demands. And I think there&#39;s also, and maybe I&#39;m getting too romantic here, but you don&#39;t know how long you get to play in the big leagues, so to speak, right? And so there&#39;s some elements of kind of writing it down, documenting it, and perhaps noting how special some of these campaigns and moments are. Corey, what have you done in the past in terms of documenting campaigns and whether it be for personal reflection or professional development.</span>

The NDP put out their 2021 campaign debrief. They silently put it up online earlier this year, I should say. It was reported on this week by the CBC. This report, a 20-page PDF, breaks down the campaign on many different fronts, including operations, products, which is what I guess they call the materials produced, digital, media. media. I&#39;m just going through a few other ones here that they have, what we heard, summary of debrief process. So they actually talked about the process itself.</span>

Number two, this is my analysis that&#39;s layered on top of it. And then the third section is, and so I&#39;ve come to these conclusions. And then when you talk with somebody, you say, okay, do you think my facts are wrong? Do you think my analysis is wrong? Or do you think something&#39;s missing?</span>

            <span class="text">Here&#39;s the thing. I think that it&#39;s way more important to talk to people who know what the hell they&#39;re talking about than to talk to less engaged, less informed people. And I think that the problem of engagement, and this is the problem on virtually every campaign, you go down from the top level professionals all the way down to the volunteers. And there are some excellent volunteers. There are some fantastic volunteers.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But more often than not, we should have them door knocking or manning the phones. A lot of volunteers don&#39;t understand the the principles of politics, the way that we&#39;d want them to understand the principles of politics. And as a result, going back and just simply going and talking to each of them, you know, every time I do a campaign debrief, or every time I talk to campaigners, the first thing they say is, we should really engage the youth vote. This is the campaign where we should engage the youth vote. You know how useless that is to engage the youth vote? The youth vote hasn&#39;t ever been engaged. You can go back to the silent generation. When they were young, they weren&#39;t voting either. This idea that we&#39;re going to somehow change human nature and make people care about something that they simply don&#39;t care about is the problem when you&#39;re talking to the less engaged audience.</span>

The idea that you&#39;re going to talk to people about, you know, within the party about how policies landed is absurd. Talk about like the machinery, talk about the feedback, talk about the mechanisms through which the party runs its work. But at the end of the day, you are not like the average voter. You are not a swing voter. You&#39;re a hard-carrying member of a political party who&#39;s running a campaign or running a riding association. You are so different from what is actually the reality on the ground for most voters that your advice is not just useless, it&#39;s counterproductive. because</span>

It&#39;s almost like these parties have been started out of thin air because they&#39;re maybe not exactly political parties. They&#39;re just kind of brand templates. plates. Talk to me about your experience with kind of Surrey Forward. Is that a new brand there in a sense and how it was slapped together? I shouldn&#39;t say slapped together. That sounds so disparaging and it&#39;s not meant to be, but it&#39;s almost a compliment in the sense that they&#39;re upstarts in many ways that can kind of become incumbents very quickly as we&#39;re seeing in Vancouver.</span>
