            <span class="text">But the budget&#39;s going to have a couple of thrusts to it. One of the thrusts, and this is going to be something that the government is pushing, is the issues associated with the budget. What are the things that we are trying to solve, right? Right. So last budget, we had some issues around dental care. We had some health care issues. There&#39;s been a big deal with the provinces about, you know, additional funding for health care. All of that&#39;s going to show</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">show up in the budget. There&#39;ll be some through lines about what does it mean to be Canadian? Those things will be kind of there&#39;ll be kind of issue focused budget discussion points. Right. That will be what the budget is designed to do. And you&#39;ve prepared many budgets. You&#39;ve done multiple budget communication structures. I have.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And I would argue that most of the time when you have done those budget discussions, from the point of view of the government, you&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re talking about the issues that it is designed to address. It is designed to fix certain problems within our society. And this budget will solve those problems. Am I correct in putting those words in your mouth?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we&#39;ve talked about this in the past, but budgets are really powerful tools for that because, spoiler alert, that&#39;s where the money comes from. And money is used to solve a lot of these problems.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Right. And so the money is used to solve problems. And that is what the government wants to be talking about tomorrow and the days after. As you&#39;ve made an elegant case for before, these budgets don&#39;t just live in a single day. They&#39;re designed to carry a communications arc. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s what this budget&#39;s going to do is it&#39;s going to be trying to carry a communications arc into the future. But I would argue that the opposition don&#39;t really want it to be an issue versus issue discussion point. What they want to have is they want to have a process discussion point. They want to undermine the actual issues that are being discussed and focus on things that aren&#39;t the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, they got, so two things I&#39;ve noted that have been teased out in advance of the budget. There&#39;s been a few more than that, I&#39;m sure. But one of them is the idea that they&#39;re going to spend less on consultants, clearly a reaction to the McKinsey conversations that have been going on, right? And the other is that they are going to make money available for lower income Canadians for groceries to make that more affordable. Now, listen, we can talk about the policies of both of those. We don&#39;t have all of the details. I actually have pretty strong opinions about both of them. And I think in both cases, I&#39;m not wild about what the government&#39;s proposing. But they are clearly trying to knock off issues, right? Issues they see in front of them and they&#39;re trying to deal with it. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And those issues are things that they think they can win on. Right. So they&#39;re going after poverty and families. They&#39;re going after, you know, these issues are things that they feel they can chip away at.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And they, you know, the issue of McKinsey and the consulting companies getting too much money.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Easy, easy. We&#39;ll solve the issue simply by not giving them any more money. Look at us seeing an issue and addressing that issue. That becomes their primary thrust on their communications pieces. And I would challenge our listeners as they&#39;re watching the budget unfold in the next couple of days, can they see those issue thrusts coming from the government, right? What issue, you know, here&#39;s the issue, here&#39;s how we&#39;re trying to solve it. And it becomes almost that formulaic style of communications. We issue solution, issue</span>

            <span class="text">so you&#39;re the opposition however and you don&#39;t you don&#39;t want to talk about how they&#39;ve solved an issue you want to talk about the process you want to talk about how the government ended up there in the first place and these two examples are actually kind of perfect because why do we need to deal with consultant fees because they&#39;ve let them get out of hand why do we need to deal with the high cost of groceries because this is a government that has made it absolutely unaffordable um thanks to just inflation or whatever the kind of commentary is there and so you&#39;re wrapping this in a bigger process story along the way about how the government made the decisions they did and what that says about government well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well and you wrap it in as big as big a bow as you possibly can so you&#39;re now saying we would not even have had to address this issue if we were in government because we would never have allowed the inflation to to take hold and to get this deep and it&#39;s because the the the trudeau government hasn&#39;t had the inflationary you know processes in place to stop this inflation that we have to see such extreme measures from this government of the day they are literally using your money to buy back uh your goodwill right so the process becomes the center part of the actual discussion instead of the uh issues that they&#39;re trying to solve in part if you you know in part because you can&#39;t win you can&#39;t say well we wouldn&#39;t give that money to poor people right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right that would be the so So you&#39;re backing it up to the process and you&#39;re saying, well, how did we even end up here in the first place?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Right. So you don&#39;t want to go to the process or you don&#39;t want to go to the issue and say we would never do that. Right. Instead, it&#39;s we wouldn&#39;t have had to do that because the process that the liberals have used is so fucked up. And that&#39;s why, you know, the liberal government is buying it back with your own money, whatever language they choose to use. Now they&#39;re using process oriented language and that becomes the budget communication cycle for them. so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">using the word issue and i probably shouldn&#39;t i should probably be using the word communication strategy right this is an issue communication strategy for the government it is a process communication strategy for the opposition two different sides you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? They take issue with the fact that they&#39;re spending money on this issue, right? Or on this particular thing, but the more powerful ones I would propose are going to be the issue or are going to be the pro the process ones. So that&#39;s what I wanted to kind of, that&#39;s why I wanted to break this down a little bit today, because I thought that that was a good example that will show two different arcs right off the bat that That we&#39;ll be showing a different structure and a different strategy for communications around a budget.</span>

So when we&#39;re talking about process, that process can be understood at a very simple level where people will be like, yeah, I don&#39;t really understand that, but I know that it&#39;s bad, right? Right. Whereas the issue, you feel like you need to actually understand it on a different level for it to actually have the same meaning.
