So, Carter, for the longest time, even when we did this episode, I think it was 539, when we initially threw in these magic pills. if you could take one of them, which one would you take? And you were confident that the conservatives, the best thing they had going for them, even outside a leader, was strategy. They were solid on their strategy. They didn&#39;t need to change it. Yet it became their failing today. Explain that to me. How does that happen within a campaign? How do you have the strategic edge for a decade and lose it in the red period?
