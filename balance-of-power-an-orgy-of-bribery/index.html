        <p><strong>The Strategists Media Corporation, in association with The Strategists Podcast Network, presents </strong><em><strong>Balance of Power,</strong></em><strong> a new series offering a fresh lens on the forces shaping Canada’s future.</strong></p><p>Is Alberta separation gaining ground, and can it be stopped?</p><p>In the debut episode of <em>Balance of Power</em>, Annalise Klingbeil, Leah Ward and Shannon Phillips unpack new polling showing 29% of Albertans would vote to leave Canada, and why that number could shift quickly in a referendum. They debate the messaging war behind separatism, the silence from business leaders, and what a Brexit-style shock could mean for the province.</p><p>Plus: what an Edmonton community league on the brink of closure reveals about volunteer burnout, third spaces, and the state of democratic participation.</p><p>And finally, Mark Carney’s new national auto strategy — billions in public money, shifting EV rules, and a fundamental question: if companies want to sell cars in Canada, should they be required to build them here?</p><p>Welcome to <em>Balance of Power</em>.</p><p></p>

We can&#39;t launch a political podcast this week featuring three people who have worked in politics here in Alberta without talking about separation. There&#39;s so many angles to this one. Frankly, it feels like it&#39;s been in the news too much, which is part of what I want to discuss. There was new polling yesterday, on Monday, from Angus Reid showing two-thirds of Albertans surveyed would vote to stay in Canada or would lean that way. And approximately 29% of Albertans say they would vote for Alberta to leave Canada if there were a referendum today. Most in that group, 21%, say they are leaning that way rather than definite in their choice, which was 8%.</div>

          <div class="said">also part of the conversation we can put on the table is that recently a coalition of seven first nations chiefs gathered at a press conference in edmonton to speak about separation and to ask albertans to stand with them and oppose a petition that could lead alberta to become the 51st state the message was clear alberta is treaty land first and foremost and any separation talk that ignores that is</div>
