            <span class="text">That might be true. True. It&#39;s irrelevant. The important thing to keep in mind here is that federally, at least, it&#39;s known as oral questions because you do have the ability to send written questions to government as well. But over time, particularly when they put cameras into these chambers, whether it&#39;s federal or provincial, people decided that it was much more dramatic, especially because the press was right there to be able to discuss these things and get on the six o&#39;clock news. right and so over time what question period devolved into is sound bites of people saying when will the minister x x being an accusation and then a clip of the minister responding with when will the leader of the opposition stop being so outrageous about this the government is doing all of these fine things so it&#39;s become bullshit theater it&#39;s no longer about questions or answers it&#39;s theatrics it&#39;s like it&#39;s twitter before twitter was twitter right and so um</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, it does make sense. And when you&#39;re in the soup on something, you do try and get out of it. I mean, Rachel Notley and Brian Mason were excellent at it. There was a two-person caucus prior to the election. So for 2011, 2012, when I was there and they hit us every single day on children&#39;s services every single day and there was absolutely nothing that the government could do. First of all, children&#39;s services is nearly impossible to fix. It goes into all kinds of issues that are much, much larger than just the specifics of each individual child that is really, really difficult. I&#39;ll tell you, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been fixed under the UCP, the NDP, or the PCs. But they just beat the crap out of us. So every day we knew that the official opposition, which I think was the Wild Rose at the time, was going to whiff. But Brian and Rachel would just kick the shit out of us on every single day. day. And they were the ones I actually worried about because they had a consistent question period thread that went through a whole session. And every single day, we were absolutely unable to address the question or shift off of it. And the Wild Rose just let them own the whole thing. It was just brutal.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I got a lot of feelings about how QP prep went in that context. And QP prep in a party that is not necessarily firing on all cylinders is more painful than QP prep generally, because what happens is people tend to hoard questions. They don&#39;t want to give them to the leaders. It&#39;s all about their agenda. They&#39;re not trying to tell a story. because what political parties generally try to do, and this is one of those things that almost, again, doesn&#39;t make sense again, but it&#39;s like, what&#39;s our narrative? How are we going to hit them regularly? We&#39;re going to do our first three questions on this. We&#39;re going to drive this agenda.</span>

            <span class="text">go away in different directions, even though the media is not caring about it, It has this ability to impose discipline on a party, right? Because it is a time to say, here we are all sitting in a room before QP, and we&#39;re all agreeing this is the thing that matters today. And so when we go and do our other bullshit that&#39;s outside of the QP bullshit, we&#39;re</span>

And that, I think the most frustrating part was the absolute lack of preparation that the ministers came in with. They were for the most part, completely ill prepared by their own staffs. And then the second piece was how challenged it was to actually give them, you know, a response that, that I can&#39;t remember how long it was supposed to be 30 seconds or something like like that or or a minute and give them a response that actually answered something vaguely resembling the question without looking like a total dick and</span>
