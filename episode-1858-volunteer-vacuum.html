            <span class="text">just gonna be you and i today um for a friday morning podcast there&#39;s so many directions we can go like there are like 50 different directions and i&#39;m not saying other people have mowed the lawn already so let&#39;s not go there. And I do like to periodically check in with you in particular about if you were there right now, what would you be doing to the pivot for Jagmeet and Pierre? So maybe let me start there because I want to see if you&#39;ve got any fresh ideas. And if the answer is no, I&#39;ll move on to something else. But I don&#39;t want to get into the story of the day. The polling is rather stable right now. Pierre&#39;s rallies are huge and getting huger. They&#39;re more impressive. They&#39;re very Very interesting. They&#39;re like rock concerts now. So there is that particular sort of response</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">response rebuttal that peers got to the polls. I think that&#39;s an interesting dynamic. Candidates are being dropped left and right across, you know, ridings in this country. So there&#39;s that storyline. line but i kind of want to put most of those things aside unless they particularly interest you start you with two questions on any moves you got carter for the conservatives and the ndp right now and then if not let&#39;s talk about um let&#39;s talk about polling and data in this uh in this particular patreon okay</span>

No, I agree with that in the sense that like, but, but the central focus on while the back and forth goes on and you take a hit, we&#39;re going to be the party that is there for you. And I think that as the worker, social support party, literally like the simple message is we care about the social supports in this ongoing back and forth, both domestically and internationally. Are you saying that simple message?</span>

We&#39;re going to make sure that we&#39;re there again at that table. Imagine if that had happened. It was a lot of their message going into this campaign. And I feel like they should own that. We&#39;re the party of being able to unearth and put together social supports. Now, I also see my own logical holes here in the sense that long term, Could this invalidate the party as ever touching a economic election ever again or invalidating them from from touching the economy? There&#39;s a good point there. Could they lose? But there&#39;s something to be said about like this move for the moment and the and the honesty of what the NDP are to many people, which is a useful piece of the Canadian.

And I think their final gasp, even if it doesn&#39;t land, needs to be, we are different. We are indeed different. It&#39;s one-on-one value proposition stuff, which is one of the other reasons I would argue that they do a big swing.
