            <span class="text">on this show, just to add a bit more context before I let you answer, that we&#39;ve maybe entered an era where there isn&#39;t a singular ballot box question, that there isn&#39;t one issue driving Canadians. So if that&#39;s the case, how do you think about where we find ourselves right now? And then let&#39;s get into specifics of this campaign and how the Liberals and Conservatives should be dealing with the one and the 1A, which has been a nuanced and oftentimes interchangeable dance?</span>

            <span class="text">So if someone else has framed the ballot box question, you know, like it is going to be about Donald Trump and the tariffs, which is Mark Carney&#39;s question, then it is very difficult to imagine that Pierre Polyev is going to sweep in and suddenly redefine the ballot box question question to suit himself, to suit his party. That is highly unlikely to happen. So instead of having a singular ballot box question, he needs to have another ballot box question, and he has to switch people over to it. So in 2012, Alison Redford, the ballot box question is, do we want to change? That is the Wild Roses ballot box question, and Danielle Smith. We changed it over to, do you want to elect those bigots and our ballot box question wound up holding the day and it was only framed about eight days before the election so yes there is the opportunity to frame late a ballot box question but you have to frame that to be your own question you can&#39;t there is very little chance i think that pierre poliev is going to go in take over the ballot box question of Donald Trump and the tariffs. He needs to develop some sort of new ballot box question, and cost of living could be it. I&#39;m not convinced that it is, but who</span>

            <span class="text">Well, Carter, can we re-examine the fundamental point you put out there? Trump is a losing question for Pierre. Does it have to be a losing question for Pierre? I get wrapping yourself up in the Canada flag is, right? And maybe that&#39;s a subset of the Trump question. But does Trump have to be a losing proposition for Pierre? Like, there are elements in the very recent past, prior to the Carney wave and the Trump tariffs, the particular element of Trump that maybe have shot Carney up in bull, where Pierre&#39;s qualities were considered to be advantageous to dealing with Trump. So I want to just question the premise, because do you feel like Trump has to be the loser loser for Pierre here? Or do you think we&#39;re perhaps skipping a beat?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I&#39;m pretty old fashioned about this. I think if you&#39;re talking about the other person&#39;s question, you&#39;re talking in their message frame, right? And that, that message frame is something that you don&#39;t want to be involved in. Now, there can be a time when someone&#39;s chosen a losing ballot box question, right? Where, where, you know, Jagmeet Singh, for example, every question he&#39;s ever asked has been wrong. So, you know, there&#39;s losing frames. But I don&#39;t think that this is a losing frame for Mark Carney. And therefore, I just don&#39;t think that Pierre Polyev can work on that frame.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, figure out how it could be.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think part of it is just how their base is divided. You know, there&#39;s this idea when you look at polls that one in five conservatives are actually willing to join the United States, let alone have sympathies to Donald Trump&#39;s views, which is an even higher percentage. And so that&#39;s a challenge he has. That means if he goes too far, he&#39;s going to be dealing with a bit of an internal war. Or as soon as I&#39;d say safely 30% of your base feels so strongly different from the other, you&#39;ve got a big fucking problem on your hands because that&#39;s a large enough group that it&#39;s not going to feel like the minority. They&#39;re going to feel like they&#39;re in the majority and they&#39;re going to say, what is the leader doing? Why are they so offside with me? So I get his challenge and I get why he&#39;s tried to avoid finding the conservative answer to Donald Trump and instead say, let&#39;s find the thing that unites all of us as conservatives, which is affordability. But I fundamentally reject that even if prices go up, people are going to say now it&#39;s about affordability. I understand they&#39;re selfish, but they&#39;re going to say it&#39;s not affordable because of Donald Trump. And they&#39;re going to say, what</span>

He&#39;s got to find something as existential as Donald Trump threatening to conquer our nation through economic force in order to sustain a different ballot question. And I don&#39;t know how you do that. I honestly don&#39;t. I think</span>

One is that you&#39;re not playing on the question that the majority of Canadians care about right now, which is Trump. And Carter, you&#39;ve refuted that.

Who&#39;s your political enemy right now if you&#39;re Pierre Polyev in this election? And you could get twisted and pretzely about this and, you know, come out the other end being like, I don&#39;t know. Or you could play it straight and be like, of course, it&#39;s Mark Carney. But where are you at with this?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, at the end of the day, you&#39;ve got to be ahead of Mark Carney. So that&#39;s the fundamental answer. But it doesn&#39;t need to mean that&#39;s how you play it in terms of your advertising, in terms of your commentary, in terms of how you talk about things. And I actually think Trump could be a fine enemy for the conservatives if they were willing to do that. It doesn&#39;t seem like they&#39;re willing or able to do that. And I talked about this last time on the Patreon episode, but I find it really, really interesting and a bit transparent how they want us to project all of our bad feelings about Justin Trudeau onto Mark Carney and act as though that makes any sense. And I think that that&#39;s going to be a problem for them because there&#39;s going to be enough people who say, well, hold on, I&#39;m not so sure I&#39;m buying it. They haven&#39;t drank the Kool-Aid so strongly. They haven&#39;t gotten onto that bandwagon so vigorously. It&#39;s going to be a tough sell. sell.</span>

And there are ways you could do it as a conservative that probably would be somewhat appealing to Canadians. I think the best one is actually talking about a strong Canada, which is why it&#39;s so interesting that the Liberals took the slogan Canada Strong. I mean, in some ways, it&#39;s fine. I wouldn&#39;t call it great, except for the fact that it might be great because it boxes out the conservatives, right now they feel like they can&#39;t talk about a strong canada and canada strong also implies you&#39;re going to be strong in a canadian way which goes back to how the liberals perceive themselves and how i believe canadians perceive have</span>

            <span class="text">as I liked It&#39;s Time to Build and as much as that&#39;s what I&#39;m personally looking for in a government. So yeah, it really speaks to me in that sense. The idea of Canada Strong, It&#39;s Time to Build is not inherently about defending Canada. Canada Strong is. And if we&#39;re going to take our own advice about ballot box question, that&#39;s a much cleaner connection to the ballot box question. because in a way it elevates it and it makes it harder for Pierre Polyev to just then go and say here&#39;s my alternative position to make Canada strong like think about it if you&#39;re saying it&#39;s time to build what you&#39;re implicitly saying as Mark Carney is I&#39;m going to make Canada strong through building and then you&#39;re going to be fighting with Pierre Polyev saying I&#39;m going to make Canada strong through lower taxes but you&#39;ve just come in and said I&#39;m just gonna make Canada strong like you&#39;ve ignored all of that argument and you&#39;ve just owned that space for yourself. And I mean, good on you. That was a pretty, pretty savvy move. I think not necessarily for what it does for the liberals, but for what it precludes the conservatives from doing. Carter,</span>

There&#39;s a lot of examples of what we&#39;d call in the business, abandoned strategies. There&#39;s a lot of examples of what we call in the business, emergent strategies, where we just say, oh, I&#39;m going to grab that. That looks really good.

            <span class="text">Actually, you know, let me pick up on that because you mentioned a campaign that I ran there. So in 2012 for the Liberals, our vote collapsed overnight when Alison Redford was elected leader of the PCs. Literally, it went from about 23, 24 percent to 10, 11 percent. It was pretty crazy. And we had five incumbents running again. And we expanded the net a little beyond that to, I think, nine ridings, maybe it was eight. And we said, there is no rest of Alberta. Our entire platform, our entire resourcing, our entire everything is focused on what&#39;s going to be popular in these eight ridings. And we did that. And we stuck pretty tough to it. And we had a platform and we pulled in all at the time, 83 ridings of Alberta, every single individual component, we found the most popular ones. We put together bundles in those eight ridings, didn&#39;t care what the rest of the province thought. And we put together bundles that allowed us to see whether those would resonate with that group. And then we carpet bombed those ridings. We printed full booklet platforms and we dropped them in those ridings in swing areas. We put all of our advertising in those areas on those issues and anything else that was existing outside of those ridings was mostly just to show ourselves as minimally viable so that we would be viable in those ridings. And that is available to the NDP as well. Unfortunately, that&#39;s a pretty tough strategy to deploy on week two of a campaign. Right,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so i think there were certainly people inside the party who were very well aware of the strategy right um and uh that you have to and and this is maybe where steven like that&#39;s a hard strategy to be very public about we certainly had a version of it where we said you know we want to make sure that this is a story that resonates with our base we had ways to talk around it for sure but no we&#39;re not saying to the entire public we&#39;re only viable in these writings because Because unfortunately, then we wouldn&#39;t get coverage. And one of our strategies was, when you pick up the newspaper, different era, people cared about this, right? When you picked up the newspaper, there&#39;d be four stories, there&#39;d be the, you know, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D. In our case, in Alberta, it was the PCs, Wildrose, Liberals, and New Democrats. And like clockwork every day, you would have those four stories, right? But if we had said to the media, we don&#39;t stand a chance outside of eight ridings, and frankly, we don&#39;t think we stand a chance outside of five ridings, they never were going to cover us like that. Our tour would have collapsed. It wouldn&#39;t have worked. There&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s something so fascinating here, Carter, because while I agree—it&#39;s not to say you said something you agree or disagree, but I&#39;m almost trying to now take Corey&#39;s strategy and say, can you right-size that for Jagmeet, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right? Almost like free ourselves of the national burden. You may not look at it that way. But if you do acknowledge it, you do also potentially have that risk of saying you&#39;re no longer seen as a national party. Now, whether that stain lasts for one election or more, if there&#39;s like deeper effects of that is to be determined. So I&#39;m kind of curious, would you say this 20 riding strategy with your outside voice or would this be, you would?</span>
