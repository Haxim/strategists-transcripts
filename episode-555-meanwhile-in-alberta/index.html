And why do people say "PIN number"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Now, there may be supplementary bills to come, but this does tell us at least what the plan is for the next year, where the spending priorities are. I think we can already expect a few things that will change as far as royalties and environment just based on Joe Cici, the finance minister&#39;s comments today. But this tells us a lot about the government, its approach to governing, and what the hell the next 12 months, 24 months, 36 months and beyond are going to be like. Carter,</div>
