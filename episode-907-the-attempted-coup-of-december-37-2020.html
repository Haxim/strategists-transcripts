I want to start there before I move into Wednesday. I know we&#39;re itching to talk about the Capitol, but Carter, give me your thoughts on Wednesday. Did the Georgia win surprise you? We were, of course, having someone on the show made a prediction. Predictive. Double down on his prediction. Yeah, okay. Double</span>

            <span class="text">well um i don&#39;t think i was surprised by the time we were within about a week of the election. That was pretty clearly in the cards when you looked at the polling, when you kind of considered the general trend of things. When you step back though and you say, is this something that a reasonable pundit would predict in November, right after the election, when it went to a runoff? No, absolutely not. I would have said, I would have bet that the Republicans win both, because that&#39;s what they usually do in such situations. And I sure wouldn&#39;t a bet that the democrats win both that uh that seems crazy unlikely but uh we&#39;ve had a pretty crazy unlikely past 60 days and well</span>

            <span class="text">not talk about a coup attempt when a coup attempt occurs here like this was a tragic tragic fuck up by donald trump um that that led to this there&#39;s there&#39;s basically no way in my mind i can get past the fact that if donald trump had had either A, just conceded right after the election, or B, everybody in the Republican party said, no, Donald, you lost and didn&#39;t indulge him in this. I think for sure the Republicans would have won at least one of those seats, probably both of them, and held the Senate. So, I mean, we&#39;ve got all sorts of Donald Trump cautionary tales this week. This one would be the hugest within years in each direction, were it not, of course, for Wednesday&#39;s situation. But But, yeah, the fact that the</span>

            <span class="text">know, any other president would have managed things much differently by moving on and acknowledging the loss. Then you have a lot more to play for in Georgia. Right. As long as you&#39;ve got the president&#39;s seat, you don&#39;t have to have the Senate because the president, the vice president cast a deciding vote. There&#39;s not much to play for. There&#39;s not the stakes fundamentally changed. Plus, he cast all the doubt on the voting process itself. Why would I even bother going vote if I can&#39;t be 100% certain that my vote counts? Now, we</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we say that, but it was kind of record Republican turnout for a special runoff. In normal circumstances, I think people would have been super impressed to get those numbers of votes. And I think that if, again, in Corey&#39;s hypothetical of the pundit that would be asked about this right after the election on November the 5th or 6th, they would say, you know what, if the Republicans get a turnout like the one that they got on Tuesday, there is no way the Georgia Democrats can win. So they did win. Their people were more organized. They were fighting the different fight that Donald Trump took off the table for the Republican Party.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, so I could spend some time talking about Warnock and Ossoff, and I&#39;m not going to do that because I want to talk about two other people, two women, in fact, rather than the two men that won. And the first person I want to talk about is Stacey Abrams. Carter, you mentioned her off the top. Many people across North America, especially in democratic political circles, are crediting her for this victory in Georgia, her two organizations, and frankly, just energy and efforts and mobilizing grit. Britt, even after losing the Georgia race for governor a few years back, has kind of led her to this moment. Corey, what do you think her national ceiling is right now? And are you surprised that she hasn&#39;t been tapped for one of the national positions or the federal positions that Stephen Carter has even suggested in the past that Biden float to Georgia voters prior to the runoff as, you know, Stacey Abrams in my cabinet, so to speak? So kind of what is your comment on on Abrams national profile?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, just reverse things. I think that if I was Kamala Harris, I would try to never have to cast a vote. I would be taking what Joe Biden said, which is we&#39;re going to try and reach across the aisle and try and find a way to get to 52, 53 votes on every issue. I think that there are going to be Republican senators who are going to have seen what happened and are going to be up for reelection in four years, not two years, or maybe in two years and outside of the Trump cycle where they think, you know what? but this is not going to work anymore. People are going to be looking for a reasonable solution. And having just survived a coup attempt at the worst case scenario, or having my office place ransacked by hooligans at the least statement, I think that they&#39;re going to be open to a little bit more civilized discourse, and they&#39;re not going to be so strictly under McConnell&#39;s thumb. Keep in mind, McConnell didn&#39;t bring these things to a vote And then have an iron fist with his caucus and controlling his caucus, as we would see with a whip situation, right, where you&#39;re just whipped as a caucus to vote the way that the whip wants you to.</span>

But the reality is, if you&#39;re trying to get to 51 on every single vote, you&#39;re fighting with one hand tied behind your back. So she&#39;s going to have to do some tie-breaking votes here.

Joe Biden, despite having never cast a tie-breaking vote, still wore the legislative agenda of Harry Reid in the Senate. That&#39;s just how these things work. So don&#39;t worry about it and don&#39;t overthink this thing. One iota. Vote when you need to vote and consider yourself very lucky you&#39;re in the situation where you actually get to cast tiebreakers as opposed to just being steamrolled on every single one as the aforementioned soon-to-be ex-majority leader would come in and not even allow your things to get to the floor.</span>

But I think it&#39;s fair to say that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders aren&#39;t going to be those challengers. So it will be a markedly different field. And I think that she&#39;s going to be ridiculously strong in it unless she does some sort of major screw up, which I don&#39;t expect from her because she&#39;s in a great spot where there&#39;s not a lot of mistakes made from the vice president&#39;s office unless your name is Spiro.

And I don&#39;t know if that was the last speech before this all went down, or if I just hit refresh next, and I saw all of a sudden the Capitol had been stormed. But it was kind of this holy fuck moment. And then over the next, I&#39;d say hour, as I got texts from other people who were doing work, but then kind of just being made aware of this, who texted me and said, holy fuck. And as this situation evolved, there was that same kind of 9-11 feeling of you didn&#39;t know what was fact and what was fiction. And the craziest fucking thing, almost in a reverse of 9-11. You remember on 9-11, there was all of this suggestion that there were bombs outside of these different places turned out to be fake.

It was hard to watch because while I didn&#39;t expect them to take the lawmakers and turn turn them into hostages. Certainly, it becomes evident afterwards that this was far more planned than just, you know, 350 people being told by the President of the United States to march upon the Capitol. They knew what they were doing. They brought their equipment. And they did what they said they were going to do, which is try and take over the Capitol. And ideally, I mean, if they&#39;d had their chance, they would have hung Vice President Pence, and they would have taken taken hostages from the Senate and the House. And the fact that they didn&#39;t is more good luck than good management, because Lord knows the Capitol Police and all the various police forces that should have been involved weren&#39;t there, which is maybe something you&#39;ll ask us about in a moment.</span>

The just iconic but horrifying images of some of these rioters inside the chambers, the stealing of the lectern, the Confederate flag, you know, the woman being shot, the police officers struggling to get through the reporting. I mean, there&#39;s so many elements to this. I almost want you guys to kind of guide the conversation for me, because I want to know what amongst all of this kind of led that emotional sort of holy shit for you. Or was it just the fact that all of it was compounding together? Was there something that just made you go, wow, I can&#39;t believe this is happening? And Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you, is what kind of stood out to you? What do you think was the most either underreported or even overreported, but just the part for you that really kind of resonated?</span>

The big difference, of course, is 9-11, the United States was attacked by somebody externally, and everybody in America got on the same page. And, you know, arguably they went way too far with things like the Patriot Act and everything that followed that. But, you know, there was there was this sense of like, you know, I think George W. Bush&#39;s approval rating shot up to like 80, 90 percent. But this was different. And, you know, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll talk about it in a minute. But right now, like in the most recent Ipsos poll, only I think 13 percent of Republicans hold Donald Trump accountable as opposed to like huge majorities of the rest of the population. But there was a partisan divide here. And so immediately you saw a big chunk of the population downplaying, minimizing, distancing. And that to me is the thing that we need</span>

            <span class="text">made some really bad defense choices. The way that they tried to defend the Capitol with the barriers and the barricades up, I mean, it was laughable. I think back to the G8 that was held here in Calgary and the work that was done by our police services to keep, first of all, to keep the protesters safe, right? So forget about everybody else, but they enabled the protesters to have their own space and then kept them in that space. Why didn&#39;t that happen in this case? Why didn&#39;t they keep the protesters safe? It&#39;s not lost on me. The four of the people who died were the protesters themselves. That&#39;s a failure of our police services because that&#39;s not supposed to happen. I may not feel the same degree of empathy towards their lives, but I do value them nonetheless. And then there&#39;s the actual defense. When things start going wrong, you call in reinforcements. This is a rather standard police procedure. That&#39;s been done with the Black Lives Matter protests early, very early in the process, arguably far too early with far too much force. course um we</span>

And perhaps that&#39;s a cousin of the former. But I&#39;m curious to get your Your read of the tea leaves as to why the calls for impeachment, the calls to distance, the calls of, you know, not being harsher with your words and downplaying or actually playing up the story to its credibility and to what it is, have not been louder by some Republicans.

In general, what we&#39;ve seen is two different types of Republicans step forward over the last little while. I&#39;m going to ignore the Mitt Romneys and the Lisa Murkowskis for a moment. These are the Republicans that stood with Trump and never raised their, you know, anything, right? These are the people who fell in line. And one set is Lindsey Graham and McConnell.

Whenever somebody – whenever there&#39;s a change in government in kind of one of those quote-unquote shithole countries that Donald Trump always talked about here, decisions have to be made. You know, there are people who are working with the previous regime, who enabled the previous regime, who stood with them. And you&#39;ve got to make the decision, or is it better to destroy them and condemn them the same way the previous leader was? Or do you try to find them and bring them on side? And it&#39;s so distasteful to bring them on side. But fundamentally, you need to bring some of them on side. As much as they don&#39;t deserve it, some Republicans are going to need to be given a pass here. And I know nobody likes to hear that.

As a sentiment to that, you know, Carter, one of the things you I think you mentioned it earlier, was some of these writers, you know, were in the Capitol, yelling to find Lindsey Graham yelling to find Mike Pence, wanting to hang these two, of course, Lindsey Graham, then further assaulted and harassed at an airport thereafter.</span>

What do you kind of see as the future of, if I can call it, this movement beyond, you know, January 20th? Because it seems like it&#39;s found its own legs. It has loyalties only to one individual, while it may be different streams and lanes that have effectively brought this group together. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re, you know, allies of the Republican Party, so to speak. They seem to have one guy that they, you know, kind of bow to. What scary movement.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s go all the way back because we can&#39;t forget how this was formed, right? One of the notes that I&#39;ve been really interested in is people have been going all the way back to 2008 and the financial crisis of 2008. And the fact that no one really faced charges afterwards, there was no consequences to that significant financial crisis. And real people got hurt. Real Americans, real Canadians got hurt, real people around the world got hurt.</span>

Barack Obama was asked to fix it, and I think he did an admirable job, but it certainly wasn&#39;t seen by a lot of people to be enough. And then that anger found its voice in things like the wall, right? The Mexican wall or the Muslim ban, some very ugly moments in American history in 2015, 2016. 2016. And</span>

I don&#39;t think that the average person&#39;s life in the United States of America is much better than it was in 2016. So the vehicle of Trump, the vehicle of Trump may have allowed a lot of that anger to kind of come together and push forward. But it hasn&#39;t dissipated any of the anger. It&#39;s It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s catalyzed the anger and it has allowed the anger voice and focus. And</span>

They can&#39;t take that anger into the combat. They have to bring a calmness to them because the anger is so unfocused. The anger can actually wind up getting them, you know, overexposed in some way. And that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. The anger has gone too far and it is no longer controllable. If Donald Trump was to have stood up on Wednesday and told everybody to go home, I don&#39;t think they would have.</span>

Because they just couldn&#39;t countenance that. But the reality is he was not in the driver&#39;s seat in those conversations. Those conversations were happening where they were happening. And, yeah, I mean, you can pull this thread back much further than 2008. How did we get to 2008? Well, it was the deregulation in the 90s. How did we get to that? Well, that was, you know, an effect of the 80s, you know, and the Reagan booms. How did we get to that? Mass</span>

I think most of it, you know, I tend to blame the people who are most proximal and most directly involved, and I blame the Republicans. Let&#39;s be very clear on that here. And Carter raises an interesting kind of corollary with like the 2008 and the financial crisis here. Because what happened with the financial crisis is they, you know, ultimately the government came in in such a big way because, in my opinion, they absolutely had to to keep the economy from collapsing because</span>

I see no reason to delay, especially with these new variants that are coming on that seem to spread much faster, have a much higher R rate, R-naught, which is something that we never knew how to use in a sentence before.

So if Pelosi has a way to pull this off where she gets roughly the same number of Republican votes to vote to impeach that she had saying that this election needs to go forward, okay, that&#39;s fine. Fine. Sorry, I should say that confirming of the count of the Electoral College. But if it ends up being all the Dems on one side, all of the Republicans on the other side, this is just this is not going to help this situation one bit. And yeah, Donald Trump will then be the guy who was impeached twice. So fucking what? What does that matter? Who cares? That&#39;s embarrassing for him.

And now we have a poll that&#39;s come out from Main Street that has the NDP at 48% and the UCP in the 30s. That&#39;s really, really bad. And the reason why like a public poll is going to cause more heartburn than a private poll in these contexts is that there is a kind of a, you know, jump on the bandwagon phenomenon.

They&#39;ll start saying things like, oh, the UCP lied to us or the UCP wasn&#39;t honest about this. And sooner or later, people start talking about the accidental UCP government.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s talk about another poll. Let&#39;s talk about Alberta. Another poll came out earlier this week that said the Alberta government lacks rest amongst provinces for public perception on the pandemic response. How much of a political concern is this to Jason Kenney? I mean, compounded with all of the other things he&#39;s dealing with Stephen Carter over under on six for this. I think</span>

We are starting to see people do what they are supposed to do. People are getting vaccinated. I&#39;d like it still to be faster.
