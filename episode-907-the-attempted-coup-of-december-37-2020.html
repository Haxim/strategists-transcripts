        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the strategic fallout of the US Senate race and Trump insurrection before returning to Canada with the crowd favourite "Fine, Fabulous or F--ked?". Will the Trump movement survive the inauguration? Will Canadians be vaccinated by the fall? And when has Carter ever passed on giving advice before? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

And the first person I want to talk about is Stacey Abrams. Carter, you mentioned her off the top. Many people across North America, especially in democratic political circles, are crediting her for this victory in Georgia, her two organizations, and frankly, just energy and efforts and mobilizing grit. Britt, even after losing the Georgia race for governor a few years back, has kind of led her to this moment. Corey, what do you think her national ceiling is right now? And are you surprised that she hasn&#39;t been tapped for one of the national positions or the federal positions that Stephen Carter has even suggested in the past that Biden float to Georgia voters prior to the runoff as, you know, Stacey Abrams in my cabinet, so to speak?

          <div class="said">Yeah, just reverse things. I think that if I was Kamala Harris, I would try to never have to cast a vote. I would be taking what Joe Biden said, which is we&#39;re going to try and reach across the aisle and try and find a way to get to 52, 53 votes on every issue. I think that there are going to be Republican senators who are going to have seen what happened and are going to be up for reelection in four years, not two years, or maybe in two years and outside of the Trump cycle where they think, you know what? but this is not going to work anymore. People are going to be looking for a reasonable solution. And having just survived a coup attempt at the worst case scenario, or having my office place ransacked by hooligans at the least statement, I think that they&#39;re going to be open to a little bit more civilized discourse, and they&#39;re not going to be so strictly under McConnell&#39;s thumb. Keep in mind, McConnell didn&#39;t bring these things to a vote And then have an iron fist with his caucus and controlling his caucus, as we would see with a whip situation, right, where you&#39;re just whipped as a caucus to vote the way that the whip wants you to.</div>

Joe Biden, despite having never cast a tie-breaking vote, still wore the legislative agenda of Harry Reid in the Senate. That&#39;s just how these things work. So don&#39;t worry about it and don&#39;t overthink this thing. One iota. Vote when you need to vote and consider yourself very lucky you&#39;re in the situation where you actually get to cast tiebreakers as opposed to just being steamrolled on every single one as the aforementioned soon-to-be ex-majority leader would come in and not even allow your things to get to the floor.</div>

But I think it&#39;s fair to say that Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders aren&#39;t going to be those challengers. So it will be a markedly different field. And I think that she&#39;s going to be ridiculously strong in it unless she does some sort of major screw up, which I don&#39;t expect from her because she&#39;s in a great spot where there&#39;s not a lot of mistakes made from the vice president&#39;s office unless your name is Spiro.

And I don&#39;t know if that was the last speech before this all went down, or if I just hit refresh next, and I saw all of a sudden the Capitol had been stormed. But it was kind of this holy fuck moment. And then over the next, I&#39;d say hour, as I got texts from other people who were doing work, but then kind of just being made aware of this, who texted me and said, holy fuck.

It was hard to watch because while I didn&#39;t expect them to take the lawmakers and turn turn them into hostages. Certainly, it becomes evident afterwards that this was far more planned than just, you know, 350 people being told by the President of the United States to march upon the Capitol. They knew what they were doing. They brought their equipment. And they did what they said they were going to do, which is try and take over the Capitol. And ideally, I mean, if they&#39;d had their chance, they would have hung Vice President Pence, and they would have taken taken hostages from the Senate and the House. And the fact that they didn&#39;t is more good luck than good management, because Lord knows the Capitol Police and all the various police forces that should have been involved weren&#39;t there, which is maybe something you&#39;ll ask us about in a moment.</div>

The just iconic but horrifying images of some of these rioters inside the chambers, the stealing of the lectern, the Confederate flag, you know, the woman being shot, the police officers struggling to get through the reporting. I mean, there&#39;s so many elements to this. I almost want you guys to kind of guide the conversation for me, because I want to know what amongst all of this kind of led that emotional sort of holy shit for you.

The big difference, of course, is 9-11, the United States was attacked by somebody externally, and everybody in America got on the same page. And, you know, arguably they went way too far with things like the Patriot Act and everything that followed that. But, you know, there was there was this sense of like, you know, I think George W. Bush&#39;s approval rating shot up to like 80, 90 percent. But this was different. And, you know, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll talk about it in a minute. But right now, like in the most recent Ipsos poll, only I think 13 percent of Republicans hold Donald Trump accountable as opposed to like huge majorities of the rest of the population. But there was a partisan divide here. And so immediately you saw a big chunk of the population downplaying, minimizing, distancing. And that to me is the thing that we need</div>

I think back to the G8 that was held here in Calgary and the work that was done by our police services to keep, first of all, to keep the protesters safe, right? So forget about everybody else, but they enabled the protesters to have their own space and then kept them in that space. Why didn&#39;t that happen in this case? Why didn&#39;t they keep the protesters safe? It&#39;s not lost on me. The four of the people who died were the protesters themselves. That&#39;s a failure of our police services because that&#39;s not supposed to happen. I may not feel the same degree of empathy towards their lives, but I do value them nonetheless. And then there&#39;s the actual defense. When things start going wrong, you call in reinforcements. This is a rather standard police procedure.

Antifa, however you want to say it. It wasn&#39;t Yal-Qaeda, it wasn&#39;t vanilla ISIS, it was Antifa. I don&#39;t understand this. I don&#39;t understand how we can&#39;t look at this and say this is Yokel Haram, or this is Yehudists that are actually jumping in to try and attack and take takeover but instead it&#39;s always it&#39;s always antifa or it&#39;s blm and the only reason they couldn&#39;t go with blm is the pictures showed a bunch of white fuckheads doing this uh there was like maybe five black guys proving that stupidity is not any part of any one race this is just it was lunacy and the response to me has been as devastating as the day it&#39;s the day it happened well</div>

Is it the fact that there is this rich vein of voters that they want to appeal to? Is it as Machiavellian as that? Or do you feel like it is tribal loyalty?

          <div class="said">This movement seems to have gotten out of hand in some ways. And I I want to kind of put your prognostication hat on a bit. What do you kind of see as the future of, if I can call it, this movement beyond, you know, January 20th? Because it seems like it&#39;s found its own legs. It has loyalties only to one individual, while it may be different streams and lanes that have effectively brought this group together. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re, you know, allies of the Republican Party, so to speak. They seem to have one guy that they, you know, kind of bow to. What scary movement.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, let&#39;s go all the way back because we can&#39;t forget how this was formed, right? One of the notes that I&#39;ve been really interested in is people have been going all the way back to 2008 and the financial crisis of 2008. And the fact that no one really faced charges afterwards, there was no consequences to that significant financial crisis. And real people got hurt. Real Americans, real Canadians got hurt, real people around the world got hurt.</div>

Barack Obama was asked to fix it, and I think he did an admirable job, but it certainly wasn&#39;t seen by a lot of people to be enough. And then that anger found its voice in things like the wall, right? The Mexican wall or the Muslim ban, some very ugly moments in American history in 2015, 2016. 2016. And</div>

I don&#39;t think that the average person&#39;s life in the United States of America is much better than it was in 2016. So the vehicle of Trump, the vehicle of Trump may have allowed a lot of that anger to kind of come together and push forward. But it hasn&#39;t dissipated any of the anger. It&#39;s It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s catalyzed the anger and it has allowed the anger voice and focus. And</div>

The anger can actually wind up getting them, you know, overexposed in some way. And that&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. The anger has gone too far and it is no longer controllable.

Because they just couldn&#39;t countenance that. But the reality is he was not in the driver&#39;s seat in those conversations. Those conversations were happening where they were happening. And, yeah, I mean, you can pull this thread back much further than 2008. How did we get to 2008? Well, it was the deregulation in the 90s. How did we get to that? Well, that was, you know, an effect of the 80s, you know, and the Reagan booms. How did we get to that? Mass</div>

And Carter raises an interesting kind of corollary with like the 2008 and the financial crisis here.

They obviously weren&#39;t. they were going to do this on january 20th or shortly thereafter is my opinion but they saw like okay we can&#39;t we&#39;ve got to we got to go now this is getting crazy and in fact he got his temporary ban and he had to delete a few tweets</div>

We&#39;ve committed to, what is it, eight or nine vaccines per Canadian. Let&#39;s get as many in as quickly as possible. While I&#39;m very pleased that by the end of the summer, every Canadian who wishes to be vaccinated will be vaccinated, And I&#39;d be fine if it was by the end of April. I see no reason to delay, especially with these new variants that are coming on that seem to spread much faster, have a much higher R rate, R-naught, which is something that we never knew how to use in a sentence before.

They should be ahead of prisoners, right? Because, of course, people in prisons can be vulnerable populations.

If you are a vulnerable member of a prison population, you should not die just because you happen to be incarcerated for perhaps a very minor crime. And these actual – the situation, the prison is a bit of a petri dish. We all know this. We know that things are more likely to travel around a prison and that means that they are going to be more vulnerable almost by default. fault and let&#39;s not forget people work in prisons you know the ratio of guards to inmates is actually pretty significant and you are putting them at risk too and they are on the front lines they are you know correctional officers who are who are putting their lives on the line daily especially in some of these max security places right and now you&#39;re saying fuck you go get the coronavirus right i mean it&#39;s such a shitty shitty thing to do uh it&#39;s a shitty thing to do as a human being uh you know how we treat uh the least advantaged of us and the worst of us is is how we should be defined as a society it makes me beyond mad um but tragically i think the politics of it will play just fine carter</div>

So if Pelosi has a way to pull this off where she gets roughly the same number of Republican votes to vote to impeach that she had saying that this election needs to go forward, okay, that&#39;s fine. Fine. Sorry, I should say that confirming of the count of the Electoral College. But if it ends up being all the Dems on one side, all of the Republicans on the other side, this is just this is not going to help this situation one bit. And yeah, Donald Trump will then be the guy who was impeached twice. So fucking what? What does that matter? Who cares? That&#39;s embarrassing for him.
