Steven, of course, adding more fuel to the fire to our ongoing rivalry with Canada Land. Of course, they know about us. I just want to put that out there. They know who we are. They know who we are.

          </div>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">yeah we&#39;ll just watch him uncomfortably you know what i&#39;m actually gonna save us from that and let&#39;s move it on to our first segment okay we</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">we We have no choice. Stephen Carter, we have to do it. We have to go. I know. I know. It&#39;s so bad. We have to do it. But do not worry. There are games. Our first segment is Testimony Thermometer. Now, of course, we play this every time our head of state testifies to the finance committee. And we&#39;ve played it before back in the 1800s. I don&#39;t know, the 1900s at some point. Corey will find out for us. Of course, Chester was hosting the show back then.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Prime Ministers have spoken to committees quite a few times in the past. It&#39;s not the rarest thing in the world. I don&#39;t know if it was the Finance Committee in all those times. You know, his dad spoke to committees four years in a row. So it&#39;s a Trudeau thing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Nerd alert. Okay, Corey, thank you. I just expected a, oh, this is the year it happened. But thank you for the entire history on committees and Prime Ministers showing up to them. Here&#39;s what we&#39;re doing. We&#39;re doing testimony thermometer. thermometer. I am going to go through individually with all the testimony we&#39;ve heard. We&#39;re going to go through the Kielberger brothers. Of course, do them together. They&#39;ve been joined at the hip since they were teenagers. We&#39;ll do them together. We&#39;ll go through Trudeau. We&#39;ll go through Telford. And here&#39;s what you need to do. You need to give me a response from minus 10 on the thermometer, which means very shitty, all the way to plus 10, which means in normal summer terms, not great weather, but the highest that this thermometer goes. It&#39;s a very cheap thermometer. So between Between minus 10 and plus 10, and please, answer the fucking questions. I cannot have you go lightning round on me on these. We&#39;re going to use it. No, this one I&#39;m paying</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the whole time. I was. I was really paying</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">paying attention. Yeah, okay. This is not going to go well for us. Okay, let&#39;s start here with Corey first and the Kielberger brothers. We go with minus 10 to plus 10. Where do you put them? And then tell us why.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">guess I put them at about a minus five because nothing is going particularly well for them, but they&#39;ve been in a bad spot for so long. I don&#39;t know that things got materially worse for them, but that committee performance of theirs certainly didn&#39;t move them any far forward. So they have a problem. They have funders who are fleeing from them, because one of the reasons why big corporations fund an organization like WE is that they can pat themselves on the back and talk about all the social good they do. If there&#39;s no PR bump to funding WE, then, my God, you&#39;d only actually be doing about it because you actually care about the charity. And let&#39;s be real, corporations are far too cynical for that. And, and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">then if you look even a little bit beyond that, they continue to get pulled deeper and deeper into all of these quarrels with all of these different people. Most recently, of course, we saw that they&#39;ve been spending money on political consultants in the United States. I don&#39;t think that shocks any of us on this podcast. We&#39;ve all done work like that for clients in the past, you&#39;d be surprised the kinds of people who want to have political advice provided to them. And there&#39;s all sorts of legitimate reasons for it. But it just continues to paint a picture of a charity run amok, rightly or wrongly, and they just can&#39;t get out of it. They&#39;re in rough at this point, and it&#39;s going to be tough for them to pull both their personal reputations and their charity&#39;s reputation out of this ditch. Carter,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, before I go to you on the Kuhlberger brothers, Corey, you know, you&#39;ve said on this podcast numerous times that the audience that they&#39;re primarily playing for leading up to this testimony that they gave was the corporate boardroom, was their sponsors and funders. Would you say that they were a minus five on that scale, too, or were they worse as it relates to to perhaps how their message and perhaps their message in the form of how they presented as well resonated with corporate boardrooms?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, maybe worse. I don&#39;t know if I can parse it out like that. They certainly played badly with the public as a whole, but that is why they played badly with the corporations. And I think those who were watching quite closely, quite intently, were probably a little bit alarmed</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like they were dodging. It seemed a little bit smarmy. The coziness that they were accused of was on full display. I think it was really bad advice whoever suggested to them kind</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">kind of telling Charlie Angus, hey, yeah, your kids participate in this charity. I have no idea why they thought that was going to play at all, at all, and it just created this sense of entitlement on full display, very evasive, would</span>

So that&#39;s a very interesting point, Carter, that that they were the wrong actors for the screen that they were on, that they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re like they&#39;re concert hall performers in your mind. I think that&#39;s a very fascinating analogy. Corey, do you agree with that?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I love that metaphor. for. And you think about stage acting and kind of the over the topness of it, this idea that you want to create a sense of intimacy with everybody in your audience. And that is the wrong, wrong play for that particular stage. I think that it was a combination. They really didn&#39;t know who they were and where they were, is what I felt. So totally agree with everything Carter just said there. The other comment that really stunned me for its inelegance for that moment was when they they said they thought of themselves primarily as entrepreneurs. You can say that being an entrepreneur or a social entrepreneur is a means to an end, but you</span>

            <span class="text">you should be thinking of yourself primarily as people trying to do good in the world, people trying to run a charity. You are a charity first and foremost. Everything else you do is in service of that mission. And the problem is they seem to have confused the means and the end there. And that is going to cause them even more problems going forward.</span>

That&#39;s what they did better. But they developed a public relations strategy that was, like I say, it was designed for the 20,000 person venue.

So, Carter, you&#39;ve used this concept of the arc of celebrity, and I want to see if it applies here. And maybe I&#39;ll let you explain it, because it&#39;s fascinating when you are on this arc. You talk about the rise and the fall. Do you feel like it applies here? And maybe explain to our listeners what it is.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s a great analogy. I mean, we used it a lot with the Nenji campaign. It also worked with the Alison Redford campaign, but it also applies to Trump. And it applies to all kinds of different people who are in politics or in celebrity life. And the arc of a celebrity is that people build you up way faster than you have earned it. So you go way up very quickly. And that is essentially the light of celebrity. That&#39;s the spotlight on you. on you and it goes up very quickly but the thing is you get to the top and you immediately drop and we&#39;ve seen uh very few stars are able to kind of sustain their celebrity for for years and years like um taylor swift might be one that right now everybody&#39;s got you know she&#39;s still at the top of her her zenith whereas if you look at the kardashians for example their entire life is the roller coaster of up and down with celebrity so the problem with celebrity politicians politicians or in the case of the kill burgers is that they</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they can&#39;t when they come back down the crash is massive and they don&#39;t have the tools or the infrastructure to allow themselves to build back up and this particular celebrity fall i mean this was this charity has been built by celebrity means that&#39;s the public relations element that i was referring to before they built it as celebrities they made themselves the star of the show and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and when you make yourself the star of the show then when When you fall and you collapse, it takes everything down with you. And it takes a very special type of celebrity to be able to rebound from that collapse. You know, Branson maybe can do that where he&#39;s got some negative things that follow him around. But, you know, some of these other guys, you know, Jeffrey Epstein doesn&#39;t recover, right? Does not recover because his whole world and it is the celebrity downfall is so massive. um the you know mel gibson can can come back and still direct films but you know that&#39;s it like there&#39;s just once you go down you&#39;re down you&#39;re out cory</span>

That would have been the proper tone and approach to take, because I think that would have engendered some sympathy, as people would have said, oh, hey, look, yeah, I mean, why the hell is this happening to them? And that would have played as kind of a foil to the questioning that they were getting, too, from folks like Pierre Polyev, right? If they had just kept it a little narrower and less over</span>

It actually played, in my opinion, very close to what I predicted it would be last week, which is panned by critics, you know, just generally panned by the pundit class. But I think he did what he needed to do with the public on the whole. There&#39;s very few new components that come out of that. And when When you were trying to explain to the public why you should be concerned because a pre-cabinet brief had a certain item on the agenda. We&#39;re getting way too deep into the world of procedural operations in a privy council for most people to care. So I don&#39;t actually think he&#39;s worse off this week than he was last week.

He did nothing to recuse himself between that and when they officially kind of passed this. Do you feel like, I take your point that that might be in the weeds for the general public to absorb, but do you feel like that that is now going to extend the news cycle on this story with that new piece of information given by the Prime Minister?

I think on the whole, you&#39;re just like, it came, he had questions, he sent it back, that seems reasonable, and people will move on.

He didn&#39;t repeat the dollar amount, for example. He didn&#39;t do some of those things that could, of course, be used in a future video or a clip for, you know, a future campaign mailer down the road. but if you were advising him right with hindsight now to your benefit what would you have done differently how would you have structured his 90 minutes differently uh both from tone message perhaps even optics uh what was what would have gotten that number higher for you on that scale</span>

It&#39;s Katie Telford, the Prime Minister&#39;s Chief of Staff. Now, both of you have been in government, kind of know the responsibilities of a senior senior level bureaucrat, a political staffer. So I&#39;m curious to get your take from that knowledge in mind, what you thought Katie Telford&#39;s performance mapped to on the testimony thermometer. And Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first.</span>

The last thing you want to be doing is testifying in front of a House committee. um that&#39;s not your job that&#39;s not what you want to be doing um i thought she was fine i i didn&#39;t think that she um made any particular mistakes and you know if we go back to your thermometer i mean she</span>

Five is what I&#39;ll say, just because I don&#39;t think you can give anyone a 10 in a situation like this. But, you know, I, unlike Carter, come from a school of thought that political staff and, you know, senior officials should be neither seen nor heard, right? They should be in the background. Carter disagrees. Carter likes to be in the foreground. He&#39;s Carter. It&#39;s what he does. Well,</span>

But how did they perform? Of course, they are the principal political enemy, they are the official opposition. How do you think they performed on the testimony thermometer minus 10 to 10?

They gave them time to reinforce and justify their decisions. How did you feel about how they performed in the sense of doing those two things?

Those soundbites were for the prime minister. You cannot imagine a world where CTV News comes on and you&#39;re getting some liberal backbencher as the voice of this particular scandal. So I&#39;m not so fussed with that. It is interesting to talk about the theater element that Stephen was mentioning, and how high the bar is for the conservatives right now and the NDP.

We know you&#39;re going to find good refuge here. So here is what bold, brilliant or boneheaded is. I&#39;m going to run through about half a dozen things that have happened this week. And you guys are going to give me either the fact that the strategy was bold, was brilliant or was boneheaded. Now, hopefully we have some agreement, but hopefully also have some disagreement as to what happened. And then give us your quick justification. So we want to run through a half a dozen of these. And Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. The first one, Trump this week attacking the American Postal Service, and then going after the election date saying, shouldn&#39;t we delay it? Bold, brilliant, boneheaded?</span>

            <span class="text">he has moved the conversation and he had to do it around this time. He couldn&#39;t wait multiple months in order for this to roll out. If his strategy really is one to sow doubt about whether the election should be occurring at that moment or not, anyhow, he&#39;s got us talking about it now. And the fact that he has voting by mail looking very suspect because the mail system is looking very suspect, I mean, it&#39;s awful, and it is, in my opinion, criminal. But it was a bold tactic, and certainly I don&#39;t think it hits either brilliant or boneheaded. Carter,</span>

This is, you know, the strategy of undermining the election and maybe the only strategy that Trump has left. I mean, he&#39;s not going to be able to fix COVID. He&#39;s not going to be able to fix the economy. He&#39;s not going to be able to fix his personal popularity. And he&#39;s not going to be able to run against an incumbent or against a candidate like Hillary Clinton, who, for whatever reason, was not able to resonate with more than a small percentage or not a large enough percentage of the population.

Of course, Minister Madu has the ability to fire Joe Magliocca, for those who are not following this, a little bit of a thread.

As they have with the, you know, they&#39;re out of step with a school board here in Calgary. And they&#39;ve lost their mind. The problem with governments is when you become a government that gives back to your friends, as the UCP have done, all of their agency boards and commissions appointments have been to their friends, to their buddies. Those appointments are stacked in their favor. And now one of their buddies who was going to run for them, that was always the rumor, Joe Maglioc is going to run for the UCP. I just hoped that we would get him out of city council because he&#39;s so useless. And now he&#39;s he&#39;s Joe Magliocca has committed. You know, this has been referred to the to the Calgary Police Service. This is not just a oh, by the way, you may have have charged a little bit extra on your on your expense forms. He&#39;s already paid six thousand dollars back and there&#39;s, you know, over ten thousand dollars more. This guy should be kicked out of council. If he&#39;s not kicked out of council, who&#39;s going to be kicked out of council? Do you wait for the police to come back? I mean, I remind everybody the police are still investigating Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership. They&#39;re not fast movers on this stuff. So my view is Joe Magliocca should have resigned or should be kicked out by this minister. This is a boneheaded strategy by a partisan minister that&#39;s protecting one of his own.</span>

And in theory, you don&#39;t want to be involved in yourself in these local contests. And B, you&#39;re going to have to be starting to do things like this everywhere if you start leaving it just to the point of ethics violations. What I think is really lacking is the tools for council to deal with this appropriately themselves. And so a bold move would have been to say, hey, no, we&#39;re not at all interested. And we&#39;re not exactly keen on the idea of, of counselors getting to decide who their colleagues are. But maybe this is an opportunity to bring in municipal recall.</span>

At the John Lewis funeral, Barack Obama makes a political speech calling the filibuster a Jim Crow relic and then encouraging voter registration, giving a pretty fiery speech about the current administration. Mixed reviews for that part of his speech, but from your political standpoint, from a strategy standpoint, bold, brilliant, boneheaded? I</span>

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s on any level controversial. It may be political, but it shouldn&#39;t be controversial. These are these were the principles that John Lewis stood for. You know, if Barack Obama had come in and started to articulate principles that were unrelated to John Lewis, then I think it could have been a bad strategy. But instead, these were about the man himself, and it was about the vision that the Democrats need to carry into the next, ideally into the next year when Biden is the president and there&#39;s a small Senate majority for the Democrats, and they continue to have their House majority. Because they need to get shit done and they need to get shit done in a hurry to reestablish these institutions that Trump has just absolutely decimated. So this is the time.</span>

Now, now that said, like their videos are pretty interesting and certainly they&#39;ve got everybody talking, but I have not actually seen any results yet. So I, I, yeah, I don&#39;t know.

            <span class="text">we&#39;ll leave that one there and for our final question of course given to us by one of our listeners a five-star review from our dental luck who says strategy for podcast reviews though of course they&#39;re asking us for our strategy on podcast reviews just so you guys get the preview there uh what would your strategy be for responding to another podcast undermining your valuable reviews see boys in the short pants episode 93 at the 10905 mark they gave the strategist three three stars. Corey, I&#39;ll let you go first. I mean, what would our strategy be? Hypothetically, of course, if we were to respond to Boys in the Short Pants, never heard of them, episode 93, where they gave us three stars.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, look, I think that when I look at the number of reviews we have and the number of reviews they have, I think I&#39;d be very careful if they want to want to get into an artillery battle with us. Our fans are crazy. You guys are lunatics and you&#39;ll go and you&#39;ll give everybody two star reviews at Boys in the Short Pants, I&#39;m sure. And those will probably be full of questions in the spirit of the strategist reviews. But like, who are you and why do you exist? I just think this is going to happen organically because of our true believers here. Yeah,</span>
