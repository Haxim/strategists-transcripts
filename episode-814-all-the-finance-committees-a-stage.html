        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Kielburger, Trudeau and Telford appearances at the Finance Committee before being subjected to the return of "Bold, Brilliant or Boneheaded". Did Trudeau do what he needs to do? Can Joe Biden just hide in his bunker for the next ninety days? And how many podcasts is The Strategists at war with, exactly? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

I don&#39;t know, the 1900s at some point. Corey will find out for us. Of course, Chester was hosting the show back then.</div>

I am going to go through individually with all the testimony we&#39;ve heard. We&#39;re going to go through the Kielberger brothers. Of course, do them together. They&#39;ve been joined at the hip since they were teenagers. We&#39;ll do them together. We&#39;ll go through Trudeau. We&#39;ll go through Telford. And here&#39;s what you need to do. You need to give me a response from minus 10 on the thermometer, which means very shitty, all the way to plus 10, which means in normal summer terms, not great weather, but the highest that this thermometer goes. It&#39;s a very cheap thermometer. So between Between minus 10 and plus 10, and please, answer the fucking questions. I cannot have you go lightning round on me on these. We&#39;re going to use it.

          <div class="said">guess I put them at about a minus five because nothing is going particularly well for them, but they&#39;ve been in a bad spot for so long. I don&#39;t know that things got materially worse for them, but that committee performance of theirs certainly didn&#39;t move them any far forward. So they have a problem. They have funders who are fleeing from them, because one of the reasons why big corporations fund an organization like WE is that they can pat themselves on the back and talk about all the social good they do. If there&#39;s no PR bump to funding WE, then, my God, you&#39;d only actually be doing about it because you actually care about the charity. And let&#39;s be real, corporations are far too cynical for that. And, and</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">then if you look even a little bit beyond that, they continue to get pulled deeper and deeper into all of these quarrels with all of these different people. Most recently, of course, we saw that they&#39;ve been spending money on political consultants in the United States. I don&#39;t think that shocks any of us on this podcast. We&#39;ve all done work like that for clients in the past, you&#39;d be surprised the kinds of people who want to have political advice provided to them. And there&#39;s all sorts of legitimate reasons for it. But it just continues to paint a picture of a charity run amok, rightly or wrongly, and they just can&#39;t get out of it. They&#39;re in rough at this point, and it&#39;s going to be tough for them to pull both their personal reputations and their charity&#39;s reputation out of this ditch. Carter,</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, before I go to you on the Kuhlberger brothers, Corey, you know, you&#39;ve said on this podcast numerous times that the audience that they&#39;re primarily playing for leading up to this testimony that they gave was the corporate boardroom, was their sponsors and funders. Would you say that they were a minus five on that scale, too, or were they worse as it relates to to perhaps how their message and perhaps their message in the form of how they presented as well resonated with corporate boardrooms?</div>

And you think about stage acting and kind of the over the topness of it, this idea that you want to create a sense of intimacy with everybody in your audience. And that is the wrong, wrong play for that particular stage. I think that it was a combination. They really didn&#39;t know who they were and where they were, is what I felt. So totally agree with everything Carter just said there. The other comment that really stunned me for its inelegance for that moment was when they they said they thought of themselves primarily as entrepreneurs. You can say that being an entrepreneur or a social entrepreneur is a means to an end, but you</div>

And it applies to all kinds of different people who are in politics or in celebrity life. And the arc of a celebrity is that people build you up way faster than you have earned it. So you go way up very quickly. And that is essentially the light of celebrity. That&#39;s the spotlight on you. on you and it goes up very quickly but the thing is you get to the top and you immediately drop and we&#39;ve seen uh very few stars are able to kind of sustain their celebrity for for years and years like um taylor swift might be one that right now everybody&#39;s got you know she&#39;s still at the top of her her zenith whereas if you look at the kardashians for example their entire life is the roller coaster of up and down with celebrity so the problem with celebrity politicians politicians or in the case of the kill burgers is that they</div>

But I think he did what he needed to do with the public on the whole. There&#39;s very few new components that come out of that. And when When you were trying to explain to the public why you should be concerned because a pre-cabinet brief had a certain item on the agenda. We&#39;re getting way too deep into the world of procedural operations in a privy council for most people to care. So I don&#39;t actually think he&#39;s worse off this week than he was last week.

But how did they perform? Of course, they are the principal political enemy, they are the official opposition. How do you think they performed on the testimony thermometer minus 10 to 10? Given the fact they had time with Katie Telfer, Justin Trudeau, and the Kielberger brothers i think six hours plus in total with these folks give me your your your thermometer ranking i&#39;m</div>

Those soundbites were for the prime minister. You cannot imagine a world where CTV News comes on and you&#39;re getting some liberal backbencher as the voice of this particular scandal. So I&#39;m not so fussed with that. It is interesting to talk about the theater element that Stephen was mentioning, and how high the bar is for the conservatives right now and the NDP.

And you guys are going to give me either the fact that the strategy was bold, was brilliant or was boneheaded. Now, hopefully we have some agreement, but hopefully also have some disagreement as to what happened. And then give us your quick justification. So we want to run through a half a dozen of these. And Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. The first one, Trump this week attacking the American Postal Service, and then going after the election date saying, shouldn&#39;t we delay it?

And the fact that he has voting by mail looking very suspect because the mail system is looking very suspect, I mean, it&#39;s awful, and it is, in my opinion, criminal.

          <div class="said">okay we&#39;ll move it to the next Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you on this one. For this one, it is UCP Cabinet Minister Casey Maddow saying he will not fire Joe Magliocca, who&#39;s a city councillor here in Calgary, who, of course, had expenses dating back to the last couple of years, which were unaccounted for. Of course, Minister Madu has the ability to fire Joe Magliocca, for those who are not following this, a little bit of a thread. But Carter, bold, brilliant, boneheaded for the UCP minister overlooking municipalities to not fire the councillor.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I mean, imagine what would have happened if this was one of the left-leaning councillors. If this was one of the left-leaning councillors, there&#39;s no question that this UCP government would have lost their mind. As they have with the, you know, they&#39;re out of step with a school board here in Calgary. And they&#39;ve lost their mind. The problem with governments is when you become a government that gives back to your friends, as the UCP have done, all of their agency boards and commissions appointments have been to their friends, to their buddies. Those appointments are stacked in their favor. And now one of their buddies who was going to run for them, that was always the rumor, Joe Maglioc is going to run for the UCP. I just hoped that we would get him out of city council because he&#39;s so useless. And now he&#39;s he&#39;s Joe Magliocca has committed. You know, this has been referred to the to the Calgary Police Service. This is not just a oh, by the way, you may have have charged a little bit extra on your on your expense forms. He&#39;s already paid six thousand dollars back and there&#39;s, you know, over ten thousand dollars more. This guy should be kicked out of council. If he&#39;s not kicked out of council, who&#39;s going to be kicked out of council? Do you wait for the police to come back? I mean, I remind everybody the police are still investigating Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership. They&#39;re not fast movers on this stuff. So my view is Joe Magliocca should have resigned or should be kicked out by this minister. This is a boneheaded strategy by a partisan minister that&#39;s protecting one of his own.</div>

You know, you do not get yourself involved in this. A, you&#39;re a conservative. You believe in local government. And in theory, you don&#39;t want to be involved in yourself in these local contests. And B, you&#39;re going to have to be starting to do things like this everywhere if you start leaving it just to the point of ethics violations. What I think is really lacking is the tools for council to deal with this appropriately themselves. And so a bold move would have been to say, hey, no, we&#39;re not at all interested. And we&#39;re not exactly keen on the idea of, of counselors getting to decide who their colleagues are. But maybe this is an opportunity to bring in municipal recall.</div>

At the John Lewis funeral, Barack Obama makes a political speech calling the filibuster a Jim Crow relic and then encouraging voter registration, giving a pretty fiery speech about the current administration. Mixed reviews for that part of his speech, but from your political standpoint, from a strategy standpoint, bold, brilliant, boneheaded? I</div>

          <div class="said">I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s on any level controversial. It may be political, but it shouldn&#39;t be controversial. These are these were the principles that John Lewis stood for. You know, if Barack Obama had come in and started to articulate principles that were unrelated to John Lewis, then I think it could have been a bad strategy. But instead, these were about the man himself, and it was about the vision that the Democrats need to carry into the next, ideally into the next year when Biden is the president and there&#39;s a small Senate majority for the Democrats, and they continue to have their House majority. Because they need to get shit done and they need to get shit done in a hurry to reestablish these institutions that Trump has just absolutely decimated. So this is the time.</div>
