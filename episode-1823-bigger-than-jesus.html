          <blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter contemplate the value of endorsements, Carney's new economic advisor role with the Liberals, the Saskatchewan NDP and much more. Is it possible to "plagiarize" another campaign? Does Carney's role make him more or less likely to end up as Liberal leader? And who was richer, Jesus or Buddha? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

It&#39;s almost ramped up right now, the rhetoric, especially with her, that if she doesn&#39;t do it, does she lose anything? I find that fascinating right now from a cultural perspective where it&#39;s on... And part of it is Was there a DNC sort of special guest and she didn&#39;t show it was supposed to be her? What&#39;s going on? That was a fuck up on the DNC&#39;s part. But it&#39;s now reached a point where the earnest question is, is there a cost not to do it? Is there a disappointment in a sense?

            <div class="said">obvious. Exactly. So let&#39;s talk about it from that perspective, the strategy of giving it a title. And then Carter, I want to actually expand it, which is, is this good strategy for Carney? That in buying the liberal stock this low, associating yourself with the party this low, when let&#39;s just assume, we&#39;ll make one big assumption, your goal is to lead it and to be the next prime minister in some way, shape or form. Let&#39;s talk about that strategy as well. But Corey, let&#39;s start with the first one.</div>

            <div class="said">I mean, maybe it&#39;s the formalization to an extent. Maybe there was some ambiguity about that that they wanted to clear up. But I think the answer is just as likely, this is the time-honored tradition in politics of government of re-announcing, right? So you make the announcement, then you make the announcement, you made the announcement, then you make the announcement locally, then you give the status update, then you give them the name of the project, and then you move forward and so on. And you&#39;ve gone and done this 30 times before the hospital was built. And this is probably the political advisor equivalent of it. So Mark Carney here, he&#39;s talking to the prime minister. Oh goodness. Now he&#39;s showing up at convention. He&#39;s saying things like, I&#39;m going to do whatever I can to help the liberals to win. Again, see comments of, I sort of assumed he was already sort of economically advising based on those comments. And then you hear commentary that he&#39;s going to talk to caucus and blah, blah, blah, all the way along. So I think they just want to continually remind people of this, particularly at this moment before a by-election, and hope</div>

            <div class="said">economic growth, right? Productivity, it&#39;s important. And I don&#39;t mean to say narrow in a disparaging way, but I&#39;m also thinking about it from like a political advice perspective, right? It&#39;s almost like he&#39;s going to be a policy wonk thinking about policy for economic growth as someone who rather than a, let&#39;s just say a crass political advisor or a very sharp political sort of strategic advisor in that sense. What do you think of that area of focus for him as he thinks about his future positioning? It&#39;s obvious, but is that a good thing or a bad that thing?</div>

            <div class="said">Well, if you&#39;re the prime minister, of course, you want to frame it as an economic legend because you are weak on the economy. And so to dilute him and make him an overall policy advisor, that doesn&#39;t benefit you. You want to brand him in such a way you&#39;re constantly reminding people that he&#39;s got an economic focus, the economy is your focus, and you&#39;re pushing forward with that frame in mind. There&#39;s also the possibility, Zane, that he&#39;s not the only special advisor we&#39;re going to hear, and maybe there&#39;ll be additional ones coming down the road wrote as part of a strategy. It&#39;s just hard to know without knowing, but those would be the obvious reasons from the prime minister&#39;s perspective. If you&#39;re Mark Carney, can I tell you the most obvious reason you want to be the economic advisor?</div>

And I&#39;m quite certain that Mark Carney doesn&#39;t want to run as a member of parliament right now. He wants to get as close as he can so that when the leadership occurs, and let&#39;s be honest, the leadership is going to occur sooner than later, that he can say, you know, I&#39;ve been working with the prime minister, I&#39;ve got connections to this party, they run deep, and I&#39;m prepared to serve. That&#39;s why I served as Justin Trudeau&#39;s economic advisor in 2024.</div>

Guys, I want to talk about something that&#39;s happening on the prairies. This is really fascinating to me. Okay. In some ways, it is fascinating. In other ways, it might be a very simple, easy segment, but it is worthy of discussing. Saskatchewan is heading to the polls, and they&#39;re going to be heading to the polls at the end of October. Actually, in fact, they&#39;ve got something they&#39;ve called Voting Week, which I think is interesting. They&#39;re actually collapsing advanced vote with a week where you get to end up voting starting on, I believe, a week before Election Day or six days before Election Day and you get to vote for the whole week. That&#39;s neither here nor there. They&#39;re going to the polls. SAS party is currently in government, Carter. The NDP seemed to be surging a bit. The</div>

            <div class="said">Well, sir, first some thoughts on your thoughts. There are basically only two pollsters active regularly in Saskatchewan. And one of them has shown, I think, the NDP in the lead once. But Angus Reid, which is probably one of the more active pollsters over time, has never shown the NDP in the lead. It&#39;s certainly a tightening from what, 25 points Saskatchewan party lead to 10, you know, but that&#39;s still a blowout in most jurisdictions. So TBD, and of course, there&#39;s also going to be internal polling and Saskatchewan is a pretty small place. Like there&#39;s not a lot of polling that goes on there,</div>

Well, their interest was to shore up a lead, to make sure that they had something that was defending against the rightward flank and the attacks that the conservatives were going to make against them that were otherwise disqualifying on things like crime, on things like affordability. So they create a bundle of things that say, we&#39;re not going to give you an excuse to just run back to the PCs and say, yeah, but I&#39;m a little nervous about these guys. That&#39;s</div>

This is not something you&#39;re necessarily going to lead with during the campaign, but you&#39;re providing an answer that people can use when they&#39;re on the door and somebody says, well, I would vote for you, but for X, right? right? You don&#39;t want to bring those things with 10 days left in the writ period. And then you spend the time when everybody&#39;s focusing the most during the writ talking about the things that you want to talk about. And if somebody tries to pull one of your candidates on the door or one of your volunteers onto those issues, well, you&#39;ve got an answer for it. Like you&#39;ve got your shields ready to go on it and you&#39;re not polluting the time where you&#39;re trying to command the narrative with things on which you&#39;re weak.
