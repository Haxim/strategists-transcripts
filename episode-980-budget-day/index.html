        <p>In their first Thursday night on Patreon, the gang talk about the 2021 Federal Budget released earlier by Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. Lots of talk about how it might land and who wins, who loses. Plus: Corey Hogan gets a sound board that he promises to never use again unless he really wants to.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the 2021 Federal Budget. What's the story being told with the "Plan to Grow Our Economy and Make Life More Affordable"? Who are the winners and who are the losers? And did Corey murder a Miami Top 40 radio DJ? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Corey, your budget brand that you came up with was back to basics, right? You said lean into that back to basics branding, stuff it with your big programs that you want to do, but the back to basics makes sense. Carter, you had your one time fix sort of a mantra that you were kind of looking at making life more affordable was certainly part of your verbiage.

          <div class="said">Well, let me just add some of the details and then Carter, I&#39;ll go to you, right? So this budget has a deficit that is at $52.8 billion projected for the 2022-2023 year. It introduces, of course, more spending. It is signaling an eye-popping 12-digit deficit coming to an end, you know, at the end of COVID. We&#39;re also looking at big spending on housing to try to help cool the housing market, a greener economy, a multi-billion dollar plan proposed for defense spending. spending.

          </div>
          <div class="said">is there a cohesive story that you see in this budget? And could they have had a cohesive story? Because I almost want to go back to some of the stuff that you talk about quite often in your campaign consulting life with that 330-330 model that you&#39;ve introduced to us a while ago. I think that might be helpful to our listeners, where you look at a brand and a title, and some people might say, why are you guys spending such disproportionate amount of time trying to dissect what the title of a budget is, there&#39;s some merit behind spending disproportionate time around what the seven to eight or six words that you use at the top of any branding or deep dive policy document is. Is there not, Carter?</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah. I mean, we haven&#39;t done the 330-330 for a while. So maybe I&#39;ll explain it first and then jump into what it is that we&#39;d be looking for from this budget. But the idea of 330-330 is that the first three stands for three seconds. So that&#39;s the first group of people that are going to be bringing in and understanding his budget. They will spend approximately three seconds looking at it. They&#39;ll get a tweet. They&#39;ll see something.</div>

          <div class="said">Then there&#39;s three minutes. Can I get people to engage for three minutes on this budget? You&#39;re going to get down to very, very small percentages of actual Canadians that are actually going to engage for three minutes. And then you get to the 30 minute idea. The 30 minute idea is, you know, the Trevor Tombs of the world who are, you know, digging in. He&#39;s an economist at the University of Calgary. He&#39;s digging in, and he&#39;s reading the budget. He&#39;s read all 280 pages already. He&#39;s dissected it. He&#39;s written three blog posts. That real intense understanding is going to be done by a very small group of people. So when you&#39;re doing a communication strategy, you want to try and get people from the three seconds to as deep in as they will go. So three-second headline, 30-second understanding, three-minute understanding. And those people who get to the 30-minute understanding are kind of a few and far between, but you&#39;re always trying to move them along. And I think that the challenge I have, and I think this is what Corey was trying to get to, is that that three-second piece, a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable, is actually better summarized by simply saying, this is a budget about housing, climate,</div>

          <div class="said">I want to pick up on that because Carter, Carter, when we were recording our election episodes, we talked about how the platforms for not just the liberals, but every political party were almost micro targeted, that there was no real through line, like they were trying to tell a story, but it was cosmetic. It was like, we&#39;ll give you 5 million here, we&#39;ll give you 8 bucks here, we&#39;ll give you 6 billion here, but will everyone get something? Everyone has something. And this budget to me kind of speaks that way. So the question I have for you, Carter, is as much as Corey was talking about on the front end of this segment where we&#39;ve climatized ourselves to having brands for our budgets that speak to the values. Have we climatized ourselves maybe back again or maybe in a new era in some ways to not having through lines, that it&#39;s fine, that it&#39;s fine to have bits and pieces and micro-targeted activities for every constituency group as part of a budget? You might say that that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been. I&#39;m just curious to get your reaction to that, because this one, more so than the last one and the one before, and certainly the one uh in the heart of covid um to me seems like exactly what cory&#39;s identifying which is a light touch on the through line and small micro targeted pieces for different groups you</div>

Not the austerity, but the liberal version of austerity. Then the big spend budget. I think the big spend kind of took over the runway prior to today. And they, of course, landed in a spot that wasn&#39;t big spend or wasn&#39;t like blow the doors out historical big spend with the, you know, wasn&#39;t the orange budget that people expected. And certainly, you know, despite what Candice Bergen and others called it today. Um, what part do you think that was strategy, Carter, to set the expectations so high that they could land the plane, so to speak, at a different altitude and still be fine because expectations were much higher and perhaps even purposefully elevated?</div>

We don&#39;t have to name them. We don&#39;t have to be specific about them. I want to get deep into the practitionership of what organizations that look for stuff in a budget, how are they processing it, and what should they be doing thereafter? Both of you have been in roles that involve people saying, oh, shit, my thing wasn&#39;t there. My program wasn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve been spending eight months, six months, for example, if you&#39;re Carter, you know, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, they&#39;re like, where is this? We&#39;ve been looking for it for so long. They show up and they say, this wasn&#39;t there. What are they doing on</div>

          <div class="said">on the eve of a budget? And let&#39;s take it out from just the day, but the weeks and perhaps even just a few months thereafter, to position themselves to get back into the mix. How do special interests and advocacy groups Groups that have desires for programs and opportunities in a budget bounce back. Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you first with your chief of staff experience. What would you suggest to the groups in that category? What does today look like? And then let&#39;s go from there.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, the budget is just the first of the spending bills, right? I mean, there&#39;s more spending that happens through the course of a year. It&#39;s not like the budget comes out and the government just throws up its hands and says, well, that&#39;s it. We&#39;re not going to spend any more money. And</div>

          <div class="said">it&#39;s also not that every nickel that&#39;s in the budget is already allocated. There&#39;s money in there. There are programs in there. I mean, I know that when the city of Calgary was looking at trying to find money from the federal government, it was relatively straightforward to go in and find all the different programs that are publicly available. You can just find all the publicly available information. You find out where you think you can fit into, and then you try and apply for that money. And it&#39;s actually remarkable how sometimes that money isn&#39;t applied for. So you can go and find dollars within these buckets if you just change your talking points a little bit, right? You change what you&#39;re talking about. You&#39;re changing how you&#39;re approaching things. Well, this doesn&#39;t entirely describe what we&#39;re doing perfectly. Well, change</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">change what you&#39;re doing. Change it so that it does describe what you&#39;re doing perfectly. So that&#39;s kind of my first step. The second, of course, is that more money gets allocated throughout the course of the year. If you need additional funds, if there&#39;s something that&#39;s really important to you, then go get it. Go and find those additional funds and those additional funds can still be put forward. I mean, you know, more money is being spent in a bunch of different areas, but it doesn&#39;t mean that more money won&#39;t be spent later in the year. Corey,</div>
