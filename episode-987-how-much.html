            <span class="text">The debate was wild. It was a raucous debate. This was the Manning Center, as now known as the Canada Strong and Free Network, hosted a debate as part of their conference. Patrick Brown, one of the leadership candidates and arguably a friend of the pod, door number eight, was not on stage. But you had other candidates who certainly were, including Pierre Pallieva, Leslyn Lewis, Sean Sharae, amongst Scott Aitchison and Roman Baber. Guys, the debate itself was two hours in format, standard format debate that you&#39;d see. But I have to say, the gloves seem to really be off. And the scorched earth rhetoric that at least the Pallieva campaign has been unleashing online and at rallies found its way on stage. age.</span>

I&#39;m sure if this is your cup of tea, it was great. It was like wrestling. Wrestling is not my thing all the the time and</span>

I mean, let&#39;s not pretend like debates in the past have been this great thing that we all watched and loved and walked away from better people who understood the issues better. That&#39;s not what debates are now, and I&#39;m not sure they ever were. So let&#39;s not expect that it was going to be a good debate, but I did not expect it to be a tragic train wreck.</span>

            <span class="text">and tearing people down. Now, the Republican Party has a built-in advantage because they have a Senate and they have the ability to gerrymander their ridings. In Canada, we don&#39;t gerrymander the ridings quite as badly. I mean, there are some gerrymandered ridings, but nothing like the United States. So we get a much more accurate representation of our votes. But keep in mind that conservatives are winning, you know, getting more popular vote, getting fewer seats because they are getting more and more specifically located within geographic and demographic</span>

The people who like the conservatives, I suspect that Corey and I struggled with it because we don&#39;t identify with that party, me anymore, and Corey never. And, you know, I was hoping that Sheree would be better. And I do think that Sheree was the best on that stage for my type of conservatism, which is that old style progressive conservatism, but I&#39;m not sure how that worked for anybody else.</span>

For many people, they&#39;ll say, look at Polyev and the way he&#39;s holding them to account. I mean, that would be fucking sociopathic behavior in any office if somebody was having a discussion. Why do we put up with it in politics? Absolutely beyond me. The swipe that Asheray made about we&#39;re not on a student council, I don&#39;t think does service to student councils which act with far more decorum than uh than i saw polyev act there he&#39;s acting like an asshole on a student council not like a student council more generally and um and yet that&#39;s what a lot of people are going to be really drawn to how tough he is it seems how aggressive he is how it&#39;s not something that he&#39;s going to let sheree off the hook on</span>

            <span class="text">that kind of like aggressive bulldog approach works pretty well from opposition and that remains true that remains true even when you separate from a context of a debate like this here uh because governments tend to be perceived as arrogant over time liberal governments even more so right and when you see somebody taking down somebody you perceive as arrogant you&#39;re not going to react to it the same way as like</span>
