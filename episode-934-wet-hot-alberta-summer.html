Quote, Quebec has the same right as several other nations around the world, the right to be proud and display that pride on social media. The wording of the non-binding motion invokes the importance of having a, quote, distinct visual identity on the Internet. Stephen Carter, Quebec is making moves. They&#39;re making them quick, and they&#39;re now entering the emoji wars. Does Quebec deserve its own emoji, and does it need to be the Quebec flag? Two questions.</span>

            <span class="text">Some campaign is going to be really interested to see where that campaign goes. OK, let&#39;s move it on to our next headline. Our next headline comes to us from the CBC. I want to spend some time on this because we&#39;re getting serious, Corey. OK, we&#39;re getting serious. We&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to put our strategy caps back on. OK, we&#39;re going to put them back on, Stephen. Dozens of MPs stand to lose access to pensions if they&#39;re defeated in an early election. I want to talk about this a bit more. The almost a selfish side of politics, kind of what we don&#39;t talk about. But here&#39;s some substantiation. Dozens of members of parliament could lose access to generous MP pension plans if they lose their seats in an early election because they would not have the required six years of service. Speculation is running hot in Ottawa about the exact date of the next general election call. For 142 MPs, a few weeks either way could decide whether they retire with tens of thousands of dollars in pension benefits or not. Nobody talks about it, but everyone thinks about it. And I think it&#39;s one of those things that we should discuss. I shouldn&#39;t even look up. I think there&#39;s quite a significant number of cabinet ministers. Don&#39;t quote me on this number. I think it might be in the order of 20 cabinet ministers might be also kind of in play for these specific pensions. I feel like this is a topic we should discuss, both from the side of politics in terms of how much something like this could influence an election call, what conversations in caucus around these could look like. Are they honest? Do people talk about this stuff, honestly. Carter, maybe I want to go to you first. When you</span>

            <span class="text">you read this story, do you feel like something like this is a useful input for those that are prognosticating about a future election date in terms of when it might be called, considering how many people in the current liberal government it might impact?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s a big deal for a lot of people because this is their retirement, right? When you work for an MP and they only get one term, They don&#39;t get the pension. It&#39;s a significant loss for them as a person. And to lose out after winning the second election, to lose out by a period of weeks, that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that would be very upsetting for MPs. Now, the good news there is that the prime minister wouldn&#39;t have to worry about those individual MPs. They&#39;re out of his caucus. They don&#39;t exist anymore. So it&#39;s a problem for the individuals. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a problem for the party, and I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a problem for the prime minister, but I&#39;m sure that people would be keenly</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">does have a significant impact for people who run for office. us. So I would imagine that MPs, especially for a couple weeks, and I&#39;m not sure, is it targeted based on the election day or is it targeted based on the dissolution of parliament for the election? Because it&#39;s October the 15th. And either way, if they do a fall election, I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s going to come after the 15th of October, given the Quebec municipal elections are in early November.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So a couple of things to add there, Carter. There&#39;s more than 90 liberal MPs, including 23 cabinet ministers or ministers that could lose access to the pension by an early election call. And then for the 142 MPs elected for their first time on October 19, 2015, defeat in an election taking place before October 19, 2021 would deprive them of that access to the MP pension, which at minimum, they could lose a retirement allowance of just over $32,000 a year, starting at age 65. So that kind of lays out some of the facts. Corey, how useful of an input is is this for prognosticators and tea-leave readers to look at in terms of when this election might be called? Do you feel like, maybe not the PMO, but a caucus, like this is something that could be vocalized in caucus by a large swath of your MPs to be like, hey, this is my livelihood you&#39;re talking about here when you think about an election? Or do you think that&#39;s too selfish to kind of bring up in that broader context?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t know. I mean, I think that&#39;s certainly something that they would be talking about. Obviously, we&#39;ve got a CBC story that suggests that people are aware of this point. It&#39;s not as though they&#39;re not aware of that. Anybody who&#39;s got a pension can probably quote</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">quote the day that they&#39;re allowed to retire and get their full pension benefits. The thing is, though, I think it would be really tough for anybody to stand up and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? We can&#39;t go to the polls. I&#39;ve got a pension to worry about because it&#39;s kind of suggests you think you&#39;re going to be defeated. So there&#39;s kind kind of like this social pressure beyond, you know, it would be very weird for a governing party with a spring in its step. In a funny way, this is a problem that isn&#39;t, at least writ large, because if you are a governing party and you&#39;re thinking of pulling the trigger on yourself and going to the polls, you obviously think you&#39;re in a position to gain seats, right? And if you think you&#39;re going to gain seats, then you&#39;ve probably not got too, too much to worry about in most cases. And it means that the anxiety will be somewhat limited to people who are in the most swingy of swing ridings and yes the liberals have an awful lot of people more than half their caucus 23 ministers who have not uh have not gotten to the point where they get the pension yet but that&#39;s because uh 2011 was a historically bad election for the liberals they only got 34 seats and unless you were returned from an earlier time in the 2015 election this is anybody in the class of 2015 now who&#39;s looking down those pension barrel where i think it&#39;s probably most interesting zane is not in the inter party or intra party dynamics but the inter party dynamics because if you are uh members of the ndp elected in that class in 2015 if you&#39;re the bloc quebecois this is just yet another reason to pull this thing forward a bit uh to allow to allow um you know to allow that uh that pension money to vest obviously almost by definition anybody who thinks they&#39;re in a position to lose seats is going to be more worried about that than somebody in the position to win seats of course but you know as much as we talk about half the caucus 23 ministers even</span>

This is the decision that gives us the best possible chance to remain in government.

If you want to be an elected official, you&#39;ve got to put yourself out there. And they do tend to be subject to the optimism bias that we all are, but more so, right? right? Politicians are just like us, but more so. And as a result, I think it&#39;s probably one of those things that&#39;s as annoying anxiety. But when you talk about like, is this 5%? Is this 10%? I doubt it&#39;s any of those percents. Because to Stephen&#39;s point, if you lose, you&#39;re not in caucus, it&#39;s not going to be, you know, the biggest deal in the world.

The province will enter stage one on June 1st, i.e. this Tuesday, and expect to be fully open by the beginning of July or earlier, as according to Premier Kenney, which is stage three, that optimistic stage three. Corey, this is a different strategy than other provinces. I can start that in a very basic way, for a few reasons. Number one, probably, and you guys can correct me if I&#39;m wrong, the most aggressive lifting of all restrictions strategy that I have heard thus far in the country. country. Secondly, different from the sense that it&#39;s a bit of a hybrid model, I don&#39;t know if I can call it that, between having roughed out dates that things are going to happen, but still tethering to vaccinations and also adding hospitalizations into that mix. Corey, what was your overall sort of take when you saw this? You know, when you saw stage one, when you saw stage three, and then I think when you saw that more ambitious stage three, give me your initial, you know whoa this was my reaction and then we&#39;ll kind of take it from there and tease out what this could mean politically and maybe do a bit of compare and contrast and of course discuss the stampede question so i&#39;ll go to you first in terms of your your gut check first take from when you saw this rollout by the premier yeah</span>

The PHAC requirement or the PHAC suggestion slash recommendation was a 75-20 split. This is explicitly on a 70% threshold combined with the hospitalization caseload to open up in phase three.

            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s start off by saying that I was really hoping that we would have very clear rules, right? We would say this is what&#39;s going to happen in stage one. We have that. It&#39;s pretty clear. Don&#39;t have a problem with stage one. Stage two, you know what? Pretty good. Outdoor social gatherings of up to 20 people with distancing. Indoor social gatherings not permitted. I think that&#39;s actually pretty good. I mean, outdoor social gatherings of up to 20 people, that feels pretty great. Great. Stage three, let&#39;s have a 70,000 person festival.</span>

The standby is let&#39;s hope things don&#39;t get worse. And you&#39;ll recall that we wound up having the worst phase three or stage three because we had hope as our primary strategy. We would ask people to please behave responsibly. That&#39;s okay. I mean, we didn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t work. We didn&#39;t learn a fucking thing. So now what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to launch into the most permissive stage three in the country at</span>

And I use the phrase hell or high skywater, you know, with emphasis because of the 2013 floods. This is a plan</span>

I certainly I&#39;m with Corey, I want to get back to normal. I want to I want to do things this summer. I want to travel this summer. I want to, you know, ride my bike in fun places. I don&#39;t want to be trapped in my house anymore. We have to get out of this situation. But I also don&#39;t want to get out of this situation or be told I&#39;m out of this situation and have something bad happen again. And we&#39;re starting to see bad things happening in Great Britain. We&#39;re starting to see that people with a single dose of this vaccination are not more susceptible because they&#39;re not more susceptible. They&#39;re less protected against certain strains of the virus. This is a problem. And keep in mind that if we have 70 percent vaccination rates and we&#39;ve got, say, 2,000 kids picking up trash on the Midway grounds over the course of the stampede, that&#39;s 600 children that aren&#39;t protected at all.

So we&#39;re putting kids, we&#39;re putting people who have to do these jobs at real risk. And on top of that, there&#39;s this 70% province-wide vaccination rate and no acknowledgement that there are certain segments of the population that aren&#39;t vaccinated nearly as much as the higher income, more affluent areas of the city where people can sit on their computers for two and a half hours at a time and book. cook um one of those elusive vaccinations uh and there&#39;s no plan there&#39;s no plan none</span>

And even if I think that&#39;s not likely, I think the fact that that&#39;s possible makes it not a very smart bet because the downside is, it&#39;s too down. It&#39;s too down. And, you know, there&#39;s this, I was talking to my friend Scott on Twitter today, and he was saying it reminded him of Patton&#39;s Third Army speech in the movie Patton, where he&#39;s like, I don&#39;t like to pay for the same real estate twice. Well, how many fucking times are we going to pay for this real estate? How many lockdowns are we going to have to endure here, where if we had just been a bit more sensible coming out of them, we</span>

You go home in the black, you go home a big winner, you make up for all the money you lost. For Jason Kenney, it seems like, and I&#39;m kind of curious to get your guys&#39; take on this, that this is not just go back in the black. You literally make a bunch of money on this and you&#39;re riding high. This can undo all of the past mistakes. Corey, in your perspective, what is the size of the prize here? Let&#39;s just say, let&#39;s frankly hope this works, right? Because Because the cost of not hoping this works is morbid in many ways, right? When you think about it, what it could be. Let&#39;s hope this works. What is the size of the political prize in your mind for Jason Kenney on the back end? Does this wash away everything? Does this kind of forgive all that sort of stuff? Do you feel like this kind of heralds him a hero? Just, you know, project for me a bit. What does it look like to you?</span>

            <span class="text">What the prize is, is he is able to say to everybody who said, why did you do these lockdowns? What are you doing? That, hey, I have never been enthusiastic about lockdowns. I did them because they were necessary. I am all about freedom. I wanted to be the first back to normal, and I did it. Because of my steady leadership, you know, this is him talking here in this hypothetical scenario, I was able to make Alberta the most free jurisdiction the soonest. And that&#39;s what I got. And I know it was awkward, but now&#39;s the time for us to put that behind us. And that&#39;s how he mends the bridge with kind of the quote-unquote far right of his party, the Freedom Caucus, the people who – this is the hope, right, that you&#39;re able to just reset that relationship. And from there, once you&#39;ve got your rear flank dealt with, you can start dealing with the NDP and the fact that you&#39;re losing in polls for many, many months at this point, right? That&#39;s the prize. It&#39;s a big prize. prize um i just i have to believe there are other ways to get there but i i believe that he just didn&#39;t want to be not just last he didn&#39;t want to be second he wanted to be the first to open</span>

The NDP have all been vaccinated, all of the MLAs, and the UCP, a good chunk of them won&#39;t say and are presumed unvaccinated. So who is this for? Who would this appeal to by saying like, oh, look at them. They&#39;re a bunch of anti-vaxxers. Well, your base. But how does your base feel about that issue? Because last I checked, your base was the most likely to think you should be anti-vaxxed. So who is this message for? I mean, this is kind of just kind of petulant, petty politics stuff. And it doesn&#39;t – I don&#39;t think it actually moves any meters. And it has the chance of commentary like this, almost as eye-rolling commentary that says this was – to get really meta, who is this for? You know, people start asking, what is the guy thinking when he starts putting out messages like this? So I think he&#39;s just shelf messaging like this. I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s a particularly fruitful area. If you want to say, hey, the NDP doesn&#39;t just have confidence in the science, we&#39;ve had a lot of scientists on it, that&#39;s one message. But to suggest that they&#39;re, you know, lacking a faith in science is, it&#39;s just absurd, right? I</span>

Don&#39;t, Carter, I&#39;ll go to you first on this. Or do you feel like they&#39;re okay to kind of be like, hey, this, we need to be, this is, you know, what is the premier doing here? Or, you know, I&#39;m trying to like balance between like, or maybe they don&#39;t need to, between them saying, you know, we hope this works versus being like, this is crazy. This is batshit.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so what Carter suggested there, no, don&#39;t do that. We do X, not Y. People aren&#39;t voting on X versus Y. We are going to do what the government is doing. And just as we talked about, it&#39;s more likely to work than not, or maybe even you just think it&#39;s 50-50, or maybe you think it&#39;s 30-70. The same logic applies, and if you think it&#39;s likely to work, even more so. So you can&#39;t say, like, this is a bad plan, because even if it is a bad plan because it&#39;s not particularly prudent, right, it&#39;s too risky, the math is still on the side that things will be okay. Well, let&#39;s just say it is, right, for the sake of argument. So let&#39;s say math is still on the side of things being okay.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what do you do when Stampede comes and it goes off relatively without a hitch? What do you do then? Then as the NDP, you look wrong because you presented a plan that was more prudent but ultimately was not necessary because it turns out that the vaccinations were able to cover us there. So there&#39;s no point in proposing counterplans at this point. That is making the same mistake the government is making. You&#39;ve got to keep this thing on kind of process and say, this is a bit wild. I think it was likely to work out, but I think it&#39;s a bit risky. And that is largely what the messaging has been here.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But I think it&#39;s got to be more about that. And I do agree with Stephen in the sense that it would have made more sense to go slowly. But you have to be careful. You&#39;re not saying like this will get a better result. You&#39;re saying this provides better insurance and this is what everybody else is doing. And there&#39;s logic in following what other jurisdictions that have come out of this successfully have done. We don&#39;t want Alberta to be a COVID experiment. We want to do this right. I</span>

We now have Open for Summer in, what would you call this, like a magenta and blue sort of like Hawaiian punch style vibe. talk to me about the branding here like i it&#39;s obviously the most visually vibrant branding that we&#39;ve seen during a pandemic from any province uh clearly try to illustrate something any i don&#39;t really have a question for you other than to let you go off if you&#39;ve got any brand related comments as someone who&#39;s well extremely familiar with this space yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i will say that um this is this is kind of a profligation of brands that is totally unnecessary one of the things that governments sort of spin themselves up on is we got to have a logo for this we got to have a brand and it takes an awful lot of discipline to say no you don&#39;t you got a logo it&#39;s the government logo and by the way most people in alberta probably couldn&#39;t identify that right people don&#39;t tend to think about these brands that you&#39;re creating as much as you do and they might be in front of your face all of the time but the reality is we&#39;re at a point where the average citizen has probably seen each of these brands once and that&#39;s not a brand at that point that&#39;s just a bunch of crazy crazy crap that&#39;s happening on a lectern sign so</span>

            <span class="text">they they just need to kind of cool it and i get the logic i guess here&#39;s what i would say i understand the pressure that would lead them to do these things like it&#39;s very easy to understand they had their covid brand all of a sudden we&#39;re in a bigger situation more urgent why not say it&#39;s more urgent through branding stop the spike right but the problem is if then two weeks later you&#39;re like well we&#39;ve stopped the spike but we want to tell them it&#39;s the best summer ever let&#39;s just create that brand that&#39;s not that&#39;s not the right play ultimately brand is not about logos brand is not about colors brand is about a feeling that you have and the feeling that you want to have from your government is one of kind of stability and assurance and you&#39;ve got this in hand not that they&#39;re ping-ponging from solution to solution and the fact that they&#39;ve had so many covid brands at this point just sort of reinforces this merry-go-round that we&#39;re on which is exactly why you don&#39;t play with these brands so much because it just creates this sense of chaos So, you know, it&#39;s easy for me to be critical of that. It&#39;s super easy to just sort of throw stones at it because I don&#39;t think fundamentally it&#39;s good brand foundation to keep changing these things up so quickly. I understand that the pressures are there to do this. I just don&#39;t think it makes an awful lot of sense. And at the end of the day, you</span>
