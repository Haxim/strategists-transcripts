        <p>Trump dodges a bullet from a would-be assassin. After a moment like this - is the election just over? The gang discuss strategy for both Democrats and Republicans.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the assassination attempt against Donald Trump and how it has already upended the strategy of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Is this election just over? Do the Democrats now pivot - or does the pivot just seal their fate? And why would any of us fear, when there's a donate button? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Is it that Trump&#39;s voter turnout is now going to be 105% because he&#39;s a god, as both of you have kind of indicated? Like mechanistically walk me through it. Because I think we all probably have the same emotion, many people online too, but very rarely does anyone show their work. Work. Show your work, Carter. Like, talk to me about what elements kind of make you think, fuck, this is this is over. And of course, you guys have both mentioned this, the imagery as well.

I mean, it was a heroic and spectacular effort that he put in and people responded to it. Alison Redford&#39;s mother passed away and people responded to it. It also made it so that her opposition couldn&#39;t throw any punches at her. I mean, what are you going to do? You&#39;re going to throw punches at the woman whose mother just died? You&#39;re going to throw punches at the guy who just got shot? You&#39;re probably not going to be doing a big negative ad run.

And because of that, they&#39;re going to view unity and standing together, I think, similar to they did after September the 11th, when being on one side or the other side was not allowed. You were only on America&#39;s side. And that&#39;s one of the reasons that George Bush was able to push through some of his really really really bad war ideas um but nonetheless donald trump has worse ideas and i think he does get to stand on the on the unity frame and i do think that people will join this unity frame because they will now feel like they are a part of it in a way that they didn&#39;t feel like they were a part of it before i couldn&#39;t stand donald trump before but after he got shot he seemed more human to me right</div>

But before we move on, Carter, how do the Republicans, and I&#39;m going to speak very crassly here, how do the Republicans extend their get out of jail free card honeymoon? How do they make this, like, how do they prevent Democrats, the media, others from talking about Donald Trump as an existential threat on democracy as a ballot box question for as long as possible? You&#39;ve seen how they&#39;ve successfully, almost with ease, I remember watching an interview this morning, Kristen Welker, we&#39;re interviewing Lindsey Graham, asking about how J.D. Vance, who is, you know, rumored to be the VP pick for Trump, or at least in the top two VP picks for Trump, tweeting out something saying that Joe Biden created this environment. Lindsey Graham pretty much says, listen, today, I&#39;m just glad the president is alive. Okay.</div>

Because you could, you know, extending Corey&#39;s take and adding analogy, you could kind of think about this as a power play, right? Like, or the other side with one hand behind their back, at least for a limited time. Are you trying to take advantage of that momentary time? Or are you trying to extend that time? Not to get too sort of, you know, illustrative, but there&#39;s multiple schools of thought here. Go on the offensive, regardless of how much time you have, let that, you know, be up to fate, or extend the time that you have to kind of have this chiller, calmer, runway where the other side can&#39;t make up the deficit that they were in even prior to this weekend.</div>

We addressed it at the beginning and then went on with business as usual. And I think that, you know, I would argue that the way to extend this isn&#39;t to go on the offensive.

I&#39;m not even saying they&#39;re going to be successful, but if that strategy is guaranteed doom for the Democrats all the way across the ballot, they&#39;re going to pick a different approach along the way. And so why wait for them to be the ones who start to chisel away at that sense of unity? Why not put them on the back foot?

And I actually believe it&#39;s probably right now while the Democrats are in disarray, and some of them will start scolding the other of them saying, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re attacking Donald Trump at this particular moment, as Van Jones weeps quietly on CNN and says, we are all mega today.
