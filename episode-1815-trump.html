            <span class="text">And listen, I would love to talk about the shooter and the motives and all that sort of stuff. I mean, let cable news figure all that out. This is the Strategist Podcast, Stephen Carter. We&#39;re not about the emotions. We&#39;re about the strategy. We&#39;re about the raw politics. So I have to ask you, Stephen, the first thought you had, no, actually, let me rephrase that. The first political thought you had when you heard about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. And just saying those words is chilling. But when you heard about this attempted assassination, what</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">what was the first political thought? Spare me all the emotions, spare me all the human elements that I&#39;m sure and I&#39;m certain that certainly flooded you first.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I had no human reaction, Zane, no human reactions whatsoever. The only thing that hit me was one thought and one thought only. And that is, oh, fuck, I think Donald Trump just won in the election and i&#39;m not sure that there can be much in the other in the way of other</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">almost a god you know he did no wrong said did our jfk um abraham lincoln you know like any Well, I think there was one other president who was assassinated. I want to say it was Grant, but I don&#39;t know for sure. And that was going to, you know, it kind of takes away my entire point, which is we remember those who get assassinated.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It was not Grant Hill, president of Team USA basketball, that was assassinated for those keeping track, Corey. Hey, what was your first political strategist&#39;s thought? Not your first human thought, as much as I&#39;d like to, you know, soak up all those feelings. Give me your first political thought. Was it the exact same one Carter had? had it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">oh my god if if he doesn&#39;t survive it could be chaos i think that kind of like because we didn&#39;t know right he was just taken off the stage we didn&#39;t know he was grazed at the bullet you never know and uh my second one was he</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he is he has just going to he&#39;s just become a god to his supporters right that shot of him being apparently grazed by either through the bullet or some glass from the teleprompter there&#39;s some kind of speculation about that right but hit and then um hitting</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">hitting the ground and then coming up surrounded by the secret service and him saying like wait wait and just raising his fist and shouting like fight but by the way i&#39;m sure there&#39;s already merchandise on donaldtrump.com that says fight because shit that was cinematic right like it was over the top like it was central casting style stuff If you saw it in a movie, you would think it was like over the top, but you&#39;d also be like chilled by it and be like, damn,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that was cool as hell. It was really, really powerful. As much as I loathe the guy, it was really, really powerful. And then he&#39;s pulled off and he&#39;s an absolute legend to his supporters now. Like that is some Hollywood shit right there. That is crazy. easy and um my more nuanced political thoughts that followed are this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this man i continue to believe despite apparently this week and we&#39;re not allowed to say it is a threat to democracy in the united states but it feels like now that the central argument against donald trump at least for the next little bit is going to be something nobody&#39;s allowed to say yeah that&#39;s really wow wow does that jam the democrats let&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about that in a second uh i like that cory you said you loathe him. In previous worlds, we probably would have said we hate him to death. But I guess we&#39;re not allowed to say that. But not on this podcast, Carter. We</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">break all the rules. And also, we&#39;re in a different country in case they want to come after us for some reason whatsoever. Hey, Carter, talk to me about this. Mechanistically, walk</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">walk me through why your first thought is it&#39;s over.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Like, talk to me like politically mechanistically. Is it simply Simply because, is it Corey&#39;s point that Biden doesn&#39;t, you know, his central argument is lost? Is it that Trump&#39;s voter turnout is now going to be 105% because he&#39;s a god, as both of you have kind of indicated? Like mechanistically walk me through it. Because I think we all probably have the same emotion, many people online too, but very rarely does anyone show their work. Work. Show your work, Carter. Like, talk to me about what elements kind of make you think, fuck, this is this is over. And of course, you guys have both mentioned this, the imagery as well. But like, make the make the argument for me. Put it together. There</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is no stronger emotion than kind of like human empathy. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And it wasn&#39;t like Donald Trump was able to access human empathy on a regular basis prior to this shot, right? He bragged about being able to shoot people on Fifth Avenue and his supporters wouldn&#39;t leave him. him. But</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;ve got this empathy and it reminds me actually, and this is going to be a weird comparison, but it reminds me of Jack Layton in his last election when he was campaigning with death forthcoming from cancer. I mean, it was a heroic and spectacular effort that he put in and people responded to it. Alison Redford&#39;s mother passed away and people responded to it. It also made it so that her opposition couldn&#39;t throw any punches at her. I mean, what are you going to do? You&#39;re going to throw punches at the woman whose mother just died? You&#39;re going to throw punches at the guy who just got shot? You&#39;re probably not going to be doing a big negative ad run. On top of that, I mean, the human empathy is going to be able to fill his coffers. I went to DonaldTrump.com because Corey suggested that we go there.</span>

But do you think it&#39;s a smart now to November play?

It&#39;s not just an attack on Donald Trump. It&#39;s an attack on the entire country. And because of that, they&#39;re going to view unity and standing together, I think, similar to they did after September the 11th, when being on one side or the other side was not allowed. You were only on America&#39;s side. And that&#39;s one of the reasons that George Bush was able to push through some of his really really really bad war ideas um but nonetheless donald trump has worse ideas and i think he does get to stand on the on the unity frame and i do think that people will join this unity frame because they will now feel like they are a part of it in a way that they didn&#39;t feel like they were a part of it before i couldn&#39;t stand donald trump before but after he got shot he seemed more human to me right</span>

And it&#39;s very much not just unity, it&#39;s unity as represented by the leadership of Donald Trump or as represented by the heinous act done against Donald Trump.

How do they make this, like, how do they prevent Democrats, the media, others from talking about Donald Trump as an existential threat on democracy as a ballot box question for as long as possible? You&#39;ve seen how they&#39;ve successfully, almost with ease, I remember watching an interview this morning, Kristen Welker, we&#39;re interviewing Lindsey Graham, asking about how J.D. Vance, who is, you know, rumored to be the VP pick for Trump, or at least in the top two VP picks for Trump, tweeting out something saying that Joe Biden created this environment. Lindsey Graham pretty much says, listen, today, I&#39;m just glad the president is alive. Okay.</span>

Because you could, you know, extending Corey&#39;s take and adding analogy, you could kind of think about this as a power play, right? Like, or the other side with one hand behind their back, at least for a limited time. Are you trying to take advantage of that momentary time? Or are you trying to extend that time? Not to get too sort of, you know, illustrative, but there&#39;s multiple schools of thought here. Go on the offensive, regardless of how much time you have, let that, you know, be up to fate, or extend the time that you have to kind of have this chiller, calmer, runway where the other side can&#39;t make up the deficit that they were in even prior to this weekend.</span>

And the day of the debate, which was two days later, so a little bit earlier than this Republican National Convention would have been, but still relatively close to the same timeline. We addressed it at the beginning and then went on with business as usual. And I think that, you know, I would argue that the way to extend this isn&#39;t to go on the offensive. The way to extend this is to minimize.</span>

Those are the types of things that can really change the outcome. if if you know if they were to show if if if they had um just the vice president uh nominee speak about donald trump&#39;s uh bravery in the face of this situation um and then no one else talked about it that to me would be an interesting way of dealing with this that may extend the story for much longer than going on the offensive so i think now</span>

            <span class="text">and that is that if the the Democrats make the assessment they cannot win the election because all of a sudden it&#39;s all kumbaya for Donald Trump. They are going to break from that. They&#39;re going to start taking a different strategy. They&#39;re going to have to. I&#39;m not even saying they&#39;re going to be successful, but if that strategy is guaranteed doom for the Democrats all the way across the ballot, they&#39;re going to pick a different approach along the way. And so why wait for them to be the ones who start to chisel away at that sense of unity? Why not put them on the back foot? Why not actually try to score a few points along the way there and try to make them like you&#39;re basically if</span>

And I actually believe it&#39;s probably right now while the Democrats are in disarray, and some of them will start scolding the other of them saying, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re attacking Donald Trump at this particular moment, as Van Jones weeps quietly on CNN and says, we are all mega today. You know, like, why not? Like the Democrats are showing themselves to be such a shit show, and you will find people break ranks with people who start to push against Donald Trump.</span>
