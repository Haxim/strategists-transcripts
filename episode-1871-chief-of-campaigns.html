            <span class="text">the campaign is over carter but the pressure Pressure keeps mounting from the conservative caucus to fire her. You know, let me just read you what the CBC and Radio Canada have reported. They say pressure is mounting as a conservative leader, Pierre Polyev, is to fire Jenny Byrne, his national campaign manager, who critics, especially those in the caucus, hold responsible for the party&#39;s defeat. If there&#39;s no change between now and January, the caucus will lose patience. Carter, there&#39;s a lot of discussion around, and we&#39;ve talked about campaign managers in the past. When did they become so relevant? events we&#39;ve talked about chiefs of staff and i want to save the chief of staff conversation because carney&#39;s having difficulty finding one that&#39;s also an interesting conversation but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">run this campaign in a way that was looking like a complete train wreck that your fate was sealed you were going to be done and And then the election happens, and the election&#39;s tighter than anticipated. You get more raw votes than you&#39;ve had in a very long time. You increase your seat count, and your guy, Pierre Polyev, gets to say,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">as Jenny Byrne, what argument would you be making to yourself right now? I&#39;m going to keep fighting, or I&#39;m going to find myself the door and call this a day. How would you, Stephen Carter, if you&#39;re in the shoes of not the party, but Jenny Byrne, be thinking about this?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, I think I&#39;d be thinking about this. what&#39;s the best thing for me in the long run, right? And sometimes it&#39;s been difficult for me to think of what&#39;s in my best interest in the long run because my pride gets in the way. And I suspect that that&#39;s where Jenny is sitting right now. Her pride is saying to her, I have to stay, I have to hold on. Not only did they get the most, they got the second most number of votes of any political party in Canada&#39;s history. And Jenny Byrne did that. But it was second to</span>

And they&#39;re already kind of like they&#39;re already talking about the historic margins and all that sort of stuff. The second part of the Jenny Byrne success story. So the question really does become, does she almost have the wind behind her back here, Carter, to say that if she just fights, plants her ground, doesn&#39;t do anything, and just suggests to people that we keep the campaign going, that that is enough of a distraction for them or that&#39;s enough of a B-side strategy for them to say, yeah, let&#39;s just make sense to keep Jenny around because the campaign hasn&#39;t ended. You don&#39;t change a campaign manager midstream because the campaign hasn&#39;t ended. We could be six months, 12 months, 18 months away from an election. Why get rid of the campaign manager when we&#39;re still in a campaign? I think that&#39;s pretty smart if that&#39;s where they&#39;re at. Do you think that&#39;s where they&#39;re at?</span>

How big could the pool potentially be of chiefs of staff to Mark Carney? And let me give you the case of how it could be big, and let me give you the case of how it could be small. The big pool could be professional people Mark Carney&#39;s worked with that he trusts in a managerial style role. The smaller pool is people with connections to this caucus that understand parliamentary procedure.</span>
