        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the possibility of an upcoming federal election, Joe Biden dropping the hammer on the Keystone XL pipeline and get tortured by Zain in the infamous Strategy Session. Will the Liberals pay a price for going to the polls early? Can Erin O'Toole successfully define himself as a moderate? And how deep will Jason Kenney have to bury the results of his "Anti-Energy Campaign" inquiry so that we can't smell it? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

So the decision not to run Prompton Trudeau to shuffle Baines out of the innovation portfolio, replacing him with Francois-Philippe Champagne, who is taking over the quickly evolving file, which means his foreign affairs job has now gone to Marc Garneau. And the transport job now goes over to rookie cabinet minister, but certainly not rookie MP Omar Al-Ghrabra, if I&#39;m pronouncing that correctly. Do you guys know the correct pronunciation? I just want to make sure I get that right.</div>

What&#39;s really interesting about this, at least how I find it, you have one Mississauga MP leaving for another being replaced in cabinet. This is the new transport minister, that is.

          <div class="said">the election readiness, people saying that this is Trudeau getting ready for an election. So Carter, I want to start at the very simple, you know, starting point here, which is, why do people associate a cabinet shuffle with an election? Can you just help us understand the basics here before we kind of go down some of the strategy and some of those elements?</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">I mean, it&#39;s relatively straightforward in that you don&#39;t want your cabinet to be taken up, your commodity, your vital commodity or valuable commodity of cabinet slots to be taken up by ministers who aren&#39;t going to run again because it is more likely to get a minister re-elected than it is just to get an incumbent MP. And</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">And of course, it is more likely to get an incumbent MP than a challenger. So what you&#39;re doing is you&#39;re trying to move as many people up the ladder as you can to try and get them all re-elected. So there&#39;s no sense in wasting that power, if you will, with somebody who&#39;s not going to be running again and therefore will not be part of your next government. So it&#39;s a relatively standard practice before an election to take a quick temperature</div>

          <div class="said">temperature gauge of all of your MPs and all your cabinet ministers and say, are you planning to run again? And if not, then you can reshuffle the cabinet. This is a relatively minor one. Before elections, you will sometimes see more major shuffles. I am a big fan of the major shuffle before an election. It allows the new minister to kind of walk away from bad decisions made by the previous minister and give your government a little bit of space between those. But this was a very small shuffle, just allowing the electoral</div>

          <div class="said">Well, for all of the reasons Stephen said, I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s entirely as simple as that, because if that were the only reason, then you would always put ministers in marginal seats, right? Because that would make them more likely to win. But we find quite often ministers come from safe seats because you put really high profile people in safe seats. So you find almost the opposite happens. I think it has probably as much or more to do with the overall feel of the government. And the fact is, a minister can be out there making pronouncements. And if they are going to be the minister going forward, that&#39;s different and probably of higher political value than somebody who is just keeping the lights on on their way out the door. Now, Stephen&#39;s absolutely right. It&#39;s very common pre-election. to have a pre-election shuffle. I feel maybe it was more common in the past. I&#39;m going to have to run some statistics</div>

But certainly, it used to be back when we didn&#39;t have fixed election dates everywhere, one of these great harbingers, you&#39;d see a cabinet shuffle that sort of happens for no reason in the middle of March. And you&#39;d think, okay, well, you can almost sort of set your watch to when we&#39;re going to have an election. And really, it&#39;s every time you go into an election, you want to present yourself a fresh face, even if you&#39;re an incumbent government of multiple terms. and um a cabinet shuffle especially bringing in new blood especially letting the and that&#39;s the other thing you</div>

We&#39;ve certainly seen more centralization in premier&#39;s offices, prime minister&#39;s offices. And for that reason, it just matters an awful lot less who your ministers are than it did in times of your, you know, we always idealize the times of the past. But it&#39;s certainly true that when you look at a prime minister like Chrétien, the ministers were, you know, much more autonomous and had much more individual authority than they do under Justin Trudeau or under Stephen Harper, for that matter.</div>

But the budget is certainly going to be signaling a different era in Canadian politics. The era of the pandemic, hopefully will be over.

I think I really want to stress that Canadians right now are still living COVID-19. We&#39;re all I mean, here we are yet again for we&#39;re moving into a year of recording this podcast from our basements. right and uh individually and then and doing it over over over the internet but when um</div>

          <div class="said">when canadians are all vaccinated when life gets back to normal when we almost take for granted the fact that we had this giant crisis that we have to go through and then we have to pay for all of the supports and all of the programs that occurred for the past few years and we&#39;ve got this enormous deficit and we&#39;re not quite sure what to do with it that&#39;s when things are going to get real in a hurry. And then historically, that is when Canadians, well, this is a lazy over generalization. But, you know, conservatives, for whatever reason, you know, all evidence to the contrary, tend to get the pass on the deficit, you know, they&#39;re seen as fiscal hawks. So if Canadians are in a mood to tighten the finances, they might be more in the mood to go to Aaron O&#39;Toole than they were previous. So yeah, I think it&#39;s almost an imperative that the Liberals go to the polls this spring.</div>

          <div class="said">Interesting. So you call it an imperative. Carter, talk to me, Corey&#39;s brought some interesting points. But the one I want to pick on right here is a strategy question. Let&#39;s talk about strategy for a second. There&#39;s many elements to strategy. What issue is your leading indicator? You&#39;ve talked about vaccines. We&#39;ll get into that in a second. But Corey brings up an interesting point, the strategy of how to call it. Because one of the things we have baked in as an assumption, even when we were recording in the, and you can tell me if you no longer agree that this is a valid assumption, in the summer and fall was the fact that the Trudeau government doesn&#39;t want to necessarily get blamed for calling an election, to Corey&#39;s point as well, right? So if you&#39;re strategizing right now for the liberals, what would you suggest? Would it be to orchestrate a disagreement, like Corey said? Would it be to take a page out of the Harper playbook? And more fundamentally to this point, do you agree that the Trudeau government still has to de-risk themselves as much as they can from being blamed for calling this election during a pandemic. How are you, if you&#39;re advising, navigating this sort of tightrope for the Trudeau Liberals?</div>

Therefore, I must come forward and ask for a mandate shift. So I think that Trudeau can say that. I think it&#39;s just filled with a little bit more risk because it&#39;s fairly clear that you are bringing it, even though you can still govern as though you have a majority.

What should they be doing in this intervening period? Like, is there something that either of them can do to, I</div>

          <div class="said">So those two pieces of failure you&#39;d be watching for. And the measurements on that are going to be in your polling. Are you seeing – so we always see the top-line questions. I would like to see the second-line question, like how committed are you to voting liberal? How committed are you to voting conservative? How likely are you to change your vote? Those types of questions are ones that I would be monitoring. And as long as I was keeping a relatively high I&#39;m not likely to change my vote metric, I&#39;d be going. There is no downside. There is only upside for them to go now. They have information at their fingertips that will tell them how likely it is to win. And they&#39;re not focused on areas like Alberta and Saskatchewan. It&#39;s BC, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada. That&#39;s it. So it&#39;s a relatively easy election to run because you don&#39;t have to worry about balancing off the prairie provinces.

          <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, elections are when people pay attention. And when they think an election is coming, they might pay more attention. But if this election somewhat hits Canadians on the side of the head, I don&#39;t know it will entirely. But I&#39;m not sure people are walking around saying there&#39;s an election, there&#39;s an election, right? I mean, in a moment like this, in particular, people are prone to conflate government approval with COVID response, because that&#39;s by far the biggest thing that&#39;s going on right now. An election conversation probably won&#39;t look like that. I mean, just look at British Columbia. The COVID response was obviously the biggest situation going in. The BC liberals couldn&#39;t make COVID response the issue of the day to save their lives, because we&#39;re all sort of saturated and defined on that. We get that one. So if I&#39;m the liberals, I&#39;m looking for early warning signs about what kind of risk is there. Carter talked about who other people might be open to.</div>

          <div class="said">ready for it, but like what the NDP and conservative ballot questions are, you&#39;re going to have a pretty good sense, right? Right. So if you&#39;re the liberals, I&#39;d be polling on these and saying when people start paying attention to these NDP and conservative ballot questions, will they like them? Do they have resonance? What&#39;s the risk? How movable are people right now? Are they just sort of locked into camps, be damned, or are they actually kind of exhausted and ready to try something new? And a lot of that disappears in top line horse race numbers that that media organizations love to look at. So I think that the liberals need to be very careful, as advice always for political parties, but be very careful not to believe the press and your own press. Start looking at where perhaps the ground is a bit softer than it looks from those top line numbers, because I think that there&#39;s</div>

Because both, you know, I shouldn&#39;t say both, but the other opposition parties are going to try to shift the question, right? If you want it to be a referendum on your COVID response, and you feel like that&#39;s your pathway to victory, the others might be trying to make it a referendum on Justin Trudeau and his leadership and ethics.

So I think that shifting from the pandemic response question or the taking care of us question to who&#39;s going to build the economy moving forward question is the biggest threat to the Liberal government as it ponders these election questions.</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, I&#39;ve got a question for you specifically, because it&#39;s from something you said, which I thought was really interesting, which is just a great ground rule. You don&#39;t want to hit go if you&#39;ve had a recent scandal of some sort, which kind of reminds me of opposition research. And the conventional wisdom with opposition research is that you release it during the campaign when it hurts the most. And I feel like that&#39;s right, as assumed with my next question. But I wanted to get a sense from you. Is there any world in where if you&#39;re the conservatives or the NDP holding on to a Trudeau scandal right now, and you know their game plan of the spring that you release it early? Or does this stay within the confines of an election? I think conventional wisdom would say the latter. But I wanted to just stress that with you just from the fact that you brought it up. And I thought it&#39;d be interesting to just get your thoughts on.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, I think there&#39;s an open question as to when things cause the most damage. Generally, you know, you&#39;re playing a bit of craps when you&#39;re releasing something with 10 days to go. Because sometimes it can take off. Yeah,</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">I mean, sometimes it takes off and sometimes it just fizzles. And we&#39;ve seen that in the past where you can see either a government or an opposition party just shopping around these potential scandals. Oh, this is a big thing. Look at this. Look at this thing that&#39;s huge. and it just doesn&#39;t get any legs and now you&#39;re 10 days out from the election and now you&#39;re trying to shop other things out i know that when we did you know the 2012 election everybody remembers is the lake of fire election here in alberta and everybody&#39;s like oh that&#39;s you know really brilliant you guys waited until 10 days out to do the lake of fire we didn&#39;t do the lake of fire the lake of fire happened it is a different thing we shopped scandal after scandal after scandal for 35 days prior to that and they just weren&#39;t taking um so sometimes you don&#39;t get to control it so my advice is probably not to wait too long into the you know maybe a week or two before the election is expected um start start laying the groundwork because these the other thing is it&#39;s never a day it&#39;s a ground it&#39;s it&#39;s a bunch of groundwork that establishes a pattern pattern um you know a government does not fall or not fall whether or not one person pees into a coffee cup cory</div>

          <div class="said">uh i would say well uh i am uh i&#39;m surprised and i&#39;m disappointed that the new president has decided to pull the presidential permit for keystone xl this is of of course, something that happened under the Biden administration or sorry, the Obama administration in 2015. But that was prior to Canada&#39;s world leading climate action plan. That was prior to all of the activity we&#39;ve taken here. And Canada is able to meet our Paris targets while still building the KXL pipeline. It also makes us more secure. It makes the continent stronger. It pulls allies together. Frankly, I would have hoped that President Biden would have wanted to turn a page in Canada-U.S. relationships and had this conversation with us, but he has pulled the permit for now. I do not see this as a concluded issue. I look forward to talking to the president about bringing back this permit once he better understands all of the actions Canada has taken, all of the support it has from Indigenous populations along the pipeline route, not to mention the support of every governor along the route. So this is to be continued, not to be concluded. And we look forward to ensuring Canada&#39;s continued economic prosperity. We will always fight for canadian interests we will always fight for the interests of the oil and gas industry well</div>

Without ethical and principled leadership in Ottawa, we can&#39;t expect our trading partners to meet us at the table and come to the accords that we need them to come to. Now, the other thing this does, of course, is it lays bare that the Trudeau climate plan, such as it is, is nothing except a wealth transfer. It&#39;s not actually improving the environment. President Biden knows that. That&#39;s exactly why he is not supporting KXL under these parameters. Under an O&#39;Toole government, not only would everyday Canadians not be hit by this carbon tax, but also we would have real climate action that is dictated in a way that doesn&#39;t hurt our economy, but we&#39;ll still get the support and respect of our allies, such as President Biden, who will deal with us because of our ethical and principled leadership.

You show through your actions, right? We We call it the kind of the brand experience in marketing. What is the brand experience? And so if you&#39;re going to have a brand experience that is to the center of Canadian politics, then put out people who represent the center of Canadian politics. Don&#39;t send out people who don&#39;t. That is the biggest kind of fake news. I mean, you can&#39;t just say these things. You have to show us. The electorate is barely paying attention at the best of times, and they need to see things. They can&#39;t just hear a written statement, you know, 250 words on how centrist you are. That&#39;s just not going to play, not going to play at all. And I think it&#39;s just evidence that the far right, the toxic nature of the far right emanating from the U.S., but also Boris Johnson&#39;s far right and the Brexit movement or the far right of Europe, Europe, these far-right parties are becoming less and less tolerable as we&#39;re seeing them up close. And Canada didn&#39;t go to the far right the way that some other major democracies have, but we&#39;re still learning from their experience. And it would appear that we don&#39;t like it.

But here we have a statement of intent. It&#39;s a statement of intent, both internal and external. And it&#39;s pretty bold when you get right down to it. Is it going to work? I don&#39;t know. But I disagree with the notion that he has to show through his actions because I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s how the political discourse goes these days. I think if you go to Fox News right now, you&#39;re going to see an awful lot of people pointing to things Donald Trump said that are not backed up by his actions. the dude still got 40 approval or you know depends on the pool maybe maybe 36 but still you know the reality is what they want it to be and aaron o&#39;toole putting something like this out there makes that a little bit easier this is the</div>

Public Services and Procurement Minister Anita Anand said this week that the global pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will temporarily delay shipments of its vaccine to Canada, further complicating the slow rollout of doses. I want you to be Justin Trudeau. I don&#39;t want you to be Aaron O&#39;Toole. I want you to be Justin Trudeau at that same aforementioned press conference. Give me the words that he should say when a reporter says, is this concerning? What do you think this means to Canada? The opposition has said that this actually further showcases Canada&#39;s inability to distribute and procure these vaccines properly. What would you be saying if you&#39;re Justin Trudeau at that podium?</div>

          <div class="said">Not at all. Not concerned at all. Our rollout plan was always based on the idea that things do not go perfectly. It&#39;s why Canada has purchased 10 times as many vaccines as we have citizens. It&#39;s why we have plans A, plans B, plans C. This will not affect timelines in any fashion whatsoever, and there is nothing to be concerned about whatsoever. The prudence that we brought into this will serve us well through this moment, and Canadians have nothing to worry about. Carter,</div>

And the reason we did so is that we knew that it wasn&#39;t going to work perfectly. We knew that it wasn&#39;t going to happen the way that necessarily we drew it up in the first instance. And I&#39;m pleased that we&#39;re still getting 50 percent of our allotment. The United States is getting 0% of their allotment. And this is part of our planning structures and our ability to purchase it early. This means that we&#39;re performing better than many other countries around the world.

          <div class="said">they don&#39;t need need kxl as long as transmountain comes online as as long as other options come to fruition and especially given what&#39;s happening in the oil sands right now it&#39;s quite possible if every pipeline that was under under consideration got built, that we would have too much pipeline capacity in the province of Alberta. Now, that will be seen as sacrilege in the province of Alberta. But I just I don&#39;t know that, that if I&#39;m sitting there in Ottawa, where I already have Alberta written off, and my Department of Finance is saying, Alberta needs two out of three pipelines, they&#39;re going to get two out of three still, without KXL, that I&#39;m that that worried about it.</div>

So he just said, fuck it. So it&#39;s under. I mean, there&#39;s no seats at stake. This isn&#39;t going to change his government. I honestly do think that he wishes the best for Alberta because that is, in fact, the best for Canada. But Corey&#39;s not wrong. I mean, when we get TMX online. And Line 3</div>
