You know, they&#39;re all but handing out handmaid&#39;s tail, handmaid&#39;s outfits at these events. And people are justifiably concerned about what&#39;s going to happen when the new leadership takes over. I think that you characterized authorized uh kenny as a moderate in one of our most recent podcasts and that that&#39;s really quite staggering when you start to think that in this particular ucp um you know kenny&#39;s going to be seen as a monitor a moderate and we now see evidence of what the other ucp starts to think about uh women&#39;s rights and other issues like that so</span>
