So last week, if you haven&#39;t listened to last week&#39;s episode, the first thing you need to do is listen to it. But if you aren&#39;t going to do that and you&#39;re stubborn, here&#39;s the update. We were talking about the launch of Donna Kennedy Glanz and Stephen and I were going in what I&#39;d call full disclosure mode. I was saying I knew Donna quite well and she was launching her campaign to become PC leader. We then had a much broader discussion on if there was anything like a soft launch in politics. Could you say you&#39;re launching and let&#39;s say three weeks later have a room filled with people and parading your name and really actually officially launching? Steven said, fuck no. That&#39;s not a thing. That does not exist. You guys are making this – this is false equivalency.</div>

            <div class="said">equivalency. I&#39;m sorry. People can go back and listen to the game tape. That is almost exactly what happened. Steven&#39;s like, no, that&#39;s not a thing. Stop being an idiot. By the way, I&#39;m working for Sandra Jansen. We&#39;re like, that&#39;s great. The only problem there is that Sandra Jansen has not launched a campaign until when you said that. She still hasn&#39;t launched a campaign.</div>

The roll-up is so vitally important, and when you&#39;re there on the convention, you need to have a strong whip system. You need to be the first person that the losing candidate, you know, the candidate&#39;s delegates hears from. You need to make sure they feel comfortable in the team. You should have started that groundwork ahead of time. Every single delegate should be paired to one of your delegates, and there should be call-outs done, And the logistics of some of that stuff and rolling that up to your central team so they know exactly where they stand on each ballot and making sure that, for example, if somebody loses, even though they would have come to you, they&#39;re just so demoralized, they go home or they don&#39;t vote.

            <div class="said">You need to have strategies to prepare for that. And leakage, by the way, I think is one of the things that people most sort of dismiss because you may leak over the course of this 100 delegates. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s 100 delegates. Right. A hundred delegates is a lot of fucking delegates, and people sort of underestimate just how much that can swing an effort. And there&#39;ll be ridings in Calgary and Edmonton, for example, where there will be thousands of people duking it out for one or two delegate spots. And they&#39;ll put the resources into that, and they&#39;ll ignore the leakage. So they are going to need to have each of these campaigns a very, very strong convention chair, a very, very strong chief whip. Those people are going to have to work hand in glove. You&#39;re going to need to understand exactly where you are at every moment, the amount of time between ballots. vitally important you have to have the ability to roll through your lists between ballots if you don&#39;t have those resources you are capital f-u-c-k fucked and this is all logistics that you just do not need to deal with when you have two weeks between ballots where people have to show up and just vote that&#39;s right any one of those positions yeah i mean</div>

But unless we want all of our senior political staffers to come from the Ottawa area and not have the ability to move and become part of the national government from other parts of the nation, there are going to be costs incurred with moving. That&#39;s just the reality of things. These are people who have lived in the Toronto market, have lived in the Vancouver market, wherever market you want to pick. But the fact of the matter is when you sell a million dollar house before the end of your mortgage, there are significant costs incurred to that.

I mean, or that we just pick the people who live within 100 kilometers of Ottawa or they say, listen, you&#39;re going to have to eat that $200,000 yourself.
