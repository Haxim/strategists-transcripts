            <span class="text">Let&#39;s go. So here we go. Let&#39;s fill people in first, and then I&#39;ll let Carter get his say. So last week, if you haven&#39;t listened to last week&#39;s episode, the first thing you need to do is listen to it. But if you aren&#39;t going to do that and you&#39;re stubborn, here&#39;s the update. We were talking about the launch of Donna Kennedy Glanz and Stephen and I were going in what I&#39;d call full disclosure mode. I was saying I knew Donna quite well and she was launching her campaign to become PC leader. We then had a much broader discussion on if there was anything like a soft launch in politics. Could you say you&#39;re launching and let&#39;s say three weeks later have a room filled with people and parading your name and really actually officially launching? Steven said, fuck no. That&#39;s not a thing. That does not exist. You guys are making this – this is false equivalency.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">equivalency. I&#39;m sorry. People can go back and listen to the game tape. That is almost exactly what happened. Steven&#39;s like, no, that&#39;s not a thing. Stop being an idiot. By the way, I&#39;m working for Sandra Jansen. We&#39;re like, that&#39;s great. The only problem there is that Sandra Jansen has not launched a campaign until when you said that. She still hasn&#39;t launched a campaign.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay. I&#39;m not Sandra Jansen. Lay it on us. How do you defend last week, Carter? Or do you defend last week? I&#39;m</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not defending anything. I totally reject your premise, and I move forward. I&#39;m trying to get Sandra Jansen into the race. I think there&#39;s hundreds of people trying to get Sandra Jansen into this race. She&#39;s not in the race. It&#39;s a different thing. There</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There are dozens of people who believe that bullshit. The rest of us, though, in adult land, feel like you maybe launched a campaign last week. But that&#39;s okay, because I like to keep the scales balanced. So I&#39;m going to launch another PC leadership campaign today. How do you like it? Are</span>

But frankly, it was embarrassing for the first person. By the time the second person soft launches like that, too, it&#39;s just a thing. Apparently, it&#39;s the new seasonal color. It&#39;s like cerulean. We&#39;re all soft launching badly. I mean, Chris Alexander for the Conservatives yesterday essentially soft launched his campaign by saying—</span>

So maybe if you have the expectation, others are going to follow the lead and I&#39;ll jump in. You sit back a bit and you launch your campaign afterwards. Afterwards, maybe, in particular, you take that approach if you feel that the field is light, right? And you want to get people to a point where they&#39;re feeling the field is wanting, and then you jump in as, you know, the hero from afar, somebody who&#39;s going to come in from out of town and save everything.

So is this is this actually something we can validate as as the opinions of the Nenshi campaign? By the way, for the listeners out there, he looks like his head is about to explode.</span>

Let&#39;s end this segment on understanding maybe what some of the other ground rules are for a leadership contest, where what else do you kind of need to do in order to prepare yourself yourself best for that convention floor?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this convention in particular, are going to be a bit surprised. The roll-up is so vitally important, and when you&#39;re there on the convention, you need to have a strong whip system. You need to be the first person that the losing candidate, you know, the candidate&#39;s delegates hears from. You need to make sure they feel comfortable in the team. You should have started that groundwork ahead of time. Every single delegate should be paired to one of your delegates, and there should be call-outs done, And the logistics of some of that stuff and rolling that up to your central team so they know exactly where they stand on each ballot and making sure that, for example, if somebody loses, even though they would have come to you, they&#39;re just so demoralized, they go home or they don&#39;t vote. And that happens, guys. That happens a lot. Leakage. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You need to have strategies to prepare for that. And leakage, by the way, I think is one of the things that people most sort of dismiss because you may leak over the course of this 100 delegates. Let&#39;s say it&#39;s 100 delegates. Right. A hundred delegates is a lot of fucking delegates, and people sort of underestimate just how much that can swing an effort. And there&#39;ll be ridings in Calgary and Edmonton, for example, where there will be thousands of people duking it out for one or two delegate spots. And they&#39;ll put the resources into that, and they&#39;ll ignore the leakage. So they are going to need to have each of these campaigns a very, very strong convention chair, a very, very strong chief whip. Those people are going to have to work hand in glove. You&#39;re going to need to understand exactly where you are at every moment, the amount of time between ballots. vitally important you have to have the ability to roll through your lists between ballots if you don&#39;t have those resources you are capital f-u-c-k fucked and this is all logistics that you just do not need to deal with when you have two weeks between ballots where people have to show up and just vote that&#39;s right any one of those positions yeah i mean</span>

This is about an attitudinal shift. This is about regulation shift. This is about we have done a tremendous amount to make this feel different. We just haven&#39;t had to do it through legislation. And if you&#39;re going to count bills as progress, if you&#39;re going to count laws and more and more regulation as progress, then you&#39;ve got the wrong metric. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to say in the room. You&#39;re saying in the room. And then I&#39;m going to say the exact same thing out of the room.</span>

But unless we want all of our senior political staffers to come from the Ottawa area and not have the ability to move and become part of the national government from other parts of the nation, there are going to be costs incurred with moving. That&#39;s just the reality of things. These are people who have lived in the Toronto market, have lived in the Vancouver market, wherever market you want to pick. But the fact of the matter is when you sell a million dollar house before the end of your mortgage, there are significant costs incurred to that. And if we&#39;re just going to lock people down, if they&#39;re unfortunate enough to be in the first two years of their term, then</span>

            <span class="text">stupid that we would sort of suggest that they have to foot the bill to take a job in a government when we live in a democracy where senior staff roll over. I don&#39;t think anybody seriously suggests they should have just kept the conservatives in the job because there&#39;s no moving costs involved in that. Right. I mean, or that we just pick the people who live within 100 kilometers of Ottawa or they say, listen, you&#39;re going to have to eat that $200,000 yourself. Yeah, you&#39;re the best person for the job, but we just don&#39;t want to do it.

So we&#39;ll look at it. But none of the people who you&#39;re talking about acted improperly. They all acted based on the policies of the day.
