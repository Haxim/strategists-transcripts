Trust me, on June 22nd, you&#39;ll look back at the start of the campaign and recall in a way you can&#39;t grasp now how much possibility you thought lay before you. It&#39;s more over than you imagine.</span>

Don&#39;t be reckless with other people&#39;s endorsements. Don&#39;t put up with people who are reckless with yours. Remember Hogan&#39;s Law of Leadership Politics.</span>
