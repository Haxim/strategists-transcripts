Of course, for those not familiar, there was a story that was published about Jonathan Dennis, the former justice minister&#39;s wedding. The size of that wedding was larger than COVID restrictions would allow at that point. He felt like someone was leaking to the press and he wanted to figure out who was leaking, and thereby he hired a political fixer to trace the phone records of this journalist.

Because, Carter, in the political roadmap we&#39;ve carved out on this show before, we&#39;ve talked about campaign managers, campaign strategists, field directors, all the positions across the board, right? Comms, you&#39;re a finance person. We rarely talk about what I&#39;d call the dark arts positions. And Corey, this kind of leads into your, Dave, too, thank you for smoking, the merchants of death sort of political positions, right we hear them carter you mentioned a few of them spin doctor what the hell&#39;s a spin doctor is that real oppo research is that is that really like a specialized role like or is that someone just that&#39;s good at google like i want to dispel some of this stuff for folks right fixer political fixer i you know we&#39;ve heard the term but i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever met one and if i have they haven&#39;t certainly called themselves that so let&#39;s can we talk about some of these dark arts sort of roles and politics that people either assign or apply. Is there any others you want to throw onto the table, Carter, that you&#39;ve heard and maybe want to help dispel the myth of or talk about if they&#39;re real or not and what exactly their function is and how we&#39;ve seen them take part in the political process?</div>

I think that that&#39;s not a spinner. I think that that&#39;s just a hack. It doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. Um, spin is, is fundamentally based in fact, in the way that we view the facts. Um, so the spinners we&#39;ve certainly seen, we&#39;ve also seen a lot of kind of dark arts on the social media side. Uh, we&#39;ve talked about bots and trolls, uh, on this before, and, and you can buy bots, you can buy trolls. Uh, there&#39;s, there&#39;s ways of setting up your own internal, uh, troll factory Or bot factory as well. All of those types of things have been done to promote or to tear down other candidates. So social media is certainly a place. And I think that the other place where we actually see a lot of dark arts is something like what we&#39;re seeing with the Jason Kenney leadership right now, where there is mining of memberships, mining</div>
