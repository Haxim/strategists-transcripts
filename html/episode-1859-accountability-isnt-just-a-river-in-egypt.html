<p data-start="386.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> actually going</p>
<p data-start="391.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> to be honest.</p>
<p data-start="392.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, I was going to be, but maybe it can be like, you know, we'll see. Can we both ask you questions?</p>
<p data-start="392.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I mean, I was</p>
<p data-start="394.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> but maybe</p>

<p data-start="560.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> it cause brain cancer? Because</p>
<p data-start="563.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I've heard that if you combine the fluoride with the 5G, it's</p>
<p data-start="564.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you combine</p>
<p data-start="567.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> not good.</p>
<p data-start="568.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> It's not good. So, like, what are you going to do about the fluoride? What are you going to do about the 5G? I'm just, like, I'm kind of concerned, and I don't have a lot of time, so, like, that's probably my issue.</p>
<p data-start="578.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, okay. Okay, so, listen, I think you're okay with fluoride. Fluoride's kind of a natural thing. It's in a lot of water sources. is just not in calgary's naturally um it's good for your teeth not not really a federal issue but uh you know happy to generally support good science and good health you know we</p>

<p data-start="668.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> doubling</p>
<p data-start="671.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> um this part this one was not mine to win though this one i</p>
<p data-start="675.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i don't care who did the campaign it was not going to be successful well tell us the context</p>
<p data-start="679.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> well tell us the context tell us what was going on i think we we we briefly alluded to it in previous episodes but tell us what was at stake why there is a by-election why you decided just if you're open to it working with this group um</p>
<p data-start="693.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> and then and then some of the dynamics and then lessons learned and shit we like to document this stuff well</p>
<p data-start="699.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> as you uh i'll start kind of you know in</p>
<p data-start="702.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> in the middle uh i worked with this group because they paid me uh i found that to be uh steven that was very influential i don't know if you're gonna be working with</p>
<p data-start="711.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> i don't know if you're gonna be working with this group again oh</p>
<p data-start="713.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh my god</p>
<p data-start="714.2"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> god</p>
<p data-start="714.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> god no</p>
<p data-start="714.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="714.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="714.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="714.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> no and uh you know they're they're my kind of people um the kind that pay the</p>
<p data-start="719.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> kind that pay the kind that pay every</p>
<p data-start="719.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> kind that pay every</p>
<p data-start="720.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> every</p>
<p data-start="721.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> every</p>
<p data-start="721.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> every every month and</p>
<p data-start="723.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> every month and</p>
<p data-start="724.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> and so i i worked with them and uh they're</p>
<p data-start="727.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> they're really great people i really did enjoy working with them but they are two and a a half years into a mandate and they're not super popular and this was a by-election where they were replacing two of the left-leaning councillors um who had stepped down to one retired completely and the other one uh became an mla uh so this uh this by-election was you know to replace two left-leaning councillors uh we thought that uh abc vancouver was was uh which</p>
<p data-start="748.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> so this</p>
<p data-start="759.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> which is a group you fairly popular yeah</p>
<p data-start="759.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> you fairly popular yeah</p>
<p data-start="761.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="761.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah and</p>
<p data-start="762.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> and uh we were wrong uh they were not and uh you</p>
<p data-start="766.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know we did a lot of advertising did a lot of science did a lot of brochure drops did a lot of you know all the things that you normally do did a lot of telephoning um but the truth is that it just didn't have the the ground game that we needed it didn't have the air war didn't stick uh there was no relationship with the media it was really a tricky campaign um and we got and the result was we got absolutely destroyed so</p>
<p data-start="792.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> so okay we can talk about the lessons of why you lost although i think you've indicated already in some of this the analysis of you know what that looked like what was the coolest most interesting thing you did or the thing you did for the first time that you've been wanting to do that you did on this campaign it could be about people it could be a campaign tactic it could be as simple as how you structure things um</p>
<p data-start="814.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> um what's something that you got to do new this time or</p>
<p data-start="817.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> novel this time</p>
<p data-start="819.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> novels a bit of a stretch but there was a we we did uh what i call the 250 meetings in 50 days right so the goal was five meetings a day instead of door knocking because</p>
<p data-start="827.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> the goal was</p>
<p data-start="830.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> because in in you know like for example cory's</p>
<p data-start="833.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> cory's running in confederation it is conceivable for him to door knock the entire war riding um you know in a period of time sorry did you say conceivable or inconceivable conceivable</p>
<p data-start="841.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> sorry did you say conceivable or inconceivable conceivable with volunteers conceivable yeah</p>
<p data-start="844.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> volunteers conceivable yeah</p>
<p data-start="845.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah yeah with volunteers yeah right it's</p>
<p data-start="846.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> with volunteers yeah right it's it's reason it's reasonable size um the city of vancouver has a city-wide system so there is no way that we were going to be able to door knock uh</p>
<p data-start="854.3"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> so there is no</p>
<p data-start="857.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh some 600 000 homes like it was just not</p>
<p data-start="860.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> not going to happen i think it's actually more like 400 000 homes yeah the point</p>
<p data-start="863.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah the point is</p>
<p data-start="863.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> point is the point is made we</p>
<p data-start="865.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> we we simply could not door knock that number of doors especially when half of them are in towers. So we did this 250 meetings in 50 days. It went fairly well. But</p>
<p data-start="879.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> in the end, we were meeting with people who didn't have a high enough give a fuck factor to really vote for us. They were happy to take the meetings but not happy to vote for us.</p>
<p data-start="886.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> They were happy to</p>
<p data-start="889.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm very intrigued by this because for two reasons. The second I'll introduce in a moment that might have a tie into the ground game of campaigns across this country in this federal election. But the first part of it It was how</p>
<p data-start="900.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> how did you set up these meetings? Were they of like influencer groups or people that could bring in voters? Were they just random meetings? Who was attending? And is this a political tactic you'd replicate? I'm curious about the nuts and bolts of it, Carter. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="915.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I mean, so we met with Chinese benevolent groups. We met with Jewish groups. We met with regular people in their living rooms. We met with every group that had a meeting hall. We were at their meeting hall at some point. Every meeting that we did, we wanted it to be specific to our campaign. Did you set these meetings up</p>
<p data-start="940.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> you set these meetings up on your own, or was this attending events and already existing? We set up the meetings on</p>
<p data-start="946.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> We set up the meetings on our own. 250</p>
<p data-start="948.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> own. 250 of those in 50 days on behalf of the two candidates on your ballot.</p>
<p data-start="949.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> 250 of</p>
<p data-start="952.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> behalf of</p>
<p data-start="955.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right, and the two candidates attended every meeting. Ken Sim, the mayor, attended probably 80% of them. Really? His commitment was phenomenal. So he went to as many meetings as he could. we had meetings as small as five or ten people and as large as several hundred people. And it was basically meet and greets where the two outcomes were to raise a little bit of money and to get</p>
<p data-start="962.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Really? His commitment was</p>
<p data-start="985.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> people to get their friends out to vote. And the events themselves were successful, but the getting people out to vote was not successful.</p>
<p data-start="994.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Go ahead, Corey. Corey, I've got clarifying questions for Carter, too. Because the operation</p>
<p data-start="995.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Go</p>
<p data-start="998.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="998.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> the operation was a success, but the patient died kind of energy there, right? Like, I'm curious, who</p>
<p data-start="1005.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> showed up, and</p>
<p data-start="1006.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> and were they already on your side? Were they undecided? Were they opposed? Like, I get why people would go to a meeting if the mayor is going to be there, too, I'll say. That's kind of why they showed up? I</p>
<p data-start="1014.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's kind of why they</p>
<p data-start="1016.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> I was wondering that, too. I think, actually,</p>
<p data-start="1017.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> too. I think, actually, that was the flaw</p>
<p data-start="1019.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> flaw in the plan. land i</p>
<p data-start="1021.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> think people went to go and see the mayor yes and they didn't go to facilitate</p>
<p data-start="1023.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> yes and they didn't go</p>
<p data-start="1024.5"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> go to</p>
<p data-start="1025.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> facilitate any votes for us they they weren't motivated by</p>
<p data-start="1029.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> by the the by-election they were motivated by seeing and meeting meeting</p>
<p data-start="1033.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> meeting the mayor um</p>
<p data-start="1034.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> um and</p>
<p data-start="1035.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> the mayor is you know he's chinese</p>
<p data-start="1037.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> mayor he's he's very</p>
<p data-start="1039.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> very popular in the chinese community he had uh</p>
<p data-start="1041.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh the south asian community is very popular in south asian community um</p>
<p data-start="1045.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> um but we saw very low turnout from those two communities in the actual by-election were</p>
<p data-start="1050.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> were either Neither of your candidates from those communities?</p>
<p data-start="1052.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Neither of the candidates. We had three, between me and the two candidates, we were indistinguishable.</p>
<p data-start="1055.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> and the</p>
<p data-start="1060.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Absolutely indistinguishable. I</p>
<p data-start="1062.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> indistinguishable.</p>
<p data-start="1062.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> indistinguishable. I</p>
<p data-start="1064.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> actually was mistaken for Jamie Stein, one of our candidates, two times.</p>
<p data-start="1064.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> mistaken</p>
<p data-start="1071.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> It was not good. But</p>
<p data-start="1072.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> But</p>
<p data-start="1073.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah, that was, you know, it was a successful operation, but it was not successful in the way that we'd want it to go. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1073.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1083.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I'll let you explain to me in greater detail where the biggest fail points were. But I have a second part to this meeting question, which is you talked about Vancouver being inaccessible with half a million homes being in towers.</p>
<p data-start="1099.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> But was any part of this strategy for</p>
<p data-start="1103.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> you, Carter, the</p>
<p data-start="1104.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> meeting strategy, coming from the place that you've maybe lost a bit of faith on door-to-door direct contact? Tina</p>
<p data-start="1115.2"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> showed her husband, John, how to invest with CIBC Investor's Edge.</p>
<p data-start="1118.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Investor's Edge.</p>
<p data-start="1118.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> John</p>
<p data-start="1118.6"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> John doesn't have the right tools to build his dream patio, but</p>
<p data-start="1122.6"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> now he does have the right tools for self-directed investing. Then, John showed Investor's Edge to his neighbor, Colin. Colin is nervous about the buzzing from the beehive in his shed, but</p>
<p data-start="1133.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> loves getting the latest market buzz to his phone every day. Now,</p>
<p data-start="1138.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> his portfolio is looking sweet like honey. Be in the know. Invest confidently with CIBC Investor's Edge. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1149.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I mean, well, first of all, we just couldn't even begin to understand where we would go with the door-to-door direct contact. It was a by-election. It was really short timelines. We weren't going to be in a position where door-to-door was going to be able to work. I'm not sure how Corey's finding door-to-door, but in the worst case scenario, it's one in 20 houses that opens the door and you're getting maybe one in two of those to commit to you. And also, there's a very real possibility of people just telling you that they're going to support you to your face and then not supporting you afterwards, which is part of what I ran into in Surrey. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1193.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> People I mean, if everybody who told us they were going to vote for us voted for us, we would have won in a landslide. And</p>
<p data-start="1198.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And the same with Mike DeYoung.</p>
<p data-start="1200.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Mike DeYoung in the B.C. liberal race, we had tons of identified vote and we got them out. they just chose to vote for someone else so</p>
<p data-start="1209.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> door knocking has its door knocking and direct contact has its pitfalls it</p>
<p data-start="1209.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> door</p>
<p data-start="1209.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> door knocking has</p>
<p data-start="1214.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> does you know it's interesting i'm certainly getting more than one in 20 people at the doors but one of the things you um you notice is there</p>
<p data-start="1222.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> there i feel at least i'm curious your thoughts on this with so many people having even ring doorbells these days oh yeah if if they see who's coming and they don't want to talk to you they just won't come to the door and and</p>
<p data-start="1229.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh yeah if</p>
<p data-start="1234.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> and so it's the doors feel better than they would have felt in elections past simply because people select not to have the conversation at certain points right yeah</p>
<p data-start="1243.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i</p>
<p data-start="1243.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="1244.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="1244.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> i still think there's a big place for them and you know there are ways to test that commitment including asking them for things like taking a sign if that's the election you're doing i think those are important things still but there's</p>
<p data-start="1254.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's no question the nature of doors is changing the nature of conversations is changing and um and</p>
<p data-start="1259.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> and i think that's something that campaigns are going to have to grapple with for the next bit In some ways, Vancouver might be a little bit ahead on that curve simply because of the nature of it being a lot of condo towns. Density and</p>
<p data-start="1268.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> being a lot of condo towns. Density and</p>
<p data-start="1270.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p data-start="1271.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="1271.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, did this campaign introduce anything on the voter contact side for you that was either emulated or directly taken from some of those advances in like what door knocking looked like or the change in philosophies? And I'm thinking of stuff like deep canvassing and other things where you do spend a long time chatting with people. even in these meetings would you classify them as being meetings of depth and and and kind of substance or are they directly to the ask i'm kind of curious like if if if one type of meeting despite the fail of the campaign one type of meeting unearthed a different type of result sort of thing um because i find that fascinating just as well i'll tell you i</p>
<p data-start="1272.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> this campaign introduce</p>
<p data-start="1307.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> well i'll tell you i mean i think the the meetings thing was a heck of a lot more deep canvas like yeah and it was uh uh just a simple turn and burn in a good way or not in not</p>
<p data-start="1314.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah and it</p>
<p data-start="1318.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> in a good way or not in not so productive way you think in</p>
<p data-start="1321.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> in a very productive way i mean most of the time we were leaving with people on side um but you</p>
<p data-start="1323.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> mean most of</p>
<p data-start="1329.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> know they weren't necessarily i mean they might have just been on side because the mayor was there they but at the end of the day um we weren't going to be deep canvassing the number of people that showed up to those meetings right those meetings were infinitely more productive than door knocking would have been. Our opposition did some door knocking. But most of the campaign was conducted with media relations, social media and advertising.</p>
<p data-start="1340.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> those meetings</p>
<p data-start="1356.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, well, so that's, I guess, the obvious question. What did the other guys do? Maybe they were always destined to win for other conditions. But what kind of tactics did you see the winning campaigns use? Well,</p>
<p data-start="1366.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, and let's be clear, there were three campaigns that could have won, right? The Greens could have won the one city could have won well did win and uh cope could have won and and did win sean two people got</p>
<p data-start="1378.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> sean two people got two people got seats and they were both progressive parties is that correct carter yeah</p>
<p data-start="1379.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> got</p>
<p data-start="1379.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> got</p>
<p data-start="1384.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah like one is a declared communist so he won he's the guy with cope um he's uh an interesting cat um little little personality</p>
<p data-start="1397.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> pieces</p>
<p data-start="1399.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> that we're not going to get into or unless i</p>
<p data-start="1402.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> unless i</p>
<p data-start="1403.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i get sued um but the the uh</p>
<p data-start="1408.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> The</p>
<p data-start="1409.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Greens didn't run a campaign at all.</p>
<p data-start="1411.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> The Greens didn't mount a campaign at all. We saw, I believe, one Green sign throughout the course</p>
<p data-start="1417.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> course of the election campaign.</p>
<p data-start="1420.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> One city did do some signage and they did do some posters and things. But Cope actually put up the most, you know, they plaster posters on these poles, telephone poles or lighting poles. They have these big round cylinders that they post posters on. can i ask you before you go</p>
<p data-start="1440.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> can i ask you before you go further it's a citywide race for two seats list of like 15 people that were like on the ballot if am i not am i right like around that what's</p>
<p data-start="1448.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> am i right</p>
<p data-start="1450.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> what's a spending limit what's a spending limit for that i'm</p>
<p data-start="1450.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> limit</p>
<p data-start="1451.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> limit what's</p>
<p data-start="1451.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> what's a</p>
<p data-start="1453.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm curious if you're running a half a million persons like what do you what do you what do you get to play with you</p>
<p data-start="1458.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> get 120 415</p>
<p data-start="1458.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> get 120 415 dollars per candidate that's</p>
<p data-start="1463.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's not a lot</p>
<p data-start="1463.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's not a lot</p>
<p data-start="1463.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> lot no</p>
<p data-start="1464.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="1464.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's bullshit is what it is it's absolute fucking bullshit it makes me so so angry why are we only getting 17 voter turnout well i'll tell you why because you won't let us fucking communicate with people you won't let us actually advertise to people i couldn't buy radio i couldn't buy television i couldn't buy um you know getting a brochure i was a fucking nightmare like</p>
<p data-start="1465.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's bullshit</p>
<p data-start="1486.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> like and</p>
<p data-start="1487.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> then they're shocked shocked i tell you we only got 17 of the population out to vote well</p>
<p data-start="1492.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> well i can't believe 17 of it fucking knew that there was an actual by-election like</p>
<p data-start="1498.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> like it is is bullshit they gave the electoral office two million dollars to plan the by-election and they get the candidates a couple hundred and twenty thousand bucks per and cope and and uh uh one city only ran one candidate they can only spend 120 grand and</p>
<p data-start="1515.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> and they kicked our ass we could spend 240 i'm</p>
<p data-start="1518.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> not feeling a lot of accountability from you right now steven yeah and</p>
<p data-start="1522.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="1522.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1522.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1522.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1522.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1522.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> and uh by the way i'm</p>
<p data-start="1523.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i'm</p>
<p data-start="1524.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm not gonna lie to you i think that it's i think that there's some campaigns that i've run that</p>
<p data-start="1524.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> i'm not gonna lie to you i think</p>
<p data-start="1531.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i could have run better right and we could have won i</p>
<p data-start="1534.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> think that if the three of us were running this campaign together with um with jesus christ himself we wouldn't have been able to pull this campaign off it</p>
<p data-start="1542.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> wouldn't</p>
<p data-start="1546.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> was a it was not ours to win it was just not ours to win it's</p>
<p data-start="1550.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's a good rant so So</p>
<p data-start="1550.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> so So what did we learn? What's your big takeaway from this campaign? Before</p>
<p data-start="1551.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> So what did</p>
<p data-start="1555.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Before</p>
<p data-start="1555.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Before you answer, how</p>
<p data-start="1556.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Before</p>
<p data-start="1556.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Before you</p>
<p data-start="1556.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1556.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> you answer, how are you going to be a better you?</p>
<p data-start="1559.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Before you jump in, Carter, I just want to talk to Colin directly. Stephen Carter is a different person than Corey Hogan, okay? Corey is a great candidate. Stephen is great at what he does, okay? But I just want you to know, Colin, I know you're listening. I hope you're enjoying it. We should gift Colin a free Patreon. Do you think we could do that, Corey? we probably</p>
<p data-start="1580.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> probably</p>
<p data-start="1580.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> probably should yeah we probably should that's good absolutely does</p>
<p data-start="1581.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah we probably should that's good absolutely does that feel like you're</p>
<p data-start="1583.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> does that feel like you're bribing the guy who greenlit you yeah cory does that feel like i don't i</p>
<p data-start="1584.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you're bribing</p>
<p data-start="1587.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> does that feel like i don't i don't know if he i don't know how the process works exactly he interviewed me i'm sure he's green lat he was</p>
<p data-start="1591.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm sure he's green lat he was</p>
<p data-start="1592.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> was green lat</p>

<p data-start="1595.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> now that's post tense it's green lat um yeah i just want to let colin know that because he's probably like well okay well what did i make a mistake no you didn't you're fine everything's good everything's good we could just chill we</p>

<p data-start="1627.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> great thank you hey carter thank you you're really helpful okay</p>
<p data-start="1628.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="1630.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> you are predestined to lose i get that you</p>
<p data-start="1633.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> did some interesting cool stuff um what</p>
<p data-start="1636.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm usually interested in in these campaigns is um</p>
<p data-start="1640.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> not</p>
<p data-start="1641.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> not necessarily what the other side did to beat you but what you think your side could have done better to get the gains to maximize the gains you could have had not to win but to maximize so optimization of certain things where</p>
<p data-start="1655.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> where do you think that was that you don't have to throw people under the bus but you could also talk about yourself but uh but talk to me about optimization i'm really curious about that i</p>
<p data-start="1658.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> yourself</p>
<p data-start="1658.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> yourself but</p>
<p data-start="1663.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> think our media relations was really poor and i'll own that in hindsight was</p>
<p data-start="1666.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> in hindsight was it just a pure media air war campaign could you have skipped skipped out on most of the ground you think i</p>
<p data-start="1673.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> think that we could have done well i mean basically we did i</p>
<p data-start="1676.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> i mean we put up signs using the reverse you know the no what</p>
<p data-start="1680.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> what</p>
<p data-start="1680.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> what was it the opt-out clause um the negative negative billing option um that's how i read about it in the paper</p>
<p data-start="1687.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> how i read about it in the paper yeah no that</p>
<p data-start="1689.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> that worked that worked out really well um we uh we we ran this more like an air war than we than it was as a ground game.</p>
<p data-start="1700.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> But honestly, when you look at how the vote turned out and where the vote came from, the</p>
<p data-start="1704.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> visible minority population was not engaged. I bought a lot of ethnic ads, but I think we could have done a lot more ethnic media, a lot more ethnic interviews. And, you know, that was probably one of the areas that we dropped the ball, as well as just general media interviews. years like um</p>
<p data-start="1726.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know we didn't go on ck and w i don't think once uh which is their big qr 770 style or you know talk radio station um you know why</p>
<p data-start="1738.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> well because we were avoiding talking about issues that may have been challenging to us and instead of going on and trying to control the narrative you</p>
<p data-start="1745.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> and instead of</p>
<p data-start="1750.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know so that avoidance um created real problems i think for us as a as a campaign pain but uh</p>
<p data-start="1758.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> again i don't think it would have changed the outcome but it might have changed the way that we are perceived within the market um</p>
<p data-start="1763.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> um and the the market at this stage perceives abc vancouver as really the the fourth place almost fifth place uh party well i guess it was the fifth place party well</p>
<p data-start="1774.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> was the</p>
<p data-start="1776.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> well so that that's a that was one of my questions that was coming like what do you think are the long-term consequences of this by-election for well i'll tell you what</p>
<p data-start="1783.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> well i'll tell you what i was telling them at the beginning this is the beginning of their election campaign in 2026 if you win both seats then you're well on track to winning and holding on to the city council if you lose um both seats then then you're you've</p>
<p data-start="1788.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> 2026 if</p>
<p data-start="1800.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> got a hill to climb and and not only did we lose the the seats we lost them badly</p>
<p data-start="1806.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> so you know we beat the independents uh that were in hundreds of vote category yeah we got 8 000 votes the winners got 31 000 votes 33 000 votes um like we weren't within striking distance so if you're you know right did you know that did</p>
<p data-start="1813.2"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> yeah we got 8 000</p>
<p data-start="1823.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know right did you know that did you know that though carter or was it kind of a surprise to you when you found out on election night i</p>
<p data-start="1830.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i don't believe the word surprised has left my mouth uh uh we we you know there's certain things that that that tell you where you are? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1839.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> tell you where you are? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1841.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, yeah, like what? Like what were the indicators of the fact that this was not going to necessarily, like a miracle would have been required to get one of the top two spots?</p>
<p data-start="1850.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think that we can relate it a little bit to Corey's campaign. When you get volunteer engagement and you get money coming in through the door, then you are running a good campaign. You need both of those things to really say that the campaign is resonating with Gen Pop. up um we</p>
<p data-start="1867.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> we didn't have volunteer engagement and we had money we had money but</p>
<p data-start="1870.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> but we had money because we're the the government not because we were running a spectacular campaign you couldn't do i mean out beyond</p>
<p data-start="1873.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> because</p>
<p data-start="1873.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> because we were</p>
<p data-start="1875.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> campaign you couldn't do i mean out beyond the 250 what were you going to do anyways too right like yeah well</p>
<p data-start="1880.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> well i mean yeah i mean we raised as much as we spent yeah</p>
<p data-start="1883.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah right good for us isn't that isn't that wonderful but this really could have been a catalyst for starting to raise money for 2026 and some could argue should have been. You know, I don't think that Corey's going to turn off the taps when he reaches his max spend in Confederation. You raise money when you can raise money and elections are when you can raise money. It enables the spending in your constituency or in your party for the next few, because you need an executive director, you</p>
<p data-start="1883.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="1883.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah right good</p>
<p data-start="1884.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> us isn't</p>
<p data-start="1884.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> isn't</p>
<p data-start="1890.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1890.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> and some</p>
<p data-start="1912.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you need a comms person for your party.</p>
<p data-start="1914.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> You pay them out of the money that you have surplus in your campaign. you</p>
<p data-start="1919.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you don't you can't raise money now right</p>
<p data-start="1921.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> right like it's it's super hard i mean it's super hard to raise money i don't know if you're aware zane but there's a federal election um and it's dragging money out of the municipal markets that's</p>
<p data-start="1930.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> dragging</p>
<p data-start="1930.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> dragging money</p>
<p data-start="1933.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's why i'm getting my calgary party gear ready i'm ready</p>
<p data-start="1936.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'll tell you calgary party's had a good week too i'm not going to talk about it calgary party given</p>
<p data-start="1939.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> calgary party given some of the separatist talk right on the money i like it i like it it's good I want Calgary to separate from Alberta when Alberta separates from Canada these</p>
<p data-start="1945.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="1945.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's good I</p>
<p data-start="1951.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> these are</p>
<p data-start="1952.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> are the things I believe and I'll be sharing with everyone on stage as a</p>
<p data-start="1953.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'll be sharing with everyone on stage as a guest of the campaign that's wonderful</p>
<p data-start="1960.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> paintconfedred.ca you can hear more of my theories my</p>
<p data-start="1966.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> theories will be available</p>
<p data-start="1968.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> oh look at the time</p>
<p data-start="1969.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh look</p>
<p data-start="1972.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> why are you even here I</p>
<p data-start="1973.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> are you even here I</p>
<p data-start="1974.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> I don't</p>
<p data-start="1975.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> know</p>
<p data-start="1975.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> know</p>
<p data-start="1975.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> know I</p>
<p data-start="1975.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I got nowhere else to</p>
<p data-start="1977.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> to go. Do you feel like we held him accountable enough?</p>
<p data-start="1977.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> to go. Do you feel like we held him accountable</p>
<p data-start="1978.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> accountable</p>
<p data-start="1979.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, where did you fuck up the most? Let's get back to it. Where did you... Yeah, let's get to you. Okay, media relations. Is there any regret for taking the gig? Is there any regret for... Where do you kind of feel like, fuck, I learned something? You know, I'm good at what I do, but I learned something. Where did I fuck up the most?</p>
<p data-start="1983.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> relations.</p>
<p data-start="1996.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think the biggest fuck up was not being able to come up with anything that would change</p>
<p data-start="2000.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> change the channel when we needed to change the channel and not being able to really</p>
<p data-start="2004.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> really jump, jump you know jump start us into something spectacular you know I think that you</p>
<p data-start="2011.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> know we weren't able to come up with a great slogan we weren't or or theme to the campaign because I don't like slogans but we didn't have a theme to the campaign we didn't have you know we were stuck in we've</p>
<p data-start="2023.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> we've done you know these are all the great things we've done in the past except no one believes them no one believes that all these great things were done by ABC and I wasn't able to come up with something that was better so we weren't able to communicate um</p>
<p data-start="2030.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> one believes that all these great</p>
<p data-start="2039.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> um the potential of abc and</p>
<p data-start="2042.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> and i think that that was really the biggest failing uh</p>
<p data-start="2045.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh forget about what you've done in the past but what's the potential what are you going to get if you vote us back in what are you going to get then and that to me was was a great failing because the i think that people are as you may be aware i think that people are relatively selfish and uh their vote needs to be about what's in the future so that to me is uh you know the the problem okay</p>
<p data-start="2073.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> cory i'll let you ask one more question to stephen carter and then i think i need you to leave uh</p>
<p data-start="2077.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> uh this is like the game quiz show</p>

<p data-start="2193.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> -da. Later,</p>
<p data-start="2193.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Later, Hogan. Okay, Carter, he's gone. So, man,</p>
<p data-start="2197.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> so many things. Let's boil it down this way. Two topics, 15 minutes. Okay? Sure. Topic number one, carny is coming to calgary uh pauliev is as we speak tonight um packing anywhere between 10 to 15 000 people in edmonton yeah</p>
<p data-start="2215.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> let's start there um</p>
<p data-start="2217.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> um the</p>
<p data-start="2219.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> events</p>
<p data-start="2220.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> events don't seem to be a rebuttal for the polls but</p>
<p data-start="2223.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> man are they still fucking impressive and they're growing so tell me what's happening like is this entering a wave beyond politics that's not going to have a political impact that people are just going to go see the act like Pierre's in town and we got to go see the best of is this related to the politics and we're going to be surprised like what is your years of experience strategist gut sense telling you that these two things are divorced that this guy's just</p>
<p data-start="2250.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> happens to be running for prime minister while putting on rock concerts across the country and it's not going to have impact on his polling or that a and b definitely converge at some point and over I think</p>
<p data-start="2260.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> over I think that these events are not replacements for polling polling right i think that polling does something completely different but let's be very clear about the number of people who have a super high give a fuck factor um there is a huge group of people for whom the give a fuck factor is really high and they're going to those those rallies they're going to those events and they're hearing from</p>
<p data-start="2285.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh</p>
<p data-start="2286.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh from pierre poliev because that's what they want to do that's what they find finding entertaining right now going</p>
<p data-start="2292.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> going to these events has now become um</p>
<p data-start="2295.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> um you know part of the conservative experience but</p>
<p data-start="2299.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> but i think that it's two</p>
<p data-start="2300.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> two percent of the population right</p>
<p data-start="2303.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> they were going to vote conservative anyways it's not like it's changing anybody's mind because the event uh you know how many concerts are held in the city of calgary that you and i don't know anything about right that fills and they can bring 20 000 people yeah</p>
<p data-start="2305.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's not like it's</p>
<p data-start="2316.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> and they can bring 20 000 people yeah</p>
<p data-start="2318.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah and it's like 20 000 people and you're like what the fuck was that you</p>
<p data-start="2322.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know who the fuck is</p>
<p data-start="2322.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> who the fuck is jelly roll that's still a question i have it's</p>
<p data-start="2324.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> question i have it's</p>
<p data-start="2326.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's still a question i didn't even know it was a question uh</p>
<p data-start="2328.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh you know this this is um these events are drawing the the hardcore and the the heart there are a lot of hardcore but mark carney's event you know in one day um is going to draw you know 25 through to 2500 to 3000 people in a day yeah yeah so you know how long has it been advertised how long you know how much effort are they putting into it um you know i i i</p>
<p data-start="2348.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> in a day yeah yeah so</p>
<p data-start="2357.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> never liked big events in in politics because i find that big events in politics don't actually generate new votes um they take a lot of time to implement and execute but they don't find any new votes they only find the old pre</p>
<p data-start="2371.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> pre-existing 100 already with you voters and</p>
<p data-start="2375.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> the dynamics of this race could we look back and say pierre was a genius to have these massive events to ensure his base remained as sticky as possible, because that liberal vote didn't necessarily go to the conservatives, but it was just soft and didn't show up in the way that the polling indicated. Is there wisdom in the strategy to make your vote as hardened, where Pierre might be reaching</p>
<p data-start="2399.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> a new conservative ceiling in his vote? This is a pretty high number for Pierre in terms of where the CPC are currently polling. Usually they hover around in the low to mid 30s. He's hitting 38, eight thirty nines on the national averages so could you just say well listen we may not be able to compete with the liberals right now but if we make sure our vote is super hard and bank on theirs being just a bit soft elections ours what do you think of that yeah</p>
<p data-start="2425.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i mean i think is that like wishful thinking</p>
<p data-start="2427.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> is that like wishful thinking like i'm not i'm not hearing this from conservatives in my circles to be honest but i'm just kind of reacting to what you're what you're suggesting here and saying like could this this be a a theory that that might have some wisdom behind it</p>
<p data-start="2440.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> um i</p>
<p data-start="2442.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't know how's</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> how's</p>
<p data-start="2443.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> how's that first shitty answer um i just don't know i think that there's there's um ready</p>
<p data-start="2447.4"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> there's there's</p>

<p data-start="2485.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> think you're hardening the wrong</p>
<p data-start="2487.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> wrong group.</p>
<p data-start="2488.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, I think if you're going to make something hard, you start at the base and you work your way all the way to the tip.</p>
<p data-start="2494.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And if you can work from the base to the tip. Okay,</p>
<p data-start="2496.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> the base to the tip.</p>
<p data-start="2498.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay, just okay. Thank you, Carter. Thank you. Thank you. But</p>
<p data-start="2501.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> But right now, polyevs only work in the base, and you're just not going to get there, you know? You're not going to get to the end result if you just work the base.</p>
<p data-start="2511.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> this count as the same podcast that Corey was on earlier?</p>
<p data-start="2514.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, totally.</p>
<p data-start="2515.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay, good. I just want this mention to be the same one where paint, is it turn or paint?</p>
<p data-start="2517.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> want this mention to be the same one</p>
<p data-start="2520.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> where paint,</p>
<p data-start="2524.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Paint.</p>
<p data-start="2525.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p data-start="2526.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Turn confed red. It</p>
<p data-start="2529.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> was paint, and then it became turn.</p>
<p data-start="2529.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> was paint, and then</p>
<p data-start="2533.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's turn confed red.</p>
<p data-start="2535.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay. No,</p>
<p data-start="2536.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I don't think it is. This pink can fed red sounds better.</p>
<p data-start="2536.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> No, I don't think it is.</p>
<p data-start="2541.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> agree, and I don't know which one it is either. It's fine. It's fine. Just as long as your phallic analogy as well as- You know, if he doesn't win,</p>
<p data-start="2548.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> as well as- You know, if he doesn't win, and it comes back to this podcast, we're</p>
<p data-start="2550.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> back to this</p>
<p data-start="2552.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> going to have some guilt issues. I mean, not a lot, because we don't care that much. Well, he</p>
<p data-start="2553.6"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I mean,</p>
<p data-start="2553.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> mean, not a lot,</p>
<p data-start="2554.1"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> lot,</p>
<p data-start="2556.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> he</p>
<p data-start="2556.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> he</p>
<p data-start="2556.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> he can record a nice, solid, clean bumper. Let him do that. Let</p>
<p data-start="2562.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> him do that. Why</p>
<p data-start="2562.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Why would we let him do that? He's probably in bed already.</p>
<p data-start="2565.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's true.</p>
<p data-start="2566.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Lazy, lazy candidate. Carter, I've</p>
<p data-start="2568.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> I've</p>
<p data-start="2569.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> said this is the most important week for the conservatives. The stock market is, you know, tumbling like a motherfucker. Friday was worse than today, and we record here today on a Monday. There</p>
<p data-start="2579.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> seems to be no shifting off of the Trump question, although they're trying, they're trying, they're trying. They're putting out ads that are going after the Trump question. They seem to have some targeted spots, including one where Pierre is driving this Corvette around a racetrack with his wife, which has its</p>
<p data-start="2598.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> own vibe, and you could see the message in terms of who it's for. um what</p>
<p data-start="2603.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> sort of shift if you were in the conservative war room or if you were team jenny burn would you be looking for this week like we we're all kind of talking about this is the make or break week but i don't think people understand what are practitioners actually looking</p>
<p data-start="2618.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> for right what are practitioners actually looking for um</p>
<p data-start="2623.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> um in momentum change and in a turnaround style week because it could be less or more than what gen pop thinks needs to happen in order for something to be a turnaround so this is what i kind of wanted to spend the final few minutes here which is if</p>
<p data-start="2639.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> if we're on this campaign what are we looking for this week well</p>
<p data-start="2642.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know what to be honest uh i think that they might even be looking for something as simple as um did you see that shitty ad that you know that pierre polliev did that at least would be be a talking point that puts Pierre Polyev in the front of the front of people's minds right now like in 2010 when I and I've told this story so many times but in 2010 it was always have you heard of this Nenshi guy that's</p>
<p data-start="2667.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's what we wanted to see that's what we wanted to hear what</p>
<p data-start="2667.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> wanted to see that's</p>
<p data-start="2669.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> what Pierre Polyev needs is that someone at some point actually says what</p>
<p data-start="2673.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> what do you think of Pierre Polyev what</p>
<p data-start="2675.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> what are you thinking about Pierre Polyev what</p>
<p data-start="2677.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> what the what he's getting so far is have</p>
<p data-start="2680.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> have you heard to that mark carney guy are</p>
<p data-start="2681.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> are you watching that mark carney campaign have</p>
<p data-start="2683.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> have you seen mark how much mark carney's numbers have changed you</p>
<p data-start="2687.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know and pierre polliev is you</p>
<p data-start="2689.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know desperate with the events he's you know maybe he can get somewhere with this i think it's a tragic ad but i don't imagine that i'm part of the target audience um but you know and everybody that seems to have seen it seems to be uh uh make it an issue right which one is this is</p>
<p data-start="2706.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> which one is this is this the change is coming down the track the speed down the track yeah yeah the corvette ad yeah yeah i</p>
<p data-start="2710.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> down the track yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="2714.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't understand that at all do you get it</p>
<p data-start="2717.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> um yeah</p>
<p data-start="2718.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2718.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah i do i think um he looks good he looks manly he looks like he's got a really cool wife um there's a level of um</p>
<p data-start="2733.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> 30</p>
<p data-start="2734.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> 30</p>
<p data-start="2734.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> 30 40 50 year old dude being like that guy's kind of my vibe i'm not sure if it's purely like aspirational like like i wish he would he had had what he had but it's</p>
<p data-start="2744.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's kind of i</p>
<p data-start="2745.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> get it i get it it doesn't have and it's also like it's political messages does he need to</p>
<p data-start="2747.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="2747.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's also like it's political messages does he need to solidify men like the gender gap is already massive okay</p>
<p data-start="2753.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> gap is</p>
<p data-start="2755.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> so you know what i i i think he might you're</p>
<p data-start="2759.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> you're going to come back to hardening again i</p>
<p data-start="2759.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="2759.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> going to come back to</p>
<p data-start="2761.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> think he might i think he's in the situation right now where there's</p>
<p data-start="2765.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> two ways if he hardens okay</p>
<p data-start="2765.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> two ways if he hardens okay</p>
<p data-start="2766.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="2767.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="2767.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="2767.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="2767.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay so then</p>
<p data-start="2767.4"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> then let Let me ask.</p>
<p data-start="2769.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> You can't win if he makes it so hard that no one else can join in, right?</p>
<p data-start="2769.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> You can't win</p>
<p data-start="2774.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> It</p>
<p data-start="2775.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> has to be hard enough. I'm</p>
<p data-start="2777.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm letting you go at this</p>
<p data-start="2777.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm letting you go at this one alone, which you'd be very used to.</p>
<p data-start="2781.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, yeah. I mean, if it's super hard and you're going at it alone, it's no problem. But he wants to have others join in.</p>
<p data-start="2781.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2787.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> And when you want to have others join in, sometimes having it super hard is a little intimidating.</p>
<p data-start="2787.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="2787.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> And when</p>
<p data-start="2788.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> when you want</p>
<p data-start="2793.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> it?</p>
<p data-start="2795.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I believe so, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2798.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, keeping you on track. Here we go. By the way, change is coming down the track, I should mention. Listen, okay, this</p>
<p data-start="2805.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> this is similar, though. If you take that ad, though, and you don't understand it, and my theory to you is that this is to pretty much solidify the group of men, because I honestly, both</p>
<p data-start="2815.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> both on the surface and thinking it through a bit, do not see an audience beyond that,</p>
<p data-start="2819.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> right? Dudes, like just dudes. But</p>
<p data-start="2824.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> then you also look at another act that they took today, which is Stephen Harper coming coming out of retirement, which might sound like a casual thing. It is not. He has not done anything for the past two candidates, recorded a video for one, showing up and introducing Pierre at a rally today. You could look at that as an offensive move or a defensive move. And my default is to look at that as a defensive move, which is they</p>
<p data-start="2845.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> which</p>
<p data-start="2845.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> which is</p>
<p data-start="2846.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> is they</p>
<p data-start="2847.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> they</p>
<p data-start="2847.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> they needed Harper, right? Every time you see a big name come out in campaign, and we're used to this in the American context, I always think of that that is defensive posture, right?</p>
<p data-start="2856.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> right? Like you couldn't get the job done. The surrogate sort of intro or the surrogate sort of rally, to me, is always on a defensive posture. So to</p>
<p data-start="2866.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> me, I think this is a group that pure strategy, this next little while may have been, I'm going to pivot a little, I'm</p>
<p data-start="2874.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> going to harden my group and my base, make sure they're as engaged that voting is something that they are looking forward to do and they do. And then maybe I rely upon the gods a bit alongside some of my negative uh that that carney's vote isn't as soft as the the mid-40s he's getting in certain polls and then there's</p>
<p data-start="2893.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> our race like i it's a it's a working theory i'm</p>
<p data-start="2897.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm not sure it's a successful one no</p>
<p data-start="2899.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> no i mean if you're playing defense and you're behind you're really fucked right</p>
<p data-start="2904.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> you need to be playing offense when you're behind and uh right</p>
<p data-start="2909.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> now the only have you seen any new negative from</p>
<p data-start="2910.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> have you seen any new negative from him have you seen any new negative from him that that is maybe it's completely hidden from like the the youtube universe but at that being said youtube is taken away from these folks right like no partisan paid content on youtube because that would probably be the fastest quickest turnaround way to get stuff out is paying stuff on on youtube so they might be using meta i can't find anything that's new that's attacking carney in a unique way beyond the the the the list of things they've had going for the the last number of weeks um</p>
<p data-start="2912.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> seen any</p>
<p data-start="2941.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> um so i'm not sure what their offensive game is right now i</p>
<p data-start="2944.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't think they have one and they can't and they can't rely on the ndp</p>
<p data-start="2946.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> can't and they can't rely on the ndp the ndp are trying to go negative on carney to fight for their own survival but i don't think you can rely and boost the ndp content to be to kind of be the you</p>
<p data-start="2955.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know the marker that takes carney down what</p>
<p data-start="2957.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> what if they're just waiting for the debates what</p>
<p data-start="2961.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you tell me</p>
<p data-start="2961.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> you tell me you think that's a serviceable strategy right now like you think you tell pierre being like do a bit of a pivot try a few things out we're gonna have to take him down with</p>
<p data-start="2970.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> with one viral moment at the debate</p>
<p data-start="2974.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's essentially what i would be doing it</p>
<p data-start="2976.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> it doesn't have to be one viral moment i think that he can just dominate the debate you know i think that he can be a super strong uh candidate and and try and push it that way</p>
<p data-start="2987.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> pierre</p>
<p data-start="2987.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> pierre paliev has not been tested with a real debate at the federal level even though we all quote unquote know him so well so</p>
<p data-start="2987.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> pierre</p>
<p data-start="2995.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> so carter the final thing i want to talk to you about um and</p>
<p data-start="2998.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's creeping up it's not like like</p>
<p data-start="3000.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> at like a a 10 on the volume scale because if it was its own crisis that i think the conservatives could take advantage of but it's liberal arrogance it's like liberals on panel shows measuring the drapes kind of like how polyev folks have been doing for the last 18 months it's the the comments that this thing is over etc etc beyond the obvious do you feel like that is a a potential like strategic thing that could be hit upon right now that the liberals getting getting overconfident? Or is that like a meta inside the bubble inside an Ottawa sort of thing? Or do you think liberal arrogance in this moment in time has any play or mileage? And could you, as</p>
<p data-start="3015.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> months it's the the</p>
<p data-start="3039.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> as a strategist working for the conservatives, mold something there from that or not so much in your mind?</p>
<p data-start="3044.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Liberal arrogance is the Achilles heel of the Liberal Party. And it is always there, it will always be there to be taken advantage of. And if Pierre Polyev wants to take advantage of of it it's he can uh the problem is that pierre paliev comes across as such an arrogant ass that it's harder to make a case of um you know liberal arrogance when he's coming across as an arrogant asshole he's</p>
<p data-start="3072.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> not the right messenger he's</p>
<p data-start="3074.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> the wrong messenger for that message pierre reasonably could</p>
<p data-start="3077.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> reasonably could jugmeet reasonably take that line on what's his what's his um if there's a there there why can't jugmeet carry that uh particular argument because jugmeet is also</p>
<p data-start="3086.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> argument because jugmeet is also the He's also the wrong messenger, Zane. I mean, you're looking at two campaigns that have the wrong messenger at the wrong time.</p>
<p data-start="3097.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Pierre Palliev is just the wrong guy to be up against a Trump</p>
<p data-start="3097.3"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Pierre Palliev</p>
<p data-start="3097.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Palliev</p>
<p data-start="3102.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Trump wave and Mark Carney at this particular moment in time. And Jagmeet Singh is probably three years past his best before date.</p>
