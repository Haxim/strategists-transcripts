</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="125">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">2:05</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">yourself that&#x27;s interesting yeah so there is something interesting about this which is jagmeet singh&#x27;s cultural cachet was always greater than his political uh upside carter gravitas yeah yeah like the fact that like drake and jagmeet singh know one another Now, there&#x27;s actually quite interesting from a Canadian cultural perspective. I find that to be quite interesting. So what does someone like Jagmeet Singh have to do when he obviously is no longer a political face, but transitioned? I&#x27;m almost asking you celebrity PR, Carter</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="154">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">2:34</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">but it kind of is.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="155">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">2:35</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Jagmeet Singh almost is on like a celebrity PR track now, isn&#x27;t he?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="158">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">2:38</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">No, he&#x27;s at the very of his celebrity PR track. Yeah, he&#x27;s at the very end of his celebrity track. Track. And he extended it by an extra 24 hours just by getting in the middle of this Kendrick Why don&#x27;t we just all go with Kendrick? I mean, and what is Za? What is that? Is that a band?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="183">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">3:03</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">okay. It hurts. But, you know, if Jagmeet Singh is going to have another little round of 15 Minutes of Fame, Then he should use it for fundraising purposes to clean up the debt that he left the party and the existential threat that he left to the federal NDP and the future of social democracy in this country. How about we take that seriously, not the Kendrick Drake feud? Like, come on down to earth, buddy. There&#x27;s a big old debt there. Figure it out and set the party up for success, which is something you never did in the time that you were leader of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="216">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">3:36</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Here&#x27;s what I like. I like that she added is taking it in this direction. I was just coming in with a nice sort of like, you know, let&#x27;s all lay our tentacles into Jagmeet Singh for a few minutes. But now I have a serious question for you. And it&#x27;s back to you, Shannon. Does the former leader have a actual responsibility to clear this debt? Talk to me from like a party perspective, because many people do not know this, and you could probably explain it greater than I do, but I&#x27;ll give you the simplified version. The NDP have a building that they borrow against to raise money.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="244">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">4:04</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">And I think they&#x27;re the only political party on the federal scene that does so and does that, the boring of the money leverage against the building. So this is an interesting sort of situation where what happens when a leader leaves? What have you historically seen? What do you think both the actual and moral responsibility for someone like Jagmeet Singh is in that regard?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="265">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">4:25</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, the federal party has never been left in a state like this, not even when they lost party status in 1993 to my recollection of it, although I joined the party around 97. But I was on the federal council in the late 90s, early 2000s and, you know, in in the days when we had like 20 seats. So I saw their finances at that time. And I was around as well for when the party bought or essentially Labour bought the building for the party before the new election finance rules came into place that that that Kretchen brought in right in 2003 before the 2004 election. So that was the genesis of that. Steele and others pooled some, because in the olden times, Labour used to guarantee that loan, right,</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="309">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">5:09</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">in some way, shape or form, because they could. Oh, wasn&#x27;t aware of that. Oh, that&#x27;s interesting. Yeah. And so when the legislation took that out, then Labour, before the legislation came in, Labour bought the building. Yeah.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="320">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">5:20</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">And then the party, and that was essentially what, there were a couple of different things that came out of that legislation that helped the party build in the latent years. Number one was it allowed individual riding associations to do their own receipting and their own fundraising. And so you didn&#x27;t have to necessarily do a revenue share or anything. So you were just amassing money in individual riding. So a Nathan Cullen, a Jack Layton, an Olivia Chow, these kinds of seats, then, you know, Brian Massey grew up over time, right? Because they could establish their own fundraising base. So that was what that legislation did for the party. And the other thing it did was it allowed them to borrow. But to your question, what responsibility does Jagmeet Singh have? I&#x27;m not really sure if I can sort of reach back to it like a history time on when a leader had that kind of responsibility, because no leader has left the party in this kind of dire straits ever. Never. And so if he has an ability to help them get out of it, he should try because he set a really bad precedent here. And he has authored a lot of it.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="393">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">6:33</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Carter, obviously, was not planning to go here, but now I find this a very interesting line of inquiry. Oh, great. I&#x27;m well prepared for it. As someone who&#x27;s advised politicians and as a... No,</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="403">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">6:43</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">but as a political practitioner, Commissioner, what responsibility would you have tasked with your principal, Jagmeet Singh, to clear the party&#x27;s debt? Or would you have said, do you do your nominal bit? Do you participate at all? This is behind you. How do you even think about these things? We often talk about leadership campaigns, which are, of course, associated with your name and you ran for leadership. And we talked about the toxicity of leadership debts. This is interesting because it&#x27;s a party that no longer has official party status, that has this ability to borrow, that did do that borrowing. It&#x27;s got a long history and tenure. It&#x27;s a very interesting situation. What responsibility do you hold Jagmeet Singh to from a practical practitioner&#x27;s perspective?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="441">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">7:21</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I think he&#x27;s got a moral responsibility that he&#x27;s going to be walking away from. I mean, he has no actual responsibility. He has a moral responsibility, but that moral responsibility does not carry the weight of law or any of the truth of the matter is the leader is not responsible for the actual actions of the party during the actual campaign. One could argue he may not even have known. Now, if he didn&#x27;t know, then I think he&#x27;d be delinquent in his leadership responsibilities. But if he did know, then, you know, he would have some fundraising responsibilities. But let&#x27;s be honest. Let&#x27;s be honest saying if he had any capacity to do the fundraising, he would have raised the funds. He doesn&#x27;t have the ability to do the fundraising. So he leaves a giant hole all for whoever chooses or is chosen to lead that party. I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;re going to see a huge lineup of people going, yeah, I really want this challenge. But whoever takes it on is going to be taking on quite a lift.</div>

<div class="turn" data-start="502">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">8:22</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Can I talk about Jagmeet for a second, though? Shannon, maybe over to you. Do you feel like someone who leaves a party in this sort of lurch, has this impact them in their future career prospects or even in a brand way? Or have we in In politics, just consider this one of the elements of politics where this doesn&#x27;t dog you. You get to just move on with your life. What do you think?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="520">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">8:40</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Oh, I mean, I think it would depend on what he wants to do. But generally speaking, you know, my working thesis is always that people don&#x27;t really understand politics. And to the extent they do, they don&#x27;t really care how it all works. And so he&#x27;ll probably go off into the private sector or go and practice law or do something else. I think, you know, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s got a number of things that he can do. He is a talented guy in certain respects. He just wasn&#x27;t particularly talented at leading the federal NDP and creating one party, in my view, for the country. So he&#x27;ll do that. I don&#x27;t think it really matters. But for people like me who would like a relevant federal NDP, my heart has</div>

And now with the opportunities and openings that they have that they won&#x27;t be able to necessarily take, am I pissed about it? Hell yeah, I am. It&#x27;s a good thing I can&#x27;t hire him because I wouldn&#x27;t.</div>

  <div class="said">Carter, let&#x27;s use that transition of heartbreaks and let&#x27;s go from heartbreaks for the last decade to hearts potentially breaking for conservatives in January. because it has just come out a couple hours ago that Pierre Polyev is going to be facing a leadership review at the party&#x27;s, and these are sources speaking to the Globe and Mail, at the party&#x27;s national convention in January of 2026. Carter, this was well-rumored to be something that happens in the spring, potentially, for Pierre Polyev. It&#x27;s now been moved up to January. This is also a time where Pierre Polyev doesn&#x27;t have a seat. It&#x27;s also a time where Pierre Polyev seems</div>

If you&#x27;re going to have the leadership review, personally, I think the faster after the election, the better for the party, just to get it behind them. him.

So you have a good opportunity to fill that room for the people who are going to vote nicely for you, who maybe just worked on the campaign, on the by-election, who are your ride or dies out of Alberta. They&#x27;re not folks out of BC who might be butthurt that they didn&#x27;t have the breakthrough that they wanted. They&#x27;re not going to be folks from Atlantic Canada who are butthurt that they didn&#x27;t have the breakthrough that was expected. it back even five months ago. And so I think it&#x27;s easier for them to do it earlier. It basically means that you campaign through the summer, through your by-election and through your barbecue circuit. You get back into the House, you score a few points off the budget and other things and show that you still are in fight and form. It&#x27;s not long enough for anything to fester are either on the party side or the caucus side. As I said last time, when, you know, looking at his really crappy numbers, and they are really bad.

Caucuses being what they are, oftentimes they&#x27;re the last people you can hold a gun to their head and they wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell you what percentage of popular vote you got in the last election. This is what electeds are like. Having been one, I know how blissfully unaware we, they are. But I do think that it doesn&#x27;t give anything time to steamroll and to fester because the party is still on his side. They kind of still don&#x27;t know what to do or make of it. And it won&#x27;t be enough time for factions to kind of bubble up in caucus. I think that&#x27;s probably the idea of January over spring. Carter, what do you think of that?</div>

That is their methodology. That&#x27;s the way that they think. And I don&#x27;t think that Pierre Polyev&#x27;s performance, as good as it was, is going to necessarily be enough to stand in the face of the performance as bad as it potentially could be.

The kind of like the further right ones, right? The more conspiratorial ones. He never really pissed them off, right? Right. He never went, you know, like, oh, you&#x27;re a globalist, W.E.F. guy or whatever.

Carter, if your job was to sow chaos and potentially propose an alternative between now and two milestones that we know, we roughly know, his by-election and now January, give me a game plan, roughly, around what you&#x27;d be doing, what you&#x27;d be doing this summer, what you&#x27;d be doing tail end of summer, what you&#x27;d be doing early fall right now, Carter, if you wanted to propose the weakening of Pierre Polyev and potentially an alternative.

I would set that as a, as a primary outcome. If he&#x27;s, if he&#x27;s going to show real strength, he has to get over 80%. If he doesn&#x27;t get over 80%, then we are seeing the law, you know, he&#x27;s not as popular. Um, so that&#x27;s, that&#x27;d be the first thing I would set. The second thing I would set is that he&#x27;s got to perform well on the barbecue circuit. And this is not a guy who traditionally performs well on the barbecue circuit. He is better in the house of commons doing the theatrical than he is in the uh in in people&#x27;s uh front front rooms doing barbecue circuit during the barbecue circuit meeting the the gen pop he that&#x27;s not his strength but i would i would expect i would set an expectation that it&#x27;s going to have to be his strength you know how does he perform at the stampede how does he perform across canada during the the course of the summer? Is he getting out there? Is he being seen or is he, you retreating into prep for House of Commons, which is what he really loves and what he really wants to be. I&#x27;d set those two expectations right off the bat. And the third expectation I would set is that his House of Commons performance is just costed We know he&#x27;s going to be great. We know he&#x27;s going to be great. He&#x27;s going to be the best leader possible in the House of Commons. Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t win elections.

So obviously the Alberta members who have lots of membership in their ridings, I&#x27;d be talking to them in particular. And I&#x27;d probably, in addition to my stampede work, I would be doing some specific things with the biggest Alberta ridings where there&#x27;s a large membership base.

It&#x27;s coming from the Lulu&#x27;s on the right. And so, yeah, I would be finding one or two of those to just start like creating just an absolute gong show.

And this is leaning into the provincial side a bit more, but do you feel like the current situation we have with separatism in Alberta, could that metastasize to an operation on the federal level in any meaningful way? We&#x27;ve always talked about it metastasizing into a splinter of the right provincially, but I&#x27;m curious what role and impact, especially now that we&#x27;re tripling down in Alberta, right? Like Polly is running in an Alberta seat. This is going to be an Alberta convention in January. You&#x27;re probably calling a lot of Alberta ridings.

And so we&#x27;ve seen some some of this movie before, in terms of when the two, when the blue and the red become really big tent brokerage parties, there are factions that get left out. And that&#x27;s what led to the creation of the Reform Party.

While conceding he&#x27;s a terrorist person who likes the relative simplicity of imposing broad-based tariffs on goods from other countries to raise revenue and try to bring back jobs to the U.S., Trump said Carney has come forward with a different concept, and it&#x27;s one some people like, and we&#x27;re going to see if we can get to the bottom of it today. Quote, I think Mark has a more complex idea, but it&#x27;s still very good. Unquote, Trump said of some sort of trade pitch that Carney has made to the Americans, a proposal that is yet to be made public. I think we&#x27;re going to accomplish a lot, quote unquote, from Trump at the end there. Carter, expectations were high. It wasn&#x27;t that just Carney just wanted to host the G7. That was what was given to him. It seems like he wanted to now convene the G7 and be something at the G7.</div>

Which is Trump praising an alternative proposal by Carney at the G7 with a lot of observer observer countries, or whatever you&#x27;d call them, added to the mix. What do you think is happening to the expectations game in real time of one Mr. Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada?</div>

A self-made man, made millions of dollars from Northwest Territories who comes out and gets a scholarship to Harvard and suddenly makes all the money. I think that Trump has respect for people with money in a way that he doesn&#x27;t have respect for other levels of politicians. So I think that, you know, Mark Carney coming in and saying, I may not be a billionaire, but a hundred, a hundred millionaire, you know, that that brings a lot of of credibility to the table. And Mark Carney is taking advantage of that credibility. I would love to be able to see what the proposals are, because those proposals, you know, one of the I think that, you know, Donald Trump&#x27;s proposals have been written on the back of a napkin and crayon.

He&#x27;s already done it with the UK, and he&#x27;s trying to do it with the whole world and he essentially said this morning you know everyone has our deal right because we&#x27;ll just write them a letter and tell them that that that here&#x27;s your across the board tariff for the rest of time that&#x27;s the trade deal if you don&#x27;t make a deal with us right and so i we know that&#x27;s the default and so what carney is doing is putting something in front of him that does not bake in and across the board or even auto or steel specific tariff for the rest of time in a way that really rewrites the terms of kuzma that is what he is i you know without having seen anything that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s trying to do uh and and i don&#x27;t think they could get it over the line for the g7 because there was too much in there that that baked in a fundamental rewrite of access to markets for us and so now we&#x27;re going to go into this place where he&#x27;s just trying to leverage the defense stuff and some of the procurement maybe uh some of that against you know if we do this then you will not tariff us on that is is my hunch i that&#x27;s that&#x27;s what my gut is of where this is going um and he&#x27;s he&#x27;s playing it out beautifully so far and and i have read some reporting that you know they tried to structure it in a way that would make uh the toddler happy as well right so in in smaller chunks of time because he doesn&#x27;t like the everyone going around the horn seven people he doesn&#x27;t like having to sit through a lot of that because it annoys him so they&#x27;ve they&#x27;ve structured even today in a way that doesn&#x27;t make him too too tired. He gets his nap, his blankie, his snack, and they can kind of manage any meltdowns that might happen.

That to me is really driving the agenda. And it&#x27;s the photographic video intensive outcome of all of this. I&#x27;m not sure that the man sat down for 48 hours, but he doesn&#x27;t need to.

I mean, we&#x27;ll see what comes out of the communique and we&#x27;ll see what happens in the next 24 hours on the Israel-Iran conflict, because it could just kind of sort of pull the whole thing off in a different direction and even cause conflict in the attendees. It could possibly. But what he&#x27;s done is he&#x27;s recreated essentially the big countries of the G20 at the G7. He&#x27;s provided some of those opportunities for Canada to look like a leader on the world stage.

And he is giving them what they want there and what they voted for. So I don&#x27;t think there necessarily needs to be a tariff deal as long as as Trump is like saying like sort of nice mumbles like he already did. and some of the bilat stuff, you know, that can go out and become headlines in their own right that don&#x27;t even maybe have to do with Canadians. If the Aussies conclude some sort of deal with somebody or, you know, Brazil does some trade stuff, it kind of places us within to take our rightful place, I think, and as more of a player than we have been historically.

So, you know, the polling data, the reason why Canada has never done it is because the polling data puts that pretty low on the billion dollars. Yeah, it&#x27;s not just expensive. It will displace a lot of programs when Canadians go, oh, yes, we need to tighten our belts. We should displace programs. And then when it&#x27;s the stuff that comes into their bank account, they get mad, right? Because I don&#x27;t think people quite get the extent to which that child tax benefit is a massive amount of money every month. month. And, you know, the seniors benefits are quite generous in this country compared to many other countries, indexed to inflation, all the rest of it. You know, there&#x27;s a bunch of different ways in which the government of Canada supports our daily lives. And then there&#x27;s the health and social transfers on top of that that supports our provinces. So the fiscal situation becomes extremely tight for something that people only theoretically actually want. Right. So there are risks and downsides to doing this once you start cutting things like employment, social development, Canada programs, once you start cutting Indigenous services or, you know, seniors benefits of various kinds, workforce development, stuff of various kinds, even border or passport services or you name it, the kind of stuff, CRA that the government of Canada does. I still think there are risks in in doing it. He&#x27;s made the commitments. I have no earthly idea how he&#x27;s going to get $9 billion extra out the door this year.</div>
