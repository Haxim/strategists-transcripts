<p data-start="216.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> is getting some incredible some</p>
<p data-start="220.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> some incredible math we've got spreadsheets being sent to us now for those that are not aware we're trying to figure out how many last meals have been had at swiss chalet there have been two people who have confused uh last meal at swiss as being how many people have gotten food poisoning from swiss chalet and have subsequently passed because That is not what we are asking. I'm glad I'm not an owner of</p>
<p data-start="221.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> incredible math</p>
<p data-start="221.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> math we've</p>
<p data-start="237.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> is not what we are asking. I'm glad I'm not an owner of this litigious show that you guys have now.</p>
<p data-start="243.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> We're</p>
<p data-start="244.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We're</p>
<p data-start="244.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're trying to do the math.</p>
<p data-start="245.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Swiss Chalet is a Canadian institution. You</p>
<p data-start="249.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> You can see it by my hat.</p>
<p data-start="249.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> it by</p>
<p data-start="249.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> by my hat.</p>
<p data-start="251.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Corey, do you want to add in your guess of how many people have had their last Swiss Chalet since its founding in the 1950s? Sure.</p>
<p data-start="251.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Corey, do</p>
<p data-start="258.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Sure. You bet, Zane. All of them.</p>
<p data-start="262.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Explain that to me. No, I mean, that's how we all go. People don't really realize it. that it's not something we talk about. End of life is awkward. What I like is that it's a</p>
<p data-start="268.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> End of life is awkward. What I like is that it's a very QP answer, right? You don't have to... In 35 seconds.</p>
<p data-start="274.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> 35 seconds. You don't have to add anything. I can answer everything in 35 seconds. Yeah. You never could answer anything in 35 seconds. We've taken...</p>
<p data-start="275.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> You don't have to add anything. I can answer everything</p>
<p data-start="276.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> everything</p>
<p data-start="278.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. You never</p>
<p data-start="283.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Has that been the hardest thing to adjust to? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="285.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I don't really answer questions in QP, because... No, but, I mean,</p>
<p data-start="288.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, but, I mean, if you were to answer a question...</p>
<p data-start="290.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="290.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, like, Carter, you're a minister, so you answer questions. I can imagine it would be hard to do that. Yeah. When</p>
<p data-start="290.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> you're a minister, so you answer questions. I can imagine it would be hard to do that. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="293.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. When</p>
<p data-start="293.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> When</p>
<p data-start="293.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> When I was... Now that I'm a minister, I'm finding it tricky. tricky but</p>
<p data-start="297.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know you do answer questions in the house when you make anytime you make a speech like so the difference between like the house of commons and at least the provincial legislatures i've worked with and around is there's</p>
<p data-start="302.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> the difference between</p>
<p data-start="302.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> between</p>
<p data-start="307.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's a lot more interaction like it's it's a bigger show there's just more going on like you got to mix it up i</p>
<p data-start="314.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean there's still one person talking and the other people listening right i don't</p>
<p data-start="314.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean there's</p>
<p data-start="315.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> there's</p>
<p data-start="315.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's still one</p>
<p data-start="318.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't think any of us listen ever uh that's that's my early assessment that's a bold</p>
<p data-start="322.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's a bold thing to admit this early and well there's answered we can read</p>
<p data-start="324.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> and well there's answered we can read it afterwards see if we missed okay yeah</p>
<p data-start="326.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> afterwards</p>
<p data-start="326.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> afterwards</p>
<p data-start="326.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> see</p>
<p data-start="327.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> we missed okay yeah see if you missed anything heckle heckle heckle so</p>
<p data-start="331.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> so so</p>
<p data-start="331.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> so hogan there's so</p>
<p data-start="331.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> so hogan</p>
<p data-start="331.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> hogan there's so much about your life that now interests us when when in the past you were the least interesting person on the show carter</p>
<p data-start="335.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> past you</p>
<p data-start="335.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="335.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> you were the least interesting</p>
<p data-start="338.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter so can</p>
<p data-start="339.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> can we just run through a couple things i'm interested in maybe a couple things you're interested yeah yeah let's do that so last time you were on the show correct me if i'm wrong we were doing the debrief of uh of how you won what that looked like what election yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="343.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="343.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="343.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah yeah let's</p>
<p data-start="344.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> let's do that so</p>
<p data-start="344.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="344.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="344.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="350.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> what</p>
<p data-start="350.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> what that looked like what</p>
<p data-start="351.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="352.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah and then he elect</p>
<p data-start="352.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> and then he elect walk</p>
<p data-start="354.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> us through the whirlwind from there is there of vettings or orientation i assume there is uh-huh take us take us to like you went to rome you were named a part of what the fuck is going on cory man give us like</p>
<p data-start="363.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> of what the fuck is going on cory man give us like it's crazy huh that's</p>
<p data-start="366.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> like it's crazy huh</p>
<p data-start="366.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> huh</p>
<p data-start="367.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> huh that's</p>
<p data-start="367.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="367.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="367.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's so weird uh</p>
<p data-start="368.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh look i you know in a funny way i think when you're looking at it from the outside you think man why does it take so long for parliament to get back it was about a month right yeah</p>
<p data-start="378.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah it</p>
<p data-start="378.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> it was not enough time in many ways like many of us were still working in the hallways as the the session had begun. And we didn't have our constituency offices set up and all of that. There's a lot that goes into onboarding a new MP and setting up a new parliament. I guess that's the one thing I would really underline here, because you've got to wait until the results are verified. And then they reach out to you to start orientation. And that orientation isn't one meeting, it's a series of meetings over the next couple of weeks, everything from how to set up a constituency office to how committees work and everything in between. There's lots of orientation.</p>
<p data-start="414.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> You got to go to Ottawa for it. You got to be sworn in at some point. And while this is all going on, that's, let's call it machinery of government stuff. There's also things</p>
<p data-start="424.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> going on with your party. Like a cabinet is being created. There are activities that go into that.</p>
<p data-start="428.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> are activities</p>
<p data-start="431.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> There is the first caucus meeting. There is meeting your colleagues for the first time. I had a kind of weird meeting my colleagues because the colleagues I met for the first time that I didn't already know as MPs, I met in Rome. you know as part of the delegation to rome like on the plane yeah</p>
<p data-start="449.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> well on like in the terminal before getting on the plane in some cases you know and that's where i met jamie maloney who became our our caucus chair for example it's where i met hymie batiste who is you know</p>
<p data-start="452.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> the plane</p>
<p data-start="461.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> know one of my parliament besties now you know he's a guy i got to become friends with pretty quickly and uh feel bad that i i mispronounced his name now when we go back to those leadership ones all those do you really feel bad</p>
<p data-start="471.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> those do you really feel bad or is that it's okay</p>
<p data-start="472.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> or is that it's okay i'm you know okay you're through it already good yeah it's not like we're gonna find a clip of you pronouncing it wrong we would never</p>
<p data-start="473.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> okay you're through it already good yeah it's</p>
<p data-start="475.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's not like we're gonna find</p>
<p data-start="478.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> we would never go back i</p>
<p data-start="481.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> won't you know there are people who've done this before jamie did this back in 2025 we</p>
<p data-start="487.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> would never do that i mean</p>
<p data-start="487.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> do that i mean it's not like</p>
<p data-start="487.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> mean</p>
<p data-start="488.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's not like it's not like</p>
<p data-start="489.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> like it's not like our spot is a lot of work the one thing is it is a lot of work it</p>
<p data-start="489.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> like our spot</p>
<p data-start="489.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> spot is a lot of work the one thing is it is a lot of</p>
<p data-start="492.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> it is a lot of work so we've got a producer now</p>
<p data-start="493.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> is a</p>
<p data-start="493.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="493.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> a lot of work so</p>
<p data-start="493.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> so we've</p>
<p data-start="494.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> we've got a</p>
<p data-start="494.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> a producer</p>
<p data-start="494.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> producer</p>
<p data-start="494.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> producer now yeah we do no you get to meet</p>
<p data-start="494.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> now</p>
<p data-start="494.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> now</p>
<p data-start="495.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah we do no you get to meet you get to me i got to meet many</p>
<p data-start="498.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> many</p>
<p data-start="498.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> many</p>
<p data-start="498.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> many great people and and it was kind of an interesting time to do it And they were kind of laughing because they're like, this is not what the job normally is. Enjoy it. This has never happened to any of us before.</p>
<p data-start="510.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> And that just adds to the volume of stuff that is weighing on you as you're also trying to wind up your past life. I had to formally quit as a vice president at the University of Calgary. I had to adjust, I don't know, everything. Lori, my wife, left her job because all of a sudden our schedules are just totally crazy. It's a lot. It's a lot going on. And then, boom, you're</p>
<p data-start="532.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you're in session. And that is just madness from start to finish. Just madness from start to finish. I would describe it as very full days, like 7.30, 8 a.m. in the morning until midnight every night between the various things you have to do, including sometimes being in the house to midnight. And it's</p>
<p data-start="551.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> just, it's kind of, it's a lot, right? It's not even like I'm saying it's like super complicated. I'm not saying it requires all of your brainpower all of the time. It's just, it's a lot. It's always on. And when you're a new MP, you're also trying to figure out the unwritten rules of the place at the same time.</p>
<p data-start="570.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Garner, what are you interested in? And while you think there's one question that everyone cares about, which I'm going to ask Corey right now. Corey, how</p>
<p data-start="577.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> many of your colleagues are fans of the pod and have you kept it running? You</p>
<p data-start="580.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> You know, a few.</p>
<p data-start="582.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Let's</p>
<p data-start="583.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Let's take a few. I would say</p>
<p data-start="583.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Let's take a few. I would say more than a dozen even. I've had colleagues come up and be like, hey, can I be on the pod? Hey, I love the pod. hey i i you know i used to listen but that that that zane guy's intolerable you know whatever the regular</p>
<p data-start="597.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the regular stuff regular regular stuff you hear</p>
<p data-start="597.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> stuff regular regular stuff you hear all the regular feedback</p>
<p data-start="599.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> hear all</p>
<p data-start="599.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> all the regular feedback i i</p>
<p data-start="600.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> i i i don't know who they are but they're definitely gonna have their last meal at swiss okay</p>
<p data-start="605.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's all i know</p>
<p data-start="606.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> know about them okay</p>
<p data-start="606.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="607.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay uh</p>
<p data-start="607.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh yeah no like you know it's funny and a lot of the staff a lot of the staff listened to the podcast too quite a few people came up to me and said hey man never missed the pod never miss I said, gone downhill since you left. I think they were lying about the second part. I think that was more to make me feel better. That's</p>
<p data-start="619.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="619.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="619.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I think they</p>
<p data-start="619.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> they were lying about the second part. I think that was more to</p>
<p data-start="623.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's hurtful. Shannon's going to be really upset. Yeah, no, she should be. No, no, for sure.</p>
<p data-start="623.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's hurtful.</p>
<p data-start="624.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> upset.</p>
<p data-start="624.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, no, she should be. No, no, for sure. That is a personal and direct insult to her. Yeah, upset. Carter,</p>
<p data-start="626.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> personal and</p>
<p data-start="629.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, upset.</p>
<p data-start="631.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> what are you wondering</p>
<p data-start="631.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> what are</p>
<p data-start="631.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> are you wondering about? We</p>
<p data-start="632.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> wondering</p>
<p data-start="632.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> wondering about? We don't feel anything anymore. Carter, there's so much other shit on the board. I forgot that the king was here. Corey's also a parliament. The king was here.</p>
<p data-start="632.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> We don't</p>
<p data-start="633.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't feel anything anymore.</p>
<p data-start="633.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> anymore. Carter,</p>
<p data-start="634.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="634.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="636.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Corey's also a parliament. The king was here.</p>
<p data-start="638.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> We haven't gone to any of that. The throne speech. Bunch of fucking issues. You want to talk about that? Yeah, the throne speech. So, king</p>
<p data-start="638.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> We haven't gone to any of that. The throne speech.</p>
<p data-start="640.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Bunch of fucking issues.</p>
<p data-start="641.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> talk about that?</p>
<p data-start="644.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> comes. There's a throne speech. Yeah. It's in all the newspapers. right but we saw that one of the interesting things about the throne speech is um he gives it in the senate and then in the house of commons we have to take it up and there's a motion moved to to discuss the throne speech somebody has to move that motion and i i was the guy who got to move that motion so it's kind of one of these things that's like uh you know it's a nice little thing to do inside parliament i don't think anybody in the rest of canada knows or cares that i'm the guy who moved the throne speech motion but the</p>
<p data-start="648.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> we saw that one of the interesting</p>
<p data-start="675.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> the long and the short of it is it It means I've got to give a 20 minute speech, which is basically rehashing the throne speech with a couple of comments at the top about, you know, my family and, you know, you know, the writing and all of that. Carter and I and yeah. Yeah, of course. A lot of content on you guys. A lot of content. Thanks for the shout outs.</p>
<p data-start="687.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="687.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, of course. A lot of content on you guys. A lot of content. Thanks for the shout outs. We've really appreciated them. And then I have</p>
<p data-start="691.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> We've really appreciated</p>
<p data-start="693.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> then I have to take 10 minutes of questions from the house on the throne speech, which basically means on anything because the throne speech is obviously. Well, or what's not in the throne speech and why isn't it in the throne speech? Right. And so, yeah, it's like the first thing that happens in the house. Like, I have to stand up, and I've never been there for a sitting in the house. It's a full house, and you've got to do it. It's kind of a fun thing. Did</p>
<p data-start="699.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> throne speech is obviously.</p>
<p data-start="716.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Did you wear adult diapers, or were you able to, you know, not shit yourself? No, you know me.</p>
<p data-start="720.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, you know me. Like, if I have a superpower, it's that I am unbothered. Like, things don't really bother me. It gets me in trouble as much as it helps me, but it wasn't, like, bad in that sense. It was a lot of fun. on this</p>
<p data-start="731.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> that sense. It was a lot of fun. on this is a good question carter asked about the adult diapers cory are you still wearing sneakers are you still keeping that top button undone oh great question this is this i feel like the sartorial aspect of being a member from a member of parliament parliamentary secretary cory hogan is very important for us to understand um are you keeping it real or have you sold out yeah</p>
<p data-start="740.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh great question this is</p>
<p data-start="742.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> sartorial aspect</p>
<p data-start="743.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> a member</p>
<p data-start="747.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> is very important for</p>
<p data-start="752.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah so let's talk so first off the</p>
<p data-start="754.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> the top button undone yeah 100 no i still keep it undone no for sure of course i i do like what kind of man animal am i there is a dress code in the house the dress code is in order to kind of be there you need to wear a jacket and in order to speak or vote you need to wear a tie so or i think maybe you can vote if you just have a jacket on anyways you can't speak without a tie that's for sure so men have to wear a jacket and a tie in the house of commons it's kind of old school like that but to get to the second part of your question zane there's no No dress code for below your jacket and tie. Yeah, there isn't. So, yeah, I mean, most of the time I'm wearing sneakers in the house. I will say, because I went to the Pope's inaugural mass, and I thought, I can't go to St. Peter's Square wearing sneakers to, like, the inaugural mass. I did buy my first pair of dress shoes in, like, decades. And so I do own a pair, and I do sometimes wear them as well, just to try to get a little value out of them. But, yeah, mostly sneakers.</p>
<p data-start="757.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> i still keep</p>
<p data-start="758.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> no for sure</p>
<p data-start="759.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> i i do like</p>
<p data-start="789.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, there isn't.</p>
<p data-start="813.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> But, yeah, mostly</p>
<p data-start="815.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> They live in Ottawa, right? You don't even bring them back? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="817.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I mean, why would I? That's not a Calgary Corey thing. Will you be wearing</p>
<p data-start="818.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's not</p>
<p data-start="822.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> thing. Will you be wearing cowboy boots when we get to the stampede? No,</p>
<p data-start="824.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> stampede? No, I'll never. I mean, listen, if you own cowboy boots and you've broken them in, good for you.</p>
<p data-start="827.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> you own cowboy boots and you've broken them in, good for</p>
<p data-start="830.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I have. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="832.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> But why would you do that to yourself?</p>
<p data-start="836.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because</p>
<p data-start="836.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because we like the pain. That's why we're in Calgary.</p>
<p data-start="836.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because</p>
<p data-start="838.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're in Calgary.</p>
<p data-start="839.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Calgary is about pain.</p>
<p data-start="841.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> And this is one of the things that comes along with that pain. You have to wear cowboy boots. we have to wear really warm shirts in the summer you gotta wear the warm shirts and the super heavy jeans yeah i</p>
<p data-start="844.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> to wear cowboy boots.</p>
<p data-start="847.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> summer</p>
<p data-start="847.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> summer you gotta wear the warm shirts and the super</p>
<p data-start="850.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> i agree we're about separatism and then a hat that makes your head sweat the blood flow from your body to your feet cory that's that's okay yeah you see what you see the save there you</p>
<p data-start="852.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> and then a hat that makes your head sweat the</p>
<p data-start="856.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's okay yeah you see what</p>
<p data-start="858.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> what you see the save</p>
<p data-start="858.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> save there you see</p>
<p data-start="859.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> you see that i did what you did what you did there was nice okay yeah that's good that's good yeah i'm</p>
<p data-start="859.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> see that i did what you</p>
<p data-start="862.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah that's</p>
<p data-start="864.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm just i'm i'm intrigued by what has happened like so what happened in the house that that you were the most surprised by as a newly elected member of parliament?</p>
<p data-start="875.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, people ask that a lot. Like, there's versions of that question I get asked by people on the daily. So I'm a simpleton. You're a simple man with a simple question. Okay, that's good to know. The basic elevator talk. I was hoping you'd elevate it on this podcast, but I have elevated</p>
<p data-start="881.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> daily. So I'm a simpleton. You're a simple man</p>
<p data-start="883.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> man with</p>
<p data-start="883.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> with</p>
<p data-start="883.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> with a simple question.</p>
<p data-start="884.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> question.</p>
<p data-start="884.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> question.</p>
<p data-start="884.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> question.</p>
<p data-start="884.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> question.</p>
<p data-start="884.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> question. Okay, that's good to know. The</p>
<p data-start="889.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> but I have elevated</p>
<p data-start="890.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> elevated it. Your brain</p>
<p data-start="891.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> brain has atrophied without my presence. I do understand. I understand,</p>
<p data-start="895.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I understand, yeah. Can I just mark this timestamp at the 15-minute mark, Corey's told a constituent that his brain is atrophied.</p>
<p data-start="895.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> understand, yeah. Can</p>
<p data-start="896.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Can I just mark</p>
<p data-start="897.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> mark</p>
<p data-start="897.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> mark</p>
<p data-start="902.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> brain is</p>
<p data-start="904.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Just</p>
<p data-start="904.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Just want to make sure that's on the record.</p>
<p data-start="905.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> record.</p>
<p data-start="906.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> But I didn't vote for him. I mean, let's be clear. Yeah, okay, well, that tracks.</p>
<p data-start="908.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, let's be clear. Yeah, okay, well, that tracks. That tracks.</p>
<p data-start="911.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> What surprised me the most? You know, like,</p>
<p data-start="916.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> obviously, this is a world that's not foreign to me. Like, I was aware of it. Although I have said to many people, I think including you guys, like, geez, I probably should have paid more attention when my friends were doing these things. I just, I never cared heard about the house procedural stuff like it was never my thing it was never something that interested i'll be honest it still doesn't particularly interest me it's just part of the job but um but</p>
<p data-start="938.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> but the thing that surprised me most is that it is uh it is such a weird combination the moments that you think are the big moments are not the big moments and the big moments are ones that i think would otherwise like kind of pass and not think about it like you know you would think like the first time you vote that's like a big moment right like oh it's the first some of them in the house you</p>
<p data-start="957.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> like oh it's the first</p>
<p data-start="959.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> know i didn't really know what the hell was going on i couldn't really hear what the clerks were saying i was watching people are standing up i'm trying to figure out is it time for me to stand up oh no that guy's not standing up yet why isn't he standing up is he supposed to stand up and just sort of watching it and being like</p>
<p data-start="973.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> low-key bewildered and then just being there and like oh they're nodding am i supposed to not are you required to nod that person didn't nod before they sat down how does this work you know because nobody fucking tells tells you those things so they don't tell you that in orientation no no no</p>
<p data-start="983.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> so they don't tell you that in orientation no no no</p>
<p data-start="986.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> no and so then uh so then i vote and i sit down i move on with my life and just go well that was a thing that happened you know recorded i think i voted yeah</p>
<p data-start="992.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> recorded i think i voted yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="994.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah they're an interesting thing um meanwhile like you'll be sitting there kind of candidly bored out of your mind six hours into a debate oh and by the way we got to talk about debates in a minute here but like you'll be like six hours into a debate and</p>
<p data-start="1007.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> like</p>
<p data-start="1007.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> like you'll be like</p>
<p data-start="1010.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you're like staring at the ceiling counting the panes of glass and and then Then it just sort of, like, washes over you. You're like, holy shit, I'm one of the 343 people who makes laws for this country. And, like, that's the moment that hits you, right? Yeah, like, I should</p>
<p data-start="1022.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, like, I should pay attention.</p>
<p data-start="1024.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, sort of. But as much as anything, it's like you have a moment to, like, soak it in because, like, you've moved past the moments where you're busy. And so, yeah, I think that also it is like any other job in that there's, like, this unwritten code of how everything works. I don't mean that in, like, it's, like, this weird, like, clubby thing. it's more like it's not written down any like i remember you</p>
<p data-start="1046.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> know early on they're talking about oh and you only have to be here if you're on house duty you know only a quarter of the mps are in the house or even you know next to the chamber really uh all of the time when you're sitting there you'll talk about it for a bit you'll be like uh-huh how do</p>
<p data-start="1052.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> mps are in the house</p>
<p data-start="1060.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> do i find out if i'm on house duty you know like like nobody tells you though google doc well</p>
<p data-start="1065.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> though google doc well and then</p>
<p data-start="1066.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> well and then they're like oh no we'll send an email right and then the email has like one two three four as the groups but they're not even anyways it's all very it's</p>
<p data-start="1075.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's very sensible once you know what it is but it's all very bewildering if you've never done it before so yeah you're doing a lot of that the first little bit is</p>
<p data-start="1080.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah you're</p>
<p data-start="1082.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> is part of you happy that that your first sort of sitting in the house so soon after getting elected like you just were thrown into it right away and like that this is now it's of course you're back in calvary it's summer you're gonna be doing a bunch of events you're gonna be traveling the country i assume</p>
<p data-start="1091.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1091.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and like that</p>
<p data-start="1098.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> but are you happy that they like you got that out of the way but</p>
<p data-start="1102.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> but it happened so quickly then rather than having to wait till the fall, for example, to go to Ottawa and do it?</p>
<p data-start="1108.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I don't think I'd want to wait till the fall. I do think we could have used a little bit more time for, like, look, I get why. We're a country that's got a lot of things to do. We're in a hurry. We've got to do things fast. That's what the prime minister said. But, you know, it's kind of an interesting stress where you're sitting there in Ottawa and you're doing what you're supposed to do in Ottawa and you don't have your Calgary constituency set up yet. and you're just like jesus i really wish i had time to hire staff and set up the office and open the office and again there's nuts and bolts there's you've got to get the</p>
<p data-start="1131.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> jesus</p>
<p data-start="1140.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="1140.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> the internet provider in and then you've got to get the house of commons it people to come in and talk about this how</p>
<p data-start="1144.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> in and talk about this how does this actually work do you have to do that do you get staff on day one do you have one person right away no you have to hire these people every single one yeah</p>
<p data-start="1150.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> no you have to hire</p>
<p data-start="1154.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> and i didn't have the ability to hire people until i don't know like four weeks in which is basically just as soon as i'm supposed supposed to go to ottawa so and you know that you don't just hire people they've got to be they've got to go through security clearances and so i have i have a fellow who works for me who worked for george shahal so he was fairly fast to onboard not the case with others right and and you know and you just don't have all of the levers available to you yet i mean a very funny thing it's june 30th today right yeah if you're a new mp our first paycheck was today we didn't get paid until today and so like everything you know you just wish there was a little bit more time to get your feet under you and get some of those nuts and bolts because you're worried about letting down constituents as much as anything like emails are just going to an inbox that you don't have access to for a few weeks that your staff doesn't have access to for a few weeks after that and you're just like jesus christ i just</p>
<p data-start="1166.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> so i</p>
<p data-start="1204.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> that your staff</p>
<p data-start="1209.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> just yeah you know i'm</p>
<p data-start="1209.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> just yeah you know i'm trying not to fuck it up on my first month on the job but uh look we got stuff to do we had to run we had to hurry and uh you know there are are consequences to that what</p>
<p data-start="1219.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> what did it feel what was it like to actually do some of that stuff like when when you're passing those bills uh c5 comes to mind yeah what does that feel like when</p>
<p data-start="1226.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> c5 comes</p>
<p data-start="1229.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> when you know the conservatives come and join you and and passing the bill and immediately think did i just do something horribly wrong shannon stubbs agrees with me that's a terrible situation</p>
<p data-start="1237.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> shannon</p>
<p data-start="1239.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's a terrible situation</p>
<p data-start="1242.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean that that's got to be going through your head and give a very she just agree pity answer that can be</p>
<p data-start="1244.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> and give a very she just agree pity answer that can be also circulated amongst media put into</p>
<p data-start="1247.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> be</p>
<p data-start="1249.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> into a clip uh no no no no no i you know i think that the reality of the house is so</p>
<p data-start="1255.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> so a colleague of mine who i won't name because i'm not sure if he'd want to be attributed to it i just just let's say it wasn't mine you know we we finished like a late night of voting it was like midnight we get to leave yeah you know he says as we're walking out because because you know we we're</p>
<p data-start="1265.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah you</p>
<p data-start="1269.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're then all leaving at the same time because you're all there to vote if you're like there to vote right there is remote voting but but most of the people were in the house. And so we pour out of the chamber into our lobbies that are on each side of the chamber. And then we pour out of the lobbies instantly, like to the stairs and we all go down and we sort of all go down together. Right. And as we're walking over, he says, he says, Jesus, it's like that old Warner brothers cartoon where it's like, we're beating the shit out of each other in the house all day. And then we're out. See you tomorrow, Sam. You know, we just sort of walk out and</p>
<p data-start="1273.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> there to vote</p>
<p data-start="1296.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> all day. And</p>
<p data-start="1297.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="1297.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="1300.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> we</p>
<p data-start="1300.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> we just sort of walk out and</p>
<p data-start="1301.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1302.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's a bit of that. Like what you don't catch on the cameras. and uh or in the audio is like we're</p>
<p data-start="1308.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> we're chatting</p>
<p data-start="1308.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> chatting with each other we certainly talk to each other in the halls you know my conservative colleagues are very nice to me on the airplane right like there is a certain theater element to it you know and there's there's jokes and some of the jokes are pretty funny like um you know so on c5 uh one of the people who didn't vote for at least one of the motions i can't remember if you voted in the final thing was nate erskine smith you know yeah liberal mp and</p>
<p data-start="1331.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> and uh you know uh chris the whip for the conservatives is like you know chirping across the way he's like jesus you know we're more reliable votes for your guys bill than your party are what's going on over there you know it's like that's pretty funny i can i can deal with that that's kind of fun and so yeah you know i i mean it is one of the things i hate most about it if i'm being candid but it is also you know it makes me think maybe there's a foundation for more constructive working relationships that like it's not as shitty as it sometimes appears and so like if you can find common ground and you can work with people and i you know i just don't think the conservatives are that interested in voting against stuff like that the</p>
<p data-start="1346.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> and so</p>
<p data-start="1367.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> interested in</p>
<p data-start="1369.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> the naivete is just on display i know the</p>
<p data-start="1370.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> naivete is</p>
<p data-start="1372.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> on display i know the rookie mp</p>
<p data-start="1373.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> the rookie</p>
<p data-start="1373.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> rookie mp the rookie mp so</p>
<p data-start="1374.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> mp the</p>
<p data-start="1374.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="1375.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> the rookie mp so good they're all friends it's my jokes card it's like summer camp there's</p>
<p data-start="1376.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> so good they're all friends it's</p>
<p data-start="1377.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="1379.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's</p>
<p data-start="1379.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> there's in time it's</p>
<p data-start="1380.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's summer camp for for grown-ups summer camp well Well, yeah. Summer camp that you're not invited to see.</p>
<p data-start="1385.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> camp that you're not invited to see. Who's your camp counselor?</p>
<p data-start="1387.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Is it Patch?</p>
<p data-start="1388.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1389.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> know. I don't get the reference. Like, who's my... Is a camp counselor somebody who's a colleague of mine? Which film? Is this Dane? No, someone who's taking care of you</p>
<p data-start="1391.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Is a camp counselor somebody</p>
<p data-start="1393.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> who's a colleague of mine? Which film? Is this Dane? No, someone who's taking care of you while you're there. Like, does someone take care of you while you're in Ottawa? No, nobody takes care of me. Like, we've seen you try and live. How do you eat when you're in Ottawa? Well, I hope that's a really good question. Because we know how you have eaten.</p>
<p data-start="1399.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, nobody takes</p>
<p data-start="1399.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> takes care of me. Like, we've seen</p>
<p data-start="1404.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="1404.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="1404.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, I hope that's a really good question.</p>
<p data-start="1406.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> question. Because we know how you have</p>
<p data-start="1407.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> have eaten.</p>
<p data-start="1407.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> eaten.</p>
<p data-start="1408.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I almost never do. You know, it's just, it is... well look i mean the reality is those are things you kind of have to watch when you're an mp because</p>
<p data-start="1408.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I almost</p>
<p data-start="1409.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> almost</p>
<p data-start="1409.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> almost</p>
<p data-start="1409.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> almost never do. You</p>
<p data-start="1416.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's a weird combination of there's food everywhere at events but unless you actually are consciously sitting down to eat you might also just forget to eat for a day too so so people in ottawa tend to go one of two ways they'll like gain 15 pounds or lose 15 pounds like in their first kind of session so so</p>
<p data-start="1427.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> in</p>
<p data-start="1435.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> so we're gonna watch it i'm more the lose actually like the thing is like Like, for me, food is so disassociated from hunger. I don't know why or how. It's not a good thing. But, like, when I'm at my house and there's all the candy my kids have around and there's all of the food in the world, like, I'll just kind of randomly eat. But when I'm in Ottawa and it actually takes, like, conscious effort to go get a meal, I'll just, just as much as not, just be like, I'll get later. And then later is a meal later. This isn't describing</p>
<p data-start="1435.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="1435.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> so we're gonna watch it i'm</p>
<p data-start="1436.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm</p>
<p data-start="1436.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm</p>
<p data-start="1436.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm more the</p>
<p data-start="1437.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="1458.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> is a meal later. This isn't describing a healthy relationship with food. It's</p>
<p data-start="1461.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> It's not. I know. Something to work on. We all have things to work on. Carter wants to</p>
<p data-start="1463.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> on. We</p>
<p data-start="1464.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> We all have things to work on. Carter wants to ask, is how many Wendy's burgers sub the patty with fries in the middle that we had so far? Over, under, on three. That's really nice. Over,</p>
<p data-start="1470.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> middle that we had so</p>
<p data-start="1471.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Over, under, on three. That's really nice. Over, under, on three. I don't know where the Wendy's is, so that's somewhat saved me. Fucking lie. It's an over, Carter. We know it's an over. Yeah, we know it. That's a simple skip order. Corey, you can figure that out. Hey, you know, I mentioned I want to talk a bit about debates, right? Yeah. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1472.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Over, under, on three. I don't</p>
<p data-start="1476.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> lie. It's</p>
<p data-start="1478.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> over. Yeah, we know it. That's a simple skip</p>
<p data-start="1482.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> you can</p>
<p data-start="1486.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1486.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah. Why is he trying</p>
<p data-start="1486.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah. Why is he trying to redirect? We're asking the hard-hitting questions about shoes. We didn't even bring up Flair Airlines. No, we were. We were one step away</p>
<p data-start="1488.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> the hard-hitting questions about shoes. We didn't even bring up</p>
<p data-start="1491.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, we were. We were one step away from Swiss Chalet, and I veered. I fucking zagged, man. I didn't want to go there. What</p>
<p data-start="1496.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> zagged, man. I</p>
<p data-start="1498.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> What do you have</p>
<p data-start="1498.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> do you have</p>
<p data-start="1499.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> have against Swiss Chalet?</p>
<p data-start="1500.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p data-start="1500.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Nothing. Oh, now here we go. It's fine.</p>
<p data-start="1500.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Nothing. Oh, now here we go. It's fine.</p>
<p data-start="1503.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Swiss Chalet is fine. It's fine. If it's your thing, I think that's good for you. I did a whole campaign</p>
<p data-start="1508.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I did a whole campaign on Swiss Chalet. Wow.</p>
<p data-start="1509.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> on Swiss Chalet. Wow. Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1511.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1511.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Did not die.</p>
<p data-start="1514.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yet. Yet. Yet.</p>
<p data-start="1516.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yet. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1516.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, wow.</p>
<p data-start="1516.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1516.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1517.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> From</p>
<p data-start="1517.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> From both of you. Talk about debates.</p>
<p data-start="1519.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Talk about debates. And then there's two things I actually want to get into process-wise that I find interesting. Your trip to Rome and then your process for the Parle Sec. How did that come about? out and how did you hear it so talk to us about debates sure</p>
<p data-start="1526.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> come about?</p>
<p data-start="1529.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> sure well like so um debates kind of also leads into me wanting to chat about qp for a heartbeat here yeah</p>
<p data-start="1535.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah so</p>
<p data-start="1535.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> so one of the things about so there's time for debates i don't like i said like the whole parliamentary procedure is not my jam but long story short is there's like you get 20 minute blocks right where it's a 20 minute speech and then 10 minutes of questions from the rest of the house rotating</p>
<p data-start="1550.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> through all of the parties uh but the 20 minute block can be split become two 10 minute blocks or whatnot but one of of the things that happens in a debate uh pretty quickly is well let me put it this way if you have something to say on a bill you're not gonna have any trouble saying it like you just go to like the person who's managing your lobby and you're like hey can i get on the speaker's list either for today or tomorrow or whatever it is i'll go i want to go i have a few things to say they'll be like yeah fucking great because most of the time they're trying to fill that time and sustain the house and what's happening is uh they're rotating through like liberal conservative block liberal liberal-conservative, liberal-conservative, liberal-conservative block, or some pattern like that, right? And</p>
<p data-start="1589.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> And even</p>
<p data-start="1589.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> even though there's not necessarily something new to add to the conversation, nobody wants to give up their part of the conversation, because if a liberal's not there to do it, it's just going to go on to the conservative, right? And then it's going to be a couple of those speakers. We've got to save some</p>
<p data-start="1602.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> of those speakers.</p>
<p data-start="1602.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> speakers. We've got to save some of their talking points. But no,</p>
<p data-start="1604.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> points. But no, Zane, because we don't save it. We just repeat them. We repeat them in kind of different frames. And so a lot of the House does start to feel pretty repetitive, and you really take note of when it's somebody who stands up and gives a speech that's like oh this is coming from somewhere right like oh they're speaking from personal experience and you know some of them it's like really great you get this big extemporaneous speech or something like that right uh because most of it is like the house leader has sent a speech and i'm reading the speech i'm going to sit down and then there's questions and you know it's just it's like it's very patent performa um unfortunately</p>
<p data-start="1608.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> repeat them in kind</p>
<p data-start="1637.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> unfortunately so uh because i do think that like when people actually are leaning into it it's really great and i think I think truly, if you could manage to compress the debate just into those moments where people are saying the things that matter to them and that they want to say, I think the House of Commons would be fucking awesome. Like it would be like people would watch it, right? Like they would see interesting things, but there's just too much, too</p>
<p data-start="1657.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> would see interesting</p>
<p data-start="1660.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> too much doldrums, too much repetition, by and large. And to be fair, a</p>
<p data-start="1665.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> lot of the time, you don't even know it's repetition, because you're not in the chamber, you know, you weren't there for the first four hours, you weren't on house duty, now you are. now you're going to make a speech blah blah blah um</p>
<p data-start="1675.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> um so that's that's number one but that gets us to qp so 2 p.m eastern every day you've got 15 minutes of statements by members it's like one minute like blast like oh you know there's a chili cook-off in ramuski and it's great you know best chili cook-off in in the eastern part of quebec you know and i just i hope you'll all come out yeah clap clap clap right um and then you get to qp and what can i say about qp that That hasn't really already been said.</p>
<p data-start="1706.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> QP's the worst, guys. Like, it's just like, okay, I want to be fair to all sides here. So the opposition stands up and they ask the same question 15 different ways, 15 different flavors of angry and shitty. And, you know, and they're staring at the camera and they're like this. And it's just like so, like, 35-second sound bites that they're going to use for social media. And you can think, oh, shame on them. But then the government responses come. and we give 35 second responses that have maybe passing like reflection to the question that was asked and it's just like why won't they stand with us and canadians you know it's like you know it's just like the lowest nutrition value you could possibly get and we do it 15 times we'll give the same you know non-answer 15 times and and they will give the same question they know the answer to 15 times and none of us are like particularly</p>
<p data-start="1709.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> just like,</p>
<p data-start="1757.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> like uh</p>
<p data-start="1759.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> i don't know what can you say like why Why do we do this? Like you sit there. Oh, and then like the rest of us are sitting there like clapping madly like train seals. Like, oh, it was great. The 15th time I heard that it was fucking awesome. You know? Did you stop</p>
<p data-start="1771.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> You know?</p>
<p data-start="1772.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Did you stop yourself from clapping or cheering or did you feel like you had to? No, you</p>
<p data-start="1777.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> you kind of had. Listen, a couple</p>
<p data-start="1779.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> couple of things on that. One, you sort of do it because like sometimes your colleagues do do a nice spin on it. But the other one is you</p>
<p data-start="1787.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> you want to make sure you have your teams back. like one of the things i think even on heckling i would say is like i was like i will never heckle i will never fucking heckle yeah</p>
<p data-start="1794.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> fucking heckle</p>
<p data-start="1796.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah this is i was heckling</p>
<p data-start="1796.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> was</p>
<p data-start="1796.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> heckling within two weeks right uh not all the time like i wasn't being shitty but</p>
<p data-start="1798.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> uh not all the time like i wasn't being shitty but</p>
<p data-start="1800.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="1801.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="1804.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> a little bit right but you know the reason you do it is to have your guys back like because what happens is they're heckling your guy or gal right who's speaking yeah and you're like those fucking assholes that's a friend of mine that's a a colleague of mine and so you give it back to them right and so it ends up being very much a sports team thing and less about them and more about your team and letting your team know you have their back right it's it's different than you expect who's</p>
<p data-start="1831.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> who's the best heckler on your team who's</p>
<p data-start="1832.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> who's</p>
<p data-start="1833.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> the best heckler on my team oh i don't know i don't know if they'd want that praise to be honest come on hogan just you know who's a pretty good heckler is yasser really</p>

<p data-start="1888.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I know you do.</p>
<p data-start="1888.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> do. Well, look, I kind of posted about this. Pitch</p>
<p data-start="1888.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> do. Well, look, I kind of posted about this. Pitch us, because you've done this for three weeks now. Yeah, so I clearly know how to fix it. You've got the solutions. I can solve it. Give us a solution.</p>
<p data-start="1891.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Pitch</p>
<p data-start="1891.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Pitch us,</p>
<p data-start="1893.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, so I clearly know how to fix it. You've got the solutions. I can solve it. Give us a solution.</p>
<p data-start="1897.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> So, there's this thing that happens at the end of the sitting day, uh you know colloquially called the late show right if if somebody feels that they're not satisfied with their question that they asked and the response they got in qp they can then go and basically ask a long form version of that question and they get a long form response so they get a four minute block for the question and you get a four minute block to respond and</p>
<p data-start="1920.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="1920.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> and then they get a one minute supplemental and you get one minute to respond that</p>
<p data-start="1925.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> nobody's around for it like because like it's right at the end like so right so there's very few people in the house the</p>
<p data-start="1932.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> quality of that even though that still has its problems is so much better than the average quality of a qp exchange right i think you could do a version of qp at least once a week where somebody says okay i'm just in advance it doesn't need to be a lot in advance like an hour in advance just let them know the category so the minister knows who's up can give some thought to what they're going to say you get a much better response as a result and you could have a more thoughtful exchange on an an issue and you could actually test somebody's knowledge of it because i'll tell you something 35 seconds you could say anything at 35 seconds you know as a joke so as a parlsec one of the things you have to do is answer if like your minister's not in the house and sometimes there's moments where you're looking around you're like is that minister there am i gonna be up i don't have a binder today you know like i don't know what to do uh and some of my colleagues will be like oh no what if i have to go up and i always say to them like well just it's 35 seconds you just say, Mr. Speaker, I can't believe. Let's start the clock, right? Mr.</p>
<p data-start="1970.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> sometimes there's</p>
<p data-start="1973.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> there am i gonna be up</p>
<p data-start="1988.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Mr. Speaker, I cannot even believe the member opposite would ask a question like that. This government is incredibly committed to Canadians, is incredibly committed to this country, and incredibly committed to equity and justice for all. I hope the members opposite will join us as we are trying to make Canada stronger, including a tax cut for 22 million Canadians, Mr. Speaker. Why don't they get on board with that mr speaker we've got canadians backs will they have canadians backs and like it's fucking over you know like hey</p>
<p data-start="2016.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know like hey can i ask you a question if you were so good at 35 second answers what the fuck happened on this podcast yeah let's</p>
<p data-start="2023.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> let's go ahead well</p>
<p data-start="2024.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> well i think what i'm saying is sometimes they're not really answers steve oh i</p>
<p data-start="2027.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh i see but maybe four minutes maybe</p>
<p data-start="2028.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> but maybe four minutes</p>
<p data-start="2030.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> maybe</p>
<p data-start="2030.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> maybe four</p>
<p data-start="2030.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> four minutes that's enough for a zane question and a corey response you know i don't think it's enough time for a zane question i mean the same question i mean</p>
<p data-start="2030.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> four minutes that's enough for a</p>
<p data-start="2035.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> i don't think it's enough time for a zane question i mean the</p>
<p data-start="2038.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean that's let's not go crazy yeah so let's not go three weeks</p>
<p data-start="2040.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah so</p>

<p data-start="2307.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> and we get there</p>
<p data-start="2308.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> there and um there are we have pretty good seats where the canadian we just happen i I guess in Canada, there's the Americans have like their delegation ahead of us. And we're just like right behind them. The Italians are to our left. You know, there's, there's all sorts of, you know, people going on.</p>
<p data-start="2321.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, there's,</p>
<p data-start="2324.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> We get there and we can't find our seats. We're, we're looking around and all of like the, um, embassy staff and the protocol staff are confused. They're like, where are our seats? Can't find our seats. And so, um, the ambassador to Italy, she says to us, well, she says to myself and Jaime Batiste, like, well, you guys just go sit over there. like with the italians basically right so we go and we sit in the middle of the italian like parliament seats and there's another fellow who's there and they kind of kick him out pretty quick but they don't kick us out yet and so hymie's like if they if they ask if you're like a parliamentarian just say just say c c that means yes here it's fine and so uh you know we uh we don't get kicked out so we end up staying there but what's happening where we were is they find find out that the reason we can't find our seats is the americans have taken off the reserve for canada signs and put reserve for the usa on it because they're trying to get more space anyways no yes yeah i mean very much symbolic of the times right anyways oh my god ambassador tough</p>
<p data-start="2382.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yes yeah i</p>
<p data-start="2387.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh my god ambassador</p>
<p data-start="2389.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> tough as hell she says i don't think so gang and they're like no no no we need the seats she's like these are our seats these are not your seats sit down she says to our delegation and everyone sits down in it but yeah the uh she was a little she was little elbows up uh and you know it all's well that ends well and the americans kind of said something apparently i wasn't there like ambassador</p>
<p data-start="2407.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> apparently i wasn't there like ambassador to the vatican ambassador</p>
<p data-start="2410.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> ambassador</p>
<p data-start="2410.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> ambassador to italy to italy so we have an ambassador to the vatican and an ambassador to italy of course and so uh and so uh yeah uh the americans begrudgingly oh i guess you guys can have them and i guess we were like no there are seats we have them because there are seats so So, but, uh, yeah, it was</p>
<p data-start="2411.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> to italy so we have</p>
<p data-start="2415.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> so uh and</p>
<p data-start="2416.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> and so</p>
<p data-start="2428.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2428.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah, it</p>
<p data-start="2429.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> it was</p>
<p data-start="2431.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> was</p>
<p data-start="2432.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> was</p>
<p data-start="2432.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> was quite an interesting metaphor, but, uh, yeah, anyways, Jaime and I never made it back there. We were sitting amongst the Italians the whole time and then we did a full Latin mass sitting in the seventh row, which</p>
<p data-start="2432.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> was quite</p>
<p data-start="2440.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> a full</p>
<p data-start="2444.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> which is like a lot closer than I ever sit at mass at home. Right. I was like, I was observing that at one point to myself. I'm like, like, I don't sit this close in church at home. Like this is, I'm a back row guy. Right. And, uh, I'm sitting here in the Vatican. and it was very wild. It was quite interesting, quite humbling. So, yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2459.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> that was Rome.</p>
<p data-start="2460.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="2460.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="2460.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, follow us for our dear friend, Mr. Corey Hogan. I want to talk about the Parlesek thing. We've got to maybe let him go.</p>
<p data-start="2461.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> us for our dear friend,</p>
<p data-start="2462.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> friend,</p>
<p data-start="2467.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I want you to do the Parlesek thing and then I want to talk about something coming up because the stuff coming up is the most interesting. I agree</p>
<p data-start="2470.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> about something coming</p>
<p data-start="2475.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> interesting. I agree with that, too. Parlesek. Carter</p>
<p data-start="2478.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> and I make cakes. We made multiple cakes for you. The Parlesek one paid off. That's</p>
<p data-start="2483.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> The Parlesek</p>
<p data-start="2485.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's great. I'm glad. But how did you get that job? Talk to me about process. Talk to me about timing. Was this after</p>
<p data-start="2486.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm glad. But how did you get</p>
<p data-start="2492.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> the King's speech? Yeah. It was. It was after. Okay. Yes, it was. Walk us through this. All</p>
<p data-start="2495.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. It was. It was</p>
<p data-start="2499.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> right. Well, like, obviously, I don't know how conversations were unfolding behind the scenes. Sure. But I will say, I think it's pretty safe to say at this particular moment, if I'm saying something I shouldn't, oops, my bad, PCO. Sorry about that. but i</p>
<p data-start="2505.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> But I</p>
<p data-start="2514.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> got a call not too soon after the election just essentially to get my permission to be vetted right</p>
<p data-start="2519.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> right uh</p>
<p data-start="2519.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> right uh</p>
<p data-start="2520.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh you know where i have to you know you fill out a form and then they can go through your financials and all of that stuff and you have an interview with somebody and in the interview they sort of say like this is you know they don't tell you why at the start but you'd have to be an idiot not to kind of know that it's like for an additional position um but you know they do say they're like well you know it's this is for like you know consideration for ministers or parliamentary like it's always like that was like part of the framing off the top like so i don't know what they're thinking was like from day one and that they the vetting is not about like your qualities it's not about what you're good at it's like tell us let's go through your life about everything that could be bad right like let's let's just figure it out you know they're like how's your marriage you know uh drug use you use drugs you know like stuff like that like and they go different different than</p>
<p data-start="2520.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know where</p>
<p data-start="2529.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know they don't</p>
<p data-start="2566.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> like and they go different different than the candidate vetting you had like in terms of intensity and timing or well</p>
<p data-start="2572.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> well so</p>
<p data-start="2572.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> so they're sitting there and they actually have</p>
<p data-start="2574.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> have</p>
<p data-start="2574.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> have my candidate vetting as well like as sort of a foundation for questions they're going to ask you and the notes that are in there and all of that but uh yeah i would say it was certainly much more about kind of like my personal life and you know and then they throw questions where like why</p>
<p data-start="2575.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> well like</p>
<p data-start="2576.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> as sort</p>
<p data-start="2590.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> why are they asking that what do they know like you know they'll be like somebody who'll be like listed as like a i won't say which because but you have have to list a bunch of relatives and they're like how's that relative doing and it's like of a list of like 20 they pick one and you're like why</p>
<p data-start="2604.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> fuck</p>
<p data-start="2604.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> fuck they ask about that</p>
<p data-start="2604.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> that one</p>
<p data-start="2605.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> one you</p>
<p data-start="2605.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know and like you start getting in almost your own head about that but uh um yeah so it's like it's a little more intrusive like that they say things like what's the one thing you'd be like mortified if the prime minister found out about right or like you had to go tell them and so was</p>
<p data-start="2605.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> know and</p>
<p data-start="2610.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> so it's</p>
<p data-start="2620.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> was it the podcast it was</p>
<p data-start="2620.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> podcast it was definitely the podcast yeah i'm really embarrassed about the podcast yeah</p>
<p data-start="2622.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i'm really embarrassed</p>
<p data-start="2625.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah that's That's what I would have gone with. So</p>
<p data-start="2626.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> gone with. So you do that, and then you go, and then the cabinet comes out, and you're not in it, and you're like, oh, okay. Well, everyone wants to be a cabinet, right? So it's a bit</p>
<p data-start="2633.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's a bit of a downer, but it's not the biggest deal. I</p>
<p data-start="2635.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> I will say, like, it's not a better job in the world than being an MP. But because you're your own boss, and you get to do whatever you want, right? As long as you keep voting with the way- As long as</p>
<p data-start="2644.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> way- As long as you vote with the way you're supposed to vote. And you clap at the right time. Keep it in 35 seconds. And you got to clap at the right time.</p>
<p data-start="2646.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> to vote. And you clap at the right time. Keep it in 35 seconds. And you got to clap at the right time. Well, and, you know, like, but, you know, and of course, you got to keep, you got to work for your people. but uh but uh so anyways that goes on and then there's</p>
<p data-start="2650.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="2650.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Well, and,</p>
<p data-start="2650.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2651.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2659.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> just uh at an early regional caucus meeting we just get word like oh because</p>
<p data-start="2664.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> because i don't think anyone knew 100 that we're going to be parlsecs although i think there was like an assumption there'd be parliamentary secretaries you just get a note like oh and parliamentary secretaries that's going to be like within a week was not within a week took like two weeks i think probably from when we heard it was a week but um so</p>
<p data-start="2678.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's going on uh and then you just sort of go about your life you don't hear anything about it except for kind of occasionally updates like oh it's going to be in the next couple of days or whatnot and</p>
<p data-start="2687.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> and then i get a phone call i get a phone call from uh brayden cayley who</p>
<p data-start="2691.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> who you know many of us i think all of us know right yeah</p>
<p data-start="2694.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah oh yeah and</p>
<p data-start="2695.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> and he says basically like</p>
<p data-start="2697.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> like you</p>
<p data-start="2697.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2697.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know on behalf of you know the prime minister is this something you'd be willing to do be parlsec for you know energy and natural resources and i</p>
<p data-start="2705.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i mean i don't think there's an answer except yes right like i I feel like you should have signaled much sooner if you weren't interested in a role like that by the time they get to you. So</p>
<p data-start="2715.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> So you say yes, and then you do it. And like</p>
<p data-start="2717.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> a lot of it, like, you</p>
<p data-start="2720.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't know what the hell it is. You know, like, nobody tells you, okay, well, what do I got to do next? You get your job description on the phone.</p>
<p data-start="2724.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> I got to do next? You get your job description on the phone.</p>
<p data-start="2726.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, you don't get anything like that. And of course, like, I know what a parlsec is, and I know what the rough job is, but like... Did you know there's going to be two of you in this? I did. So they told me there'd be two. So, like, I think it's fair to say that with the benefit of hindsight, I don't know if this was always the plan, but it was clearly the plan for a while to say, okay, energy, natural resources, important file, kind of a national unity file at this point. So we've got Tim Hodgson, who's, you know, super smart dealmaker, you know, well-known and well-connected to Mark Carney. and uh then you get uh an albertan and you get a quebecer and you say okay between the three of you figure it out you know because this is like kind of important stuff and so hey you know and tim's a great guy to work with uh and so is cloud uh we we have a lot of fun because cloud by the way is like former like ibm canada president like super smart guy too uh he's the he's the other process and</p>
<p data-start="2751.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know, super</p>
<p data-start="2780.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and so you're</p>
<p data-start="2780.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> so you're</p>
<p data-start="2780.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="2780.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> you're kind</p>
<p data-start="2780.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> kind of the</p>
<p data-start="2781.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the slow</p>
<p data-start="2781.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> slow</p>
<p data-start="2781.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> slow</p>
<p data-start="2781.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> slow one you're kind of the slow one i think when you vice president</p>
<p data-start="2782.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> one i think when you vice president i think everyone else was a president everyone was a president i was just a vice president</p>
<p data-start="2785.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> president everyone was a president i</p>
<p data-start="2787.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> was just a vice</p>
<p data-start="2788.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> president yeah</p>
<p data-start="2788.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2788.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah that's</p>
<p data-start="2788.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's uh</p>
<p data-start="2789.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's uh that's got</p>
<p data-start="2789.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh</p>
<p data-start="2789.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> uh that's</p>
<p data-start="2789.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's got to be a shift for you it's got to hurt the problem i hadn't thought about that thank you for making me feel bad this</p>
<p data-start="2790.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> got to be a shift for you it's got to hurt the problem i</p>
<p data-start="2792.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> hadn't thought about that thank you for making me feel bad this</p>
<p data-start="2794.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> this is why he's got to climb up the ranks with novel ideas about qp yeah</p>
<p data-start="2795.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> climb up</p>
<p data-start="2796.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> novel ideas about qp yeah so</p>
<p data-start="2800.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> so can</p>
<p data-start="2800.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> can</p>
<p data-start="2801.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i ask my so now i want to know what what so</p>
<p data-start="2803.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> so you're back in calgary yeah what</p>
<p data-start="2806.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know everybody always assumes that you're not doing anything yeah</p>
<p data-start="2809.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2810.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because you're just back in Calgary. What is the average day looking like for a member of parliament, Corey Hogan, just getting his feet underneath him in Calgary? I would imagine that a lot of it's just planning your stampede breakfast.</p>
<p data-start="2822.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, I've done almost none of that, as you know. I think that was a leading question. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2828.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Look, so all of that office setup that we didn't get to do earlier, we're doing now. Yeah. And there are things like getting the first householder out. So that's the mailing that we do. There are creating</p>
<p data-start="2833.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2838.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> creating the processes. It's creating the metrics through which we measure ourselves. There's just scores of meetings of people that have backed up along the way that we've got to have. There</p>
<p data-start="2847.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> There are announcements. You're at the Green Line announcement. You're at the Lufthansa Technic announcement. Do you</p>
<p data-start="2853.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Do you want to talk about the way you were wearing your hard hat in the Green</p>
<p data-start="2856.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Green Line</p>
<p data-start="2856.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Green</p>
<p data-start="2857.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Line shovel thing? It was fine. It</p>
<p data-start="2858.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> thing? It was fine. It was a fine. It was not fine. It was fine wearing the hard hat. Your hard</p>
<p data-start="2860.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> It was not fine. It was fine wearing the hard hat. Your hard hat looked really bad. Do you want to talk</p>
<p data-start="2863.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> hard</p>
<p data-start="2863.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> hard</p>
<p data-start="2864.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> bad. Do you want to talk about your expression in that ribbon cutting that we also saw? it was a little bit too a little bit do you want to</p>
<p data-start="2867.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> a little bit</p>
<p data-start="2868.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> bit too</p>
<p data-start="2868.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> too a</p>
<p data-start="2869.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> do you want to know where my expression came from on that one yeah</p>
<p data-start="2871.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah well the scissors were</p>
<p data-start="2873.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> were way sharper than</p>
<p data-start="2874.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> than</p>
<p data-start="2874.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> than i expected it</p>
<p data-start="2875.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="2875.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> it was like holy shit i feel like you could cut off a baby's arm with those scissors you gotta be careful with those scissors yeah</p>
<p data-start="2882.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2882.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i</p>
<p data-start="2882.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> i expected them to be more dull they were not it felt more like a guillotine right so i think that well that's</p>
<p data-start="2883.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> them</p>
<p data-start="2888.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> well that's that's good i'm glad and you still get all your digits i</p>
<p data-start="2892.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i you're okay so far you</p>
<p data-start="2892.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> you're okay so far</p>
<p data-start="2893.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know but it was my first uh first ribbon cutting so i</p>
<p data-start="2897.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't know we could tell</p>
<p data-start="2897.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't know we</p>
<p data-start="2898.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah you did not look you looked a little bit 12 yeah</p>
<p data-start="2899.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> you did not look you</p>
<p data-start="2900.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> you looked a little bit 12 yeah</p>
<p data-start="2902.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> well because it was the first ribbon cutting you know it was just really exciting it's no how would you change how would</p>
<p data-start="2903.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> well</p>
<p data-start="2903.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> well</p>
<p data-start="2907.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> no how would you change how would you change ribbon cutting square now that you've done one now that i've done one now that you've done one what do we need to do differently about i think the</p>
<p data-start="2911.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> i've done one now that you've done one what</p>
<p data-start="2912.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> what do we need to do differently</p>
<p data-start="2914.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> think the ribbons need a big bow you know they need like a focal point like an accoutrement i kind of agree with him on that yeah</p>
<p data-start="2919.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> kind</p>
<p data-start="2919.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> kind of</p>
<p data-start="2919.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> of</p>
<p data-start="2920.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> of</p>
<p data-start="2920.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> of</p>
<p data-start="2921.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah keep</p>
<p data-start="2921.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> keep going though I'm not disagreeing. To that point, though, on the office, can I ask, did you take, is it common practice to just take the spot that your predecessor, regardless of what party they are, had from like a opposite office perspective? And are you doing that?</p>
<p data-start="2933.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> opposite office</p>
<p data-start="2936.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> So you, when you get the office, you get it for three months beyond the election, beyond when they vacate it. So I think for us, that time is up in August. We're going to have to make the decision pretty quick, whether we stay there or we look for a different office. Got it. I think right now I'm leaning towards different office, something</p>
<p data-start="2953.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> something that's a little more central and in the constituency. This one is sort of right on the edge of the constituency in the Northwest, which works for Len because Len lived up there. Right. And so it was like kind of a, you know, it was a sensible way for him to kind of organize his life.</p>
<p data-start="2970.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I would rather be sort of in</p>
<p data-start="2972.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> in the heart of the constituency. Doesn't even need to be where I live, but like just just a little bit more central. probably</p>
<p data-start="2977.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> probably</p>
<p data-start="2977.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> probably</p>
<p data-start="2977.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> probably</p>
<p data-start="2978.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> in</p>
<p data-start="2978.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> in Che there is at least</p>
<p data-start="2978.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> in</p>
<p data-start="2980.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> is at least one location in Che that I'll I was kind of looking at it needs to</p>
<p data-start="2986.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> it needs</p>
<p data-start="2986.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> needs to have</p>
<p data-start="2987.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> to</p>
<p data-start="2987.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> to</p>
<p data-start="2987.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> to</p>

<p data-start="3111.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> do</p>
<p data-start="3111.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> do you want</p>

<p data-start="3119.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> services tax or something like that the digital services</p>
<p data-start="3120.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> or something like that the digital services taxes has it been yeah so</p>
<p data-start="3121.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> services taxes has it been yeah so</p>
<p data-start="3123.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> is this the part of the show where, like, I, you know... Defend the government. Got it. Or</p>
<p data-start="3128.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> government.</p>
<p data-start="3130.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Or you make some cruel, cruel, limiting moves. We find out together.</p>
<p data-start="3130.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Or you</p>
<p data-start="3131.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> cruel,</p>
<p data-start="3132.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> cruel,</p>
<p data-start="3132.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> cruel,</p>
<p data-start="3132.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> cruel,</p>
<p data-start="3132.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> cruel, limiting moves. We</p>
<p data-start="3133.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We find out</p>
<p data-start="3134.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> out together.</p>
<p data-start="3136.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> kind of talk about this, Jack,</p>
<p data-start="3137.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> about this,</p>
<p data-start="3137.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Jack, as you do about QP.</p>
<p data-start="3140.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, look, I mean, I think that everybody knows QP is a challenge, right? I don't think I'm splitting the atom on that one. Yeah, exactly, right.</p>
<p data-start="3145.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> don't think I'm splitting the atom on that one. Yeah, exactly, right. Can you extend it to this? Are you willing to extend it to this? Well,</p>
<p data-start="3150.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Are you willing to</p>
<p data-start="3152.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, look, I mean, what can you say? It's an interesting... Look, on</p>
<p data-start="3156.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> on Friday, Donald Trump decides that he's going to potentially throw, blow up all negotiations and not negotiate with Canadians as long as the digital services tax exists. And the reason why it's, I guess, au courant is today was the day where all of these American companies were going to have to give, well, not just America, but like the American companies, you know, money retroactive for a few different years, right? And he's like, if this happens, like all negotiations.</p>
<p data-start="3184.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> negotiations.</p>
<p data-start="3184.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> negotiations. I</p>
<p data-start="3185.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> think it's fair to say, as Canadians, we've known for a long time, the digital service tax is not something that the Americans are particularly thrilled about, like Joe Biden wasn't particularly thrilled about it.</p>
<p data-start="3196.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I think it's also fair to say we always sort of knew this was likely to be something that got mixed up in any kind of trade negotiation that occurred. It</p>
<p data-start="3204.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> It was going to be true of any government, any trade negotiation going on. so</p>
<p data-start="3206.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> any trade</p>
<p data-start="3208.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> so i think in some ways it was not like the hardest give for us right to say okay well let's just keep things moving it was going to be you know something there as long as it sort of gets costed into the final deal but</p>
<p data-start="3220.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> but i mean i certainly understand why people look at it and say like oh man we gave the americans another one and you know the the u.s president just demanded and we we did this thing for him and i think yeah</p>
<p data-start="3230.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="3231.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah i</p>
<p data-start="3231.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i mean like a</p>
<p data-start="3232.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="3232.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="3232.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> a huge part of me</p>
<p data-start="3235.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> hates</p>
<p data-start="3235.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> hates that right like Like doesn't want to do that, but like that's the kind of ego you sort of have to check when you're the government and you don't have the luxury of having. Like as a podcaster, I probably would have been railing against it, but realistically, we</p>
<p data-start="3236.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> to do that, but</p>
<p data-start="3248.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> need a deal. Like I've been writing about this forever. Like in January, I was saying, look, no matter what you think of this current moment, and I think a lot of things about it,</p>
<p data-start="3258.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> if you want to have a different economic future for Canada, one that is not as tied to the United States, one that perhaps is more integrated with Europe and Asia and Africa, right?</p>
<p data-start="3270.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's going to require time, and that's going to require money. So step one for any reorientation of our economy is minimizing the damage and eliminating the damage from this current moment we're in with the United States. And that was never going to be fun, right? And that was never going to be anything but pain, I think, for all parties involved. Does it</p>
<p data-start="3286.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> was never</p>
<p data-start="3291.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> it turn into an Alberta-type situation where the government of Alberta is unwilling to switch from the easy opportunity that is oil and gas, and as a result, they're stuck there and we never move away from it? Do you see that the government of Canada, the Canadian excitement about doing deals with Europe and Africa and Asia, do you think that that</p>
<p data-start="3320.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> starts to subside when we get another deal with the Americans? Will we still be this enthusiastic? The diversification,</p>
<p data-start="3325.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> this enthusiastic? The diversification, will</p>
<p data-start="3327.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> will it happen if we stay</p>
<p data-start="3327.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> if we stay</p>
<p data-start="3328.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> stay on the same track?</p>
<p data-start="3328.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> track? Because we don't do it in Alberta. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="3328.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> track? Because we</p>
<p data-start="3330.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, well, I'll be honest. I think that the overall like public desire to do it will likely abate a bit. But I don't think this government's desire to reorient is going to abate. I think that the Prime Minister is pretty fixed on making sure that we have new trade deals and new trade relationships. He was in Europe this week, you know, for new military partnerships. And I think that you're going to see a lot more of that. But it's kind of like step one, step two stuff, right? Right. And so what I would say to anybody is as much as it might be galling to find ourselves at this particular moment, we can't we can't lose sight of the main objective here. And this is very much a game in progress. Like there are steps going on behind the scenes. There are steps going on that, you know, that even I am not privy to. Right. As a caucus member. Right. Where all of this is going on. And you're just going to have to sort of. Well, my my ask is, I guess, assess it on the full body of work, not like the individual moment within it. Like, you know, a month from now, two months from now, where are we in terms of a trade deal? Like assess that overall bundle, rather than assessing like the individual thrusts and parries of a very erratic US president who often throws bombs into the discussion that</p>
<p data-start="3401.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> frankly, he knows he didn't need to throw in. Like, you know, it would it would have been a moment of conversation about this. Anyhow, it would likely have been part of any deal anyhow. But he likes the theatrics of it. He likes to change the channel. And, you know, it's not really any way that, in</p>
<p data-start="3418.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> in my opinion, you should run a country just like random tweets on a Friday. But hey,</p>
<p data-start="3423.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> hey, Americans picked him and he's running that country. So we sort of have to we</p>
<p data-start="3428.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> have to kind of deal with it. And at the end of the day, you're gonna have to measure it by like the full body of work, not the not the individual plays. Carter,</p>
<p data-start="3436.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> you seem skeptical. I'll let you follow up as</p>
<p data-start="3439.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> as the minister. Yeah, you do look skeptical. I</p>
<p data-start="3439.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, you do look skeptical.</p>
<p data-start="3440.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> skeptical.</p>
<p data-start="3441.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I am skeptical. I think that it's easy to talk about these things. Hey, you're the minister,</p>
<p data-start="3442.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> skeptical. I think</p>
<p data-start="3442.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> think that</p>
<p data-start="3444.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> these things. Hey, you're the minister, man. Yeah, I know.</p>
<p data-start="3446.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I know. And this is why I'm concerned. I've been talking to the deputy minister, and I feel like we don't have the House behind us. My question about</p>
<p data-start="3458.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Alberta, I think, is about</p>
<p data-start="3461.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> about the weakness of government, right? Right.</p>
<p data-start="3464.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Government, because we tend to follow where the people want to go in</p>
<p data-start="3468.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> in three years or two years or a year, we may have a completely different directionality from the government, from the from the people. And the government may not have the opportunity to continue to</p>
<p data-start="3480.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> continue with these these big, bold dreams. I mean, a big, bold dream was announced when we went to a commitment of 5% of GDP towards military spending, which strikes me as a near impossibility for a country that was struggling to get to 2%. We're here now. Pardon me? We're</p>
<p data-start="3490.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> which</p>
<p data-start="3498.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're here now. Pardon me? We're at 2% now. We will be this year. We're kind of at 2% now.</p>
<p data-start="3501.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> this year. We're kind of at 2% now.</p>
<p data-start="3503.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> We're there. We're kind of there. Listen,</p>
<p data-start="3504.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> there. Listen, can I ask you guys a question? You</p>
<p data-start="3507.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> You most</p>
<p data-start="3507.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> You most certainly can. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="3509.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Setting aside my family, you know anybody who's gone to Tokyo recently? Lots of people.</p>
<p data-start="3515.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Lots</p>
<p data-start="3515.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Lots</p>
<p data-start="3515.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Lots of people. Just your family.</p>
<p data-start="3515.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> of people. Just your family. Lots of people. Because</p>
<p data-start="3516.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because</p>
<p data-start="3516.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Because of the direct flight, I assume. Because of the direct flight.</p>
<p data-start="3516.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because of the direct flight, I assume. Because of the direct flight.</p>
<p data-start="3519.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> I believe in a few things, and one of the things I believe in is markets. And government has the ability to set conditions that will then allow people to be rational actors and choose things that they wouldn't have chosen before those frameworks were in place. And so when you talk about oil and gas in Alberta, I hear you, Stephen. But I think one of the reasons why the, you know, Alberta, you know, you call it like easy money. I don't agree with that assessment. But like I would say, one of the reasons is that there's just no government will there and the government hasn't incentivized some of these things that you're talking about. But you have federally a government that will incentivize these things, that will make those trade deals. And ultimately, the market will then shift. Like once those conditions are there and people can make a pile of money in Europe, in Asia and in Africa, things</p>
<p data-start="3567.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> will shift. That's just economics. And I think that</p>
<p data-start="3571.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> that you shouldn't underestimate the power of a government that's hellbent on doing something. Well,</p>
<p data-start="3578.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I certainly underestimate the government of Alberta and its willingness to drive us straight into a ditch. So there you go. I</p>
<p data-start="3587.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean, I know. Corey, this is where you get to fill in</p>
<p data-start="3588.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> know. Corey, this is where you get to fill in the space there. Do you want to add</p>
<p data-start="3591.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> there.</p>
<p data-start="3591.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> there.</p>
<p data-start="3591.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Do you want to add anything about Danielle Smith and her government? Yeah, do you</p>
<p data-start="3593.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Smith and her government? Yeah, do</p>
<p data-start="3594.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> you want to talk about that? All</p>
<p data-start="3595.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> All right.</p>
<p data-start="3595.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> right. Let's</p>
<p data-start="3595.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Let's move on. Let's move on. Didn't love the surveys. I'll say that. Didn't love those surveys. No.</p>
<p data-start="3598.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> love</p>
<p data-start="3600.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Didn't</p>
<p data-start="3602.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> No. Not your favorite thing? Oh, my God.</p>
<p data-start="3602.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> No.</p>
<p data-start="3602.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Not your favorite thing? Oh, my God. Like, terrible survey design. Breaks all of the rules. Do we want to ask Dr.</p>
<p data-start="3606.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> all of the rules. Do we want to ask Dr. Trevor Toome what the hell he's up to and Adam Legge? I mean, some real questions there. Real questions. Maybe</p>
<p data-start="3611.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Legge? I mean, some real questions</p>
<p data-start="3613.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> questions</p>
<p data-start="3613.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> questions</p>
<p data-start="3614.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Maybe we'll save that for a show</p>
<p data-start="3615.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Maybe</p>
<p data-start="3617.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> show that Corey's on. That sounds like a mainline strategist episode. That does, Carter. Carter,</p>
<p data-start="3618.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> show that Corey's on. That sounds like a mainline</p>
<p data-start="3620.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> That does, Carter. Carter, as the minister, you, of course, get to ask the final question, but I've got the penultimate</p>
<p data-start="3622.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> the minister,</p>
<p data-start="3622.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> minister,</p>
<p data-start="3622.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> minister,</p>
<p data-start="3622.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> minister, you,</p>
<p data-start="3623.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you,</p>
<p data-start="3627.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> penultimate question. Yeah, you asked the</p>
<p data-start="3629.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you asked the penultimate question. Corey, how</p>
<p data-start="3630.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Corey, how</p>
<p data-start="3631.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> how long have you been doing this? How long have you been in the Ottawa bubble now? you've just come back from it but yeah i was i</p>
<p data-start="3639.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean i don't know it</p>
<p data-start="3640.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> feels like a question that there's not a good answer to because if i give a number no no no meeting i'm in the auto yeah</p>
<p data-start="3641.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> like a question that</p>
<p data-start="3644.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> no no no meeting</p>
<p data-start="3645.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah that's not even the question the question is this what's the most ottawa thing you have done so far kind of like your pinch me moment when you're like i'm one of these 300 plus legislators that get to create what's the most ottawa thing that you've done so far that you'll be like oh man i</p>
<p data-start="3648.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> this what's</p>
<p data-start="3656.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> that get to</p>
<p data-start="3660.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> i never thought i'd be doing</p>
<p data-start="3662.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> doing this or i never thought this would be me in some ways laid on</p>
<p data-start="3665.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> on me well</p>
<p data-start="3665.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> well i honestly think the answer might be the heckling right like where i just like the first time i'm like ah what am i doing you know and i know why i did it for all of the reasons i said but that was probably the moment where i'm like i</p>
<p data-start="3677.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> i hope i don't become somebody i don't want to become but you know in</p>
<p data-start="3680.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> in</p>
<p data-start="3680.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> in general risk of that no</p>
<p data-start="3680.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> in general risk of that</p>
<p data-start="3682.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> i mean</p>
<p data-start="3682.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> i mean</p>
<p data-start="3683.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean look i think i</p>
<p data-start="3685.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> think there's always a risk of that if you're being honest with yourself but i do think that there's certain personality traits rates i have that maybe make it less likely uh you know i'm i'm not like really a guy who's like oh i'm gonna be a part of this club and not tell you what i think right so uh</p>
<p data-start="3699.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh i think um i</p>
<p data-start="3701.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> think that that that was that would be kind of a specific i would say in general it's not oh</p>
<p data-start="3707.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> i got a good i mean like scrums can we talk about scrums like oh here we go yeah</p>
<p data-start="3711.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh here we go yeah</p>
<p data-start="3712.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah have you</p>
<p data-start="3712.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah have you had to do anything oh</p>
<p data-start="3714.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh yeah yeah okay we'll let's talk about them yeah</p>
<p data-start="3715.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> okay we'll</p>
<p data-start="3717.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah with like two journalists i mean does it account is it scrum no</p>
<p data-start="3719.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> is it scrum no no no no no no so i have no idea i'm gonna show up before qp</p>
<p data-start="3721.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="3722.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="3723.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> before qp</p>
<p data-start="3724.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> qp</p>
<p data-start="3724.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> qp</p>
<p data-start="3725.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> qp like people are outside west block like there's i don't know there'd be a few like let's call it half a dozen to a little more less than a dozen might be there's a couple in the door they might try to grab you for a question on the way in maybe you blow past them uh caucus is where there's just a ton like they just they line up and there's like 20 plus people they're all just kind of like shouting questions at you as you walk down a hall just to get to the caucus meeting. And, you know,</p>
<p data-start="3752.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> mostly you just walk by, but every now and then I'll stop and I'll talk about it. Have</p>
<p data-start="3756.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Have you been given any guidance? When you can stop, how you can stop? Nope. This is, again,</p>
<p data-start="3758.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> stop? Nope. This is, again, this is part of the whole like, just</p>
<p data-start="3762.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> just kind of figure it out as you go. And, you know, despite what you might have heard, the Liberal Party, at least, doesn't really police those things very strongly. Interesting. If at all. I figured they would. No, no, no. But</p>
<p data-start="3767.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> strongly. Interesting. If at all.</p>
<p data-start="3773.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> like, what a way to do it like like i actually kind of usually want to stop every time but almost definitionally i'm on my way somewhere like i'm probably going at that time because that's exactly the amount of time i need in order to get the things done when i get to the other side and so i always feel like you</p>
<p data-start="3793.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> guys are like so eager for these questions like why don't you just email my office like i don't think i've turned down a media request like why are we doing it this way like why do we do it in this just like totally wild fashion that is just sort of designed to make it look like we're all pricks having to walk by you all because we got places to go. We got stuff to do, you know, like just. Are you eating a cookie? I was not eating a cookie. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="3816.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay. That's a good sign. But you know,</p>
<p data-start="3816.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's a good sign. But you know, there was like, so there was like the other day, like the last caucus meeting, I was walking by and I answered some question about Bill C-5, you know, some question about like the authorities and all that. It was in the Toronto Star. They mentioned it. But like, then I'm walking by And there's another question shouted at me about like, what do you think about Danielle Smith's government bringing in charges for COVID vaccines? And I was thinking, I really want to answer that question. I have some thoughts on that question. I don't have time. I'm already late because I stopped to talk to those people. And so it just it kind of sucks. It's like, just just call my office. Like that was a question just for me from one journalist. Just call my office. Happy to answer at a later point. Well,</p>
<p data-start="3818.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> know, there was like, so there</p>
<p data-start="3819.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> other</p>
<p data-start="3819.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> other</p>
<p data-start="3859.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> that seems like an invitation now to the media to call you, and you're going to have to keep your 100% answer ready. Well,</p>
<p data-start="3863.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you, and you're</p>
<p data-start="3866.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, I know, right? I'm not even sure it's</p>
<p data-start="3868.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm not even sure it's</p>
<p data-start="3869.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="3869.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's 100%. I try to answer,</p>
<p data-start="3870.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> answer,</p>
<p data-start="3871.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> answer, but yeah. Carter, that was my final question. As a minister, like I said, you get the final.</p>
<p data-start="3877.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, my question to you is, why</p>
<p data-start="3880.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> why did you feel like we had to put ice cream on pancakes for the pancake breakfast? Why was that such a make-or-break thing for you? I mean, we'll tell people when</p>
<p data-start="3884.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Why was that</p>
<p data-start="3889.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> thing for</p>
<p data-start="3889.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> for</p>
<p data-start="3889.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> for you? I mean, we'll tell people</p>
<p data-start="3890.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> people when this thing is too. Yeah, we</p>
<p data-start="3891.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, we probably should tell them. You know, it</p>
<p data-start="3891.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> we</p>
<p data-start="3891.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> we probably</p>
<p data-start="3891.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> probably</p>
<p data-start="3892.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> tell them. You know, it is a really good question. It is one of those things that you have to kind of make peace with that you're trading external voice for internal voice. And so, you know, there's a party line and you and the deal is now you get to raise in caucus and you get to talk to the prime minister and the ministers and you directly get to influence policy, but you're part of a team. And so at the end of the day, you hang with that team. And so it does change the dynamic a bit as you go along. That</p>
<p data-start="3900.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="3919.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> was a fascinating answer to some question. Can you</p>
<p data-start="3922.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> you time?</p>
<p data-start="3922.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3922.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> I bet he was 35. I have a quick question about the ice cream. I felt confused, gaslit, and then angry.</p>
<p data-start="3925.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I have a quick question</p>
<p data-start="3928.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> question about the ice cream. I felt confused,</p>
<p data-start="3933.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> So here's the thing. Your Stampede breakfast is on Sunday. It is at the— I think he's finding out</p>
<p data-start="3940.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> I think he's finding out for the first time. Are you telling him this?</p>
<p data-start="3942.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> this? The</p>
<p data-start="3943.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> The Commons—what was it called? Calgary Commons at the University District Park. something</p>
<p data-start="3949.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> like that and it's going to be a humdinger people should come and they can ask you questions that you'll answer with 35 second answers that'd</p>
<p data-start="3959.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> be pretty fun hey so</p>
