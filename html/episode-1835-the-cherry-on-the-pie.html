There&#x27;s a lot of questions, a lot to digest, a lot to think about, and we&#x27;re going to get into it. People have been waiting. They&#x27;ve been hungry for this episode. We&#x27;re going to break it into three different themes. We&#x27;re going to talk about the past, about what happened, talk about the present, and then talk about the future.

  </div>
  <div class="said">Guys, first segment, the past. Corey Hogan, you&#x27;ve written a sub stack. You&#x27;ve been waiting two weeks to talk about this. What happened? What went wrong for the Harris campaign? And what went right for the Trump campaign? Oh, yeah, you</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="196">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">3:16</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">wrote a thing. Okay, so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re talking about this.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="202">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">3:22</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">listen, the thing I wrote was probably more about the future than it&#x27;s about the past, because it was the lessons we might be able to take for Canadian politicals. We&#x27;ll get there. We&#x27;ll get there. Just wait. But in terms of what went wrong, you know, it&#x27;s interesting to me, because there&#x27;s a lot of knee-jerk opinions, including from myself. Like, we all see it, and it becomes a bit of a Rorschach test, right? Like whatever you didn&#x27;t like about Harris or the Democrats or the state of society becomes the reason why she lost. And I think the reality is it&#x27;s going to take a little bit of time to disaggregate and to look at it relative to other jurisdictions and understand what&#x27;s uniquely American. But I think two things are fundamentally true. And I actually think the argument about which one is true is missing the point because they can both be true. And they both stack on each other in alarming ways here. One is, it&#x27;s absolutely true that incumbents are taking a beating all the way across the democratic world. But it is also true that the Dems don&#x27;t know how to speak to people that they used to know how to speak to. And these are not, these are not unrelated. And they can both be true. Because I guess just to get us kicking off here, what I would say is, look,</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="272">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">4:32</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">yes, it is true that there are anti-incumbency vibes across the Western world, right? But it&#x27;s not as though the Democrats being in a precarious position against a historically bad candidate is something that just occurred this year. They shouldn&#x27;t have lost in 2016. 2020 should not have been close. Donald Trump is historically bad and an unprecedented threat to American norms. You know, nobody could convince me otherwise about that. And that didn&#x27;t just happen in the last 12 months here, right? But Donald Trump is is also tied into that broader story because dissatisfaction with the system is real is a real concern and by the system i don&#x27;t mean american democracy i kind of mean democracy like people are mad everywhere left or right they&#x27;re mad at their government nobody in all of democracy land seems happy and people are starting to come to some worrying conclusions right a lot less enthusiasm for for fucking democracy as a result of people just feeling like the system is not not getting them what they want. So what happened? I mean, everything, everything is happening. It&#x27;s all kind of happening. And we should all be looking at the lessons and we shouldn&#x27;t overreact to them.</div>

  <div class="said">you guys I have an accurate representation of where my time has been invested. Corey&#x27;s right in some ways. I think the most fascinating element to this sort of outcome for me is that you could have walked into this election on election night and had the scenario that played out, and it could have been blindingly obvious that this was going to be the case, that Kamala Harris was an extension of Joe Biden. And of course, this was going to be a referendum on Biden when we knew that the anti-incumbency wave was one compounding factor. But the other one was the fact that people were looking at this through the cost of living and economic question. And Kamala Harris didn&#x27;t do enough to separate herself. It was blindingly obvious that this was going to be the case. It also could have been blindingly obvious if Harris trumped it with 300 plus electoral votes that it was, of course, Donald fucking Trump on the other side. So I think Corey&#x27;s right, like we can&#x27;t overreact one way or the other. Because I think one of the things that the Democrats need to do in this particular case, as cliche as it might seem, is think about the things that I think they did right. And I really think they had an excellent six-week stretch with Harris, where they were actually nailing the freedom side of things, the vibes. Actually, I think that is a huge part of their success and why it was so close. And I would hate for them to think about throwing that sort of stuff away. Adding to that, I think there&#x27;s a lot of commentary out there by people much more, quote-unquote plugged in, but perhaps that&#x27;s actually not of benefit in their analysis. But I will circle a few things that I found interesting. Number one, perhaps there was a bit of a mirage for Team Biden in 2022 in terms of overplaying the democracy and women&#x27;s rights angle, which found itself to be a core focus in 2024. Perhaps to Corey&#x27;s point, people don&#x27;t care about democracy because it doesn&#x27;t mean a lot to them when their grocery bills are so high and the the economy isn&#x27;t necessarily performing to the way that they need to. And then the third point I&#x27;d kind of add onto the table, which I think Corey also alluded to, is the Democrats really need to do something about their, in its highest form, messaging, but I think in its more precise form, language. They have an issue with language, whether it&#x27;s linguistic simplicity or just meeting people where they&#x27;re at and how they speak. speak. And Democrats have had a long historical sort of Achilles heel around taking popular things and making them less popular with how they package them and how they speak about them. That&#x27;s actually been a longstanding thing. And in fact, it&#x27;s been one of the reasons why Democrats have shied away from popular policy positions is because they actually haven&#x27;t had the ability to necessarily communicate them in eloquent, simple terms that connect with people. And now I think there&#x27;s a really interesting postmortem sort of battle going on right now because some people in the Democratic Party are trying to give honest postmortem. Very few, I would say. And most people are trying to continue to win the tug of war because the existential crisis for the Democrats is now just not simply on linguistic messaging. It&#x27;s about which direction this party goes. Is the left to blame for the social issues? Is the left actually the only reason that they were this close with economics, the left sort of leading economics that Biden pulled ahead? And there&#x27;s a longstanding sort of debate that&#x27;s now going to find itself in real time as the Democrats try to, you know, do the live on air tug of war that is the future of their party.</div>

    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

  <div class="said">Yeah, look, I think Zane and I, I suspect would probably agree. It&#x27;s not a one of the above thing. It&#x27;s all of the above in some combination. And we&#x27;re just we&#x27;re talking about which one is probably the most prevalent. And so I think the Democrats can&#x27;t hand wave away one or the other. They&#x27;ve got to look at the whole package. Frankly, as Canadians, we shouldn&#x27;t look at one and just say that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the reason it is here. But one of the things that I&#x27;ll tell you that I don&#x27;t actually believe was a huge problem for the Democrats, with a little last risk I&#x27;ll throw on the end here, is Harris. I think Harris was pretty good. Like, I would not have picked her. I think that there should have been a primary. I think even if she had won the primary, it would have strengthened things. But people just sort of immediately decided, okay, here we are. And Zane&#x27;s right. Then the vibes were pretty good for a while. And she was, she was pretty good. She killed Donald Trump in the debate. Like, I have not seen a debate that one-sided in a long, long time. But she only had 100 days. And it was what it was. Like, you were not going to fundamentally change the frame in 100 days. And as Zane said it, right, Biden was a bit of a millstone around her neck here. And that was never going to change in 100 days. Maybe if she had 300 days, 400 days, she could have created some distance, a little bit of that Kabuki theater where she has a different position than the president, and it looks like they&#x27;re disagreeing in a way that&#x27;s not hurtful, but actually helpful. That all could have been possible, right? But I think that ultimately, one of the, so the asterisk here is, like, she did fine within that pretty limited construct. And I do think that on reflection, there were a couple of things that we should have looked at. And it actually goes to Zane&#x27;s point about messaging and language, and the Democrats struggling a little bit with those things. I actually also think there&#x27;s a delivery mechanism question. I think it&#x27;s a fundamental nuts and bolts. How do people make decisions? How do people form opinions in 2024 thing? I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll get into this a lot over the coming weeks and months, years even, but I don&#x27;t think we know how people make decisions anymore at all. And I just, I think about that debate, the debate where I believe Harris killed him.</div>

  <div class="said">Most people interpreted the debate through media, right? They got it from their friends, or they got it from the news media, or they got it from social media, whatever it was, they got it secondhand. And one of the things that I think a lot about now, especially with the benefit of hindsight here, is every single one of those stories, all of them that said that Harris won the debate or was really strong and essentially put Trump on the back foot. Like, you couldn&#x27;t find many people who thought Trump won that debate. But all of those stories talked about, and then Donald Trump only turned to the economy at the last minute, which was his strongest position, and why didn&#x27;t he spend more time on that? And I was thinking about it, like, how much water got carried for Donald Trump in some of that analysis, even the analysis that said Kamala Harris won, because it was just a given that Donald Trump was better at the economy. And why didn&#x27;t he talk about the economy more? And the critiques of Donald Trump became oblique critiques of Kamala Harris. And I</div>

  <div class="said">could make a case that she could probably tighten things up if she had a bit more time. I think there is a strategic failure on the campaigns part. I, like Corey, think she was not a perfect candidate. But man, did I think she ran an excellent 100 plus days. I mean, the fact that she came in there, won that debate, had an incredible launch, fantastic convention. intervention um you know and and i and i think this there is like a race and gender component to this where even in in this in this post-mortem phase so many people are blaming a single answer that she gave on the view where she said she had nothing that she would do different than joe biden as being the her demise i mean fuck that right like joe biden is allowed 50 fucking gaffes a week and he was still the candidate this woman isn&#x27;t allowed like one moment in which she cleaned up fucking 15 seconds later, and you&#x27;re going to use that. You&#x27;re going to simultaneously argue that mainstream media doesn&#x27;t matter anymore, and then argue that an answer that she gave in a 10 second clip on The View broke her candidacy. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. In fact, I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons the Democrats are so fucking dumb sometimes in terms of trying to process blame. They want to be the smartest people in the moment, and they want to be the smartest people people after the moment. They&#x27;re one of the most crystallized thoughts versus the most logical thoughts, which is you can&#x27;t say that there&#x27;s a right-wing media ecosystem that had already incubated a particular viewpoint for millions of Americans and nothing mattered six months before the election while simultaneously saying, fuck, she could have had it if she&#x27;d said something different on The View. Like, get fucked. Like, that&#x27;s not a real thing, like, to me. And so- Yeah, I agree with that, for sure. You know, and I think that you cannot understate the importance of the right wing media system that has been created. And I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;m not even talking about Rogan here. I think that was just a cherry, you know, on the pie for Trump, or on the proverbial sort of, you know, Sunday. I&#x27;m talking about like the deliberate right-wing media ecosystem that has been created that is a parallel, not even of the Manosphere podcast universe that has been kind of seeding these messages, taking ground away, communicating like a Howard Stern or an Opie and Anthony Wood during the daytime to your Hispanic or your black construction worker sort of dude all across the States for months. This wasn&#x27;t like the last six weeks they turned it on and they killed it. This has been happening for months. And the Democrats ignore that that particular aspect as well to their peril. I&#x27;ll add one more point here. And I know we&#x27;re kind of going a yes and sort of thing. There&#x27;s also another really fascinating element to this to me that gives me a bit of hope. And I know we&#x27;re not talking about the future. But if I&#x27;m a Democrat or a progressive, you could also and Corey, you may agree on this. I suspect you will. And I haven&#x27;t had a chance to reach your sub stack piece. But you could also, you could also overcorrect if you&#x27;re the Democrats, you could also overcorrect in terms of what this election meant to you. You&#x27;ve lost black men, you&#x27;ve lost Hispanic men, you&#x27;ve lost white women, like you could just go fucking nuts and be like, we got to rebuild everything from the ground up. And part of it, like there&#x27;s a case to be made. But at the same time, it is true in the American electorate system that coalitions aren&#x27;t passed through, right?</div>

And so in this case, when you&#x27;re looking at what Trump was able to do, don&#x27;t assume this coalition is going to be handed to the heir apparent of a J.D. Vance or whoever. And yes, I am speaking of a world in which we have future elections. But don&#x27;t suspect that this coalition is just going to be handed over and And overcorrect the lessons that you&#x27;re learning here in a certain way versus like deliberately thinking about things that apply across the board in terms of how you think and how you communicate going forward.</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah, well, my growing thesis is they don&#x27;t. Which is not to say that elections don&#x27;t matter, but I don&#x27;t think campaigns know how to reach people. And maybe Donald Trump&#x27;s does. Maybe by accident or design, it does, because there does seem to be some evidence of that. See him winning two of the three elections he&#x27;s been in being, I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s kind of floating right at 50% of the vote right now. But he&#x27;s got almost a majority of the vote, which is almost unheard of for Republicans in this day and age here. But I don&#x27;t know. Like, we also are starting to see a little bit of evidence develop that both here and in the United States that once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s on. And it&#x27;s kind of where it was at the start, wherever you want to sort of define the start. And I think I mentioned in that Substack piece I wrote there that it&#x27;s</div>

  <div class="said">think we can go into a diagnosis why the Democrats like didn&#x27;t kind of have a, there&#x27;s a lot of conversation now, whether they need their own version of it, or whether they didn&#x27;t go on these shows, because I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re naturally right wing. I genuinely do not think they&#x27;re naturally like Republican, so to speak, as some people would in saying that they&#x27;re a radicalization training ground. But but anyways, going.

You know, and that&#x27;s for a lot of reasons. And I don&#x27;t know. I mean, I think that that then to say, well, what I&#x27;m going to do is I&#x27;m going to run an ad about democracy against Donald Trump, and I&#x27;m going to show up and I&#x27;m going to have a big rally with Beyonce. And again, I&#x27;m not knocking Harris. I&#x27;m really not. Like she was dealt a hand and she played it. And I think she played it pretty well in that context. But to go back to Annalise&#x27;s question here, maybe you&#x27;re sitting there and you&#x27;re playing cards, but you don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s really about the building you&#x27;re in. Like everything was determined with the minute you walked in that door. And so that&#x27;s when I say that, I wonder if campaigns matter. That&#x27;s what I mean, right? Like I&#x27;m starting to wonder if campaigns can matter in this context. And I also worry that</div>

  <div class="said">there isn&#x27;t a real willingness or eagerness of campaign practitioners to really assess whether if anything they&#x27;re doing matters at all because there is such an incentive as we move into these big like listen man like i&#x27;d be curious your thoughts especially in the context of some of the recent campaigns you&#x27;ve done but you go into a campaign and you create an ad and you&#x27;re going to put that ad in front of focus groups and then you&#x27;re going to run that ad and you&#x27;re going going to see from your YouTube algorithms, how many seconds people are watching, and you&#x27;re going to AB test different versions, and you&#x27;re going to see which ones have higher click-through rates. And if you&#x27;re halfway as competent, halfway as competent, even if the ad didn&#x27;t do a fucking thing, you&#x27;re going to have a certain amount of data that says, actually, I&#x27;m very good at my job. And that&#x27;s even if you lose. If you win, you get to point yourself as a genius anyway. I think the ability to be truly self-reflective and say, did this fucking matter, is approaching approaching zero in politics i truly believe that and and i think that people get lucky a lot but i just do not feel that there&#x27;s this rigor and candor and one of the things that is a consequence of swimming in analytics is there&#x27;s always a metric that says you&#x27;re good and if you&#x27;re willing to self-delude yourself you will find the metric in in fact</div>

And then when you scale that out amongst a Democratic consultant class of which, you know, when you combine the PACs and you combine the history and the longevity of how long some of these folks have been working on these campaigns, one of the things I&#x27;d kind of go back to is when you go ask your question, Annalise, do campaigns still matter? matter. I have been on the other side of Corey&#x27;s sort of, no, they don&#x27;t, for a while. But I think he makes some really compelling points.

It&#x27;s very much like borrowing from Corey, which is, I think machine-run campaigns don&#x27;t matter. And what I mean by that is that one of the things we were touting, that the media was touting, was the Democratic machine. In fact, fuck, like, GOTV, they&#x27;ve got a machine in Pennsylvania.

I&#x27;m not trying to say do it like Trump and be fucking nuts and dominate the media all the time and who cares what else happens.

And that&#x27;s just a little disingenuous. And the multiplier effects are getting to the point where it&#x27;s really absurd. And you can go to a client though, and you can say, hey, I got you $130,000 I&#x27;ve earned media did you did you fucking really or is that just what they said because they know every year that number&#x27;s got to be a little bit bigger and so that&#x27;s a bit of a challenge and i think people need to take a jaundiced eye to some of these metrics that are designed to make communications teams look good and i say that as somebody who has spent his professional life running</div>

That&#x27;s when Harris ran on the vibes, the walls pick, freedom, I thought was a really interesting message and crystallization. And then the Democrats did what the Democrats do, the machine took over, and they had to appeal to all their constituency groups. And an election that was supposed to kind of be run on a feeling of joy and putting stuff together went back to being a 2022 rehash in some way of women&#x27;s rights, and it became a policy election. And they kind of found themselves, perhaps to their own—perhaps an own goal in their own right, having a policy election when they were setting themselves up with a candidate who wanted to really not have that type of election, at least</div>

I think that is an action that this is the time that they should do that, right? Including some of your most cherished tactics, like door knocking. In fact, I think door knocking needs its own – like, logically, taking our campaign hats off, interrupting someone at home when people do not want to talk to you and asking them about a topic that they don&#x27;t want to talk to you about sounds like an insane thing to do. Like, it just sounds like an insane thing to do, but it is cherished amongst all stripes and all types of practitioners in politics. Like stress testing that as a core tactic, for example, just like you would test the radio spot, the TV spot, the 15 seconds, the sixes, the 30s, all these things I think is a really helpful and interesting thing to do. The second thing that I can&#x27;t overstate enough, though, is that Trump&#x27;s</div>

And in an era where politics is part of culture, where people know it, to Corey&#x27;s point, like they know pop culture, or like they talk about movies or films or all these things, politics has infused itself over the last decade as being as such. the democratic campaign was not infused in culture all those stars came on as like add-on endorses they weren&#x27;t necessarily part of a cultural conversation unlike where i think trump was in many ways and think that&#x27;s something they need to think about where i think that one of the big failures was they just didn&#x27;t meet the people in in a cultural way the the harris campaign i think they tried to shoehorn and i think they knew it was a delta like they needed to close the gap there i just don&#x27;t think they did it successfully guys</div>

  <div class="said">Do it now. Do it. Do it a little bit later and then keep doing it. I mean, so do it now in the sense when it&#x27;s fresh and you&#x27;ve got these reactive thoughts, do it a bit later when those reactive thoughts are less reactive and you&#x27;re able to have a clear eyed perspective on what is real and what wasn&#x27;t. and what was kind of emotional frustration. And then when you do it continuously, I think that&#x27;s where you run the experiments. I think the big, I&#x27;ll say it again, the big mistake that the Democrats can make is that thinking that their entire campaign was shit. And I think that the overcorrection that they can make is thinking that that coalitions are lost forever or for a generation. Will they have shitty Senate rounds in 26, 28, and 30? Yeah, they will. Like it&#x27;s going to be bad for them just because of the red states available and what they have in terms of availability to flip the board in terms of the Senate. But that does not necessarily mean that those coalitions that Trump will transfer over to whoever will be as such. So, you know, go in with a set of assumptions that are more robust than just thinking through what we could have done this time, because that&#x27;s not necessarily helpful to you. It&#x27;s more about what we can do going forward. And then I&#x27;ll add a Corey Hoganism to the table, which I suspect he would have anyway.

Think about like things from its broadest perspective in terms of longevity. But also, you&#x27;re not trying to recreate the 2024 campaign Bible that would would have allowed Kamala Harris 130 days out to win an election.

I don&#x27;t know that they want to do it now, depending on what it means. I do think right after something like this, you need to capture your reactive thoughts. you need to gather information before that information gets lost but you know do it like make those changes a bit later outside of the heat of the moment like it&#x27;s so human to go through something and to overreact and to overcorrect and to overswing and to Zane&#x27;s point there was a lot good that they want to make sure that they&#x27;re not throwing out too and so that&#x27;s really where you&#x27;ve got to think about things in terms of incrementalism you&#x27;ve got to do these things gradually and slowly and look at the evidence, honestly look at the evidence and see if they are making an effect. And the great thing about the American system is it does allow you to test things in 50 states and across 435 congressional districts. You don&#x27;t need to go all in in a way that&#x27;s going to potentially break your coalition. As much as people are saying, oh my God, the Democrats got the lowest percent of black men&#x27;s votes that they have in, I don&#x27;t know how long but it&#x27;s still like generation 78 80 like based like for fuck&#x27;s sake like that&#x27;s that&#x27;s an absolute overwhelming route uh with a demographic and you don&#x27;t want to start saying well i guess we&#x27;ve got to change our democratic or demographic focus that&#x27;s crazy right</div>

I think there&#x27;s a lot of anxiety. There&#x27;s a lot of angst. And frankly, there&#x27;s a lot of bile and hatred for one&#x27;s own party.

It may not be constructive or useful, but that catharsis, I think, is actually super strategic. In order to allow a rebuild, I think people don&#x27;t want to wait months in order to give someone a piece of their ear. And I think any good organization recognizes that there&#x27;s feedback that&#x27;s useful and strategic and constructive and feedback that just needs to be given so that the other person feels heard. And I think there&#x27;s a lot of folks right now in the democratic sort of universe, whether they consider themselves part of that aforementioned machine or or not, but are supportive of the outcomes of the Democratic Party&#x27;s principles that feel like shit right now. They either have a, I told you so, we should have done this, I&#x27;ve got thoughts. And to me, that is actually a mark of engagement, continued engagement. To me, the fact that they still, like they&#x27;re angry shows to me that they&#x27;re engaged. And if I&#x27;m the Democrats and I&#x27;m smart about it, I actually want to get that energy, and I want to harness that energy, and I want to use as part of what the rebuild looks like. I think political parties that fail to do that, to capture that energy and let these people internally kind of boil, will ultimately lose those people. And these people are ultimately assets that they need down the line. So that&#x27;s one argument I can make for what they should do at this junction, even without proper DNC leadership, so to speak.</div>

Like, you&#x27;re not going to do anything constructive or productive, but if you&#x27;re at least part of the collection of this bile or maybe this not necessarily useful feedback that&#x27;s going to create the next future, but it&#x27;s part of someone&#x27;s catharsis, I think that&#x27;s an incredibly important opportunity.</div>

  <div class="said">little of both i think one of the interesting things about it is in some ways it um it for me it almost gets to what do you need to do next and so you&#x27;ve got to be a little bit cautious on that front like one of the you know the american system we&#x27;re talking about is you know a couple of times and so like yeah and they can do all these crazy things but there is a version of it their parties are quite different right um even in canada after a loss like this you will see a certain growth in and factionalism, you&#x27;ll see people say, well, they only lost because they weren&#x27;t left wing enough. Or let&#x27;s use the NDP as an example. They weren&#x27;t committed enough to the environment. They weren&#x27;t committed enough to labor. They weren&#x27;t committed enough to being moderates, right? You know, that kind of that centrist version of a new Democrat, right? And there&#x27;ll be some arguments about it. And people will start to self-collect and self-organize and say, well, we&#x27;re going to change things. We&#x27;re going to get a leader who believes in X. We&#x27;re going to get policies that It&#x27;s do why. We&#x27;re going to organize ourselves at the ground level around Zed. And so that happens here, and that really happens in the United States, right? Because we&#x27;ve said it before, and I&#x27;ll say it again, like in</div>

Maybe they were too consumed with the, you know, that classic broker politics of the Democrats where they do thing for group A and thing for group B and thing for group C, and group D&#x27;s mad because they did things for groups A, B, and C, right? Like, if you think that&#x27;s part of the problem, then you probably don&#x27;t want to allow people to drift to and become more deeply involved in the quote unquote factions. You know, so you&#x27;re going going to want to get on that pretty quickly here but if you think that what the democrats need is strong independent voices then you know fucking just let it happen it&#x27;ll happen right but that&#x27;s you know i don&#x27;t necessarily believe that&#x27;s what the democratic party needs but um but certainly there are people who do although</div>

Like, even beyond the cabinet picks, because, yeah, like, while you have an insane pick a minute coming from Trump, we know that&#x27;s just the start of it in terms of the outright insanity. And the Democrats have actually boxed themselves in in a really interesting way, because they have said that electing Donald Trump is electing a fascist, right? Like, on its face. Like, they&#x27;ve taken John Kelly&#x27;s words and they&#x27;ve put it back. That is what this guy is. And so he&#x27;s brought fascism to America. And</div>

They have to figure out what their tone is going forward and how they want to deal with this, because they have told the country that doing X, in our eyes, voting for Trump is going to usher in this new era. And how do you then deal with that when you have to oppose it? How do you deal with that when you have to oppose it? And I think they&#x27;ve kind of boxed themselves in, in the sense that I think they&#x27;re going to have to go hard in the paint, Corey, even if they don&#x27;t want to.

Political parties are supposed to stand for something. But again, you go to that American, people choose their parties rather than the parties choosing the people. I don&#x27;t know, like, if you actually don&#x27;t care about anything but winning, fucking go for it, like create this free market of political ideas, and just see whichever one is the most successful.

It&#x27;s a lot of people who&#x27;ve run campaigns before, who&#x27;ve had White House jobs before, who are the other side of K Street now, who are running lobby shops, who are running ad firms, who are doing all these things. I mean, it&#x27;s not like, you know, in the democratic world, it is not frowned upon to have played both sides. And in fact, that is who fuels the entire operation, largely, till this day, these ad firms, etc. etc. So there&#x27;s this really fascinating tension of folks that will not let this thing go by the way of AOC or Bernie or others who want to say that this is what we need to do. They might agree on economic left policy or populist economics as a future cause, but they&#x27;re not going to hand over the keys to be like, and there you are, said Godfather, the machine is now yours.

There&#x27;s a lot of commentary about how he might try to get some very non-desirable cabinet picks into cabinet positions. We should circle back to that point in a second. But it&#x27;s not uncommon for when you&#x27;re an elected president, a newly elected president-elect. Actually, one of the interesting interesting things, by the way, is all of his letterhead doesn&#x27;t say president-elect, it says President Donald Trump.

Which which apparently now we&#x27;re not supposed to see, but I would wager we will.

  <div class="said">Well, look, I think that, so this is, when you look at Donald Trump when he was elected in 2016, I would describe his first moves as tentative, right? And some of the reporting was tentative. And some of the things he was deciding to do or not do were reported in a way that suggested there was a nervousness by Trump coming in. Like, what was he allowed to do? What was he able to get away with? What could he manage to pull off? And what was he thinking that might be a bridge too far for Americans? And so I&#x27;m going to go a little bit more slowly here. And that goes everything from like security reviews to some of the appointments that he did to, you know, to some of the policies that he presented here. There is no tentativeness anymore. And there is a unique danger and</div>

He knows things about government. He knows the levers that matter. He knows the things he can get away with after testing these norms for eight years. He fucking knows. And so the thing that I&#x27;m going to be watching him for is what he&#x27;s just willing to do. And obviously he&#x27;s said what he&#x27;s going to do in a lot of cases. His actions show he is clearly following through on this notion of loyalty above above anything else. But that loyalty is also, like, they&#x27;re going to execute these things. And when he starts putting his own personal attorneys into the Justice Department at lower, you know, like those undersecretary positions and around that, that&#x27;s like, do you really think if you end up in a situation where he orders the Attorney General to do something and they, A, they&#x27;re never going to say no, because they&#x27;re Matt Gaetz. But B, if they did, there are four other people that he can appoint to take their position and have it done. Like, Like, you&#x27;ve got to watch for these things.

Now, it&#x27;s all going to be in the execution for Trump. But I think Corey&#x27;s absolutely right here. And let&#x27;s be clear, you know, this is a nightmare scenario in some ways. if you&#x27;re a Democrat, rather than having Trump do eight straight years, back-to-back terms, he has this break in between where all the people who hate him leave, say they&#x27;re against him, he gets to retool, rebuild, come at it again while learning things, right? Versus if he had just taken another four after winning his first four, you would just kind of like, the machine&#x27;s too big in some ways, you just have to carry it forward. In this case, he gets four years to retool rethink and just get a brand new system um in place and and expedite it to his will and have a loyalty test where people came out of the woodwork to say yeah boss not with you great thank you step aside i&#x27;ll find someone who is yeah</div>

I don&#x27;t think anyone who is hoping that this would be a, oh, my God, we&#x27;re so lucky to have Justin Trudeau and the liberals in Canada moment and say, you know, we got to do everything we can to protect progressivism. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s going to happen. I think the fact is, in fact, that the fact that Trump&#x27;s coalition was much more diverse than perhaps we assumed it would be heading into this election gives a lot more people license here to vote conservative. I&#x27;m not comparing Pierre Polyev to Donald Trump. That&#x27;s not what I am saying. However, it does give folks that license. There&#x27;s just a natural kinship that you already see with the rhetoric, the linguistic language between the conservatives and Donald Trump and the Republicans. And then I think there&#x27;s just some interesting X factors. One that I think is going to be talked about a lot more is how a sitting member of parliament in Jamil Javani is best friends, BFFs with J.D. Vance, like quite literally groomsmen at wedding level BFFs with the vice president and arguably the standard bearer of MAGA going forward. So I think that, you know, advantage conservatives is what I&#x27;d say.</div>

  <div class="said">look i i think that the individual event is probably advantageous to the liberals but it doesn&#x27;t matter like it doesn&#x27;t fundamentally change the fact that the liberals are 20 points down i don&#x27;t know it gets them even a point democracy international relations norms rhetoric yeah maybe the liberals will pick up a little bit on that but none of those things i just talked about are what&#x27;s driving the decision in voters minds right now as they&#x27;re moving forward and so So actually, I might talk myself into saying advantage to conservative, but for different reasons, if the liberals think that this is an advantage and start to put their eggs in this basket and chase this election strategy, it will get worse for them, not better. And if the signal they&#x27;re getting is, okay, Donald Trump&#x27;s there, we&#x27;ve dealt with Donald Trump before, we&#x27;re seeing a little bit that Canadians trust us a little more to stand up to Donald Trump, which I&#x27;ve seen some preliminary kind of numbers suggesting that might be the case. and they start chasing that, I mean, it&#x27;s not going to be the thing that drives it, right? They will run into the exact same trap that the Democrats found themselves in, in my opinion, which is they talked so much about the threats to democracy.</div>

They don&#x27;t care. I want them to care, but they don&#x27;t care. And if the liberals, sorry, decide that they&#x27;re going to start making that the thing that they are fighting on, they&#x27;re going to lose.

  <div class="said">Maybe that campaigns are actually about building and arming your base, and that trying to get folks excited about you is the focus, and that you need to start communicating in a way that isn&#x27;t alienating to them first. It actually, in fact, the opposite, it excites them. And then the second round is about persuasion. We know that there&#x27;s research out there. And I think this is what I&#x27;m almost taking the lessons from the Democrats here, rather than being like, here&#x27;s what Trump taught us. No, I think the Democrats have all roll on to something, that where they had their moment of zen, their exciting six weeks of joy, that they were doing something there, that there was something happening there. And I think, you know, whether they strategically or accidentally gave that up up is perhaps beside the point in terms of what I think a campaign needs to look like, because I think they&#x27;re hitting on some really important things here that progressives should talk about, which is being part of the culture, the feelings of joy, being part of something bigger than yourself. I&#x27;d say Trump ultimately won that question. There was a lot of people from the manosphere and other places that Trump thought was selling a movement, not the Democrats, despite the fact that we saw the Democrats for six weeks looking like they sold a movement. So Democrats shouldn&#x27;t forget that lesson, right? Like, I don&#x27;t want to throw that away, because I think there were some good building blocks there of what they experimented with. And frankly, I&#x27;d say one thing that was fascinating about that period of time was, I don&#x27;t know how much of that was programmed. I don&#x27;t know how much of that was built</div>

  <div class="said">by the machine in a six-week stretch. And I think there&#x27;s something to be said about that. And I&#x27;m not trying to like be too cute with my earlier point on the democratic machine, but when they built that stretch, it seemed authentic and organic and like of something natural. And maybe it&#x27;s because it was. And maybe it&#x27;s because it was rather than it was something engineered as the standard issue campaign that we would expect. And so there&#x27;s something for progressives to think about around how you, you know, and of course, the standard progressive brain would overanalyze that and figure out how you try to make an organic moment and engineer it. But there was something to be said about yes, ending and saying, yeah, we&#x27;re going to lean into this moment. We&#x27;re going to like, you know, we&#x27;re going to lean into Bratz summer, we&#x27;re going to talk about the, you know, the Kamala pilling of situation. Most of that was not engineered, and you could tell. And there was a six-week spark there where I would do a case study on what the fuck happened there because I want to bottle that up and figure out what we do going forward and without necessarily being too overly analytical about it in certain ways. So maybe that&#x27;s a start. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s even a good point to make, but I&#x27;ll throw it out there. I think there&#x27;s something there.</div>

And there was, you know, this whole, like, we are so back energy that they brought to everything was fun. Like, it was always going to be difficult to stretch that all the way to the election. And I think they really struggled. And I think that they got on their own heads about it. And I don&#x27;t know it would have been enough to win the election, knowing what we know now. But it&#x27;s an interesting thing that they should explore and they should be looking at more. And not to try to shoehorn in my big thing here, but I do think part of it was there was a real sense of like theater and story. Like, holy shit, like you had Biden and Biden did this debate and then Biden had to go and then Harris had to step in out of nowhere. And all of a sudden, Harris is everywhere and Harris is picking walls to be her vice presidential pick. And the internet is on fire about all of these things.

And I do think that there is something to that. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the only lesson for progressives there. I think the bigger one is they need to just sit and have some real honest conversations with themselves as to whether they know how to change minds or how minds get changed.

  <div class="said">You know, versus being like the polling tells us this is how we keep all these 19 fucking coalitions stitched together. And frankly, I think this election result shows in some ways that you can try coalition management, you could spend hundreds of millions of dollars on coalition management, telling certain types of voters what you think they want to hear, but they&#x27;ll still go after the big, sort of broad, broader message in some ways. And I&#x27;m not saying Trump did that perfectly, but he was the version of that. And there is a lesson to be learned here that&#x27;s saying, and maybe this goes back to why, Corey, you think campaigns no no longer are effective, because we&#x27;re running campaigns as managers. We&#x27;re not running campaigns as ambitious creatives trying to actually move the needle and sell people a brand new suite of things that could be part of a revision mandate. We&#x27;re trying to sell them just what we think they want to hear. And there&#x27;s something to be said there. Some people have called it the super majority style thinking, being like, I want to just blow the doors off this thing. And who cares? There&#x27;s coalition management is second, right? Like, you know, and this is what we need. And I think if I&#x27;m a progressive strategist, manager, activist, whatever, maybe I&#x27;m like, look, here&#x27;s our proof point that the stitching together coalitions piece by piece, poll by poll, and managing in certain way does not get us the outcome and does not even get us the mandate that we want at the end of the day.</div>

And these big social media companies, which are the subject of much of our ire, and you know, these bootstrapped media companies, which is also subject of our ire, they&#x27;re not here a lot of the time, right? They&#x27;re American ones, and that American argument is now propagating across the border.</div>

It&#x27;s going to require education. We&#x27;re going to need to train people to be better at identifying these things. We&#x27;re going to have to reward people who are critical of their own views and testing whether those views are accurate or not. And that&#x27;s all going to take time, much more than one election cycle, two election cycles, three election cycles. So yeah, let&#x27;s deal with that problem.

That fucking doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Like, this is all coming across the border. It always does. All of a sudden, everybody is referring to EDI initiatives, equity, diversity, inclusion, as DEI initiatives, because that&#x27;s what the Americans call them. And it comes across the border, sure as anything. So, you know, it feels like such a force of nature. Like, I just, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s avoidable. But I do think that we can be thinking about mitigations, we can be thinking about how we nudge, adjust things and start making some course corrections</div>
