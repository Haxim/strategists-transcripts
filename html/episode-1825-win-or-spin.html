And Corey, you would agree that starting is the best way way to get started don&#x27;t you not to do it but to do it oh i i agree completely stephen carter here&#x27;s where we&#x27;re going to start jagmeet singh is using the recent by-election results in winnipeg where he held on him and his party held on to the um with transcona riding and a strong third place showing in montreal to position the ndp as the signature alternative to the conservatives buying himself more time to separate himself from the liberals carter here&#x27;s the statement statement.</div>

They pulled it off. and uh you know so i was a little bit i i think that you know overall that was a very strong showing for uh for for jagmeet singh now keep in mind my expectations are extremely low but nonetheless i think that he did what he needed to do came in and and won uh won a seat and uh coming in a strong third i mean there was a what about 400 votes between the top three three uh top three candidates i was hoping you guys would would spin me on some uh some vote split but you go go for it</div>

Expectations were low, and he exceeded them. Congratulations, Jagmeet Singh. You won in a by-election by less than you won in the general.</div>

    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

  <div class="said">Montreal. So you can talk about being 400 votes separated, and that&#x27;s true. And there was the possibility he could have won, but he would have won – we&#x27;re talking about Sauvé there. Not to be confused with Sauvé who won, but the Sauvé who lost. The Sauvé who lost, yeah. That&#x27;s right.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">4:57</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">would have been with 27 of the vote like this this is not the this is not the jack layton train of coming around the bend here this is not a recreation of 2011 and why this is so dangerous is if he actually believes that he is now the strong alternative to the liberals and don&#x27;t get me wrong in the next election he could end up with more seats than the liberals not really because of any great showing by the ndp but because of kind of a poor showing by by the liberals. But if he believes that and he gets cocky and he starts saying, well, maybe I&#x27;ll go to an election this fall, and it makes that more likely in confidence votes to come,</div>

    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">5:30</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">well, that&#x27;s dangerous. You want to spin other people. You don&#x27;t want to spin yourself. And my feeling is that he might have spinned himself here</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:39</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Carter, the story is Jagmeet Singh on by-election night. The question on the spin or win statement was, did he have a good night? Let me ask you you this question. And it&#x27;s similar to what Corey&#x27;s just alluded to. Not only did he have a good night, he&#x27;s now positioned as the alternative to pure Polyev&#x27;s conservatives. And it&#x27;s a winning strategy he&#x27;s demonstrated to unite the left for those who are disillusioned with the liberals. Oh</div>

  <div class="said">win? That&#x27;s pure spin. You held on to the seat. You didn&#x27;t lose a seat. Congratulations. That&#x27;s not not turning the world upside down on its head. The liberals beat you in Montreal. I mean, it&#x27;s just, it&#x27;s not even close to true. Not that spin needs to be even close to true, but that&#x27;s just beyond, that can&#x27;t even be spun. That is so far outside the expectation that that can&#x27;t even be spun.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">Corey, talk to me a bit more about this. What are the dangers of Jagmeet Singh beyond accidentally getting cocky and triggering or an election, but what are the dangers of him positioning himself as the alternative? We&#x27;ve talked about the pros. The liberals are down on their luck, all those sort of things in the past. Talk to me about the strategic pitfalls of positioning yourself, perhaps in the crosshairs, as the viable progressive alternative. Well, I</div>

  </div>

The risk always with you spinning yourself as you make bad decisions, whether that&#x27;s you spin yourself that your opponents are hated the way you hate your opponents, or you spin yourself the way that you think you&#x27;ve got a chance and you allocate resources and writings where you don&#x27;t have a chance. Those are dangerous things for political parties to do. They can&#x27;t buy their own bullshit. They need to be clear eyed behind the scenes and they need to be able to say, that ain&#x27;t going to work. That is going to work.

The concerns in particular here, if you want to go beyond the risk that he tempts himself into a general election because he thinks he&#x27;s in such a strong position that he can take all of the liberals&#x27; lunch, right? The risk beyond that is that that delusion leads him to make tactical errors in terms of how he positions himself to the Canadian electorate if that is what he believes And if he thinks, okay, well, I can reasonably position myself as the left wing alternative. Let me just throw a lazy example to you here. If you say you are, if your assumption is I can be that person and that&#x27;s what Canadians are looking for, and that&#x27;s not what Canadians are looking for, or they don&#x27;t believe that that&#x27;s you, then you&#x27;ve run into a lot of trouble.

  <div class="said">Well, there&#x27;s two things. I think that Corey&#x27;s really articulated the risks of lying to ourselves. The lies that we tell ourselves are probably the most toxic. But the second is, you know, you got to spin something that&#x27;s believable to the Canadian public. As soon as they reject your spin on one thing, they&#x27;re going to start rejecting your spin across the board. That&#x27;s where Pierre Polyev has actually been very successful. He&#x27;s been able to keep his spin into the realm of possibility and probability. ability. The spin coming out of Singh, I mean, he&#x27;s still polling in third place. He doesn&#x27;t have a national army that can really win seats across the nation. I mean, how many seats can he win in Alberta? Well, probably the same number as the liberals. But nonetheless, it&#x27;s not a real army that&#x27;s going to launch him into being the official opposition. When we&#x27;ve seen the NDP being the the official opposition is because of a complete collapse of liberals, not because of strength from the NDP.</div>

Where things will go off the rails is if the school being built in your neighborhood, actually a school that is a private school, right? That&#x27;s where things will go off the rails. But as it currently stands, building more schools is a winner. It was a winner in 2012. It was a winner in 2015. It&#x27;s a winner in 2024. So build all the schools you want to build.

  <div class="said">It&#x27;s tough to call it a win because there&#x27;s no money to put teachers in the schools, but I have to call it a win. I do agree with Stephen&#x27;s analysis there. Generally speaking, this is a pure vibe test, but just people I&#x27;ve talked to in the past 24 hours, people who are varying degrees of politically attuned, they&#x27;re generally saying, yeah, it sounds okay. And in fact, I was having one conversation with somebody where he was like, oh yeah, that&#x27;s a lot of money for schools. That&#x27;s really good. And I said, yeah, well, that&#x27;s a lot of money for nonprofit schools. We never used to do that. And they said, oh, it&#x27;s not that much. Most of the schools will be public. And there was a general comfort with the ratio that was presented. And it&#x27;s pretty difficult to make the more nuanced argument like, no, these other schools shouldn&#x27;t get the money. They shouldn&#x27;t. It should be for the public system, maybe not even the charter system. But there are a lot of people saying, well, the ratio seems sensible. So it feels like it&#x27;s at least a short-term win. I do wonder when the rubber hits the road, if it&#x27;s not just a question of, is this school a private school in my neighborhood? I actually don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s the biggest risk. I the private schools will be generally put in places where there&#x27;s pre-existing communities. You know, they&#x27;re going to be magnets for larger areas because they&#x27;re often built around a concept or a religion or a culture, right? And so they tend to have larger catchments. I think the bigger, and so you have the public and the charter schools out in the new build areas. I think the bigger challenge though is it&#x27;s not clear how those prioritizations are going to occur. There&#x27;s going to be a lot of people fighting at the table for their various pieces of funding and prioritization, but then there&#x27;s not teachers. And that&#x27;s the bigger problem. Like when you look at the operational dollars that are in education right now, lots of ways to look at them, but the simplest, plainest way to look at them is that we spend the least per student in this area of any province. and you can only claim look how good we are look at this alberta efficiency for so long before it just starts to look fucking unreasonable and and nonsensical and why is my child&#x27;s class 28 kids why is my other child&#x27;s class 29 kids these are kids in the fifth grade in the third grade in this case you know this these are big class sizes and it&#x27;s not going to solve a lot of parents problems and that&#x27;s going to be kind of clear in three years i think that&#x27;s the problem they have the timeline doesn&#x27;t necessarily line itself up.

You know, it can&#x27;t be too little too late, uh, cause it is a massive investment. Um, but it is too late and it happened on her watch and, uh, and it&#x27;s going to be watered down by having fewer, uh, public schools and more, more private schools.

He has fallen into a false dichotomy. He&#x27;s actually playing the Premier&#x27;s game here. He is saying the Premier is wrong. And instead of that, he should be saying, here&#x27;s what would be right. Right. Why didn&#x27;t he go out, for example, and say, yeah, build $4 billion of schools and take the other $4 billion and fund $400 million a year in teachers for 10 years? That&#x27;s what this system needs. I think there are ways that you can avoid the frame that the premier has created and also deliver the exact same message. Schools are great. We need schools. We need people to work in those schools too. And the balance is entirely wrong here. So let&#x27;s not spend that money on private education. We&#x27;ve never had to in the past and it&#x27;s still going to be there. Let&#x27;s not put the money into charters. Let&#x27;s put the money into teachers and let&#x27;s be realistic. We&#x27;re not going to build a billion of schools. That would be inflationary. We&#x27;d be bidding against ourselves over the next few years.

And I ask this because there&#x27;s a lot of, Corey, speaking of WhatsApp, there&#x27;s a lot of WhatsApp chatter in my hood about what this could mean for private Muslim schools that many of which, to be very crass and frank about it, do not adhere to some of the sort of normative social values that we&#x27;ve been talking about, very like against the LGBTQ agenda, as they call it, especially with the broader conversation on trans rights taking hold in the mainstream. Talk to me about your concerns there from a policy perspective, but also from like a political strategy perspective and what risks might lie in that regard. Carter, you&#x27;re chuckling.</div>

I think that there will be something vaguely resembling a green line, but the city of Calgary isn&#x27;t the one who&#x27;s going to be footing the bill for it. It may use a lot of the same infrastructure. It may not be a total $2 billion or whatever the numbers are that have sunk costs, but it&#x27;s not going to be the city of Calgary&#x27;s project. It&#x27;s going to be the province of Alberta&#x27;s project. And that may not matter in the overall scheme of things, but it does matter in terms of how the city of Calgary is viewing it. This isn&#x27;t the city&#x27;s project anymore. And for them to move forward would have been foolhardy because they don&#x27;t have the money to backstop any of the commitments that needed to be made, nor can they tell the federal government that they are in a strong position. So, there was no other choice but to say, we&#x27;re done and hand this over to the province. And I don&#x27;t disagree with Corey. I think that this probably means something weird is going to happen with the province. But I just don&#x27;t know what that something weird is.</div>

And next year there&#x27;s a municipal election in Calgary and council could change. They could have a different mayor. That mayor could be more willing to make a deal or have a different rhetorical bend in terms of their engagement with the province. And new mayors like to win if there&#x27;s a new mayor. And in that situation, there might be a way that they can declare victory based on a deal that was previously dismissed by the city. Happens all the time. And I do believe there&#x27;s just a lot of impetus. All of the parties have reason to want to get something out of this at the end of it. The city needs this infrastructure. The province doesn&#x27;t want to go into a provincial election looking like they killed the Green Line and wasted billions of dollars. So there&#x27;s space for a deal there. I think that&#x27;s possible. I do ultimately believe that the hit that the province seemed to want on the project has been delivered. Now I had Nenshi, just another tax and spend liberal.

As any particular councillor, do you see a strategic value on staking your reputation on the future of the Green Line, continue to campaign for it, talking about its need or necessity? necessity? Or do you feel like in this limbo, you&#x27;re actually opening yourself up to a lot of risk, right? There&#x27;s two ways to potentially look at it. A lot of people are abandoning the project, so there&#x27;s space for you to lean into it as a defender of public services, infrastructure, this particular line. Then there&#x27;s also the uncertainty. You don&#x27;t know what happens next, and it could actually end up being a very different project with an uncertain timeline. How would you advise folks to deal with this in-between project that was the hallmark of many people&#x27;s political careers, if not political advocacy?</div>

The province of Alberta wants us to build ring roads. We&#x27;ve already done that. now we need to build the actual infrastructure that goes where people are not where roads want you know not where uh it&#x27;s easy to build um so just because it&#x27;s easy to build somewhere doesn&#x27;t mean we have to build it there and i would i would advise any councillor that wants to get re-elected uh to start fighting for that um but</div>

What advice strategically would you have to third parties that have been unabashed advocates for this thing, for its building, for its construction, for its future prosperity and access that it would have? Do you take a pause? Do you regroup? Do you keep going? How do you retool when something is in such limbo? Is this white space opportunity? Is this you go dark if it goes dark?

No, it&#x27;s not fucking better than before. It&#x27;s worse. You lost more votes in this by-election than you lost in the previous by-election. Things are getting worse. You can try to tell yourself second place is great. You can try to tell yourself that there are different results at play. It got fucking worse. It got worse there. You had a bad night on the prairies too. Elmwood was not your friend either. It&#x27;s getting worse. Things are bad. You&#x27;re going to lose the election. At this point, the only thing Justin Trudeau has going for him, ironically, is the confidence supply agreement fell apart.
