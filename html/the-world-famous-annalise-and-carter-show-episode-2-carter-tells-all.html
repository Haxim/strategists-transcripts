<div class="turn">right throughout the episode uh</div>
<div class="turn">yeah they're not gonna listen i okay before Before we get into it, and there's a lot I want to get into because I know we're often not allowed to talk about municipal politics on</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(3:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">on this episode. I know, because they don't understand how important municipal politics is. Why</div>
<div class="turn">Why? Because it's literally the water going uphill and the poop going downhill. It's the roads that we drive on. It's everything that we use on an everyday basis. Without municipal government, our lives would grind to a halt. and i would argue that without the federal government uh nothing would change nothing would change so that's</div>
<div class="turn">yeah that's that's for you buddy nothing would change and</div>
<div class="turn">and obviously zane has nothing has ever changed from what zane does yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(4:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">but snow clearing and potholes and the house going up aside you selling both of us are experiencing right now like yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(4:32)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah i'm actually watching it's supposed to be coming down in the next day or two video</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(4:36)</span></div>
<div class="turn">video it so i can and show my child he is the my three-year-old is obsessed with demolition videos as long as you assure him that our house is not getting demolished um</div>
<div class="turn">yeah but i'm gonna</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(4:47)</span></div>
<div class="turn">gonna do your house is next just end</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(4:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">end it with that don't he will have nightmares um but yeah municipal municipal no seriously there's so much development where i live that it's like every third day on the walk to daycare we see something being torn down and he's really worried that our house is next so So we've had to explain the</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(5:06)</span></div>
<div class="turn">criteria of when a house gets knocked down.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(5:08)</span></div>
<div class="turn">But municipal is exciting, and it's different this year with the party system. So we're going to get into it. We're going to talk about Calgary, talk a bit about Edmonton. Before we do, Stephen Carter, can</div>
<div class="turn">who you are helping? Who I</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(5:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I am helping? Yeah,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(5:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah, because, yeah, I have questions. I've got some tough ones. But I think we got to disclose at the beginning our interests, our conflicts.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(5:35)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I'm working with Better Edmonton in Edmonton, Tim Cartmell, and 12 candidates up there running for council. Full slate, full party. I'm working with the Calgary Party in Calgary with Brian Thiessen and a current slate of 11 people, although it looks like I might be able to go up to 14 in the next two weeks.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(5:55)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Okay. So those are your interests out there. Those</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(5:59)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Those are my conflicts of interest. Yeah. I don't have any.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(6:03)</span></div>
<div class="turn">any. I have some friends who are running who I advise, but I am currently not being paged by any campaigns. I did used to cover City Hall as a journalist, so I get it. I know City Hall.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(6:14)</span></div>
<div class="turn">You're kind of a big deal. I know know how important it is.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(6:17)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I'm not a big deal, but I'm very plugged in municipally.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(6:21)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yes, you are. You're one of my go-to people to find out the latest rumors,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(6:24)</span></div>
<div class="turn">rumors, the latest scandal. I have friends in high places.</div>
<div class="turn">Okay, so first segment, party, party, party. Let's talk about the parties, Stephen</div>
<div class="turn">Stephen Carter. So for those who are still listening, who are interested in municipal politics, a part of why I wanted to talk municipal is that it's different this year in Calgary and Edmonton specifically. So last year, Daniel Smith's UCP government tabled legislation that introduces political parties to our municipal elections only</div>
<div class="turn">only in Alberta's two big municipalities in Calgary and Edmonton.</div>
<div class="turn">I guess it's worth noting that a government survey kind of at the time that Post Media Access by FOIP showed</div>
<div class="turn">showed more than 70% of respondents opposed to adding political parties. And there's been other polling that shows the same thing. Alberta municipalities have done polling that shows similar. So in Calgary, we have the Calgary Party, which Stephen Carter can tell us more about. But is it fair, Carter, to call the Calgary Party center, center-left? What are we calling it?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(7:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I think we're going really center. I think that we're going for a really pragmatic party that approaches</div>
<div class="turn">approaches problems from the left and the right.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(7:33)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Oh, center, of course. We'll get into why you're branding it that way. But so we have the Calgary Party center, communities first, First, which I think it's fair to say is a conservative party that several incumbent conservative leading councillors are running with. Also, a better Calgary party. I don't know if you know more than I do. I don't think they have any candidates yet.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(7:53)</span></div>
<div class="turn">They do. They have six or seven candidates. Do</div>
<div class="turn">Mostly in the south. You know</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(8:00)</span></div>
<div class="turn">your suburban conservative politics than</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(8:03)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, I'm running against them.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(8:07)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Fair. You're doing your job. Good.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(8:09)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Good. I need to pay attention. Okay,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(8:10)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Okay, so three parties in Calgary. None of them have the full 15 yet, full slate of 15 candidates yet. And I guess worth mentioning in the race for mayor is our incumbent mayor, Jody Gondek. Jeremy Farkas, who was a city councillor who ran last time for mayor, came in second. And Jeff Davison, who also was a city councillor who ran for mayor last time, came in third. So both of them have had a term away from council. And then also running for mayor is Sonia Sharp, who is running with Communities First, who is a current city councillor. And then Stephen Carter's guy, Brian Thiessen, he's been everywhere this stampede, who's running with the Calgary party.</div>
<div class="turn">Give me a brief rundown of the Edmonton scene. There's Better Edmonton.</div>
<div class="turn">And then are the two, the PACE, Principled Accountable Coalition for Edmonton party? party</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(9:02)</span></div>
<div class="turn">pace is running a few candidates i think that they've got six that are running right now uh they're a right of center party they're right wing uh they combined with tap yeg um which was going to be a third party but these guys wound up being able to merge uh whereas communities first and a better calgary uh weren't able to merge they weren't able to to pull it off so uh we have have uh two parties in edmonton three parties in calgary and</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(9:30)</span></div>
<div class="turn">and how would you brand better edmonton it's more right of center it's</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(9:36)</span></div>
<div class="turn">it's center right tim cartmell i think is is more right wing but uh he's a pretty pragmatic guy he always likes to talk about his engineering background and approaching uh problem solving from that engineer's background rather than an ideological point of view so</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(9:51)</span></div>
<div class="turn">so why so province introduced these rules and i feel like people went two very different There's people who are like, I'm an independent. We don't need political parties in municipal politics. People don't want political parties in municipal politics. Other people, such as you, who are like, hey, there's parties. I'm going to run some parties. Not just one, but two. So talk to me about why.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(10:11)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, there's two reasons. The first is the inherent advantage that the rules give you. So the rules have been changed dramatically. So it used to be Annalise Klingbeil could give $5,000 to every one of my 14 candidates. Not</div>
<div class="turn">Not anymore. Now Annalise has only $5,000 in total that she can give to all of the candidates.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(10:31)</span></div>
<div class="turn">What if I've got several corporations there, Stephen Carter?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(10:34)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, one would expect that you would. Yeah, several. It depends. If you control multiple corporations and it's the same ownership group, then you can only give from one of them.</div>
<div class="turn">So you can only give from one corporation. Now that dramatically reduces the amount of money that was going out. So there was a lot of money going out from developers where they would splash around $70,000, $75,000 to various candidates. Now they're limited to $10</div>
<div class="turn">$10,000 to the candidates, right? An individual. Hold on.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(11:06)</span></div>
<div class="turn">on. When you say $70,000, you mean total? Like they would be five here, five here, five here? Five</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(11:10)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Five to everybody, two to this person, two to counselors. And so it used to be that the counselors that looked like they were going to win, everybody got $2,000. uh the mayoralty candidates the top ones will all get five thousand dollars and they'll be the same donors basically</div>
<div class="turn">basically funding multiple campaigns and that's gone away now they basically have to pick a winner but there's another pool of money so there's that five thousand dollars but then the same corporations and the same individuals can give another five thousand dollars to the parties so in</div>
<div class="turn">in aggregate again so not five thousand dollars to the calgary party better calgary and uh communities first but five thousand dollars between those three so basically you're doubling your fundraising opportunity by having a party and</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(11:55)</span></div>
<div class="turn">the spending cap i think correct me if i'm wrong mayor</div>
<div class="turn">mayor can spend about</div>
<div class="turn">each ward can spend it's is it still like it's population but it's like 80 to 90 000 give or take let's</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(12:09)</span></div>
<div class="turn">let's call it 90 000 in calgary 80 some thousand dollars in evidence. But</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(12:13)</span></div>
<div class="turn">But then if you're part of a party, the party can spend an additional one million. Is</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(12:18)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Is that correct? The party has an additional one million. So basically it's three</div>
<div class="turn">three million dollars for the parties. It's one million for an independent mayoralty candidate. And it's constrained in terms of how much you can spend as an individual candidate. I think the spending limits are a red herring because I don't think anybody's going to be able to raise that much money with the the rules being as tight as they are uh but nonetheless uh there are spending opportunities because of the way that things have been organized uh</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(12:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">think independent candidates are going to struggle to get that 80 to 90 000 fundraised i</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(12:54)</span></div>
<div class="turn">think that most candidates it doesn't matter if they're independent or not i think that council candidates are struggling to</div>
<div class="turn">to get over 30 35 000 because</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(13:01)</span></div>
<div class="turn">because of the new rules or because of people</div>
<div class="turn">are tired of donating to politics because it's just been election after election?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(13:09)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I think a little bit of both, but the new rules really do pit the hamper. I mean, all of a sudden, someone will give $5,000 to Brian Thiessen and they're off the playing field. They can't give any more money at all. So then</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(13:20)</span></div>
<div class="turn">then why does it matter that parties can spend more if they can't raise it?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(13:25)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, the party itself can raise more money as well. So the party can raise more money than just an individual candidate. So now I get three pools of money to kind of play with. I get the candidate's money, I get the party money, and I get the mayoralty candidate money. And And so all three of those areas kind of come in together and you start to be able to assemble a bank,</div>
<div class="turn">bank, not a single bank account, because each person has to have their own bank account. Each person is still responsible for their own funding, but there's means available to split the money and share the money between the various campaigns. pains that's also part of the changes that were brought in uh by the conservative by the ucp government so</div>
<div class="turn">so that's the first reason yeah the second reason is that i now get to marry a ground game so 14 candidates going out and door knocking with an air war which is what we traditionally do with the mayor's race so a mayor can't door knock 486 000 homes in calgary uh can't door knock 426 000 homes in edmonton but</div>
<div class="turn">but when you have 12 candidates in edmonton and 14 candidates in calgary now</div>
<div class="turn">now you're starting to get to the number of people that can door knock uh</div>
<div class="turn">uh an entire city of calgary which</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(14:37)</span></div>
<div class="turn">you tried i don't want to speak on your behalf but you tried to do that a bit last time around with gondak like before there was parties where it was like hey let's get some let's let's get some council candidates who are aligned and while you're dropping your let's mention mention mention who's running for mayor type thing right yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(14:54)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah we dropped two pieces of lead at the same time um and we would bring significant numbers of volunteers we'd do it on a weekend uh we'd do a drop in ward four and we're dropping ward six and you know on one each every day we'd be with there with a different candidate we chose female candidates to work with for chochi uh it was a i think it was a good partnership i think we elevated a number of women to higher levels we didn't have much success necessarily in getting everybody elected that we'd hoped for um but uh we were you know we did elevate the number of candidates and i thought it was a good program so</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(15:27)</span></div>
<div class="turn">so to go back so basically you're running the</div>
<div class="turn">the two you're running within the party because these are the rules that are set up let's play with them so we can spend more money and do the ground game and air war at the same time like you think it's the winning recipe it</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(15:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">it is the only recipe and then on top of that we have one a third uh thing which is what happens in other jurisdictions where there's parties and in other jurisdictions where there's parties parties dominate so british columbia uh quebec those those areas have party domination because parties parties are more efficient parties make it easier for the voters to choose right how do you choose your council candidate now you're somebody who actually knows your council candidates and you'll make good choices but a lot of people choose their council candidate because of name recognition because of party affiliation really shallow reasons to choose a candidate and the party system enables us to to take advantage of those shallow reasons a little bit more efficiently.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(16:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Okay. How do parties change the system for voters? And you and I obviously pay a lot of attention to City Hall. We get the ins and the outs. But if you ask the average, like, gen pop person, they probably don't even know whether there's parties or not. Can you just kind of walk through how</div>
<div class="turn">how parties will, how the new council, October 20th, will be different? French.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(16:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">About 80% of the doors that you knock ask one question, and that is, which mayoralty candidate are you going to support when you're a councillor? So when you're door knocking, you're out there and they knock on the door and you say, which mayoralty candidate would you support? And this gives us the right answer. My team is able to say Brian Thiessen. Communities First gets to say Sonia Sharp. And that elevates both the party, the individual council candidate, And the mayoralty candidate. So because you've got a singular answer, because it's always going to be the same, you're able to elevate to the highest possible level. So sometimes the council candidate is going to lift up the mayoralty candidate. Other times the mayoralty candidate is going to lift up the council candidate. And in a perfect world, both of the candidates are working to lift the other. And that's, I think, one of the reasons that I'm a big fan of the party system. didn't</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(17:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">didn't answer my question at all come</div>
<div class="turn">come october 20th after the election how how does council i</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(17:51)</span></div>
<div class="turn">think you phrased it how does</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(17:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">does council look different because oh it</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(17:56)</span></div>
<div class="turn">council because you're not even so the municipal government act doesn't enable parties to caucus so if you have the majority of the seats you're not able to caucus because you can't assemble a team of councillors greater than quorum, which is 50% of the membership. If If you assemble a group of councillors greater than quorum, it is deemed to be an unofficial meeting and you can get in real big trouble under the MGA. So it will literally not change the way the council operates. There is no caucus, there is no capacity for city council to work because the UCP in their infinite wisdom system didn't think to change the mga to reflect parties they left the mga in such a fashion that they that parties wouldn't be able to function and then they said oh oh yeah parties can function okay they just said that they didn't actually legislate i</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(18:50)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i don't think people have fully like understand or have thought this through if one of the one of any of the parties that we have mentioned gets eight people elected gets the majority you're</div>
<div class="turn">you're saying even once they're on on council, nothing</div>
<div class="turn">nothing matters because they can't meet as a caucus.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(19:10)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Right. So you can't, you know, so Brian can go and talk to the individual councillors, which would very much mimic the way that Dave Brancanier, for example, used to govern, or Stephen Mandel in Edmonton. You know, he would go and talk to the individual councillors to try and get, earn their vote. And that would essentially be the only thing that can happen in council. There can't be a meeting where they determine in advance how they're going to vote on a specific motion. Can there be</div>
<div class="turn">There's already group chats in the existing councils. Yeah, exactly. But that group chat is not allowed to discuss or further council business.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(19:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">How is that monitored?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(19:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">In theory, you can FOIP that. but</div>
<div class="turn">i happen to know that most of the mayors and counselors delete their chat history on a regular basis yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(20:00)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah i know people who have tried to FOIP the uh the group chats the text messages and it's uh it is not easy um</div>
<div class="turn">um okay so what's</div>
<div class="turn">what's the point of all those cards like if</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(20:14)</span></div>
<div class="turn">the point is always the the same annalise it's to win that's the point winning</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(20:21)</span></div>
<div class="turn">but but you win and then like how is it if if if any of these calgary party people had just run as independents any like once once the election is over to your point they can't they're not a party they don't they don't they're not going to have like a president of the party or party infrastructure or anything no</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(20:40)</span></div>
<div class="turn">no in fact the The party is not allowed to function for the first two years of their term. So the party has to dissolve itself and isn't able to function for the first two years of the term. We're not allowed to raise money. We're not allowed to be a functioning functioning party during the first two years. It's only an elections vehicle, the way that they've set up the legislation. Which</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(21:00)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Which is different than other, like you mentioned, B.C. In B.C., the party is like a party.</div>
<div class="turn">party. It's like similar to the NDP or the liberals or the conservatives. It's a party, is it not?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(21:11)</span></div>
<div class="turn">It is, but they, I mean, now we're going to get into the real details of it, but they still have an MGA that prohibits them from caucusing. ABC, a better city, got in trouble because they were caucusing and advancing council agendas outside of council meetings, and they're getting in trouble from the Ethics Commission. How do</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(21:31)</span></div>
<div class="turn">do you not, by caucus, you just mean gathering in a group of the people who are part of the same party, correct? That</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(21:37)</span></div>
<div class="turn">That is correct. How</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(21:37)</span></div>
<div class="turn">How do you not caucus when you're part of a party?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(21:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">You're not allowed to caucus, Annalise. I wish you'd be paying attention to my answers. Not allowed to do that, Annalise. I mean, I think I've been answering your questions and you've just been saying, ah, you're not answering my questions. No,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(21:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">No, because I'm just trying to picture this. If, like me, let's say you and I and, I don't know, Corey and Zane and our producer, the five of us are all part of a party. We're candidates, and then we just happen to bump into each other at the bar. That's not allowed?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(22:06)</span></div>
<div class="turn">You can run into each other at the bar, in theory, but you would have to make sure that you're not talking about council business.</div>
<div class="turn">As soon as you start talking about tomorrow's motion, you're technically in violation of the Municipal Government Act. Okay.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(22:19)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Okay. So do you think any party will get eight seats? And if the answer is no, does it even matter to your point because they can't caucus?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(22:29)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I'm not doing all this work not to win at least 10 seats. 10</div>
<div class="turn">10 seats. You think the</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(22:33)</span></div>
<div class="turn">the Calgary party is going to win 10 seats in Calgary?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(22:36)</span></div>
<div class="turn">That's why we're running 14 candidates. Stephen Carter, how?</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(22:39)</span></div>
<div class="turn">How are they winning 10 seats?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(22:42)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, you take the ground game and you marry it with the air war. I</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(22:46)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I just keep saying that.</div>
<div class="turn">How are they winning 10 seats, Stephen Carter? Seriously.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(22:51)</span></div>
<div class="turn">How would you not?</div>
<div class="turn">Because it's a party and parties are going to be effective. I believe that at the end of the day, it's going to be us versus communities first. Because the party is going to actually matter more. Because at some point, Jeremy Farkas, who has no money, is going to realize that he's not going to be able to raise this much money. Or that Jeff Davison, who has no money, can't raise the money because he doesn't have a party. And the parties that exist are going to be able to raise more money and spend more money. And unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on which way you want to look at it, in order to win an election, you have to spend money. And the Calgary party is able to do more with less. When</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(23:29)</span></div>
<div class="turn">When does the raise, we're what, July 10th? Three months to the election. 100</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(23:36)</span></div>
<div class="turn">100 days. How many days?</div>
<div class="turn">100 days. Today? 102. Okay,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(23:40)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Okay, 102 days. What a great day to do our municipal episode, Carter. Yeah.</div>
<div class="turn">When does the raising and the spending really ramp up? To your point, and I think Jeremy Fargus, who's an avid listener of this podcast, would probably disagree that</div>
<div class="turn">that he's not raising money. But I have heard a lot of people are struggling to raise money. You mentioned it at the beginning that it's a harder environment.</div>
<div class="turn">When are we going to see this start ramping up of the raising and the spending?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(24:09)</span></div>
<div class="turn">It's already ramping up. Sonia Sharp and Brian Thiessen both have billboards that are out right now. They're spending money. You can see that money has been raised because the money is being spent. And Sonia Sharp is spending, you know, I would probably estimate it around $20,000 on billboards um i think brian's in the same category we have seen significant amount of money being raised and significant amount of money being spent by the calgary party and a little bit less money being spent by uh communities first how much</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(24:43)</span></div>
<div class="turn">much money are you spending on um stampede lawn signs and uh with with lamppost signs can we can we just sidebar into your knack for um finding loopholes in bylaws it's</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(24:56)</span></div>
<div class="turn">it's not a loophole it's it's not a loophole it's literally written into the law what you're allowed to do so</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(25:01)</span></div>
<div class="turn">so what steven carter has done this time around because you've done this like every recent election you've done you've municipal you've</div>
<div class="turn">you've got some sort of trick up your sleeve but um the calgary party has lawn signs that that are only up for 14 days because that's all that's allowed in the bylaw that are stampede specific some of them say yahoo some say giddy up</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(25:25)</span></div>
<div class="turn">giddy up some say let's ride which i</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(25:27)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i think is inappropriate um</div>
<div class="turn">um you can thank steven carter for that um and they so they're they're only up for 14 days and then this i actually quite appreciate you guys put signs on lampposts like all over downtown all along the parade road yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(25:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah some 6 000 different signs and</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(25:44)</span></div>
<div class="turn">me if i'm wrong the the thing is like everything has to be be gone within 14 days of when it was first put up yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(25:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">no pressure it's a it's a significant day to rip down everything and what what happens</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(25:55)</span></div>
<div class="turn">happens if they're not gone theoretically</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(25:58)</span></div>
<div class="turn">theoretically we could face a fine of up to three hundred dollars per instance three</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(26:02)</span></div>
<div class="turn">three hundred times six six thousand you do you're revealing numbers here uh but tell me about the bylaw though could you not rip everything down wait a week and then put it all back up for another 14 days you</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(26:13)</span></div>
<div class="turn">you don't actually have to wait a week you could rip everything down and as you're ripping it down put up another sign that just as long as it says is that what you're doing are</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(26:22)</span></div>
<div class="turn">are you saying that's because you guys are doing that no</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(26:24)</span></div>
<div class="turn">no i'm not doing that you</div>
<div class="turn">it'd be too much it'd be too much you're out</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(26:28)</span></div>
<div class="turn">out there anyways think about all the labor you're out there anyways ripping down just</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(26:32)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i know back out i know but they they work so well and i don't think that they would work as well as if we if we kept them up for us for that so did you did you</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(26:40)</span></div>
<div class="turn">you take this from somewhere else or why has no one else done this</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(26:44)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, I did it actually. I did it once in 2001 for Drew Farrell. And she hated it. She was so mad. I mean, sorry that you won, Drew. But she hated it. She just disliked the fact that we put up these signs. And there's another kind of piece to it. And that piece is that you can put them up on prohibited roadways, which we haven't yet done. So you're allowed to put them up on Crowchild Trail, for example. For 14 days. For 14 days, all on these lampposts. Well,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(27:12)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, now you're giving away that you're going to be doing that later.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(27:16)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Oh, I mean, it's a podcast, Annalise. You got to give the people what they pay the money for. Yeah.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(27:20)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah. Oh, this is a Patreon episode. This</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(27:22)</span></div>
<div class="turn">This is a Patreon Patreon episode. So we</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(27:23)</span></div>
<div class="turn">we can really, really get into the weeds. But I think that Jeremy</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(27:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Jeremy is a patron, isn't</div>
<div class="turn">isn't it? Oh, I am</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(27:32)</span></div>
<div class="turn">will be listened to.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(27:35)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Two weeks to go. I'll just tell you what the deal is. Two weeks to go. But</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(27:38)</span></div>
<div class="turn">But you've done, like the sign thing, The loophole You can call it what you want to call it But last time around When Gondek, who was a councillor at the time Was running for mayor You</div>
<div class="turn">You guys had signs way earlier than they were allowed Because they weren't They were advertising events Was that what the loophole</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(27:56)</span></div>
<div class="turn">loophole was then? They were advertising an event, yeah So we had Facebook Live events And you could put them up for two weeks at a time The Ward 3 councillor</div>
<div class="turn">with the Ward 3 councillor And we didn't mention that she was running for mayor um they weren't election signs they were just joe tigandek is hosting uh uh uh town hall a public facebook live in your neighborhood and wants your opinion what and it was during covid too so we couldn't meet in person so so we we put them up and now one of the things is we still have a non-profit society that can still do that so watch for that later too just</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(28:33)</span></div>
<div class="turn">just dropping uh dropping things all all over the place um</div>
<div class="turn">um with with that though i think it's worth mentioning and we can talk a bit about the media aspect and how hard it is for for candidates and parties to break through but the the kicker to me about like it's the second i saw that first sign downtown i parked downtown saw one i'm like this has stephen carter written all over it and then then my head went to oh great and now he's gonna get coverage for this because it's hard to break through and you saw the same same thing in the vancouver by-election how how many days of coverage did you guys get for that opt-out sign thing right like we're in an environment i don't know if people understand how hard it is to get media coverage three</div>
<div class="turn">three months before an election and you you got it with these signs how many uh how many calgary pieces were there uh</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(29:22)</span></div>
<div class="turn">uh five or six different pieces in total um we did uh we basically got every tv station we uh we got um live wire was the first to cover it i mean we did very well on earned media on this um because again everybody everybody also expects it from me right so they always want to see how i figured out a a little bit of a loophole and uh this this one was relatively easy one to walk through so it was you know i got we got media Media attention, which you're right. It is an impossible time to get media attention. Even during the writ, we're going to have to come up with stunts instead of actual news to get media attention. And you know how it goes. You know what the media atmosphere looks like right now. So getting the story lasted for four days. So getting four days of story was spectacular. So</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(30:15)</span></div>
<div class="turn">So who I didn't actually watch or read any of the things. I just saw the headlines and I knew it had your name written all over it. But who did, did Thiessen do, was Thiessen who spoke in the interviews or did people talk to you?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(30:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I spoke to Livewire and Thiessen spoke to everybody else. Why</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(30:28)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Why didn't Thiessen speak to Livewire?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(30:31)</span></div>
<div class="turn">He was just unavailable that day.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(30:34)</span></div>
<div class="turn">parade day, I think. What was his key message? What did he say? Like, this is how we break through. We're introducing ourselves to Calgarians?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(30:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Absolutely. It's entirely legal. And we explained to people why it was legal. We explain Section 5 of the Temporary Sign Bylaw, which very clearly articulates what we can and can't do. And some people misunderstand the bylaw and they think that you can't put up election signs prior to the writ. But there is no prohibition on putting up election signs. There is only a prohibition on putting up election signs for longer than two weeks.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(31:06)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah, it's a two-week loophole. Stephen Carter and the two-week loophole. Like the name of a children's</div>
<div class="turn">what's what what do you find easier like you haven't run in in you've run a lot of municipal elections in calgary for for council candidates for mayor whatever but not with a party system what do you find easier this time around doing it under a party system</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(31:31)</span></div>
<div class="turn">what do i find easier um everybody's functioning as a team that</div>
<div class="turn">that has been spectacular you have all All the candidates functioning as a squad, helping each other, providing advice to everybody. There's a little bit of good-natured competition that</div>
<div class="turn">that starts to unfold within within the team. You know, this group is doing better Nordocking than that group. The other groups are all trying to catch up. There's best practices sharing. sharing. Um, it's, it's, it's like having a group of, you know, 14 or 15 candidates that are all functioning as a team. And that team is a lot different to run even than provincial and federal, because when you're running provincial and federal stuff, it's too big to really create one single team.</div>
<div class="turn">Um, but with 12, 13, 14, you're able to create a single team where everybody gets to know each other and they can communicate on a daily basis and our discord chat for the calgary party is fantastic it's um it's got a tremendous amount of interest are you</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(32:36)</span></div>
<div class="turn">are you giving candidates essentially like a campaign in a box like i just think about the the barrier to entry in terms of people being intimidated intimidated and being like i want to run but i don't know how and i i don't know what i don't know and just being so overwhelmed so is there a bit of like a here</div>
<div class="turn">is your to-do list here is someone to help you go forth yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(32:54)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah we give them a full campaign in a box that is they even goes further than that we give them three brochures we give them so three brochures about 60 000 copies of brochures all together we're giving them signs we're giving them uh all the back-end uh computer software uh</div>
<div class="turn">uh common nation builder uh we're giving them the designs we're giving them all the templates we're giving them buttons and posters and all of of those types of things are coming from the party and they don't uh the amount paid by the candidate for those products is dramatically reduced uh so they don't have to pay as much that's part of the the beauty of working within a party system is that uh you're able to make your money go much much further why</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(33:38)</span></div>
<div class="turn">why why are you doing the two parties because was it a bit of like rinse and repeat once you understood the rules to set up another one or like like i imagine and i know Because I've seen you recently and you look a little tired. Is that not a lot of work?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(33:53)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah, it is a lot of work. And Edmonton was supposed to be a slam dunk working with Tim. And it's been a little bit more complicated than that. Housing up there has turned into a massive issue the same way it is in Calgary. But we did not anticipate that. We anticipated a little bit different primary issues. issues and Tim uh Tim's been doing great but uh you know today we just saw Michael Walters is going to uh run</div>
<div class="turn">run for mayor against Tim yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(34:24)</span></div>
<div class="turn">you've got a lot of people in the race and I mentioned yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(34:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah I mean it's fantastic I'm really excited about it you are</div>
<div class="turn">because it changes the vote numbers the number of votes required to win and Tim's already over 40 so I'm feeling really confident so</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(34:37)</span></div>
<div class="turn">so you think you're getting 10 for your parties in Calgary and in Edmonton Is this your prediction? Bold. Stephen Carter is so bold.</div>
<div class="turn">Speaking of issues, what do you think are the top three issues, Calgary top three, Edmonton?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(34:53)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I think that, well, housing is number one in both markets. And public safety, I think, is number two in both markets. Both markets have been talking about public safety and housing, which is quite interesting because significant ports of public safety and housing rely on the provincial government. And, you know, it's kind of been downloaded to the city. You know, like we're not talking very much about city issues at all. I would say that, again, both markets are kind of going with a back-to-basics model. I think that we are talking about the same three things most of the time. There's some unique elements in Calgary that we're not talking about in Edmonton. Calgary, we just launched a water utility policy that I don't think anybody's talking about. But, you know, we're putting forward a proposal just to look a little different and to have kind of more of a fullness of the conversation. Really good stuff. Really smart policies coming out of Calgary. Does</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(35:57)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Does anyone care about policies right now?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(36:01)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yes and no. no um yes</div>
<div class="turn">yes insofar there is a very small group of concerned calgarians that that read all the policies and like to critique them and tear them apart um those seven or eight people i don't</div>
<div class="turn">don't worry about too much um we</div>
<div class="turn">we did get some media on our public safety some some</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(36:24)</span></div>
<div class="turn">some negative press steven carter we</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(36:30)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah i mean i'm at this stage i'm willing to take media my hair i see through</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(36:35)</span></div>
<div class="turn">through what you did there i'm sure our smart patreon listeners do</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(36:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">do you honestly think that the journalists saw through what we did there you're so predictable steven carter you're so predictable predictable</div>
<div class="turn">predictable to you uh</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(36:50)</span></div>
<div class="turn">uh why why was the better edmonton launch so calgary party launched october last year like calgary party</div>
<div class="turn">not not with as many candidates as they have now and i'll note still not the full slate but why was Didn't the Better Edmonton launch just happen? Why did it take so long? Better</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(37:05)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Better Edmonton launched in May.</div>
<div class="turn">Why? Because we were in a very different spot with Edmonton. Calgary, we knew we were running a party from day one. And when we recruited the mayoralty candidate, we recruited everybody else to be a part of the party. Tim was very reluctant, I think I can say that, to form a party. he wasn't 100 sold on it he he's very very he's</div>
<div class="turn">he's a very practical man and his questions around how will it operate after the election um are</div>
<div class="turn">are legitimate questions he's not sure how it's going to operate we've talked more about it can't operate it can't</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(37:47)</span></div>
<div class="turn">can't operate after the election we've</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(37:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">we've talked about how we have to just be a team and we have to have a group of people who have common and values and that that</div>
<div class="turn">he bought into late um uh because it makes sense electorally uh to do it ultimately attracting the team uh has been good for tim too he also is is looking for a team he wants to surround himself with people uh that are like-minded that can support one another that like one another that are spending time together um you</div>
<div class="turn">you know it's an isolated job it's an isolating job to be a counselor uh and</div>
<div class="turn">and to have a team of people that you're working with and team of people people that you're running with that's</div>
<div class="turn">that's a really positive uh positive</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(38:36)</span></div>
<div class="turn">okay good uh good good party pitch there carter did</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(38:39)</span></div>
<div class="turn">did you like the spit did you like that i i i uh</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(38:42)</span></div>
<div class="turn">uh yeah there's just just been all over the place don't worry i've got more questions for you um okay</div>
<div class="turn">let's say just now that we're each really explain this caucus thing let's say hypothetically there's eight</div>
<div class="turn">eight independent candidates and</div>
<div class="turn">and they all they all win and</div>
<div class="turn">they are meeting or they're having a group chat is</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(39:12)</span></div>
<div class="turn">group again a group chat is allowed a meeting is allowed you're allowed to go for dinner you can go for dinner but you're saying they can't talk about council stuff about council business but</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(39:21)</span></div>
<div class="turn">but that's not that's not going to happen they're not going to not talk about council business which</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(39:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">which is one of the reasons that you don't see the counselors going out and having dinner together yeah because</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(39:29)</span></div>
<div class="turn">because they're all in the</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(39:30)</span></div>
<div class="turn">the group chat listen</div>
<div class="turn">you can foip the group chat</div>
<div class="turn">ahead FOIP the group chat if they're advancing council business in the group chat then they're breaking the rules okay</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(39:42)</span></div>
<div class="turn">okay I remember what I was going to ask when you were talking about how the sell to Tim was harder the sell to Brian how and Brian's great love Brian great guy covered him when I was when I think I've covered crime at the time when he was chair of the police commission yeah</div>
<div class="turn">how what's your pitch when you're like hey you should be mayor and also So start a party and be the leader of it.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(40:07)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Super easy pitch to Brian. Brian's a team builder.</div>
<div class="turn">Brian understands teams. He built teams when he was chair of the police commission. He built teams when he was the managing partner of Osler. He built teams when he was, you know, in his litigation practices. He is a team builder. That's what he does. And when you explain it to him in those terms, and we have a discussion about it in those terms, it was hardly a moment's thought. He understood exactly what we were trying to do. Also,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(40:33)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Also, you're like, build this team that can be a team for a year while you run, but then can't really be a team after the election.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(40:40)</span></div>
<div class="turn">I mean, it's just how they meet and interact is different. Yeah,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(40:43)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah, very different. I</div>
<div class="turn">I think the thing is like when and why I'm so hung up on this is when people think about parties, they think about like the NDP caucus</div>
<div class="turn">or the liberals or the conservatives. They think about the whips. Yeah, exactly. A group that meets and</div>
<div class="turn">and the people have, you know, no autonomy and you just do what the leader says. and the leader's the only one in media and all that. This is like, it's quite different.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(41:08)</span></div>
<div class="turn">It will be very, very different. And I am looking forward to seeing how it functions in practice. If I was writing all the laws, Annalise, I would have at the very least allowed caucusing.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(41:19)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah, because it's going to happen anyways.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(41:22)</span></div>
<div class="turn">It can't. If it happens, then you could be found guilty of breaking the municipal government act and you could lose your council. But</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(41:29)</span></div>
<div class="turn">But it just, it happens in the sense that, you know, you know the the leader of the party who may or may not be the mayor like let's say the party doesn't it gets five or six candidates but they don't get the mayor this the pseudo leader will go in as you say chat with this person then this person then this person right like yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(41:48)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah but you don't have to meet with all like 10 of your caucus mates uh at once you're or in the same meeting right or in the same for the same instead of</div>
<div class="turn">10 minute meet with you only have to meet with With the three people who have concerns. Yeah,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(42:01)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah, but instead of one 10-minute meeting, you can just have 10 one-minute meetings.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(42:07)</span></div>
<div class="turn">or if you've ever met a counselor, it's more like 10 45-minute meetings.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(42:16)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Okay, what else is on your chest? I got more questions here, but what else is on your chest about parties and upcoming municipal election? like what what do you want people to know what have people been asking you as you see all these people out and about uh during stampede well</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(42:37)</span></div>
<div class="turn">you mentioned that uh the polling early on about how the polling was negative uh the polling has changed dramatically there was a lege poll done at the end of may that had parties at 50 acceptance instead of uh instead of like 20 acceptance who did that That poll? Leger. No,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(42:54)</span></div>
<div class="turn">No, for who, though?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(42:57)</span></div>
<div class="turn">It was an independent one. They released it. Yeah.</div>
<div class="turn">I think that there'll be, I</div>
<div class="turn">I think we'll be 60, 70% acceptance by the end of this.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(43:07)</span></div>
<div class="turn">See, okay, here's my thing. And I have a couple friends, as I say, running as independents, who I have a lot of time for. Like, talk to anyone running, and if they're an independent, they'll say, oh, I've been door-knocking like crazy. At every door, people don't like political parties. parties and then and</div>
<div class="turn">you talk to anyone running with a political party they're like at every door they just love political parties i'm like yeah because it's all in like i think most people don't know and they don't understand and it's all in the pitch so the independents are saying did you know there's parties and they're bad and i'm an independent and the party people are saying did you know there's parties and they're they're good and i'm a party and then like people don't want to be mean to people's faces when</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(43:43)</span></div>
<div class="turn">when was the last time an independent was elected in you know in provincial or federal politics yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(43:48)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah but this is municipal it's so so different no</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(43:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">no it's not take a look at british columbia if you're an independent you're going to come in last out of 27 candidates okay</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(43:59)</span></div>
<div class="turn">okay so so when does speaking of polling when when does the polling catch up and the people who are currently in calgary running for parties when does their name recognition increase from two or five percent well</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(44:11)</span></div>
<div class="turn">well there's a million dollar question annalise we're not sure i mean i suspect that we'll see um polling changes in september but But the data that I have from the Gondek campaign and the Nenshi campaign shows that people make up their minds in the last 72 hours to 72 seconds before they vote. And because of that, I expect the vast majority of Calgarians to make up their minds, as they always do, in the last three days. So,</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(44:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">So, okay, let's say it's a week before the election and Calgary Calgary Herald puts out a poll, not from Main Street, but from someone else that says, you know, like Farkas at 30%, Gondek at 25%, others</div>
<div class="turn">others lower. You're not going to be worried because things</div>
<div class="turn">things changed in the last three days?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(45:04)</span></div>
<div class="turn">no momentum matters i mean if we didn't have any momentum that would be problematic</div>
<div class="turn">but you know we'll have the momentum because we have the best campaigns because</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(45:13)</span></div>
<div class="turn">because you're going to do some cool stunts can you talk to us about your stunts well</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(45:17)</span></div>
<div class="turn">well you already have given away most of them i</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(45:20)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i i want to i want to see like some big some big stunts steven some</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(45:25)</span></div>
<div class="turn">some big stunts i</div>
<div class="turn">no pressure carter but let's make it happen yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(45:30)</span></div>
<div class="turn">but don't don't you think like To the point about media, and obviously this is my wheelhouse working in communications and having been a City Hall reporter, but it's</div>
<div class="turn">it's easier to break through with a viral social stunt than it is to get good, consistent coverage in mainstream media.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(45:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Right. And so if you're going to break through with a social stunt, well, who's more likely to do it, a party or an individual? individual</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(45:59)</span></div>
<div class="turn">well a party has to your point has more money and resources and ideas right and</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(46:03)</span></div>
<div class="turn">and more and more capacity to do so it could be one of your candidates that breaks through you know you've got 15 opportunities to break through um your mayoralty candidates the ones that are running on their own i mean it's just i can't imagine how lonely it would feel trying to compete with with a party at this stage.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(46:24)</span></div>
<div class="turn">And yes. Have you seen any recent polling?</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(46:28)</span></div>
<div class="turn">The last one was that May one that I'm referring to, Lajay. Okay.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(46:32)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Let's go into our second segment. Look at this. Already 45 minutes of talking. Holy</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(46:40)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Holy shit. We have two segments in</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(46:42)</span></div>
<div class="turn">in municipal politics? Talking about municipal politics. Our second segment is called Everything is Municipal. And I'm just going to ask you some rapid fire questions. okay</div>
<div class="turn">what are my questions here um</div>
<div class="turn">what what's the what's the minimum amount that you think i well maybe this is just you're gonna i know what your answer is gonna be i'll ask it anyways the question is what's the minimum amount that you think a</div>
<div class="turn">a municipal candidate with under the new rules minimum amount a municipal candidate needs to raise to like have a good shot at winning i</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(47:19)</span></div>
<div class="turn">think it's about thirty thousand dollars that's</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(47:21)</span></div>
<div class="turn">that's changed like dramatically it</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(47:23)</span></div>
<div class="turn">was about 60 65 before but</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(47:26)</span></div>
<div class="turn">but people were spending like 300 400 000 were they not yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(47:29)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah and some of them were losing yeah um yeah yeah and so yeah i mean you used to be able to raise 150 200 000 in a counselor campaign and now i think that you'll be lucky to raise 30 to 40 those those independent candidates dates that you're talking about yeah they're</div>
<div class="turn">they're really going to struggle to to raise forty thousand dollars i</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(47:49)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i love the the um the raising you'll probably remember this but ward three this would have been maybe</div>
<div class="turn">maybe the 2017 election when</div>
<div class="turn">when um meg lioco spent like it was like the the money per vote like he spent like three hundred thousand and then winus spent five hundred dollars and almost beat him it was so beautiful yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(48:11)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah i hope winus runs the same type type of campaign this time um</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(48:13)</span></div>
<div class="turn">um okay so you think 30 to 40 000 is kind of like minimum to be competitive for people not in a party that's</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(48:21)</span></div>
<div class="turn">that's what well even for people in a party i think that that's what it's going to take to uh be competitive and to get your because that's that's your minimum budget that's what it takes to get signs and brochures and some swag and some digital campaigns and</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(48:37)</span></div>
<div class="turn">all you're not you're not paying staff you're not doing anything you</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(48:40)</span></div>
<div class="turn">you could pay like like a token amount to your campaign manager but that's not it yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(48:45)</span></div>
<div class="turn">um do you think social media matters for municipal candidates i</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(48:50)</span></div>
<div class="turn">don't think so actually heather and i were having this conversation today i i i think because heather's running in ward seven heather is stephen</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(48:56)</span></div>
<div class="turn">stephen carter's wife full disclosure yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(48:58)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah i i think that social media has lost its appeal um you know the mayoralty candidates are all duking it out we've got all the statistics from uh all the their various platforms, and we're comparing them. And I can tell you that compared</div>
<div class="turn">compared to where we were with even the Gondek campaign in 2021, there is no social media activity at all. And when you see where we are compared to the Nenshi campaign in 2010, it's laughable how little interest there is on social media so there really is no social media presence to be to speak of in the same fashion that there's no real media presence this is a challenging election if for no other reason than we have to change everything about the way that we think about campaigning why</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(49:47)</span></div>
<div class="turn">why what why has social changed so much why</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(49:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">why is social change like</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(49:53)</span></div>
<div class="turn">like but but but what in in terms of the the political thing and i i find it interesting because my my</div>
<div class="turn">my thought is that a lot of people are not doing social well i think I think they're not doing the right things on the right platforms. And I don't, I don't think the purpose of it right now is to be like, hey, I'm running this ward vote for me. It's more like, look look at my momentum to build the team. Like these people need door knockers and they need volunteers right now. yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(50:17)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah and i think that that's it that's used that used to be how we collected people that's how we did with nenshi but back in the 2010 election we had free social media you</div>
<div class="turn">you were able to post something and get um um and get you know just seen by tens of thousands of eyes um just because you posted it maybe you throw a little bit of money behind it to to promote it but you know you're talking 10 or 15 dollars to promote a post like it was just it was nothing and we had a genius just doing it and Richard Einerson. Um, today it just, you</div>
<div class="turn">you only get the paid post. You only get the paid, uh, stuff and, and, and it's all shifted to video. Um, and video is just infinitely harder to produce. Um, sure. I mean, you can do what I see a lot of candidates doing, which is the, you know, the holding the camera yourself and walking and talking to your camera. that can work you know riding your bike and looking at the camera I guess that can work as well but it's not actually the the true</div>
<div class="turn">the highest and best use I think of the social media and no one is responding it's</div>
<div class="turn">it's just not working what</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(51:28)</span></div>
<div class="turn">what about if because you and I have had this conversation about Corey's campaign and like that parasocial relationship</div>
<div class="turn">I think it would be too late for this right right now but what if someone like really went hard on social with the idea of like building</div>
<div class="turn">building that trust influencer parasocial relationship and then ran for council then do you think social media matters like</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(51:52)</span></div>
<div class="turn">like what like like cm calgary's gonna run for for office or you know cm</div>
<div class="turn">you know i mean it's just it doesn't i just don't think that the influencer or model lends itself well to politics i think that you have to say too many things and right now the only way it seems to be working is controversial statements by controversial people who then wind up being embraced by their controversial left or the controversial right yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(52:17)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah then the algorithm likes them okay so you you think social media doesn't matter if it okay if it doesn't matter and here's here's my question here is like why</div>
<div class="turn">why does everyone have it and everyone has their like 200 or 300 followers and they're like spending time posting stuff why not just like pull an andre chabot circa 2015 and be like no i don't need any social media well</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(52:39)</span></div>
<div class="turn">well i mean that's an option um and i do have a candidate in edmonton who does not have any social media who's doing a very good job of pushing out uh his messaging um i would suggest that the reason we say we do social media is the same reason that we continue to send media releases to the media um it could could work strong spaghetti at the wall it</div>
<div class="turn">it could you guys are still</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(53:02)</span></div>
<div class="turn">still sending media releases</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(53:04)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah if i don't want something covered i send a media release i</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(53:07)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i was gonna say how's your how's your pickup on your media releases going yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(53:11)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah if i want something covered i we we we find a way to leak it or something oh</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(53:16)</span></div>
<div class="turn">oh carter um okay how how what what's the appropriate time if someone's thinking of dropping out when</div>
<div class="turn">when when is like the last not like whatever the bylaws say but like if someone's like nope i have no chance i</div>
<div class="turn">i want to keep my i don't know what dignity whatever like i i'm i'm one out september long what's the timing here before</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(53:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">before september long when</div>
<div class="turn">you'd want to drop in the middle of august um if you're not getting the resonance that you want then people people don't really know that you even ran and you don't suffer much in the way of reputational damage. Um, if you drop like Kent hair did in, uh, 2010 running</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(54:01)</span></div>
<div class="turn">running for mayor. Yeah.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(54:02)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Yeah. Just before the nomination day, then that all of a sudden becomes a story. Um, and I think that it's, it's much easier to not become the story. Uh, technically you're able to drop out, I think until the 29th of September, but you just don't want to have that kind of pain. do</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(54:18)</span></div>
<div class="turn">do you do you have any advice this this is a really niche question do you have any um advice</div>
<div class="turn">advice for that conversation of because because people say at the beginning right they're like if i'm not resonating i'll drop out and you're like no you won't</div>
<div class="turn">you're gonna like work your ass off for a couple months and then you're gonna be like i'm doing great and everyone brings out they're like look what happened with nancy look at how nancy came up and no one thought he was gonna win but like what what's what's your what's your chat big big eye roll steven what what is your chat what is your chat with people because i have an approach but i would be curious to know your like your approach with people when it's like just drop out yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(54:57)</span></div>
<div class="turn">i mean if you're</div>
<div class="turn">you're going up against a real candidate you're not going to ever challenge</div>
<div class="turn">challenge them right and a council candidate is totally different than a mayoralty candidate. And you can't go back 15 years to a different time and a different election and say, well, look where Nahed Nenshi was. Or maybe we go back to 2001 and say, look where Dave Brancanier was. Dave Brancanier was nowhere against Bev Longstaff. And suddenly he just kind of materialized in September and October.</div>
<div class="turn">Sure, those are mayoralty campaigns. Now point to me the, point</div>
<div class="turn">point out to me the, the councillor campaigns that happen. I mean, normally the incumbents win, right? Normally Normally it's the incumbents. Now we have nine incumbents not running in Calgary.</div>
<div class="turn">The remaining incumbents that are running are mostly running with Communities First, except for Raj Dhaliwal and Jennifer Winus. i mean we have um you</div>
<div class="turn">you know like you're</div>
<div class="turn">you're not going to break through you're not going to break through and and you can't say well i'm getting good response at the doors because that's just a fucking joke everybody gets good response at the doors yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(56:10)</span></div>
<div class="turn">yeah it's um that that that is what people say getting a good response oh</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(56:14)</span></div>
<div class="turn">oh i'm really happy to get your stuff thanks thanks very much believe</div>
<div class="turn">believe Believe me, the only thing you're doing at the doors right now is preparing for the last 72 hours.</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(56:25)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Talk about this a bit more. I know we talked about this during Corey's campaign, but like how different the doors are nowadays than even a decade ago with like people people not answering their doors, let alone even having doorbells or mailboxes.</div>
<div class="speaker">Carter <span class="time">(56:41)</span></div>
<div class="turn">Well, I mean, not having a mailbox is a massive problem, but there's what about two thirds of Canadians right now are on super boxes. um, a little bit less in the cities. So let's say it's about half in the cities. Um, I mean, these, it is so hard even just to get a brochure into people's hands. Um, it is, it is a significant challenge, uh, just to give people a piece of literature. Um, so, uh, you know, everything has changed in a very short period of time. All of our tactics have changed. changed everything is shifted um because we can't do the things that we used to be able to do so and the door knocking is just you know i mean right now i've got very i i track on a weekly basis how our door knockers are performing and i can tell you exactly how many ids a candidate is going to get based based on what they're getting right now yeah</div>
<div class="speaker">Annalise <span class="time">(57:37)</span></div>
