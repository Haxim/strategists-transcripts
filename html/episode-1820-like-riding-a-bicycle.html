And the people who support Trump are going to be like, this was stolen. It&#x27;s been stolen. and the reason i know this is because the last time they lost that is exactly what they did so uh and i think this time they&#x27;re really going to lose their shit so i have uh i priced out most of the bug out strategy i cannot believe how expensive flour is um and you can&#x27;t really get a discount for buying 500 pounds of it so you know i&#x27;m i&#x27;m working the i&#x27;m working the if anybody has a deal let me know send me a note like a flower guy pardon</div>

We&#x27;ve discussed this multiple times on this show. We always need a fourth. And in this case, we&#x27;re adding frustrating to the mix. Stephen Carter, for the uninitiated, here&#x27;s how this works. I will go through a list of things that I find fascinating from a Canadian political strategy level. It could be policies introduced at a cabinet retreat, for example, or it could be appointments made to the Senate, or it could be videos put out and then retracted by certain political parties. I will go through all of these, and I&#x27;ll name you the party in question, and I&#x27;ll ask you, is this fine for them? Is this fabulous? Is this frustrating, or is this fucked, so to speak?

Stephen Carter, he was appointed to the Senate as a Manitoba senator for the liberals. Is this fine? Is this fabulous? Is this a masterstroke? Is this frustrating, considering some of the fallout?

And Paula, I think we can agree is a grade A number one senator. But we don&#x27;t know how these people are going to be in the Senate, right? Are you going to get yourself a great senator?

They usually kind of then have a 12-hour news cycle, if any news cycle. This one&#x27;s a bit different. Charles Adler&#x27;s a bit of a name, especially in the political arena.

Yeah, the Senate that was designed in 1867 to serve as a body of sober second thought, this cooling of the hot tempers of the public that has become this independent group of luminaries, at least that&#x27;s the liberal vision of it. There&#x27;s now only, I think, a dozen conservative senators, right? There&#x27;s quite a few vacancies at this moment.

And it does seem like he&#x27;s decided that he wants to make this particular Senate an issue again. And that confuses me. It does confuse me. And so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what anybody gets out of it. I suppose that as Canadians, we get somebody like uh you know chuck adler who i i have high regard i love a good uh principled conservative right somebody who&#x27;s going to stand up against what they see as as the ills of their own party a principled any member of any party frankly and and he certainly is somebody who believes conservative things even</div>

Because as much as it&#x27;s like, ah, this is the GG&#x27;s appointment, this is the PM making these calls, what do you think they were trying to do here?

  <div class="said">Well, I mean, because this isn&#x27;t someone being chosen out of the full population of Manitoba. The person has to actually apply to become a senator. It looks like Chuck applied, he put his name in, he threw his name in the hat, and he was selected. We don&#x27;t know who the other people were that we&#x27;ve selected over. I assume it was, you know, people in prison. But no, you know, this is what happens, right? You can&#x27;t pick from a list of the population when really it&#x27;s just a list of those people who&#x27;ve applied. And I&#x27;ve heard scuttlebutt that they&#x27;ve struggled to find applicants from time to time for these positions.</div>

Like, you know, I think the simple sort of logic that this goes against type, he&#x27;s someone who&#x27;s kind of reformed his opinions, shows that we&#x27;re potentially open to that, we&#x27;re trying to appeal to these types of conservatives. I see that. Is it just that? Or do you think there&#x27;s something else here that they were trying to do with the appointment</div>

This is not somebody who&#x27;s a liberal, historically, traditionally, even currently, I would say. But there are other, I mean, Stephen&#x27;s right, you have to apply to the job. We don&#x27;t know what the pool was. It&#x27;s certainly not every Manitoban who would be considered or even eligible, frankly, under the rules of the Senate. But it is interesting to imagine what the rest of the alternatives might have been and how the Prime Minister might have addressed that. But certainly, I think, especially</div>

This isn&#x27;t about being non-partisan. This is about being partisan with purpose. And the senators are going to outlast any one government. So why not appoint partisans that will reflect multiple governments, will reflect party principles? That&#x27;s what I want to see. That&#x27;s my magic wand.</div>

Think of it almost as like a university with tenure, but for political actors, right? Where you say, man, they&#x27;re always putting something interesting. Like you could put a person like Michael Chong in the Senate when they&#x27;re tired of being an MP, and they would always be additive, right? They are always going to be adding something to the conversation. So I think that maybe that&#x27;s the approach I would take.

  <div class="said">You know, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re a prick. That&#x27;s why. I don&#x27;t understand how something like this happens simply because of what it is. At some point, somebody had to download stock imagery that had a bunch of tags on it, and nobody noticed it was like big fighter or anything like that. I&#x27;m not even asking them to necessarily know the difference between fighter jets, although you would think that the Conservative Party of Canada would have at least a few people there with the kind of the rah-rah military boosterism that they at least purport to have at their heart, would have understood that, right, as it&#x27;s going out. But I guess I&#x27;m surprised. I don&#x27;t know how it happened.</div>

  <div class="said">Or maybe it was somewhere in the UK. Yeah. and uh and was passed off as albert people always like this is like a one-on-one thing at this point when you put up a campaign in politics someone is going to reverse image search someone is going to identify the source of it someone is going to tear apart your stock imagery and they&#x27;re going to say this is what&#x27;s wrong with it and this is why and so a big part of any construction that uses stock imagery is going through that are we 100 sure we&#x27;re not going to look like dipshits test and And this has been true for a very, very long time. So I am confused as to how this could have occurred in an operation that is purportedly as sophisticated as the Conservatives is. And that was a fairly high polish video, right? So it seems it&#x27;s confusing to me it occurred. And I think it might show a certain complacency, a certain laziness, certain we&#x27;ve done, you know, these videos and they&#x27;ve been so popular, we&#x27;ve stopped doing the very foundational checks on it and they got burned for it. But I am confused how it happened in the first place, because this has been a big deal so many times</div>

  <div class="said">Carter, there&#x27;s at least 13 inconsistencies in the video, including a Canadian dad driving through suburbs, which was from North Dakota, mountains, which were from Indonesia, signs that were from Venezuela. So people, to Corey&#x27;s point, did the internet sleuthing and did the simple reverse image searches of stock video. What is your take, Carter, on modern day stock video that you can easily get from And I&#x27;ll get a little bit into the details here that you can easily get from a royalty-free or a very minimal pay-per-use sort of site to generate these quick hit videos. As video is becoming an even more needed, volumous, not a special occasion tool, but you kind of need it every day, political parties, practitioners are having to turn to these modes to procure. and often as practitioners you guys may also agree with this that you can&#x27;t usually find stock footage of someone in canada making sure it&#x27;s exactly the same like you know there&#x27;s limitations so i i also want to acknowledge that from a practitioner&#x27;s perspective and get your thoughts on this carter as video becomes even more voluminous what do you think of stock image is this gonna become forgivable one of those things that people are like whatever as long as it helps He tells a story where this is going to have diminishing returns of people soothing this, and parties will ultimately be like, ah, fuck it. Who cares if this is a mountain from Indonesia? We&#x27;re just here to tell a story, and we put out a video every day. So we&#x27;re going to put out another one tomorrow, so you can go fuck yourself sort of thing. Are we going to get to that point?</div>

  <div class="said">What do I make of it? I mean, it&#x27;s never been as easy to create a video as it is right now. I mean, you can subscribe to those stock video services. I mean, at one point, it was really high end to have a photograph, you know, Ken Burden style, and it was moving across the screen. Now you can find stock video for just about any circumstance. But the problem is that virtually any circumstance is generally not your specific circumstance. So that specific circumstance is really hard to find. can we find you know like there&#x27;s a tremendous amount of b-roll in those you know all those calgary videos that get produced and and how do you find the b-roll for those calgary videos you can&#x27;t just go to uh stock videos r us and throw in uh calgary video because you&#x27;re going to get things that look like calgary or things that are close to calgary things that are something like it and those stampeding horses going across the plane may just be in montana right and and And sometimes you&#x27;re not going to get caught.

  <div class="said">This came up all of the time in my tenure with government communications, right? And I don&#x27;t want to be misunderstood. We used a lot of stock imagery. It&#x27;s a good way to save money, frankly. And when you&#x27;re thinking about public dollars, not everything should be an expensive, elaborate shoot, right?

  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah, like absolutely. And is that worth it? Does that make any sense? the problem with the ad for alberta was that it didn&#x27;t show alberta so the beach that was not alberta was a problem because it was an ad for alberta right so that&#x27;s a big deal ad for a health plan that doesn&#x27;t show alberta maybe not a big deal like just generic actors somewhere that are looking practically like healthcare professionals sure uh something that that is a picture of like, let&#x27;s say, a piece of plastic that was recorded somewhere else, not a big deal at all, right? So there is a bit of a sliding scale here. And generally speaking, when you&#x27;re using stock imagery, there&#x27;s a few questions you ask yourself along the way. And this is not a complete set, but it&#x27;s a good way to start. One, is it obvious, right? You don&#x27;t want to pull somebody out of it and realize, well, that image is not here, that image is not that, that right to steven&#x27;s point you wouldn&#x27;t want a picture of uh calgary and it&#x27;s clearly vancouver uh as somebody&#x27;s walking around two do we care like does it really matter for this particular moment and uh the third one really is will</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">anybody else think it matters and so you go through those things and i think where the conservative one failed and you did make me realize something as we were talking here steven maybe a way that this did happen um but you want to go through and say okay it would one of these stock images potentially offend people because of its stock nature and i think that the fighter jets isn&#x27;t pretty obvious oh yeah but when you search for these various terms quite often even if it&#x27;s not alberta people know you&#x27;re looking for images potentially of anywhere on the plains right and so they will tag a picture that was taken in montana with alberta north dakota saskatchewan they want to sell their piece because they want to because they want to sell it and so and they get to pick what the tags are so if you&#x27;re just very quickly like searching and and putting tags in and and saying fighter jets canada well that might actually have been what this was tagged with and somebody got really really sloppy and didn&#x27;t necessarily look at that again baffling to me that it wasn&#x27;t caught and that there weren&#x27;t the safeguards in place but this is something that happens with stock imagery but you just have to you have to to assess it almost issue by issue</div>

And I&#x27;m wondering if fuck it, we don&#x27;t care is like perhaps like the new sort of where we&#x27;re headed to some of this stuff, when you have to put out the volume of content that political parties have to put out. Yes, they got burnt this time, no doubt about it. It was not the right strategic call, right? Yeah. But I do wonder, there&#x27;s a part of me that wonders being like fuck it let&#x27;s just let&#x27;s just let it rip right because the the cost of trying to do the alternative and we don&#x27;t even know we need to get this out today like fuck it like we&#x27;ll take the hit if we get the hit the probability of it is five percent well that&#x27;s fine like i could see that conversation potentially happening as well</div>

How would you have dealt with this from a creative perspective? I&#x27;m just curious to get both of your takes being like, let&#x27;s just say what the creative you had was what you had.

As you&#x27;re going along there and, and occasionally you have to make sacrifices, right? You say, man, I really want a shot that looks like this. Well, to get that shot with drones right now, not possible. And Hey, we can&#x27;t get stock imagery because the Canadian air force doesn&#x27;t allow that stuff to be used for stock imagery.

And so you&#x27;ve got a bit of a protectionist rationale there, but it seems clearly at odds with the environmental rationale that the liberals have as well, right? And I think that&#x27;s going to be a challenge in any jurisdiction that&#x27;s looking at Chinese EVs because, I mean, I&#x27;ve never actually driven one, but some of them look fairly impressive. Certainly, we&#x27;re all familiar with BYD, which is one of the big manufacturers in China, being able to build these vehicles that started at one point as knockoffs, but now look better than the vehicles that they&#x27;re knocking off and coming in at way lower prices.

  <div class="said">Corey, is there anything else you want to throw in here? Like, talk to me about why you don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re trying to do this. Is it because the previous ones have failed and that announcing another reset and having it fail is not what they need rather than just doing shit? Like, this announcement, like this political conventional wisdom of announcing a reset, right? If I were to frame it in a different way, it would be that segment of why the fuck do we still do this? Why the fuck do we still have political parties announce they&#x27;re doing a reset rather than just reset? And so I&#x27;m kind of curious, like, from your perspective, because the actions might be the same, but the announcement of this is a reset is not happening. Your thoughts on that? And Carter, coming to you after this.</div>

  <div class="said">Well, it&#x27;s interesting. So if what they&#x27;re thinking is we just don&#x27;t get out there and nobody can get mad at us and nobody can critique our reset, that&#x27;s very dangerous. like that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the most dangerous mindset in politics when you start getting so insular that you you don&#x27;t want to hear from other people you don&#x27;t want to do things because you think that they&#x27;ll just invite criticism you are just hiding that is the most dangerous place to be in politics and it&#x27;s so self-defeating and if that&#x27;s where they are they just need to quit like they just need to quit everybody who&#x27;s got that mindset needs to go do something else it&#x27;s a big world politics ain&#x27;t that great there are a lot of other things you can do with your life once you get outside of politics but i think that there&#x27;s probably some more obvious reasons why they wouldn&#x27;t be announcing a full reset at this moment one is and we&#x27;ve talked about this in the context of as like last year when they did the cabinet shuffle one of the big critiques we had at the time was you only get to do this once right well so they&#x27;ve done that they can&#x27;t do another cabinet shuffle that looks foolish right they had their uh we&#x27;re gonna move this budget uh or we&#x27;re gonna going to move public opinion through this budget thing didn&#x27;t really work you can&#x27;t really keep announcing the same thing over and over again and uh if there is another card to play and i&#x27;m of the opinion there&#x27;s really only like one if you&#x27;re going to keep going and that&#x27;s a big big change at the top it&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s either a new chief of staff or maybe a new deputy prime minister certainly there&#x27;s been some reporting that uh mark carney might be in the mix for finance and so So maybe that just shuffles things up a little bit. You don&#x27;t do it before you take another hit. And I don&#x27;t know if the Liberals are going to win the Montreal by-election or not. I haven&#x27;t been following it very closely. Certainly, polling them by-elections is notoriously difficult.</div>

And I think in politics, quite often, it&#x27;s that, right? When you&#x27;re looking for change in general, you look for easy change, you look for change you can feel, you look for change you can see. Politicians are pretty addicted to that for the reasons that Stephen said, which is it allows them to shake the etch-a-sketch, get it all clear, and get to draw all sorts of new lines on it, right? And get back to that place where they have the goodwill and the charity to do the things that they want to do. So that&#x27;s why you often see them announce the change. It&#x27;s It&#x27;s because they want everybody to know they&#x27;ve changed. They make a show of the change for either internal or external purposes, depending on what&#x27;s going on.</div>

  <div class="said">Corey, I&#x27;m going to start with you on our next one, which is sticking with this Liberal cabinet retreat. There&#x27;s some policy announcements coming out of it, and one fascinating one is around housing. The Liberals are proposing to build 250,000 new homes by 2031 on public lands. They&#x27;re actually creating something called the Canada Public Land Bank and have a new public lands for homes plan, which they want to build these 250 quarter of a million homes on properties that they deem surplus, underutilized in the federal government&#x27;s vast portfolio. This is something being pushed, not exactly, but, you know, versions of this has been pushed previously in the past, has been certainly pushed by the conservatives as well. Well, fine,</div>

And it&#x27;s also very consistent with saying, what are some of the things that the conservatives are saying that we should do? Let&#x27;s just do them. And then we can take it off the table. And I think that Pierre Poliev is doing himself a bit of a disservice trying to find ways to critique it because it&#x27;s not the conservative implementation of it, right? So these incredibly long-term leases rather than it being something that you can own outright. Like, I understand where Pierre Poliev is coming from in the sense that, hey, you&#x27;ll rent forever, you won&#x27;t be a homeowner. I think homeownership is a good thing.

But this is obviously a major component of it. I&#x27;m not going to knock them for building houses. I agree with Stephen, it&#x27;s not enough. And I also believe it&#x27;s not fast enough.

They are a vital part of our economy. But given the strain on the economy that is occurring right now, I think that we have to slow down temporary foreign workers. And we may have to reduce our overall number of immigrants in total. Immigration, I think, is a net benefit to society. I&#x27;ve said that a thousand times. But right now, society also needs some housing starts. Ironically, a large portion of those temporary foreign workers and immigrants are working on the problem of actually building us more housing.

BC United having super low support, BC United signaling that that B.C. conservatives were maybe close enough to be in the same party with them. That total collapse of B.C.

  <div class="said">Carter, level of concern. If you&#x27;re the B.C. NDP right now, you&#x27;re the government, you&#x27;ve got Eby, you had Horgan prior too. This was supposed to be pretty straightforward. I&#x27;m not going to say it was supposed to be not challenging, but straightforward, I think is perhaps the right term. It&#x27;s no longer straightforward. I think that much is clear. The BC Conservatives were not supposed to be your principal opponent. They are, and they&#x27;re surging. And the other party, to Corey&#x27;s point, is near a collapse. Where are you on the panic scale between 1 to 10?</div>

  <div class="said">Oh, I&#x27;m pretty panicked. I&#x27;m probably at least at least a plus on the panic level right now, because you have to realize that if an election comes down to change versus more of the same, if the change has multiple options, it changes your number that you&#x27;re going to need to achieve. achieve this is now a single option change has so you need to get 50 plus one and that&#x27;s just not going to happen if you&#x27;re the bc ndp right now so 50 plus one is off the table and uh the bc conservatives look like they are are the ones tracking towards it so this change election becomes really really difficult for uh the bc ndp and no cory i did not describe vote split vote split yeah it</div>

What would you what would you want for him for him to do? It doesn&#x27;t have to be specific. Just words of wisdom. Anchor him with some with some of your strategist wisdom in terms of how he should land the plane from this cabinet retreat. He&#x27;s not doing a reset. He&#x27;s not doing a cabinet shuffle. awful uh he&#x27;s clearly announcing policies more on immigration expected knowing all of what we do know which is not everything give him some advice cory sam do you and we&#x27;ll finish it off</div>

Heading into this session, I don&#x27;t know what the topic, like what the theme would be that actually wins anything back. What is the theme? What is the, you know, how does he do this other than change? I just don&#x27;t know how. Corey, you have an idiast?</div>
