Not much planning goes in the show, but we have done a bit of planning, which is I&#x27;m going to get Shannon&#x27;s take on the NDP leadership, federal NDP leadership. She&#x27;s got shit to share. And Carter is going to explain to me the theory of the race race for 28 races municipally in calgary and edmonton how he thinks this thing is going to go how he thinks he has a chance to win let&#x27;s say more than half of them</div>

  <div class="said">yeah i think you&#x27;re i think you&#x27;re in trouble for more than that reason uh carter thank you we&#x27;ll get we&#x27;ll get to the theory of the race municipally we&#x27;ll get to shannon uh and her thoughts on the federal ndp leadership race now that we officially have two two candidates, Anavi Lewis and Heather McPherson. But before we get into all of that, let&#x27;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, not all labor is created equal. Guys, I want to talk about two strikes. We talked at length about the CUPE strike with flight attendants, but we&#x27;ve got this potential strike with the Alberta Teachers Association here in Alberta. And then the postal workers, in their response to the government, have now gone on strike. And I want to start with a very top-line question. We can get into the details of both of these. For example, as we record today on Monday, teachers are voting right now. Shannon, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. Carter, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. I believe we should have a sense of that by today, tomorrow, in terms of what the results of the teachers&#x27; vote on their potential strike looks like, which is scheduled for later on, first week of October, i.e. next week. and we can talk about the details of the government and their plans on the COPW strike that is now active with postal workers. However, I want to start with a very top-line question. And let me start with you, Shannon. And it&#x27;s more of an observation than a question that I get you to respond on.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">4:27</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">For neither of these groups, the teachers in Alberta or the postal workers federally, this doesn&#x27;t feel like the same level of sympathy and energy that flight attendants had.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="277">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">4:37</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Am I wrong? No, you&#x27;re not. It isn&#x27;t. Uh, and, uh, you know, flight attendants hit, uh, just a moment in time and a certain, uh, uh, issue set that, that, uh, allowed them tremendous public sympathy and that everybody understands the concept of sitting on the tarmac, twiddling your thumbs and the idea that the people sitting in the aircraft with you, uh, aren&#x27;t being paid for that time struck people, I think, uh, uh, as, uh, being a little off. and um and i think also people learning how little uh flight attendants actually make where they were like what because you know back in the day it used to be a fancy job uh and i think people were shocked to learn like they have learned with pilots as well that it&#x27;s not that fancy anymore and the wages are not that great um think with teachers you&#x27;re gonna see it start with about you You know, it&#x27;ll fall on partisan lines, let&#x27;s say 50-50, with public sympathy, and it&#x27;ll go down over time. Because that&#x27;s just what it is, right? I mean, the government will take a hit, too, for sure.</div>

  <div class="said">Carter, this doesn&#x27;t feel like the same. Is my premise correct? correct shannon seems to agree with that she&#x27;s given me some reasons why i&#x27;m curious if you agree and give me some reasons in terms of why if you do</div>

  <div class="said">i&#x27;m not sure i agree yet i think i agree on cop w i don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s public sentiment in favor of the postal union um but i i think that the teachers association will have will do better once they actually reach the strike function they have an awful lot of messaging to do uh between now and then um you know taking a deal and and turning it down um you know it&#x27;s it&#x27;s going to require some actual messaging and i&#x27;m not sure the ata has nailed their messaging to this point um but as they they move through the first week or so of this imagined strike because that&#x27;s all it is at this particular moment is an imagined strike that&#x27;s why i take a little bit of a difference it may work out to be exactly as shannon said but right now i still think that because it&#x27;s in the land of the imaginary stationary the ata still has the opportunity to kind of go 60 40 70 30 in support and then it will drop as as it continues on</div>

  <div class="said">think the reason why i&#x27;m a little less bullish than i might otherwise be is there&#x27;s been disturbance in the force internally with the ata right like the chair of the bargaining committee like you know i i quit in a fifth peak on Facebook you know like things are not well in that particular universe and it always gets dicey when you&#x27;re putting an agreement before the membership but you&#x27;re not recommending that agreement you know like there&#x27;s all this sort of storm and drang within the teachers association that is going to undermine their ability to push that message that Carter is talking about and he&#x27;s right I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;ve quite landed it yet with the coherence that it needs to be but also Also, like, stay on it and not allow those spots where the government can, like, come in, drive wedges between, you know, union and membership, all of these things that are just tried and true tactics at a straight time.</div>

  <div class="said">I want to break down both of these. And let&#x27;s start with the provincial one because we haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time on this pod recently talking about the province. So let&#x27;s dig in deeper into the teachers and their conditions because both of you mentioned this, which is the concept of bringing an agreement to membership and having not recommending it and having them turn that down. What is the public opinion sort of world there? But before we get there, let me just kind of lay out some of the facts, right? Right. So teachers voted over across the weekend. They&#x27;re voting as we speak right now. By the time we record, I don&#x27;t know when results will come out, but you should expect to hear them relatively soon. So they&#x27;re they&#x27;re voting right now. This is a vote on a 12 percent pay rise over four years. Three thousand additional teachers and coverage for the covid-19 vaccine. Those three things seem to be the headline, which you can get the whole back stuff in a moment in a different segment. If they just if they if they turn this deal down, Carter, their strike begins on the sixth. This affects 50,000 plus teachers, 51,000, oddly, nearly 750,000 students. And there is no, materially, I think this is important, they do not receive strike pay and time spent during the strike would affect pensionable income as well, which I think is just worthy of mentioning as factors. But I want to get to the core of this, which is as strategists, as folks who kind of run and understand the political situation. Stephen, let me start with you.</div>

  <div class="said">Actually having an agreement that you turn down, does that change the PR game? Does that change the public opinion game versus trying to reach a deal and having a participant in government not not budging at all? In this case, you could argue government has budged, even though this deal is virtually identical to what was initially offered that they&#x27;ve turned down before. But the government&#x27;s playing ball, which is slightly different than at least from a public opinion perspective, in my mind. Am I right? Yeah,</div>

  <div class="said">I think this is mostly an internal exercise, right? Before you go on strike, go back to your membership and just say, hey, I just wanted to clarify, this is what we&#x27;re being offered and we&#x27;re all against this, right? So when they get a, what one would expect would be a fairly significant rejection, then they get to walk back into the negotiating room prior to the strike date and say, listen, our membership knows what&#x27;s at stake here. that&#x27;s this or strike they&#x27;ve chosen strike so you best get yourself ready for it um that to me uh strengthens the bargaining position uh i&#x27;m still you know not a great big fan of recommending something to the or of not recommending something to be signed but i got it i understand what&#x27;s going on so um it&#x27;s it&#x27;s about pulling together everybody and making sure that uh everybody&#x27;s on on the same team and i suspect um 80 plus percentage will be on the same team</div>

The whimsical, ineffective voice, as she calls it. Carter, here&#x27;s the thing. The government, Shannon&#x27;s brought this up, the government is pushing their side of the story actively. They&#x27;ve got an ad campaign right now. I&#x27;ve seen it, I believe, on television, a 30-second spot that they&#x27;re running. Horner&#x27;s mentioned that they&#x27;re putting money behind it. Their campaign focuses on classroom investment, teacher pay raise, and the commitment to labor stability. They haven&#x27;t gone down the... I mean, there&#x27;s obviously a subtext to what Shannon is saying around lazy teachers, public sector workers. They haven&#x27;t explicitly gone there, but they&#x27;re starting to shape public opinion. So what is the scope of the challenge for the ATA here? And how would you kind of anticipate the government&#x27;s next move as a strategist? And like, what would you start thinking about in terms of message on your end? And Shannon, I&#x27;ll come to you with that same question in a second</div>

You know, it&#x27;s not a private corporation that you can just keep your workers solidarity together and hope for the best. This is a PR war as much as it&#x27;s anything else. And the ATA needs to come equipped, recognizing that most of the families that you are impacting are going to be pretty steamed. There are not many families that can accommodate a teacher strike with ease. Especially families of lesser means are really going to be struggling with this teacher strike. And there&#x27;s going to be some bitterness towards teachers. So you must make sure that there is a very solid communication strategy. And I&#x27;m waiting to see it from the ATA. I haven&#x27;t yet seen the ATA&#x27;s communications work. Before</div>

Actually telling the story of what teachers are working with, but doing it in a way that that looks organic but isn&#x27;t, is pushed out much more thoughtfully than that. Plus, a big ad buy in all the traditional places and spaces where the government buys. In the display ads and banners when you&#x27;re trying to read a Calgary Herald or Globe and Mail story. In the YouTube ads, the whole gamut, right?</div>

  <div class="said">It needs to be absolutely everywhere. Of course, the ATA can&#x27;t start advertising like the government has until they have the results of the vote, right? They&#x27;re hamstrung in that way. But I sure should hope that they have got their materials ready to go because they have so many different channels and different types of excellent communicators that the government doesn&#x27;t have. Because the government just has, you know, people like Nate Dorner or Daniel Smith who are at best 50-50 people to carry the message. Teachers have teachers and parents and validators and stories. And they&#x27;ve got enthusiasm and real life on their side. So I sure hope they&#x27;re using it. This</div>

  <div class="said">goes back, I want to jump in on this. This goes back to some of the research that we&#x27;ve done on voice, you know, what the more effective voices are. And Shannon&#x27;s completely right. The peer-to-peer voices are way more efficient and effective than any government voice or corporation voice. Even formalized voices like teachers don&#x27;t perform as well as parents do. So if the ATA is able to put together some super strong communications featuring parents, I think that they&#x27;ll be in a really strong position, more like my 70-30 than Shannon&#x27;s 50-50.</div>

It may even go on, I was going to say postcards, probably won&#x27;t, because we&#x27;ll talk about that in a moment here. Maybe we can talk about your struggles with postcards and literature.

So I think that there&#x27;s always a risk that when there&#x27;s significant labor movements that move together, not necessarily together in coordination, but together just in time, uh that there&#x27;s there can be some pushback and i think that the uh alberta is not noted for its uh you know support of organized labor i would argue erroneously but nonetheless it it it still could backfire very carefully like people could be very angry with the ata and that anger could uh manifest itself in some different ways in a way that i don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re going to be angry with cup w right</div>

And what could that and should that look like? because there is a timing thing here, which is like if you go in and even though we&#x27;re different unions, if you go at it like this will affect us, like, you know, this push, we want to help you be successful so that eventually when we come to the strike, you know, position that we could be successful. How do you kind of see labor solidarity playing out here in the province with the teachers should and all of our conversation today is presuming that by five o&#x27;clock today, this teacher&#x27;s vote to go on strike, right?

So the government wants the end of home delivery, closure of rural mail outlets. They want to bring back the Harper era community mailboxes, which were paused. And then, you know, actively the liberal government actively campaigned on that will end the Harper era community mailboxes. Well, the Carney government is saying, bring that shit back to make these major reforms. You guys are effectively insolvent here. This is after two years of negotiations. The union has rejected the 13% wage increase, demanding 19% instead. So we find ourselves here. Carter, give me the top line. Advantage government, advantage Cup W.</div>

Many of our listeners have probably put no flyers, please, on their mailbox, which actually reduces Canada Post&#x27;s ability to make a profit. You don&#x27;t need it. and on top of that so so canada post has redeveloped itself into a flyer delivery service and a parcel delivery service and the parcel delivery service can be extremely profitable take a look at i don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re familiar zane there&#x27;s this company called amazon they deliver</div>

When you have to send things, And a lot of small businesses do. And a lot of small businesses use Canada Post for their shipping because then they can use free shipping. Otherwise, they don&#x27;t, right? Because it&#x27;s too expensive to send it with a private courier. The second thing is it&#x27;s not just the rural and remote. It&#x27;s also the smaller cities where you&#x27;re not going to get that last mile or like smaller towns. Right. So it&#x27;s like they are, you know, out there, but they&#x27;re there. It&#x27;s basically outside of the big cities. Oftentimes you need Canada Post for that last mile. And that&#x27;s to say nothing of the actual rural and remote, like up north, right, where they use Canada Post for all kinds of reasons and their community post office for all kinds of reasons. So that&#x27;s the second thing. And the whole thing is just fucking sad. Can we just admit that this whole story is just so sad?

I&#x27;ve seen people saying Canada Post shouldn&#x27;t be seeking a profit. It&#x27;s not seeking a profit. It&#x27;s just seeking not to lose handfuls of money every single day. Right? It is losing a fortune every year, and it is not sustainable. So even the changes that are coming down the pipe are minuscule compared to the size of the overall deficit that has been created by Canada Post&#x27;s operations. So I think the regret is the 10 years that Trudeau did nothing.</div>

I&#x27;m just letting you go here, because I&#x27;m just curious how you&#x27;re thinking about this. Frankly, in an election where a lot of people in our two major cities, and Shannon, let&#x27;s appreciate it, but people are not paying attention to municipalities. politics is that fair to say like so is that part of your theory give me your state of race give me your theory of the race give me both carter</div>

Um, Walters and Jaffer, of course, will, uh, dispute that, but we&#x27;ll see at the end. All right. You know, everybody, everybody always has their comments about, about polling and the rest of it. And I don&#x27;t want to get into it, but, um, I do think that we have a very strong path at Edmonton, uh, for, for better edmonton i think that it&#x27;s well on its way i think that in general parties have been uh a challenge they</div>

I would honestly recommend to anybody that they do a quick audit of all the candidates&#x27; social media. I did it a couple of nights ago. And I just don&#x27;t think that anybody&#x27;s got anything vaguely resembling a social media strategy that&#x27;s breaking through. People can be paying for advertising, but</div>

Do you feel like they&#x27;re a liability at this point</div>

I do think that there could be a Venn diagram that we&#x27;ve drawn that has support of housing and support of parties as two very separate circles, which is impacting us in Calgary. because obviously we&#x27;re the party that supports housing. We&#x27;re the only one. And we&#x27;re really struggling with the quote-unquote progressive audience. They&#x27;re the ones that are the hardest to reach, but they&#x27;re the ones who we&#x27;ve developed the policies for.

And in the fall of 2021 was the, like, everybody hates Jason season season I because it was right after uh the best summer ever when a thousand people died uh and so and I remember being on the doors then because around September October I was like well you know what I can I can go out and I can do some canvassing and I hadn&#x27;t been able to because of you know one off and are we allowed to are we not allowed to and so I went out during the municipal anyway just to kind of like you know knock on on like kick tires knock on doors kind kind of thing. And it was amazing to me how that was motivating to people. Their municipal vote was motivated by, and you guys have canvassed this well, on that provincial motivator.</div>

I want to get to Shannon in a second about the NDP, but this has been helpful. A very honest state of the race. Can I get your theory of the race for the next three weeks? We should almost have a double Patreon where we double paywall this next part. But, Carter, what are you looking for? You&#x27;ve mentioned I&#x27;ll throw a couple of ingredients you&#x27;ve thrown at me from a state of the race perspective and tell me if these are part of it because Shannon&#x27;s brought up the campaigning against the province is that your theory of the race the next three weeks you&#x27;ve talked about the last 48 hours is that your theory of the state of the race you don&#x27;t have to give away something that you feel like could jeopardize your campaign you&#x27;ve talked about polling you haven&#x27;t moved in the poll do you need a better poll in any of these jurisdictions what is your theory of the race going forward if you&#x27;d like to share which I think you&#x27;re now mandated to well</div>

And Heather McPherson are in for the NDP, the job of being the leader of this party, which probably includes two years of debt clearance as task number one. What do you make thus far? We can get into the specifics, the branding, the color. We&#x27;ll do a whole sort of, when leaderships happen, we&#x27;ll do a whole sort of like website site, we&#x27;ll run through an audit of socials. We&#x27;ll do that episode. That&#x27;s not this. I wanted to get your quick hit. Now that two candidates are out there, what are you making of this race? What do you make of the dynamics? How do you kind of see the launches going?</div>

Rachel was there. The whole thing And, you know, it was very Edmonton Strathcona, right? Bog standard Edmonton Strathcona. That is not to run it down because here is a person who has a seat, who has held on to it, who knows how to win, who knows how to grow membership, who knows how to raise money like Stink, and who knows what the assignment is in terms of being a partisan. and um and so that is good and it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that she&#x27;s essentially chosen not to compete with avi on the the launch video right where he did a super slick kind of you know like mamdami uh mamdani adjacent kind of launch videos really good uh he is a filmmaker so i would expect it to be good uh and uh and it was uh and you know when you go and look at his actual media appearances as afterwards, way less good.</div>

In a really kind of almost aggressive way. And he was chippy too, you know? I last saw him with Coffin in the CBC, but on CTV he was, and did some really weird stuff with, you know, like attacking Evan Solomon, who used to, you know, host the show. It&#x27;s just like, why?

But he&#x27;s undisciplined in that way. But his video was really good. I haven&#x27;t looked at the numbers on YouTube or elsewhere and how much it&#x27;s traveling. I imagine a fair bit within leftist circles, because when people put it, you know, sent it to me independently or in the various group chats, people were like, oh, this is good.

And it didn&#x27;t split our government, but it gave both opposition parties a nail bat to hit us with that they have not stopped hitting us with, being anti-development and anti-jobs. And this, of course, maps on to a time, you know, in that previous quarter where WTI had fallen to $28 a barrel and we had rapidly escalating unemployment. And the last thing that any Albertan needed to hear from their government was that they thought that they were elected to hand out pink slips. And so it made for conflict. And as a result, I was sort of, because I was environment minister, it was the nexus of the problem to keep Notley out of it, although she made one of the finest speeches. A New Democrat&#x27;s ever made on the floor of that convention and people should look it up and watch it.</div>

I don&#x27;t think it matters. There is an excitement factor in the US right now that certainly comes over on the other side. Do you think that factor will have a point? You could look up Avi Lewis and video number three is him in AOC having a debate on hope and those sort of things. So he&#x27;s got those connections.

  <div class="said">don&#x27;t think so, because, you know, Jeff Meets tried this, too. He tried it for, like, you know, a long time, like eight years, right, to talk about how we&#x27;re going to, you know, change how the price of groceries goes and stuff. And people were not picking it up, not at all. They were responding to affordability arguments that Pallieva was putting before them, which, I mean, he was overpromising on many of those things, but it was still identifiable things that could be done, like ending the carbon tax or GSTM loans or what have you. And so I think Canadians are much more pragmatic than that. The good news is for Heather is that it looks like Rob Ashton is going to enter into the race. He might not be a name that&#x27;s known to folks from the longshoremen. So that&#x27;ll help with some of the kind of, you know, more down-to-earth blue-collar arguments, pushing back against Debbie that she won&#x27;t have to do it.</div>

We&#x27;ll keep talking about the race. Let&#x27;s talk about the party as we close up. What does the party need this race to be between now and March? Now that we&#x27;ve seen the first two candidates, if you&#x27;re the party, I know I&#x27;m asking that in such a genericized way, are you happy with what you&#x27;re seeing thus far? You&#x27;ve got a a couple of candidates. So like that&#x27;s good in some ways, right? Like this is, let&#x27;s be clear, this is the NDP, but this is also a party that doesn&#x27;t have official status right now. So this is two things at the same time. What do you need to see if you&#x27;re the party and what would be successful for you? At least let&#x27;s give it a time frame of the next couple of months.</div>

  <div class="said">Well, in the next couple of months, you want to finish Q4 with a decent fundraising person. It&#x27;s hard to do during a leadership race, which is why this six month timeline is bananas. And, you know, know the kind of the far left got what they wanted out of the structure of it and it&#x27;s too bad because it will hamstring the party but you want to see some some energy and some excitement and some of these you know uh membership</div>

  <div class="said">drives actually meaning a longer term financial health for the party uh just things are really not in good shape uh yeah i mean honestly if you&#x27;re the party you want people to be putting forward things that are relevant uh because the the enemy is not not each other. You know, Heather&#x27;s opponent is not Avi, and Avi&#x27;s opponent is not Feather. Both of their opponents is irrelevance. And so finding ways to, you know, use the House of Commons if you&#x27;re Heather, if you&#x27;re the party, broadly, to use these brinksmanship moments of budget votes and stuff to actually have the relevance would be good.</div>

This is my favorite part. This is not just an Alberta-specific Over, Under, and Lightning round. This is a Danielle Smith-specific Over, Under, and Lightning round. Here&#x27;s what I want to do. I&#x27;m going to give you four things our premier has done over the last two weeks or is going to do based on documents and sources. And I want you to talk about which one of these four is the silliest and which one of these four is the most strategic. strategic. These are all things that we will, between the three of us, will hate in the sense of what is going on. But I want to talk about the silliest and the most strategic. So, Carter, let me start with you first, okay? Danielle Smith won citizenship status on driver&#x27;s licenses, announcing that starting in late 2026, Alberta will require all new and renewed licenses and provincial ID cards to include a citizenship marker.</div>

There is a 100 per dose fee on the COVID-19 vaccine, except for healthcare workers, some seniors and certain vulnerable groups. The premier has defended this move as a response to the federal government no longer covering the vaccine and as a way to prevent waste, nothing to do with some ideology related to it whatsoever. So you got thing number one, citizenship status. Thing number two, the vaccine admin fee.</div>

I was just looking it up and I couldn&#x27;t find how Klein dealt with this when the federal government went in to ratify the Kyoto Protocol back in the early 90s. But there was a Supreme Court decision, I think before we were a country, I think it was the UK, out of the UK Supreme Court back in the 20s, that essentially said, yes, Canada can ratify treaties.</div>

And she can get up and make a 45-minute speech about how she&#x27;s, you know, the queen of standing up to Ottawa and we need somebody to do that. And those are good talking points for her, so great for her. I think in the same vein, though I&#x27;d be strategically silly, as in strategically stupid, is the driver&#x27;s license thing. Because, first of all, I think it&#x27;s going to be a boondoggle with the privatized registries. I think I can hear the whining from here, from the registries on, you know, the cost, you know, how the implementation goes, all of that. You know, they are a bit of a whining sector anyway. So they will whine, absolutely. Number two, it&#x27;s not clear to me if you can opt out because sign me up, I&#x27;ll be opting out, right? If I need to prove my citizenship, I&#x27;ve got documents for that. Yeah. Um, and, uh, so I think it&#x27;ll just piss people off and, uh, uh, it will be one of those things that can&#x27;t, could be used as a very good wedge, uh, by the opposition and going into an area that&#x27;s not strategically smart. It&#x27;s not at all clear to me that, uh, you know, there&#x27;s been some, some, uh, uh, talk about how the, the consensus around immigration is unraveling. It&#x27;s not at all clear to me that that is in fact the case in public opinion. And in particular, a few press people, like you could say to people in any group, oh, have there been too many temporary forward workers or too many international students or even, you know, were our immigration levels too high for the last couple of years and probably get, you know, at least a 50-50 head nod on that wherever in the country. It&#x27;s not clear to me that that then goes to we should withhold services from certain kinds of people, depending on how long they&#x27;ve lived here. I don&#x27;t think the polling on that&#x27;s probably very good. So that is dumb. I think that notwithstanding stuff on the trans issues, I mean, she&#x27;s got a constituency for this.
