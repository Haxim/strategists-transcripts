  <div class="said">guys are crazy um okay let&#x27;s move into our first segment first segment the politics of i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s called the The politics of hail, fire, and floods, the politics of natural disasters, the politics of Mother Nature. Guys, I&#x27;ve been kind of tuned out lately. As you know, I&#x27;ve had my hands full with some other things. But there&#x27;s lots that has happened, especially in recent weeks when it comes to natural disasters across Canada. Massive wildfire in Jasper. There&#x27;s recent flooding in Montreal and across southern Quebec. A big old hailstorm in Calgary. were, what, mid-August, still kind of the big months for wild weather. There&#x27;s also been, not that it&#x27;s a natural disaster, but it has to do with water, the pipe in Calgary, which is still drama around that. So I want to dive into this topic. There&#x27;s kind of different angles that I think are interesting. There&#x27;s political implications, and there&#x27;s different levels of government that this hits. Jasper specifically, you&#x27;re talking about local, provincial, as well as federal. So I&#x27;ve got a bunch of questions. I want to start with the town of Jasper. Residents have been away from their homes for three weeks. They were just told that they can return to the town on Friday. Many don&#x27;t have homes to return to, including the mayor whose home of 67 years was destroyed. Let&#x27;s start with the mayor. Let&#x27;s start, like, you&#x27;re the mayor of this small tourist town.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="284">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
    <span class="ts">4:44</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">how do you approach Friday and do you go in like do you have people giving you a strategy are you just doing what you feel is right like let&#x27;s start there and then there&#x27;s lots uh lots more I want to dive into Carter why don&#x27;t you go ahead well</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="297">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">4:57</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I think that the heading in there with your house destroyed is a really difficult moment of leadership you&#x27;re going to head in and your Your leadership is going to be torn between, do I want to take care of myself and my family, which would be a natural inclination, or am I going to go in and address the needs of the community? And I think that Mayor Ireland is going to probably have some struggles with that because he will be drawn to the natural inclination of taking care of himself and his family. uh well recognizing that the larger community needs them as well um not</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="338">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">5:38</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">everybody lost a home and most of you know the people moving back are moving back into their homes so they&#x27;re not the ones who lost them uh the people who lost their homes will will remain uh you know waiting waiting for for for solutions so i think that the mayor is in a uh a really tough spot not because the mayor&#x27;s done anything wrong or will do anything wrong but just that that balance between our human requirement to take care of ourselves and the leadership requirement the leadership burden uh to take care of a larger community it&#x27;s just going to drag them in two different small two different directions</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="375">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
    <span class="ts">6:15</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">do you think he has people like jasper small i think five five thousand around five thousand is the population and then what triple that of tourists in the summer like Like, does he have, when we&#x27;re talking about a municipality that small, Jasper only became a town recently. Does he have a team around him helping him through that and kind of looking at the different, you could do this, you could do this? Or is it like, it&#x27;s just him?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="400">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">6:40</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">You know, there is definitely a team because the nature of an emergency like this, a disaster like this, is it becomes provincialized and even nationalized because of where it is and there&#x27;s a park. And it is one of those interesting things where we talk about him as though he&#x27;s a leader. And, of course, he is, right? But this is not why you elect a mayor in a town like Jasper, right, to deal with a disaster, once in a generation disaster like this. So the team for the mayor becomes the team that would manage it for the premier, the team that would manage it for the prime minister. And there&#x27;s an awful lot of support and infrastructure, I hope, that is being provided to allow him to be the messenger and carry the message in a way that people in Jasper will understand and resonate, rather than it having to come from a faceless federal official, for example. So the job is really being a conduit, but I suspect on a certain level, he&#x27;s never had such a big team, right? Because of the nature of it and everybody that&#x27;s involved. One of the things I think is interesting and that I&#x27;m going to be looking to see here is if a third of Calgary burned down, there&#x27;s like nowhere for them to go. And it&#x27;s nothing about the size of the city. That&#x27;s the composition of the city. But you&#x27;ve already mentioned it. The population of Jasper can quadruple in the summertime, right? There are other accommodations there. So one of the things that will be interesting to watch, both the tension that it creates and the opportunity it provides, is that there are lodgings in the town of Jasper that are maybe available for some of these people who would otherwise be unhoused, have to live in Hinton or Edson or any of the other centers that are nearby. But what&#x27;s nearby when you&#x27;re in rural areas, right? And that&#x27;s going to create some logistics too, but all</div>

And especially when you&#x27;re dealing with like, this guy has lived there, you know, his entire life. I think the house that is his that burnt down, he grew up like he&#x27;s been there his entire life.

I certainly hope that everybody can be mature about it and work to the benefit of the citizens of Jasper. But we&#x27;ve obviously already seen some smallness on both sides, right? We&#x27;ve seen Danielle Smith suggest that the feds are responsible for this. Maybe they are, maybe they aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s weird to do it during the moment of crisis, though, to suggest that&#x27;s the case. And then say that the federal government would want to rebuild in a fashion that would be unacceptable to the province, based more on rumor, I think, than anything else, innuendo more than anything else. But then we&#x27;ve also seen Justin Trudeau come to town and, through some of his body language, make it pretty clear he doesn&#x27;t have a lot of time for the conservative politicians. Everybody will, well, I suspect many of our listeners will have seen the clip of him effectively blasting past Danielle Smith, offering her hand for a handshake, and the Prime Minister going and shaking the hand of, you know, the other person that&#x27;s in the room first, right? right? Hard to believe that&#x27;s a coincidence. Hard to believe that&#x27;s not even choreographed, right? And considered out. And we don&#x27;t need that shit. Like, we don&#x27;t need that shit from either of them. They both need to be there for the people of Jasper and the people of Alberta more broadly. But that is what it is. And I think that to your question, though, it adds a whole layer of politics that&#x27;s, everyone&#x27;s got their guard up. Everybody&#x27;s suspicious of the other person right and as long as that is the case it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s going to be really tough to to look at a rebuild and not and</div>

You know, the government of Alberta has a staff size that is, you know, 11 times the size of the town itself.

Carter talked about the CAO. Oh, by the way, to Carter&#x27;s point about public services, he&#x27;s almost sharing the keys for each other and saying, if then, Alberta&#x27;s got BC as a backup for communications, and we had all of their passcodes as well. So if a disaster took out one of these provinces, it was the communications team of the other province that had to like log into Twitter and say, hey, BC&#x27;s not here anymore, right? RT, like and subscribe. But yeah, as the mayor with all of these people, and the biggest risk, I think, being confusion, upset expectations, people not knowing what&#x27;s going on, people leaving with different ideas of what&#x27;s supposed to be happening next. As the mayor, you are going to, by merit of your office, be invited to a lot of these meetings, even if you don&#x27;t really have a ton to contribute. Again, I suspect it really depends on how the governments want to manage it. But you can be the person at the end who says, okay, to recap, I just want to make sure we all have the same understanding and reiterate your understanding and watch the people in the room.

Or I guess we&#x27;ll deal with that down the road. Or I don&#x27;t have time for this today. As the mayor, you should be never taking that attitude. You should always be the person who says, okay, I get the sense that you, Danielle, and you, Justin, are thinking about this a bit different. can i clarify what you mean by rebuild main street or whatever it is right and then really forcing people to get very specific about things for your community um because there&#x27;s a lot of kiting that occurs at moments like this is everybody just goes about and tries to do their own thing and if people don&#x27;t trust each other they might be using coded language they might be suggesting they&#x27;re going to do something but picking those words very carefully to not specifically say what they&#x27;re going to do you call them on it you get it out there you get a common understanding i think that would be a great role for the mayor of jasper do</div>

So if you&#x27;ve ever walked past a house and they&#x27;ve got all that wood stacked against the house, not great. If you&#x27;ve got bushes that kind of lead up to the front of the house, dry bushes, dry grass, not great. So if you want to have a fireproof home, you have to remove some of these materials and you have to put them in different places. You have to move them further away. You keep, you know, less logs on your property, those types types of things. And the answer that I came up with, and this is probably why I didn&#x27;t get the contract, the only thing that people are responding to in today&#x27;s world is shame.</div>

And then you&#x27;re going to have people arguing about the left wing and the right wing way to build water pipes to purchase, you know, backup fire trucks to create fire breaks. And I don&#x27;t fucking need that. Like, in some ways, I think we do need to keep this at the administrative level. And what politicians need to do is say it is the municipal government equivalent of just paying your fucking taxes. Nobody loves doing it, but you know, you got to do it. A certain amount of money needs to be set aside for this. And what could really help municipalities in that space is if the higher order of government could mandate a certain requirement for this, maybe even mandate that money goes into a pool for this. And yeah, nobody loves that lack of municipal sovereignty, but the fact of the matter is, if it&#x27;s unglamorous and if nobody wants to do it,</div>

But my advice for any community that&#x27;s going through a disaster like this is this right now, everybody&#x27;s in there. Everybody&#x27;s there for you. There&#x27;s this massive sense of community. Your neighbors are helping you out. You&#x27;re helping your neighbors out. Your government is there. Albertans are sending care packages. Albertans are opening their homes. homes. And there is a moment that hits 12 months, 18 months after the disaster where none of that&#x27;s there anymore, but the problems are still there. Your PTSD from such a traumatic event is there, but the community isn&#x27;t in the same way. You feel this almost hollowness about it here. People need to prepare for the mental health problems to come and realize that this is a marathon in ways that they cannot appreciate right now. It can be really tough picking up up your life after this and after the almost euphoria of the moment of hey we&#x27;re all helping each other out is gone you</div>

  <div class="said">are back in jasper and you break into a cold sweat every time you hear there&#x27;s a fire within a thousand kilometers right and so i think one of the things that everybody needs to be live to whether they&#x27;ve been affected by this or whether they know somebody who&#x27;s been affected by this and certainly any government is you can&#x27;t pull up stakes once the final road is rebuilt, right? There are people there who are going to be dealing with this the rest of their lives. And if you&#x27;re the mayor of a place like Jasper, you need to be elbows up and making sure that there are commitments for those supports for as long as those people need them, when those people need them. These things are wild. And I&#x27;ve never lost my house to a fire. I&#x27;m not going to pretend I understand it. But you get kind of an unfortunate perch when you&#x27;ve worked in some of these government jobs, and you see some of the consequences, and you see some of the pain and the frustration and, you know, the long-term health problems that come and people just need to be ready for that as well. Like we don&#x27;t get to dust our hands and say Jasper&#x27;s rebuilt. That never happens at this point. Jasper, the people in Jasper will never be fully rebuilt from this.

Uh, especially when we&#x27;re talking about the by-elections that are going to happen, I think it&#x27;s on September the 12th.

They put in a lot of progressive goodies, right? This is a standard approach that liberals have used to success since 2015 and what was consequential about this budget is it it didn&#x27;t work right even if you pull on the items individually and people support them and you know we had pharma care in that we had pharma care in that i mean it was watered down pharma care but it&#x27;s something people have been talking about forever people</div>

And the Muslim population has grown significantly in Canada. We talked a bit about the demographics when this was all popping off. And, you know, at one point, three to two, three percent to two percent, there were more Jewish Canadians than Muslim Canadians. Not to be reductive and make this about religion. It&#x27;s certainly not. And it cuts across in a lot of very interesting ways. But now it&#x27;s like nine to three. Like there are three times as many Muslims as Jewish Canadians, as Muslim Canadians as Jewish Canadians. And that is having, that&#x27;s another thing where this changed gradually over time, but you had a moment where all of a sudden it became clear to people that maybe this has created ties to different homelands and different cultures and different connections that really fundamentally changed some of those connections internally in Canada too. too. And the liberals no longer just get to hand wave this away and say, you know, our position is kind of this generic bland support for Israel. It&#x27;s now a much more complicated conversation for them. And that is making it difficult for them to make any additional turns to move on to the, you know, the fight with Pierre Polyev. And you don&#x27;t necessarily have those same tensions in the other two federal parties the the ndp is is very much the the peace party at this particular moment and the conservatives are very much the the staunch supporters of israel at this moment not to say that there&#x27;s not tensions in those groups but they don&#x27;t define the party the way they define the liberals right now which have an</div>
