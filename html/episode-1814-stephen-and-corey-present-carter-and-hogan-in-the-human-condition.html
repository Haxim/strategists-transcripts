  <title>Episode 1814: Stephen and Corey present Carter and Hogan in “The Human Condition” | The Strategists</title>

  
  

  <meta name="description" content="PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about what makes a good speech and what makes a short speech, Nenshi&#39;s first days as leader of the Alberta NDP, Danielle Smith&#39;s war on (and for) trains, and end with an uplifting reflection on life. Did the NDP miss an opportunity to define their leader before the UCP did? What happens when a &#34;proactive communicator&#34; squares up against a &#34;reactive communicator&#34;? And will Stephen&#39;s door code open his garage too? Zain Velji isn&#39;t here and neither is Annalise Klingbeil. Giddy up." />

It was really good matching kind of the audience&#x27;s tolerance for time, audience&#x27;s tolerance for politics, saying the things that made them happy, saying the things that made them laugh. saying it all of it so effortlessly and joyfully that i legitimately believe that danielle smith was thrilled to be speaking every time i saw her speak every single time</div>

She hears what you&#x27;re saying. She responds. It&#x27;s actually spike and volley. There&#x27;s a conversation. And that happens with one person. That happens with a group.

The NDP transfer of power has essentially been the same group that was bringing the same group that brought you the election loss in 2024, 2023 is bringing you the Nenshi shift in 2023. And except, you know, with a few senior leaders having gone, so it&#x27;s even less powerful.

Two years. In fact, you haven&#x27;t won a majority in any election yet, right? You haven&#x27;t won a majority in any election since the first elections you were involved in, right? Let&#x27;s assume that that type of a person existed. Wouldn&#x27;t it be imperative that that type of a leader look at themselves and say, how do I get out of this situation before I I go down to defeat. Like, isn&#x27;t it this idea that there is a good defeat against the candidates that we&#x27;re facing in these types of elections? Isn&#x27;t it time that we started to say, OK, we need these leaders out of the way so that we can start putting better candidates up in the window? And the general population will come to know and adore them in the short period of time. you know in the 15 months between now and the next federal oh I&#x27;m sorry I</div>

That&#x27;s just life. That is absolutely life. And there&#x27;s actually no shame in it. That is the arc that we are all on. It is going to happen to literally every single one of us if we&#x27;re lucky enough to get old. I guess we might not even get old. We will all die. Joe Biden, you are going to die. It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s okay that you are not as good at this as you were four years ago. It doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ve somehow failed as a politician. It means you are a human human being who has hit the limits of the human lifespan because you are 81 years old. And yes, you could live to 90. Yes, you could live to 100.

It happens to all of us. It happens. And And and I think that like the absolute denial that so many in the Democratic Party are bringing into this is not healthy and is actually a little concerning in in like eight different ways. Yeah.
