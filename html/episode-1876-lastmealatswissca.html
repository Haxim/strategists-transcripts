<p data-start="508.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> what i like protected ourselves against the</p>
<p data-start="514.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> he can sign shit i don't know if he can sign he can sign certificates We</p>
<p data-start="516.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> he can sign</p>
<p data-start="518.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> We need the brain trust of this podcast to let us know if Corey can sign shit. Here's</p>
<p data-start="523.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Here's what we do. Here's what we do. We get him to do a certificate of, you know, from the federal government.</p>
<p data-start="525.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> We get him to do</p>
<p data-start="528.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> federal government.</p>
<p data-start="531.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Corey will reach out and</p>
<p data-start="533.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> and use his powers in government. Exactly. He will give you a certificate</p>
<p data-start="534.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Exactly. He will give you a certificate acknowledging your achievement. I</p>
<p data-start="537.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> acknowledging your</p>
<p data-start="539.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> actually am in love with this idea. This is the best.</p>
<p data-start="541.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is the best.</p>
<p data-start="542.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Now, our lack of follow through has been historically noted by our listenership. No, this one's going to be huge.</p>
<p data-start="549.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, this one's going to be huge.</p>
<p data-start="550.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> We're very pumped about this. But we actually want your explanations of how many last meals have</p>
<p data-start="560.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Do people think this podcast</p>
<p data-start="560.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Do people think this podcast</p>
<p data-start="561.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> podcast is scripted, Carter? I</p>
<p data-start="562.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="562.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think</p>
<p data-start="562.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> think</p>
<p data-start="562.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> think</p>
<p data-start="562.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> think</p>
<p data-start="562.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> think they do.</p>
<p data-start="562.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> think they do. LastMeal at Swiss.ca. We will have a form there where you could explain your logic. You know what? I'm going to offer this, and I don't even know if we can do this. We're going to let you upload attachments if you need to. If you need to show your work and you've done it on paper, we</p>
<p data-start="576.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> we will let you upload attachments. attachments carter i think we have to go deeper into the mailbag do you want to do this actually we've already killed nine</p>
<p data-start="581.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> we've</p>
<p data-start="581.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> we've already killed nine minutes we've got nine minutes i've</p>
<p data-start="583.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> got nine minutes i've</p>
<p data-start="585.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> i've answered one question and created probably the greatest promotion that we've ever experienced on the show we might</p>
<p data-start="591.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> show we might do a custom url for every question we might okay look</p>
<p data-start="594.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay look let me let me jump this i'll give you a choice do you want alberta do you want federal or do you want</p>
<p data-start="601.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> municipal because we do have questions from all three literally from this week we've got provincial</p>
<p data-start="605.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> provincial because today is my election day We've got 67</p>
<p data-start="606.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> today is my election day We've got 67 things on here.</p>
<p data-start="608.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay, today's by-election day, so let's do provincial.</p>
<p data-start="610.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> provincial. I've not read these in advance. Westriff Center did a good episode on something. I'm not reading that. What outrageous claims could NDP make that would cause the UCB conservatives to light their hair on fire? Basically, anytime Smith starts a sentence, it's, would you believe? Okay, how about this? There is a few questions around the NDP. Touch</p>
<p data-start="629.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> on that. But I do like this question. Why does it seem like the NDP are doing such a bad job of holding Smith to account? We're seeing more stride in opposition from a former cabinet minister than Nenshi. OK, there's that statement. But then the question is, like, what can opposition forces beyond the NDP do? And maybe we can start there and work back to the NDP because it is by-election night. Is that fair? Sure. Why does it seem like that forces beyond the official opposition and others are also having an issue? And maybe I can expand the scope. Like, why does it feel like this seems to be a thing beyond Alberta as well, Carter, that like we're having a tough time opposing conservatives? We've had some time to soak in what the first hundred days of Trump have looked like. We've had the last couple of years of Danielle Smith.</p>
<p data-start="650.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Why</p>
<p data-start="675.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Give me your starting thoughts here and I'll kind of add to the pile. Well,</p>
<p data-start="678.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think that we don't have a history of opposing the government particularly well in Alberta. Beyond what,</p>
<p data-start="685.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Beyond what, Rachel and the NDP? That</p>
<p data-start="687.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> That was one time, and that was a moment</p>
<p data-start="692.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> in time, if you will.</p>
<p data-start="694.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> An early election call, a tremendously unpopular previous premier, a</p>
<p data-start="694.4"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> An</p>
<p data-start="699.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> a tremendously unpopular premier at the time saying things like, look</p>
<p data-start="703.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> look in the mirror.</p>
<p data-start="705.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> They basically gave away the election to the NDP. And then really</p>
<p data-start="709.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> really it was up in the air whether it would go to the Wild</p>
<p data-start="712.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Wild Rose or the NDP.</p>
<p data-start="714.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I think it was, you know, I've covered 32</p>
<p data-start="717.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> 32 different times that I think that it was Jim Prentiss himself when</p>
<p data-start="720.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> when he chose to look at Rachel Notley and</p>
<p data-start="723.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> and focus his attention on Rachel Notley in the debate. They</p>
<p data-start="725.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> They</p>
<p data-start="725.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> They</p>
<p data-start="725.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> They gave</p>
<p data-start="725.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> They</p>
<p data-start="725.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> gave that that particular outcome. But we didn't have a history of a groundswell prior to that election. No one walked into that election saying, you know what, the opposition really have it this time. People were thinking, oh, Jim Prentiss, he's calling the election. He must know something that we don't know. Everybody was thinking that except the Strategist podcast, which is one of the reasons we started the podcast. We had 526 episodes in the can on the Zune exclusive. Yes, we did. Including episode 500,</p>
<p data-start="757.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yes, we did. Including episode 500, the one I referenced. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="760.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, and then we brought it, we brought it public, much</p>
<p data-start="763.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> much to the chagrin of Chester, who was still angry about it.</p>
<p data-start="767.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> But we brought it public as a result of the NDP</p>
<p data-start="771.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> NDP looking</p>
<p data-start="772.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> looking like they were going to be the ones to, you know, to win and us, us trying to force that, you know, narrative, because we were the only ones talking about it.</p>
<p data-start="782.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Nonetheless, Zane, we don't have a history of opposition from the general population. It's certainly not the same way we would see Ontario, the same way we would see Quebec, the same way we would even see British Columbia. That history doesn't exist. Our organizations, our organizational strength is weak in that particular area because a lot of people are told, if you don't support the government, then just keep your mouth shut,</p>
<p data-start="808.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> right?</p>
<p data-start="809.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> right? Right. And this is a keep</p>
<p data-start="811.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> keep your mouth shut. You know, what did Ralph Klein say? Shoot, shovel, you</p>
<p data-start="816.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, and</p>
<p data-start="817.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> and stay quiet. I can't remember what it was, but basically shoot, shovel and shut up. That's what he said when we had mad cow disease. And that seems to be the mantra of Alberta.</p>
<p data-start="830.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just keep your mouth shut and everything else will work itself out.</p>
<p data-start="835.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, here's an extension of that question for you. Like, who do you think the majority is in Alberta politics? Is it like zealous conservatives or is it more like flabby progressives? Like, do you feel like, you know, and the reason I add those words in front of it is because often</p>
<p data-start="851.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> often it feels like the lion's share of people do</p>
<p data-start="855.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> have an opportunity to open themselves up to the NDP, which is where I think the NDP's overall strength and strategy lies in, which is that the pool is there. But how would you kind of define like the electoral base in our province? I</p>
<p data-start="866.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think I would define it in terms of engagement rather than in terms of ideology. Left</p>
<p data-start="869.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Left and right. I</p>
<p data-start="870.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think that we have a hyper-engaged population of about 30% of the population. 20% is</p>
<p data-start="870.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="876.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> UCP-leaning or conservative, and 10% is progressive-leaning. But</p>
<p data-start="881.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> But it is a relatively small group of hyper-engaged. And even then, I've expanded hyper-engaged to basically include people who think about politics once in a while. Then we have the unengaged, who are by definition not tied</p>
<p data-start="881.2"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But it is</p>
<p data-start="897.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> to any ideology. And then we have the less engaged. And they're in the middle, and they'll move back and forth as required. But they're less</p>
<p data-start="906.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> engaged, and their less engagement goes really far. They're not going to get engaged enough to mount a protest against something in Alberta. We would see, like, what's the biggest protest we've seen in Alberta? A</p>
<p data-start="923.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> couple thousand? 15,000? Not even 15,000. 5,000 people, maybe? I mean, someone should probably go to largestprotestinalberta.ca and put in what their guess of the largest protest is. And we will</p>
<p data-start="938.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> we will know if you have researched it. If</p>
<p data-start="940.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> it. If you've researched it, yeah, because largest protest in alberta.ca feels like something that we should know. Was it Bill 13 that Ralph Klein brought forward? Was that Bill 11?</p>
<p data-start="954.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't remember. Way back in the 1990s.</p>
<p data-start="958.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Might</p>
<p data-start="959.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Might even have been the late 80s. No, 90s. 90s. Because he was elected in 93. So</p>
<p data-start="964.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> So it was in the 90s when he brought in Bill 13 or</p>
<p data-start="967.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> or 11. 11. One</p>
<p data-start="968.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> One of those two.</p>
<p data-start="969.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> But we'll find out because we've got the largest protest in Alberta.ca.</p>
<p data-start="974.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, when you're on the opposition side of things, formally</p>
<p data-start="978.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> formally</p>
<p data-start="978.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> formally</p>
<p data-start="979.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> as the NDP or informally as grassroots movements who don't like what this government is doing, talk to me about where</p>
<p data-start="989.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> your propositional message comes in.</p>
<p data-start="992.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> This is something that I'm trying to maybe impose a point on you, which is, do</p>
<p data-start="997.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> do you feel, because I will ask it as a question, because I'm not sure I have a deep conviction to this point, but I'm going to phrase</p>
<p data-start="1002.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="1002.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> but I'm going to</p>
<p data-start="1002.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> to</p>
<p data-start="1002.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> phrase it just as we kind of bat this around. Do you feel like one of the things is that people have a fatigue towards things they can oppose, A, because they're happening so quickly, and the timeline of their sort of active moment, especially when it seems inevitable that they will happen or pass, is just so narrow trans rights or certain labor union sort of asks for example so that the time horizon because they're just going to there's a post-secondary we didn't really even get to the collective progressive spirit in this province didn't even get to absorb understand protest by the time it was done you</p>
<p data-start="1039.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> know what i mean yeah and and i think so that that that's one part of it but the other part is like the</p>
<p data-start="1045.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> alternatives the lack of solutions promised versus just opposing Do you feel like there's a there there that advocacy groups need to think about, even if they're opposing government legislation or stances, that they may need to start thinking about what gives people hope beyond just standing up and saying no to something, which is proposing an alternative or a solution? Or do you feel like that's not actually how you diagnose the issue or how you propose a strategic shift</p>
<p data-start="1069.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> shift in some way?</p>
<p data-start="1072.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think the strategic idea needs to be presented in a fashion that reflects the selfishness of the voter. And I think that oftentimes when we talk about trans rights, and please don't paint me as anti-trans, that would be very upsetting for me. Trans rights is not an everyone situation, right? LGBTQ is not an everyone situation. You know, most issues aren't an everyone organization. I think I've talked about the Calgary floods before.</p>
<p data-start="1091.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> is not an everyone situation.</p>
<p data-start="1102.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> The Calgary floods happened and 100,000 people are displaced. You know, we have a we have a massive flood, massive damage. Every community</p>
<p data-start="1110.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> community service is stretched to the actual absolute limits. I go to the Home Depot up in West Hills and I'm picking up, you know, stuff that I'm going to need to go in and inspect my house to make sure that it hasn't been damaged in the floods. And because we were evacuated, we were taken out of our homes and people</p>
<p data-start="1131.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> people are buying flowers, bedding flowers. right people are are plant doing their planters they're they're trying to make sure that their house looks pretty like what the fuck right like 100</p>
<p data-start="1144.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> 000 people out of 1.2 million were just were displaced one out of every 12 people had a hat were impacted by this but the 11</p>
<p data-start="1154.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> out of 12 people didn't give a fuck right</p>
<p data-start="1157.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> right and it didn't impact them it didn't change their lives and And they were still making sure that their bedding flowers were, you know, put in nicely so that their house would look pretty.</p>
<p data-start="1157.5"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and it</p>
<p data-start="1168.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know, they were just fresh rain. So</p>
<p data-start="1171.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> So you're allowed to plant.</p>
<p data-start="1172.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know. I mean, this is you've got to you've got to instill something to the to the</p>
<p data-start="1179.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> selfishness of the of the people. And it's selfishness or is it hope, Carter? No, like this is what I'm. No, it's not hope.</p>
<p data-start="1185.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I mean, everybody. I mean, hope has been used. We've seen Barack</p>
<p data-start="1189.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Obama and Bill Clinton both use some variant of hope, but</p>
<p data-start="1193.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> but we've also seen lots of people fail on hope.</p>
<p data-start="1196.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> What do you think ambition</p>
<p data-start="1197.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> ambition then fits in?</p>
<p data-start="1198.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Where do you think, like, where do you think, you know, if we're proposing trans rights, sorry, if we're opposing government legislation on their anti-trans legislation, that's a better way to put it. That's probably</p>
<p data-start="1207.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> to put it. That's probably a better way of putting it. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1209.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> it. Yeah. What is what</p>
<p data-start="1212.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> is the hope there? What is the ambition there? Like it's versus being like, let's not do this.</p>
<p data-start="1216.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> It's almost seems like progressives in today's environment have been become de facto defenders of the status quo, that</p>
<p data-start="1222.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> that they're trying to be like, keep everything the same, which has a bit of like historical irony, considering progressives are the one trying to advance the cause not to stick with the status quo. But we've almost been stuck, forced</p>
<p data-start="1233.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> forced into the position of defending rather than actually proposing what the future should look like.</p>
<p data-start="1240.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think that progressives are struggling right now. There was a lot of achievement that occurred in the 2000s, 2010s that is starting to backslide in the 2020s. I talked about</p>
<p data-start="1253.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> about that as progress that wasn't banked, progress that felt like it was…</p>
<p data-start="1259.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Or</p>
<p data-start="1259.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Or it's just the ebb and flow of a pendulum. You think so? I absolutely think so. I think that when you take a historical look on this type of thing, you see great strides forward, followed by sometimes micro steps backwards and sometimes significant steps backwards. You see the introduction of the freedom of the press, the removal of propaganda and control of the federal government in</p>
<p data-start="1259.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Or it's just the ebb and flow</p>
<p data-start="1266.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> this type of thing, you</p>
<p data-start="1287.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> in the 1940s to the openness of the 1950s, And</p>
<p data-start="1290.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> And that is then met with the McCarthy era.</p>
<p data-start="1292.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> So, you know, like little</p>
<p data-start="1294.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> steps, little steps forward, little steps backward. You know, it takes decades for Reagan's changes to the to the Broadcast Standards Act to to to really destroy</p>
<p data-start="1309.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> television</p>
<p data-start="1311.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> television news, radio news, radio, television as we know it. and</p>
<p data-start="1316.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and ultimately</p>
<p data-start="1317.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> leading to the nightmare that we're in now. I mean, I'm not sure, Zane, that we can say that this is anything but the normal ebb and flow of a step forward and two steps back, sometimes two steps forward, one step back. This feels like it's</p>
<p data-start="1336.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's a smaller subset that's been attacked, which doesn't in</p>
<p data-start="1341.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> in any way shape our mind to make it better, better</p>
<p data-start="1344.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> better but the</p>
<p data-start="1345.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> win is the the two steps forward one step back i think is where we are right now i</p>
<p data-start="1352.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> tend to disagree with that i think i think some of the ways that some progressive things have been sold in recent years have tried to capture progress quickly which is never a bad thing uh if you're bringing folks along but i feel like a lot of the backslide we are currently experiencing on a number of issues diversity issues trans rights etc is maybe because um in part, not to say that those that want to backslide it do not have nefarious agendas. Some of them certainly seem to. But in part, it's because I don't think enough people were brought along and felt like they had a stake in the issue, or they had an understanding of it. They're almost kind of told that this is the new reality.</p>
<p data-start="1392.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> And I think any political movement that, movements, plural, that says this is the new reality without bringing folks along, has that risk of folks kind of saying, okay, once the backslide gets here, maybe that backslide was more representative of my views, or because I wasn't brought along on the original decision, I'm</p>
<p data-start="1413.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm going to naturally kind of go along with the backslide. I think that's good progress that as in banks looks like. I'm not saying that's the problem that ails the NDP, to be clear. But I do think that is a broader sort of Western democracy issue that many are feeling right now, which is, we seem to have made great progress, Even if you look at the last five years on the issue of diversity, equity, and inclusion as a construct, great</p>
<p data-start="1433.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> great progress in the first two years after 2020, and then a tremendous backslide starting with what happened in the US thereafter. I think that's a good representative example of things</p>
<p data-start="1442.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> people felt like they had to do versus things people felt like they were bought into and were pushing something for some success. I think you're giving</p>
<p data-start="1449.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think you're giving people too much credit. I think that people do not pay attention the way that you're describing it. I think that the</p>
<p data-start="1452.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> do not pay</p>
<p data-start="1457.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> greatest challenge for any opposition party, any government, any social</p>
<p data-start="1461.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> social advocacy group is</p>
<p data-start="1464.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> is getting people to give a fuck for longer than 15 or 20 minutes. And as soon as it starts to feel like it disadvantages them or that they're not part of the majority, they</p>
<p data-start="1475.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> they slide backwards. I mean, and this is the challenge</p>
<p data-start="1477.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> challenge is that a large portion of people are making their decision not because they have a strongly held position on it, but</p>
<p data-start="1477.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> challenge</p>
<p data-start="1485.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> but because they are part of the majority and they want to be on the side that wins.</p>
<p data-start="1489.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know, I've seen that in virtually every election that I've worked on. You</p>
<p data-start="1489.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="1490.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="1490.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="1495.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, people go, oh, who's the winner going to be? who's winning right</p>
<p data-start="1498.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> right like that and and that becomes one of the biggest motivators right go</p>
<p data-start="1504.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> back to 2015 looks like rachel notley was the one who was threatening um jim</p>
<p data-start="1510.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> jim prentice ergo everybody moves to rachel notley viability</p>
<p data-start="1513.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> viability question right people more</p>
<p data-start="1514.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> right people</p>
<p data-start="1515.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> more more than viability it's about who who's</p>
<p data-start="1518.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> who's the winner because i want to be on the side of the winner that's how shallow the decision making is come</p>
<p data-start="1521.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> shallow the</p>
<p data-start="1523.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> come with me then to new york city right now you've been following what's happening with Zoran Mamdani?</p>
<p data-start="1527.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, yeah. You</p>
<p data-start="1529.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> actually have not. No. You have no idea. You don't know what's going on. Give me one sentence</p>
<p data-start="1531.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> No. You</p>
<p data-start="1532.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Give me one sentence of background and we'll see if I got one fact for it. Democratic</p>
<p data-start="1536.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Democratic Socialists that could win on the seventh ballot against Cuomo tomorrow night</p>
<p data-start="1540.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> in the Democratic primary. Oh, okay. Yeah, no, I'm not paying attention.</p>
<p data-start="1540.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> in the Democratic primary. Oh, okay. Yeah, no, I'm not paying attention.</p>
<p data-start="1542.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> A lot of propositional messaging. A lot of, like, you know, working class messaging, trying to reown that overall sort of narrative. I think it's a fascinating example. I want to move on, though, to tonight, Carter. Carter.</p>
<p data-start="1555.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Let's use tonight and tomorrow as a reset point for the NDP. Not a reset, but like a new chapter because Nahid Nenshi will get a seat</p>
<p data-start="1555.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Let's use tonight</p>
<p data-start="1558.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Not</p>
<p data-start="1562.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> in the legislature. Really?</p>
<p data-start="1564.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Really? Based</p>
<p data-start="1564.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Based on the election outcome of Edmonton Strathcona, which we know.</p>
<p data-start="1567.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> There's a by-election in Olds, which</p>
<p data-start="1570.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> which the Alberta Republican Party is playing in. And then there's this bellwether,</p>
<p data-start="1570.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> which the Alberta</p>
<p data-start="1574.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> bellwether, lack thereof. Don't know if it's going to be close. Don't know if it's going to be an NDP outright re-secure with</p>
<p data-start="1581.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> with decent margins as they won last time in edmonton ellerslie</p>
<p data-start="1584.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> what what do you think the impacts of tonight are for the ndp and then flash forward for the ndp for me in terms of what you feel like they need to do if if tonight tomorrow is considered to be a new act for them well let's make sure i'm getting a seat with not now getting a seat yeah</p>
<p data-start="1594.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> well let's make sure i'm getting</p>
<p data-start="1597.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i mean let's take let's take uh old stittsbury three hills right off the table right yes</p>
<p data-start="1601.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> yes that's that that does not implicate them in that same way that is correct unless you just unless you disagree unless you feel like vote percentage or something Something, is that something you're looking at there? Nothing.</p>
<p data-start="1602.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> not implicate</p>
<p data-start="1603.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> unless</p>
<p data-start="1611.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Nothing.</p>
<p data-start="1611.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="1612.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I don't</p>
<p data-start="1612.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't expect them to increase their vote percentage. I</p>
<p data-start="1615.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't expect them to increase their vote total. I think that it will be a UCP victory with the Alberta Republicans higher than anybody would like.</p>
<p data-start="1625.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> What does that</p>
<p data-start="1625.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> What does that mean, 20s?</p>
<p data-start="1627.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm hearing 30.</p>
<p data-start="1628.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p data-start="1630.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Really? That's what I'm hearing.</p>
<p data-start="1632.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Now,</p>
<p data-start="1632.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Now, am I wrong? I wish I had this in front of me. Not a prediction. Is</p>
<p data-start="1633.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> had this in front of me. Not a prediction.</p>
<p data-start="1634.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Is</p>
<p data-start="1635.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Is this the same geographic territory that once had a separatist seat in the by-election? It is. okay so you know that i'm glad you do okay</p>
<p data-start="1638.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> seat in the by-election? It</p>
<p data-start="1641.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay so there is a history clearly here but 30 is wild to me like does let me tell you this or do you tell me this if that's 30 does</p>
<p data-start="1650.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> that become the story of the night oh</p>
<p data-start="1652.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh absolutely unless ellerslie goes blue ah</p>
<p data-start="1656.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> ah fair right</p>
<p data-start="1657.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> right if ellerslie goes to the ucp then then it becomes the story because the ndp collapsed so</p>
<p data-start="1660.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> then then it becomes the story because</p>
<p data-start="1663.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> so we could have a story tonight of of an NDP loss where they've won last time, last general election. Or it could be the separatist narrative comes right back at us and just drives in where we talk about Daniel Smith's referendum, what she's playing with fire on, et cetera, et cetera. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1681.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, and then the idea of an early election, right? Don't both</p>
<p data-start="1686.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Don't both of them give you that early election sort of landing spot? I don't know, for lack of a better term. I think that if</p>
<p data-start="1694.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think that if Ellerslie goes to the UCP and the Republican Party gets over 30 percent, we're going to the polls in the fall of 2025.</p>
<p data-start="1705.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> You mean in a matter of months?</p>
<p data-start="1707.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. And we called on September the 8th.</p>
<p data-start="1708.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> on September the 8th. How would you frame that premise for her? An assailable, what mandate is she trying to capture? I</p>
<p data-start="1713.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think that she needs a brand new mandate given the Donald Trump. There's a brand new government in Ottawa. There's a Donald Trump issue. There's a separatist issue. Now, the fact that she stoked the fires doesn't mean she can't campaign against separatism. She needs to campaign against separatism. Ironically,</p>
<p data-start="1729.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> campaign against separatism. Ironically, wear Team Canada before the NDP get a chance to do so. Yep. And</p>
<p data-start="1734.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yep. And because they want to- How much of a risk is</p>
<p data-start="1734.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> because they want to- How much of a risk is that to you, by the way, right now, that she has this opportunity to both engineer,</p>
<p data-start="1740.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> engineer, not engineer, let me be,</p>
<p data-start="1744.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> partially engineer and give voice to, while lowering the bar, the separatist movement, and</p>
<p data-start="1751.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> then still continue to, not continue to, but then just find a Canada flag in the recycling bin and be like, oh, by the way, I was always this. I'm obviously partisan on this issue, so I'm trying to be as balanced as I can, but she's kind of doing a version of that.</p>
<p data-start="1757.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm obviously</p>
<p data-start="1763.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, absolutely she's doing a version of that.</p>
<p data-start="1765.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I mean, this is most arsonists, right? I lit a fire, but I called the fire department. I wanted to see how it all came out. I mean, she's the arsonist in this story. By</p>
<p data-start="1775.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> she's the arsonist</p>
<p data-start="1777.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> By the way, I'm anti-fire sort of thing. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1780.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I've been anti-fire since from the beginning. I called the fire department. Sure, I lit the fire, but I called the fire department, you know, so I'm anti-fire. She's going to be the one who stoked the separatist movement, who gets to stand up and say, I am saving us from the separatists. And she can't have 30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent. So</p>
<p data-start="1783.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> called the fire</p>
<p data-start="1787.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1787.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know, so</p>
<p data-start="1806.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> So tell me this. this tell me this yeah</p>
<p data-start="1808.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah um</p>
<p data-start="1808.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> um that</p>
<p data-start="1810.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> bad party the alberta republican separatist movement gets their 25 to 30 tonight uh</p>
<p data-start="1816.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> the ndp win ellerslie yeah does</p>
<p data-start="1819.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> does she need ellerslie in order to make her case she doesn't right</p>
<p data-start="1823.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> she's probably more threatened by 25 percent or 30 percent from the republicans than she's worried about edmonton staying orange yeah</p>
<p data-start="1834.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="1834.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> right now she knows that she can win calgary in</p>
<p data-start="1837.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> in a much larger way than she won calgary in uh in the last election in 20 was it 2023 yes so she she knows she can win calgary um it's sure it's two years early and the last person who called an election early in alberta got his ass handed to him but</p>
<p data-start="1845.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> yes so she she knows</p>
<p data-start="1856.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="1858.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> now all signals are go um</p>
<p data-start="1860.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> um if</p>
<p data-start="1861.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> if she makes a case that she needs a new mandate to deal with uh prime minister carney um and to deal with the separatists i think that she's got a clear path to having an election in uh september early october of 2025 which is a disaster for municipal elections</p>
<p data-start="1880.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> um an absolute disaster tell</p>
<p data-start="1882.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> tell me about um tell</p>
<p data-start="1885.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> me about the ndp playbook here can you write a few bullet points for them based on some of the scenarios that we see tonight so like you can Can you help the NDP out? Scenario A is,</p>
<p data-start="1895.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> and I'm going to call this the likely scenario, even though I don't have inside intel, which is that they win back Ellerslie and the Strathcona NAD's going to win,</p>
<p data-start="1902.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> to win, and</p>
<p data-start="1902.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> and this gets that 20% to 30% in holds.</p>
<p data-start="1906.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> holds. Yeah. And scenario B is they lose</p>
<p data-start="1909.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> lose Ellerslie and that 20% to 30% still holds.</p>
<p data-start="1912.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm just going to keep that number for the Republican Party because I don't know where to oscillate it, but I just, a strong showing that is gets people to look twice. Let's call it that, right? That's what that 20% to 30% is, as we've discussed.</p>
<p data-start="1912.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm just going</p>
<p data-start="1923.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Give me some strategic bullet points for Scenario A and Scenario B for the NDP here. Scenario</p>
<p data-start="1928.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Scenario A</p>
<p data-start="1928.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> A</p>
<p data-start="1928.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> A is the one where they</p>
<p data-start="1928.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> they win, Ellerslie. Scenario B is where they lose it. Do they shift the attention straight to republicanism? Do they take any seconds of their own? Do they talk about... Give me some thoughts here on their W and their L tonight. I</p>
<p data-start="1941.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think that if they win, Ellerslie, they got to talk about themselves as the natural opposition to the separatist movement.</p>
<p data-start="1947.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yes. They</p>
<p data-start="1947.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> They are the real opposition to the separatist movement. They cannot believe how much this has been stoked by Danielle Smith and how quickly it's happened. They are Captain Canada. You know, they are the ones wrapping themselves in the Canadian and the Alberta flags. They're</p>
<p data-start="1961.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> They're the ones who are going to make sure that</p>
<p data-start="1964.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> that the Alberta Republicans are not a force in the next election in 2027.</p>
<p data-start="1969.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> That needs to be their talking points. They need to make sure that they're strong</p>
<p data-start="1974.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> strong and that they come down to the Calgary Stampede with</p>
<p data-start="1979.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> significant presence. and</p>
<p data-start="1981.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and significant activity so</p>
<p data-start="1983.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> so that everybody sees everybody everywhere there's</p>
<p data-start="1983.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> that everybody</p>
<p data-start="1986.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> there's been a ongoing complaint of where's nahid uh</p>
<p data-start="1990.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh he needs to be in</p>
<p data-start="1992.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> fairness to him he</p>
<p data-start="1993.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> he is very good at stampede he</p>
<p data-start="1995.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> will</p>
<p data-start="1995.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> will be highly highly visible during stampede he knows how to do 100</p>
<p data-start="1999.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> 100 150 events in 14 days</p>
<p data-start="2003.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> he's he's great at it so he needs to just do</p>
<p data-start="2006.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> do that and</p>
<p data-start="2007.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> and scale</p>
<p data-start="2008.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> scale that out with</p>
<p data-start="2008.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> with the</p>
<p data-start="2008.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> with the</p>
<p data-start="2009.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> the rest of</p>
<p data-start="2009.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> of that team yeah</p>
<p data-start="2009.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah OK, so that's the win strategy. The win is you don't take a victory lap on Ellerslie. You're supposed to win anyways. You then take the Canada flag and you say, we're not going to let her take this. Like if they give that up to her, so to speak, or let her take it, that's a strategic L there. They need to grab that flag and say, we're the natural defenders of this province in this country on a wedge that the majority. OK, does</p>
<p data-start="2032.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> that strategy change, Carter, if they lose Ellerslie tonight? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2034.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, because they'll be weaker. They'll</p>
<p data-start="2036.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> be weaker. They won't be able to stand up and say we are the natural government. You know, we are the ones who can stand up and pound</p>
<p data-start="2043.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> our chests, say that we are the ones who can oppose the</p>
<p data-start="2047.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="2047.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the separatist movement. The truth of the matter is that they will be weakened.</p>
<p data-start="2053.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> So they need to, in</p>
<p data-start="2055.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> that particular case, they need to say, we are going to undertake a significant re-evaluation of our positions, a significant re-evaluation of how we're communicating with Calgarians and Edmontonians and the people of Alberta. And we're going to come back in six weeks at the beginning of August or the middle</p>
<p data-start="2079.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> middle of August. And we're going to have a strong,</p>
<p data-start="2081.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> strong,</p>
<p data-start="2082.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> strong, we're going to begin NDP 2.0 under Nahed Nenji.</p>
<p data-start="2089.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Publicly acknowledged reset.</p>
<p data-start="2092.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think it's the only way. I think that if you pretend that you're strong when you're actually weak, it's a huge mistake.</p>
<p data-start="2093.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> think that if you</p>
<p data-start="2099.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> But recognize that you have six weeks. You can do a reset in six weeks. We've</p>
<p data-start="2105.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> We've seen we've seen wilder shit in Canadian politics. There's</p>
<p data-start="2108.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> There's</p>
<p data-start="2108.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There's</p>
<p data-start="2108.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> There's</p>
<p data-start="2108.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There's</p>
<p data-start="2108.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> There's rumors</p>
<p data-start="2108.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> rumors that they're they're bringing in some really solid, you know, organizational structures and some really solid organizational staff. If they're doing that and they have the ability to stand up and say, this is where we're going, then</p>
<p data-start="2124.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think that that they can do really well in six weeks. And in six weeks, you know, two weeks without a stampede. Why</p>
<p data-start="2130.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> without a stampede. Why six weeks? Why are you giving him six weeks? Is this just an arbitrary number? or are you tethering it to something?</p>
<p data-start="2135.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> something? It needs to be done before the beginning of September.</p>
<p data-start="2137.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> I hear you because you're looking at that early election. Because</p>
<p data-start="2140.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because the early election's coming three weeks after your six weeks. Fair</p>
<p data-start="2143.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> enough, right.</p>
<p data-start="2144.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right.</p>
<p data-start="2145.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I would do a brand shift. You're</p>
<p data-start="2147.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> not going to be the NDP anymore.</p>
<p data-start="2150.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, talk to me about that bit more. I'm not into that, but personally, as you can see, I react to that.</p>
<p data-start="2155.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> But</p>
<p data-start="2155.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> But I'm</p>
<p data-start="2155.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> But</p>
<p data-start="2155.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> But I'm more than willing to listen, Carter. What are you talking about here? Because when I hear brand shift, I'm not hearing brand change. And maybe I felt like I heard brand change. So I'll let you explain it rather than me emoting my reaction to it well your brand</p>
<p data-start="2159.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Because when I hear brand</p>
<p data-start="2160.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> brand</p>
<p data-start="2168.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> well your brand first of all isn't working right</p>
<p data-start="2170.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right if you've lost ellerslie you your brand is broken right</p>
<p data-start="2174.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> so let's be clear no one's buying your product anymore sure</p>
<p data-start="2177.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you won strathcona but if you you know if</p>
<p data-start="2179.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you lose if you won strathcona with anything less than 65 percent um you're losing strathcona like you've lost a significant amount of okay keep going</p>
<p data-start="2186.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> a significant amount of okay keep going keep going i'll oppose my objections in a second your</p>
<p data-start="2188.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'll oppose my</p>
<p data-start="2190.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> your brand isn't working right</p>
<p data-start="2191.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> right so take that as step one step</p>
<p data-start="2194.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Step two, it used to be the, instead of the Alberta New Democratic Party, it used to just simply be the New Democrats.</p>
<p data-start="2201.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> When Pam Barrett was the leader, it was the New Democrats. It was the Alberta New</p>
<p data-start="2203.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Democrats. It was the Alberta New Democrats, yeah. It was just, no,</p>
<p data-start="2204.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> It was just, no, it was just the New Democrats. There</p>
<p data-start="2207.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> was no Alberta tagged to the front, back. Well, that's what you're</p>
<p data-start="2209.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Well, that's what you're going after, not the, okay, sorry, sorry. I thought you were going after the party aspect, not the, okay, keep going. So I would rename,</p>
<p data-start="2210.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> not the, okay,</p>
<p data-start="2213.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> keep going. So I would rename, or I would come out of this as the Alberta Democrats.</p>
<p data-start="2219.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, do</p>
<p data-start="2220.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> do you want to be associated with the Democrats in the US? Absolutely,</p>
<p data-start="2223.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Absolutely, I do.</p>
<p data-start="2223.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Fuck, man, that is a failing- you know why they</p>
<p data-start="2226.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know why they get 45 of the vote and you get fuck you and you lose ellerslie oh</p>
<p data-start="2231.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh man</p>
<p data-start="2231.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> man i i</p>
<p data-start="2234.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> no i don't agree with that well i don't think it's strategic i don't think it's right strong enough like they're losing ellerslie</p>
<p data-start="2236.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> well i don't think it's strategic i don't think it's right strong enough like they're losing ellerslie carter we've seen they're losing ellerslie</p>
<p data-start="2242.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> seen they're losing ellerslie name the last successful political rebrand in this country the</p>
<p data-start="2247.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> the bc united oh</p>
<p data-start="2248.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> oh perfect yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="2249.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2250.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2250.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah yeah rebrand a shift in name is essential in this province. I</p>
<p data-start="2251.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah rebrand a</p>
<p data-start="2256.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> may have agreed with you three</p>
<p data-start="2259.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> years ago. Damn right. I don't agree with you now. I really don't. Well, I mean, you</p>
<p data-start="2260.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Damn</p>
<p data-start="2260.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> Damn</p>
<p data-start="2260.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Damn right.</p>
<p data-start="2261.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> right. I don't agree with</p>
<p data-start="2263.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I mean, you being wrong, though, isn't necessarily new.</p>
<p data-start="2265.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> necessarily new.</p>
<p data-start="2267.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> 10 minutes, we're going to get through three questions. You know why? Because we've got 60 questions. Did we</p>
<p data-start="2269.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> questions. Did we answer any questions so far?</p>
<p data-start="2274.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> No, I think we've given people great things to think about, Carter. Because</p>
<p data-start="2277.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because I'm not sure that we've</p>
<p data-start="2278.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> we've</p>
<p data-start="2278.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> we've</p>
<p data-start="2278.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> we've answered any questions. They've</p>
<p data-start="2279.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> They've annoyed me, and</p>
<p data-start="2282.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> now I'm thinking, you know what, I don't like these questions.</p>
<p data-start="2285.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, I'm going to put these two together because I like these questions. This is a good question.</p>
<p data-start="2289.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Is there an effective way to pressure elected MLA from stepping away from their party line? And I'm going to tag in a second question here. What</p>
<p data-start="2298.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> would it take for Peter Guthrie to be an effective disruptor? You could see how those are related, right?</p>
<p data-start="2302.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> So maybe let's focus on the first part first, which is, and I'm assuming this means government MLA, although this person has not said that. But they do have a follow-up, which is if you speak to them in person, meet and greet, and have only a couple of minutes' time, what's the move? That's a good Stampede question, right? You run into a bunch of these folks during Stampede. How do you get them to have sympathy and then go as far as stepping away from their party line? That's the question that is asked here.</p>
<p data-start="2329.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> I think</p>
<p data-start="2331.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> I know where you're going to go, but I'm going to give you a shot at it anyways.</p>
<p data-start="2334.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Assume sympathy with the individual.</p>
<p data-start="2336.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yep.</p>
<p data-start="2337.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> So you start off with, I know you're in a difficult spot.</p>
<p data-start="2341.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yep. I</p>
<p data-start="2341.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I know that you</p>
<p data-start="2343.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you and I have agreed on lots of different things.</p>
<p data-start="2345.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yep. And</p>
<p data-start="2345.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And so immediately you're bringing them over to your side. Yes.</p>
<p data-start="2348.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p data-start="2348.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yes. And</p>
<p data-start="2348.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yes. And</p>
<p data-start="2349.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="2349.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I have one question for you. How</p>
<p data-start="2353.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> is it that you're able to stand with Danielle in the face of blank, the</p>
<p data-start="2357.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> the coal mining, in the face of the- Trans rights. Trans rights. In the face of- Post-hack funding or whatever. Indigenous. The separatist question. Another</p>
<p data-start="2361.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Trans rights. Trans rights. In the face of- Post-hack funding or whatever. Indigenous. The separatist</p>
<p data-start="2367.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Another big one, yes.</p>
<p data-start="2367.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> big one, yes. The Alberta pension plan.</p>
<p data-start="2370.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Whatever the situation, whatever you want to do, but you have to start off by bringing them over to your side to begin with. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="2377.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2377.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p data-start="2377.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. So, you</p>
<p data-start="2380.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, who should we pick on? Searle Turton, right? Our good friend Searle. Our good friend Searle.</p>
<p data-start="2384.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Searle. Our good friend Searle. Comes down and</p>
<p data-start="2384.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Comes down and I say, Searle, we've agreed on so many different things. How do you stand? How do you stand with Danielle when</p>
<p data-start="2393.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> it comes to the question of separation? Do</p>
<p data-start="2395.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Do you go after them personally? Like, this is, I'm glad this person asked this. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2398.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> glad this person asked this. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2400.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> like, but do you kind of say, like, I thought you were better than this? I've always heard people kind of say, like, you know, I thought, like, almost shaming them into it. Where does, you</p>
<p data-start="2410.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> know, obviously you don't want to do that publicly, but if this person's question is about a private conversation, which I like the setup here, how</p>
<p data-start="2416.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> personal can you get around someone's values and almost like, I hate to use this word, but I think it's an appropriate one, their morality, right? Like, I thought you were better than this, right? I've</p>
<p data-start="2424.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> right? I've had these conversations a number of times.</p>
<p data-start="2427.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> And have you used terminology like that? I have used values-based, morality-based questions because ultimately the hardest thing for an individual to walk away from is his or her own values, right?</p>
<p data-start="2428.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> And have you used terminology like that? I</p>
<p data-start="2432.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> because</p>
<p data-start="2432.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> because</p>
<p data-start="2439.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> right? They will be accused</p>
<p data-start="2439.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> They will be accused of not being consistent with them.</p>
<p data-start="2442.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, none</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> none of us are consistent with our values, but to have an obvious inconsistency pointed out is challenging.</p>
<p data-start="2450.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> challenging.</p>
<p data-start="2450.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> challenging.</p>
<p data-start="2450.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> challenging.</p>
<p data-start="2451.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> challenging. It's a challenging moment.</p>
<p data-start="2455.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="2455.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="2455.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> And was this actually a question?</p>
<p data-start="2457.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. It was a good question. Wow, out of 67, that's not bad. One good question.</p>
<p data-start="2462.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> One good question. What does Guthrie need to do? Let's end it here.</p>
<p data-start="2465.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> What does Guthrie need to do? To be an effective</p>
<p data-start="2466.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> To be an effective pest. I'm using the word pest, but I like it.</p>
<p data-start="2469.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> He's</p>
<p data-start="2469.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> He's just got to start implying that he knows stuff, that he knows things that have occurred behind the scenes.</p>
<p data-start="2476.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's what the media are looking for. They don't want just another person standing up and saying, there's something that smells bad about this deal deal with the corrupt care right</p>
<p data-start="2490.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> guthrie's got to be able to stand up and say i was in the room i</p>
<p data-start="2493.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> saw what was bad about the corrupt you know about this this contract i see the lack of morals i see the lack of integrity that's why i left i</p>
<p data-start="2504.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> have the</p>
<p data-start="2506.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> the chits i have the receipts that's what he needs to be imply if he's going to be the most successful uh disruptor that he possibly can be so</p>
<p data-start="2515.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> so carter here we go over</p>
<p data-start="2517.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> under in our lightning round no no i</p>
<p data-start="2518.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> i</p>

<p data-start="2520.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> oh</p>
<p data-start="2521.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh yeah you've got a question for it put it put it in the over under</p>
<p data-start="2522.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> put it put it in the over under lightning</p>
<p data-start="2522.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> lightning round</p>
<p data-start="2523.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> round no no it's before the</p>
<p data-start="2523.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> no no it's before the hell it's a bigger question than that zane okay</p>
<p data-start="2527.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay fine well i'm just trying to give you their tight 45 but</p>
<p data-start="2530.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> but i guess neither of us are shannon so we've got all we got all the time in</p>
<p data-start="2532.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> we got all the time in the world fucking</p>
<p data-start="2533.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> fucking lay it on me like i've</p>
<p data-start="2534.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i've had two phone calls during this two i mean i feel pathetic right now like that's just nothing um</p>
<p data-start="2539.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's just nothing</p>
<p data-start="2541.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> um here's my question for you what is the state of the race in the the calgary municipal elections in 2025 what's your read on it i'm i'm obviously biased but you're not biased you're just sitting there some guy hanging out you're watching this watching things unfold it's</p>
<p data-start="2555.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> watching things unfold it's</p>
<p data-start="2556.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's a really good question and i don't know what it's june it's june so i</p>
<p data-start="2562.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> think this will come down to what i call a classic realtor election which</p>
<p data-start="2566.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> is classic</p>
<p data-start="2566.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> classic realtor election real</p>
<p data-start="2568.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> real which is just like real to real realtor</p>
<p data-start="2569.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> which is just like real to real realtor realtor with the with the real don't forget the copyright and the trademark there yeah they're not happy when you don't use that carter um if</p>
<p data-start="2572.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> real don't forget</p>
<p data-start="2575.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah they're</p>
<p data-start="2580.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> man everything else has been everything else has been overshadowing municipal or the anticipation of municipal for a long time we were talking about the overlap of federal on municipal yeah provincial referendum on municipal provincial referendum potentially tagged on election provincially over municipal we just talked about that right so municipal is always kind of like the last thing to kind of get anyone's attention we're</p>
<p data-start="2592.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> provincial</p>
<p data-start="2602.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> we're in june and i feel like the punch through that is required has not happened yet for some of the candidates that need to punch through. Name names. Like candidates you may be working with, Carter. Just some of those people. Chicken shit. That being said, that being said, I, like you, agree that six weeks is a long time. I think this retail cycle is going to be really important for these candidates. They're going to have to come out of this retail cycle between July,</p>
<p data-start="2610.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> to punch through.</p>
<p data-start="2616.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Chicken shit. That</p>
<p data-start="2628.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> July, Stampede, Folk Fest. Is that August still? Mid-August? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2632.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, it's early August. Okay, so let's</p>
<p data-start="2633.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay, so let's use that five-week period, which I believe is like like five to six weeks, your number, that's</p>
<p data-start="2637.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's going to be huge for these people to define themselves, to understand what they stand for. I go back to my point of ambition and what these folks need to describe, because if that doesn't happen, it becomes a Jyoti Gondek, Jeremy Farkas re-election, where for the political insiders, there's been a bit of evolution</p>
<p data-start="2657.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> in terms of what people feel about those two characters, which I think is interesting. But for the secondary and the tertiary class of Calgary citizens, it's a rematch again where conservatism is in favor and he holds the mantle there. That's my on the sidelines, minimal attention thought</p>
<p data-start="2674.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> process. I don't, you are obviously more, you</p>
<p data-start="2677.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> you understand this more intimately. You probably know the dynamics between first, second, third, what percentage it takes to win. I also believe this will be one of those elections where the winner may have 29 to 36% in terms of what they get in terms of vote share to win, because there'll be a few people who can carve out 12 to 15 percent homes. And</p>
<p data-start="2697.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> maybe they were thinking that they could carve out 30 to 40 percent homes, but their ceiling is 12 to 15, either as a byproduct of performance, name recognition,</p>
<p data-start="2705.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> whatever, runway.</p>
<p data-start="2705.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> runway.</p>
<p data-start="2706.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> runway. They just didn't start enough.</p>
<p data-start="2708.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> But I think those dynamics probably end up with a mayoral candidate that does not have a strong mandate. Regardless, mayoral candidate that ends up with 28 percent to 35 percent is not a 50 percent plus one winner, winner, which means that the election is one thing, but the mandate on the back end is even more fascinating to me around what they feel like they've got permission to do.</p>
<p data-start="2728.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Interesting. Very</p>
<p data-start="2729.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Very interesting. So</p>
<p data-start="2731.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> who wins?</p>
<p data-start="2733.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Right now, all things equal, election tomorrow, Farkas.</p>
<p data-start="2736.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Do you think he's actually been able to walk away from his... He has his progressive creds now, and he has his conservative creds. Which ones are actual real?</p>
<p data-start="2744.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> ones are</p>
<p data-start="2746.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> I think this might play either strategically or lucky for him. I'm not sure I want to decide just yet because i haven't seen it where with the political class enough people have forgiven him and there isn't an exciting there isn't an exciting progressive that's punching through just yet on paper so</p>
<p data-start="2761.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> so they go with farkas because it's like as he fundamentally changed i'm willing to take a shot</p>
<p data-start="2766.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> he's also a machine at</p>
<p data-start="2768.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> at the one-on-one game at</p>
<p data-start="2770.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> at</p>
<p data-start="2770.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> at the keeping in touch with everyone game which i think has helped a lot of the political organizing class feel more comfortable with farkas and then i think he takes advantage of the fact that many of the people in the second and third ring still feel like he's a conservative or if if if branded with a bit more negativity conservative enough that's how i look at it i don't have the numbers you have i don't have any of the poll but it becomes a realtor election the second and third ring no jeremy farkas and i the one name i haven't mentioned is is our sitting mayor jody gondek who i've got a lot of time and respect for but it seems like you know from at least some of the polling is going to be competitive enough but but might not have the same chance that she did last time.</p>
<p data-start="2808.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> But that's where I kind of see this race going. It's like, I'm not saying it's Farkas for the taking, but if those things align where enough progressives have forgiven him on the organizing side and the political side, and enough people still view him as conservative enough, and</p>
<p data-start="2820.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> we're in a moment of more conservatism or at least more moderation than some of the things that Gondek sold during the last sort of months of her race around progressive hopes, right? If I'm being honest, like you sold progressive hopes, Carter. And I bought, I was one of those customers who said, said, yup, like, relatively last minute, if this is the choice, I'm going with Gondek. This is easy.</p>
<p data-start="2840.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> If</p>
<p data-start="2841.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> that doesn't exist to the level, the Farkas might be able to do a bit of, like, capture in that way that could be quite fascinating. Well,</p>
<p data-start="2848.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, make sure we go to whyiszainwrong.ca Okay. Are you going to</p>
<p data-start="2852.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay. Are you going to give a full explanation? I shouldn't allow you... Give us a full explanation as to...</p>
<p data-start="2855.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> shouldn't allow you... Give us a full explanation as to... You</p>
<p data-start="2857.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> You know I have respect for, and a ton of admiration for the person you're working with. Why is Zane wrong? And tell</p>
<p data-start="2860.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> for the person you're working with. Why is Zane wrong? And tell us why he's wrong, right or wrong. on.</p>
<p data-start="2864.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Tell us why you agree with Zane or why you don't, and keep in mind- Here's</p>
<p data-start="2867.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> keep in mind- Here's a genuine question I have for you. Here's</p>
<p data-start="2869.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Here's</p>
<p data-start="2869.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Here's a genuine question I have for you. Why are none of these candidates, outside of maybe Sharp,</p>
<p data-start="2875.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> punching with a fervor and intensity on Daniel Smith as you did with Gondek and Jason Kenney?</p>
<p data-start="2883.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's one element of it that I'm actually struggling with just as an ... This is pure observer, right? So you might tell me, oh, it's just Zane, you're wrong. Here's 10 things that everyone's been doing, and then it becomes a question of why none of it's penetrating, which</p>
<p data-start="2895.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> which is a different tactical question that a lot of folks are struggling with. But</p>
<p data-start="2899.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> why does no one seem to be hitting Daniel Smith on the daily about everything? If there's some softness around who's pushing back, why are some of these Merrill candidates, the Farkases and the Bryans and the Gondeks, where</p>
<p data-start="2911.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> where are we on hitting Daniel Smith on an hourly basis, let alone daily? It's</p>
<p data-start="2913.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> on hitting</p>
<p data-start="2917.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's hard to hit a shadow.</p>
<p data-start="2919.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> She moves so quickly. she moves from one thing to the next thing that you threw a punch at and then the next thing that that thing is kind of the ndp</p>
<p data-start="2925.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> is kind of the ndp answer isn't it it's</p>
<p data-start="2927.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's gone it's it's like punching a wisp right</p>
<p data-start="2929.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> right like why was it not why was it not like that for with kenny because kenny had to stand on the on the covid stuff he</p>
<p data-start="2932.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> because kenny had to</p>
<p data-start="2935.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> he was just it was the one issue that he would not back out on everyone couldn't back away from it he was</p>
<p data-start="2937.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> couldn't back away from it he was defined on it and and it gave us a much stronger attack how much of</p>
<p data-start="2944.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> how much of an assist do you think you feel like you got from the opposition ndp in the gondek race that that that they had defined Kenny in such a way, or helped define him in such a way? None.</p>
<p data-start="2953.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> None.</p>
<p data-start="2953.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> None? None.</p>
<p data-start="2955.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Tell me why. Because the NDP were nowhere near us. We were, like, I was in absolute shock that the NDP didn't at least come to steal our people,</p>
<p data-start="2958.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> like, I was</p>
<p data-start="2964.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> to steal the</p>
<p data-start="2965.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="2965.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="2965.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> the structure. I don't mean from a ground war organizational perspective. I mean from an air war definition. We</p>
<p data-start="2969.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> definition. We defined him way more on our own.</p>
<p data-start="2973.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> You think so? Absolutely.</p>
<p data-start="2973.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
<p data-start="2975.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> So you feel like this is a struggle that everyone is having right now, is how to hit Danielle Smith from a municipal angle? I haven't thrown a punch</p>
<p data-start="2979.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> municipal angle? I haven't thrown a punch at a ghost. Have</p>
<p data-start="2982.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Have you tried?</p>
<p data-start="2983.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> haven't really tried that hard right now, but it's</p>
<p data-start="2987.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> in part because we can't see the punch.</p>
<p data-start="2990.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Fair. I see what you're saying about that.</p>
<p data-start="2993.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> You have to find the angle. If you can't see it, you can't throw it. There's simultaneously too much and not enough because none of it's been bundled is how I look at it.</p>
<p data-start="2995.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> If you can't see it, you can't throw it.</p>
<p data-start="3003.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. It's</p>
<p data-start="3005.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> like a lot of raw ingredients. Carter, over under our lightning round. Oh, lightning round. Good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's just one question here, which is, first of all, a reminder. LastMealAtSwiss.ca that's where you can go to give us your actuarially sound actuarially sound analysis of how many people have had their last meal.</p>
<p data-start="3008.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> round. Oh, lightning round. Good. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="3018.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> actuarially sound actuarially sound</p>
<p data-start="3025.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> We'll use today as a stopper. June 23rd, 2025 up until today. How many people in this country have had their last meal at Swiss Chalet? Carter, I'm going to let you work this out on</p>
<p data-start="3035.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> on Mike here. Give it to us from top of the dome. Stephen Carter</p>
<p data-start="3041.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> What's</p>
<p data-start="3041.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> What's the number? Swiss Chalet, I remember coming to Calgary in the 80s. We're</p>
<p data-start="3041.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Chalet, I</p>
<p data-start="3045.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> We're talking Canada-wide, sorry. I want to be very clear.</p>
<p data-start="3046.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I want to be very</p>
<p data-start="3047.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> But I'm only familiar with the Calgary.</p>
<p data-start="3049.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay, so you're going to just use Calgary as a template. I like where you're going.</p>
<p data-start="3052.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Calgary has approximately been 10% of the population. Let's just say, no, not, yeah, 5</p>
<p data-start="3057.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> 5% of the population. No, 2% of the population. Doesn't matter.</p>
<p data-start="3061.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Math's not my strong suit.</p>
<p data-start="3063.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> So here's the number.</p>
<p data-start="3064.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay, what's the number?</p>
<p data-start="3065.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> 67.</p>
<p data-start="3067.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> 67 people.</p>
<p data-start="3068.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Mm-hmm.</p>
<p data-start="3069.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> You don't need to see the work.</p>
<p data-start="3072.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> good. I don't mind 67. 67 feels right. I could hear... I'm going to give you a range.</p>
<p data-start="3077.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, no, no, no. You got to pick a fucking number. You</p>
<p data-start="3080.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> You can't do a range. I'm</p>
<p data-start="3081.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm not very good at math either, but I think it's between 9 and 5,000.</p>
<p data-start="3085.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> That is not wrong. Pick a number.</p>
<p data-start="3089.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> 68.</p>
<p data-start="3091.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Dick! Is this... Is this... You're going to... No,</p>
<p data-start="3093.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> going to... No, no, no. It's fine. I feel like this is a poor strategy on my part, but I feel like you're going exactly where I was going to go.
