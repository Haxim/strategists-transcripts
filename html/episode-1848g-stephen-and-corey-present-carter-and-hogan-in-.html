      <p data-start="0.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay, you ready?</p>
<p data-start="2.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I don't remember. I don't remember how we start these ones.</p>
<p data-start="6.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Um, well, it is a complex dance of you saying things and then...</p>
<p data-start="12.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Welcome to The Strategist, episode 1848G. My name is Corey Hogan. You</p>
<p data-start="18.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know what? We should have done a recording like we do with the You the People ones, where we write a little script.</p>
<p data-start="23.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> little script.</p>
<p data-start="24.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Your name is Stephen Carr.</p>
<p data-start="28.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Not with us tonight is Zainer Annalise. Two hosts.</p>
<p data-start="32.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Two hosts. Useless. And yet no hosts. Useless.</p>
<p data-start="34.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Useless.</p>
<p data-start="35.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Strange, that one, huh? Standard Carter</p>
<p data-start="38.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Carter and Hogan. So</p>
<p data-start="39.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> So</p>
<p data-start="40.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> how are you doing? It's good to see you in another hotel. I'm</p>
<p data-start="43.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm in another hotel. This</p>
<p data-start="43.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm in another hotel. This is back to back, you and me, by the way. I know.</p>
<p data-start="47.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I know. Yeah. This</p>
<p data-start="48.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is starting to turn into a trend.</p>
<p data-start="50.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Only the people who spend $6 know that, though, right? That's right.</p>
<p data-start="53.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's right. That's right. We gave them their episode.</p>
<p data-start="54.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> We gave them</p>
<p data-start="57.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, in our defense, we knew that Zane was a flake. And we did ask the liberal leadership contenders to come and host this podcast. And they</p>
<p data-start="67.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> they didn't.</p>
<p data-start="67.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> didn't. I didn't</p>
<p data-start="68.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I didn't understand that none of them. I mean, Frank Bayless is getting no media at all. One would think that this has to count as some media. He could</p>
<p data-start="75.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> count as some media. He could have had the strategist bump.</p>
<p data-start="78.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Didn't do it.</p>
<p data-start="79.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Do you remember that time we did the liberal strategy and then they won?</p>
<p data-start="83.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Actually, that was a really good episode. Yeah. We often, we're</p>
<p data-start="88.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> not shy about pumping our own tires. But I think that might have been. know we actually like we commissioned polling for that do you remember i know i know we had private polling yeah that told us a bit this</p>
<p data-start="95.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> know we had private</p>
<p data-start="98.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is before we had people to pay us i</p>
<p data-start="101.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> know that was just that was the unlimited joke budget that was just my money you know just is that your budget money that paid i don't know it might have been yours i'm not sure i paid</p>
<p data-start="108.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i paid for one of the uh one of the live shows one time that</p>
<p data-start="111.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> that that i remember you</p>
<p data-start="112.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> you did you bankrolled a live show yeah that was nice of you that was back when we didn't think we'd</p>
<p data-start="114.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah that was</p>
<p data-start="115.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> that was back when we didn't think we'd draw an audience yeah</p>
<p data-start="118.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah well we</p>
<p data-start="119.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> we were we</p>
<p data-start="119.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> we</p>
<p data-start="120.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> we were We're kind of, we were young. We were naive. Like our third episode was a live show. So we</p>
<p data-start="125.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> we had that going. Man,</p>
<p data-start="126.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Man, we were arrogant then.</p>
<p data-start="127.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, man. Times were different. I wish we could go back</p>
<p data-start="129.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Times were different. I wish we could go back to those days.</p>
<p data-start="132.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> We can, bud. Don't worry. We can live into now. Hey, so no Zane. Perfect opportunity to talk about not heading to Natchi, but also maybe just Alberta in general. You want to talk about Alberta? I</p>
<p data-start="142.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know. What's going on? A</p>
<p data-start="144.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> few things in Alberta. You're not even in Alberta right now. I'm</p>
<p data-start="146.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right now. I'm not even in Alberta. I'm in British Columbia right now. Sitting in another hotel room.</p>
<p data-start="149.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Sitting</p>
<p data-start="151.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> doing video for</p>
<p data-start="152.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> for the masses with no light we're</p>
<p data-start="154.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're yeah</p>
<p data-start="155.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah we can see that yeah we can half see that yeah</p>
<p data-start="156.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah we</p>
<p data-start="158.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah well i feel bad okay</p>
<p data-start="160.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> so a few things have been going on in alberta but i think the one that we need to anchor this conversation around because we've well</p>
<p data-start="166.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> well we've talked a lot about danielle smith and her approach to to u.s politics maybe we'll get there maybe</p>
<p data-start="171.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> we won't maybe we will maybe</p>
<p data-start="172.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> will maybe we won't we're not making any promises to these people</p>
<p data-start="174.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're not making any promises</p>
<p data-start="176.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> absolutely these people don't</p>
<p data-start="177.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> these people don't pay us fuck all promises</p>
<p data-start="181.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> promises are for people who give us six dollars a month that's exactly right yeah</p>
<p data-start="183.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's exactly right</p>
<p data-start="184.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i</p>
<p data-start="186.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> want to skip past that right now though and go to what is i think maybe one of the bigger stories in alberta politics at least because of its potential you know we live in a world where people tend to throw around rhetoric like this could bring down a government you know the divine analogy this is a government in saskatchewan where they basically all went to jail like these things get thrown thrown around and most of the time you just kind of roll your eyes and you know do one of those jerk off motions if you're steven i hate</p>
<p data-start="213.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i hate i hate i</p>
<p data-start="213.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> hate i</p>
<p data-start="214.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> i hate i</p>
<p data-start="216.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i hate yeah</p>
<p data-start="216.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="216.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i hate the the</p>
<p data-start="217.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i hate the the everybody calling for everybody's resignation all the time yeah i know</p>
<p data-start="221.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> time yeah i know makes me crazy</p>
<p data-start="221.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> makes me crazy you</p>
<p data-start="222.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> you hate it i hate it you hate the heated rhetoric of like this is it this is like this is the end of the government they</p>
<p data-start="223.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> hate it</p>
<p data-start="226.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> it this is like this is the end of the government they are completely without uh without any morality i</p>
<p data-start="229.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> completely without</p>
<p data-start="233.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i hate that because</p>
<p data-start="234.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> because usually it's not the end of the government no right but why don't we get to the actual issue here or at least throw it on the table why don't i</p>
<p data-start="239.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i do this hang on hey</p>
<p data-start="241.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> hey</p>
<p data-start="241.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> hey cory</p>
<p data-start="242.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> cory will you set that up for us that's</p>
<p data-start="244.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> his angelism well</p>
<p data-start="244.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> well</p>
<p data-start="245.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> look i mean the the basic allegation the summary of it is this it is that the government of alberta uh has been directing money towards people who have been doing favors for the government of alberta i i think i can summarize it as simple as that and the value of me a favor buddy</p>
<p data-start="261.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> value of me a favor buddy and And make sure we don't get sued, okay?</p>
<p data-start="263.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> sure we don't get sued,</p>
<p data-start="265.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, that's a good idea. So that's</p>
<p data-start="265.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's a good idea. So that's</p>
<p data-start="267.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="267.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="268.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's the allegation. Okay, thank you.</p>
<p data-start="270.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> And this allegation is in many ways unspooled in a letter from former CEO of Alberta Health Services, Athana Metzlopoulos, who is a former colleague of mine, right? Worked with her at the government of Alberta.</p>
<p data-start="284.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> And many former colleagues of mine are involved in this story in some way, shape, or form. So I don't know if I want to get into the specific details here, right?</p>
<p data-start="292.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's good. we're not detail people that's</p>
<p data-start="295.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's you know it's actually great cover it's great cover for not knowing any of the details the</p>
<p data-start="295.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> know</p>
<p data-start="295.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> know it's</p>
<p data-start="295.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's actually great</p>
<p data-start="298.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> for not knowing any of the details the detail guys no that's right no this</p>
<p data-start="301.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's right no</p>
<p data-start="303.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is the strategists it's</p>
<p data-start="305.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> about half a billion dollars though it's suggested in contracts for private surgeries right being directed towards people who have shown favor to the government and in fact it is a business leader leader who is</p>
<p data-start="320.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> is tied to the Turkish Tylenol mini scandal here in Alberta that's at the center of it. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="325.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I mean, maybe... Not a mini scandal, a legitimate scandal, $75 million for a product that was really never received and never used.</p>
<p data-start="333.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, look, we can get into the definition of scandal. I mean, I think it's a bit of an outrage that the cost per dose was so expensive and we ordered more doses than we could possibly need as a province. And we ordered it in a way that it wouldn't come until after we needed it all of that i believe i mean we actually covered that in real time on this podcast this wasn't even like after the fact saying how crazy this was yeah</p>
<p data-start="344.1"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> province.</p>
<p data-start="351.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> on this podcast</p>
<p data-start="355.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah we</p>
<p data-start="355.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> we said it at the time but</p>
<p data-start="357.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> but there was never the suggestion at the time that money was like flowing in ways that were improper i guess that's what i'm trying to say when i say mini scandal well</p>
<p data-start="366.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> well there's no time yeah</p>
<p data-start="368.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah now</p>
<p data-start="370.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's a suggestion or at least there's the the insinuation out there that uh that money is flowing in ways that are improper because this you know the heart of it is this skybox where um you know you could watch hockey games from that the you know people are invited to and all that i don't really want to get into like the very specific things mostly because the premier has already threatened to sue people yeah you were alluding to that um</p>
<p data-start="393.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah you were</p>
<p data-start="394.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> um premier smith if you're listening uh our good friend carrie tate is who you're supposed to sue not not cory and i cory and i are approaching this in fact as though premier smith is innocent uh mostly to avoid litigation well</p>
<p data-start="405.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> mostly to avoid litigation</p>
<p data-start="406.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> well look i actually think that's a pretty good frame because like we only know what we know we only see what's in the media here but the long story short is all of these allegations are floating around other conversations around the side as to what this might potentially mean but after many days of silence where even the usually reliable um boosters</p>
<p data-start="425.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> boosters</p>
<p data-start="427.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> shall we say at post media were giving uh the gears to the premier and saying what is this what does this mean and you're right kerry tape broke the story in the globe and mail credit where credit's due um the premier released a statement on twitter on x on saturday and</p>
<p data-start="444.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> it was an interesting statement i mean i i've i've</p>
<p data-start="447.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> not read statements like this in a while how</p>
<p data-start="451.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> can i say this like we</p>
<p data-start="453.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> we were talking a little bit about this before here again</p>
<p data-start="455.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're</p>
<p data-start="457.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> working from the frame premier innocent does</p>
<p data-start="460.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> not actually inspire a lot of confidence that that is the case right like some of the word choices are crazy and so this is sort of what i'm hey cory yeah</p>
<p data-start="470.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah don't</p>
<p data-start="470.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't get us sued i</p>
<p data-start="471.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="471.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know i know i'm trying to walk a line brother</p>
<p data-start="473.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> line brother walk the line but i gotta</p>
<p data-start="476.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> gotta say like teach you how to do it yeah you know so the line the line in it maybe i'll maybe i'll just very quickly read you know it's not long enough that I can't read it. So let me read it. I'll skip over some. Show</p>
<p data-start="476.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> say like teach</p>
<p data-start="486.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> me read it. I'll skip</p>
<p data-start="488.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Show us your reading proficiency. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="489.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I have read various media stories containing allegations regarding the procurement and contracting processes of AHS. That's Alberta Health Services. They are troubling allegations and they should be reviewed as quickly as possible. To that end, I will be writing the Auditor General, Doug Wiley, to ask for an expedited review and his</p>
<p data-start="506.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> findings on the issue. I have also directed my officials to ensure that any request for information from Mr. Wiley or his office, is dealt with on a fully transparent and expedited basis. We need to get to the bottom of this issue quickly to identify any potential wrongdoing, correct it, address it appropriately. Okay, so far so good, right? Here's where it starts to get a little bit stranger, right? I have also asked that AHS's internal reviews be completed as quickly as possible and delivered directly to me so we can study the results and make improvements or adjustments to these processes. Until these findings are delivered, AHS has paused</p>
<p data-start="538.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> the contracting of surgical facilities under review.</p>
<p data-start="542.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> And here's where it gets strangest still. As premier, I was not involved in any wrongdoing. Any insinuation to the contrary is false, baseless, and defamatory. It then goes on to say basically, hey, I like trying to change AHS and deliver quality, timely health care. That's my goal. I'm not going to bother going into that last paragraph. That's, in my opinion, boilerplate. But two things, which I kind of paused on, but let's really call them out. yeah one is this is really serious so i've asked for the review to come directly to me yeah</p>
<p data-start="568.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> but let's really call</p>
<p data-start="573.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> so i've</p>
<p data-start="575.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah right</p>
<p data-start="575.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> right i gotta see it first gotta</p>
<p data-start="577.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> gotta see this review gotta see this review send it to me send me</p>
<p data-start="578.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> see this review gotta</p>
<p data-start="580.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> this review send</p>
<p data-start="581.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> send me an index so i can see where my name is mentioned yeah</p>
<p data-start="584.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah exactly and</p>
<p data-start="586.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> and the other is as premier i was not involved in any wrongdoing you know it doesn't say there was no wrongdoing it doesn't say even i was unaware aware of any wrongdoing it's i was not involved in any wrongdoing and</p>
<p data-start="593.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> it doesn't</p>
<p data-start="599.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> and then any insinuation i mean this is like especially for a public figure knowing where the bar is on this oh man</p>
<p data-start="605.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh man yeah can you any insinuation</p>
<p data-start="606.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah can you any insinuation is false</p>
<p data-start="608.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> false baseless and defamatory how how is</p>
<p data-start="610.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> how how is she going to sue so i mean thank</p>
<p data-start="613.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> god we're taking the position that she's innocent because she's going to sue everybody if if uh if she's worried about the defamatory statements that have been made so far because Because this is one of those scandals that</p>
<p data-start="627.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> money is not going in the direction that it's supposed to go and being directed to spend money by the government of Alberta to AHS. chess i mean</p>
<p data-start="636.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean well and</p>
<p data-start="636.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> and the suggestion is that her chief of staff at the time was at the heart of it right which which not had nancy and the alberta ndp when they were going against this you know railing against this said effectively either</p>
<p data-start="641.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> right which</p>
<p data-start="650.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> either she</p>
<p data-start="651.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> she knew and that's a very bad thing or she didn't and that's a certain level of incompetence i'm paraphrasing nancy at this point right yeah but you know the</p>
<p data-start="659.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> insinuation thing is pretty wild too like that's an interesting bar that's an an interesting interpretation but okay so that's all on the table now right let's</p>
<p data-start="666.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> talk strategy oh</p>
<p data-start="668.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh strategy okay</p>
<p data-start="669.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> okay first</p>
<p data-start="670.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> first thing i have my thoughts i want to get yours first how</p>
<p data-start="673.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> how does a statement like this get written oh</p>
<p data-start="676.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> you go and i'll go i had going and i go i</p>
<p data-start="677.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> go and i'll go i had going and i go i had so many scandals i</p>
<p data-start="681.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> i had so many um</p>
<p data-start="681.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> so many um you were at least a few scandals well we</p>
<p data-start="685.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> well we know in fairness i was not the biggest ones i</p>
<p data-start="690.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean if you recall we had the no meat committee do</p>
<p data-start="693.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> do you remember do you remember the The no-meet committee. The no-meet committee, for those just joining us, was</p>
<p data-start="693.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> remember do you remember the The no-meet committee. The no-meet</p>
<p data-start="694.7"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> -meet</p>
<p data-start="696.6"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> us,</p>
<p data-start="696.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> us, was</p>
<p data-start="697.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> was in 2011, 2010, when</p>
<p data-start="700.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> when</p>
<p data-start="700.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> when</p>
<p data-start="700.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> when a committee for the elections, I believe, was supposed to meet every month and every MLA would get a $1,000 stipend for attending those meetings. Unfortunately, the meetings never occurred.</p>
<p data-start="714.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Fortunately, the</p>
<p data-start="715.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Fortunately, the</p>
<p data-start="715.7"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="716.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the money did. Everybody</p>
<p data-start="717.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Everybody</p>
<p data-start="717.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Everybody got paid. Everybody</p>
<p data-start="717.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Everybody got</p>
<p data-start="718.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Everybody got paid, baby. Maybe, but</p>
<p data-start="720.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> but maybe</p>
<p data-start="722.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> not the scandal it sounds like because everybody got the same number of committee appointments, right? So people were paid based on committee assignments, but the reality was everybody just got paid. It</p>
<p data-start="730.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> everybody just got paid. It was just a top-up on pay.</p>
<p data-start="731.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> a top</p>
<p data-start="731.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> top</p>
<p data-start="733.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Nonetheless, we did have to write a similar type of statement that said, you know, and</p>
<p data-start="735.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Nonetheless, we</p>
<p data-start="739.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> and we had to give all the money back. We said we were going to give back all the money and that was, you know, that was our way out of it. But the point is everybody's hands on deck when you're writing that statement, you're writing that statement with the input of lawyers, you're writing that statement with the input of of the government. You're making sure that everybody's covered off so that you're not sounding like you have committed a fraud, because if</p>
<p data-start="766.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you sound like you've committed a fraud, I'll tell you something. The next call is to the police. Right.</p>
<p data-start="771.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Yeah. And the police come in and they knock on your door. We didn't commit a fraud.</p>
<p data-start="771.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="775.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> We just took some money that we weren't entitled to. That was important. Maybe the phrasing on that was a little off. The phrasing,</p>
<p data-start="781.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> little off. The phrasing, that was not great. But I think</p>
<p data-start="783.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> think</p>
<p data-start="783.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> think</p>
<p data-start="784.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> think</p>
<p data-start="784.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> think you know what I mean.</p>
<p data-start="785.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean.</p>
<p data-start="785.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> I do know what you mean. And it was interesting because on that no-meet committee, MLAs from all parties were caught up in it. Like, Raj Sherman and David Swan were both on it for the Liberals. They both wrote checks back as a result. But, you know, like realistically, it was just part of their MLA salary. Like it was just structured in such a way that committee meetings were a separate line item. But it</p>
<p data-start="806.0"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it was a big thing. It was a huge thing in Alberta. It became a</p>
<p data-start="807.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> thing in Alberta. It became a scandal. It really is the moment where Alison Redford went from will she get 87 out of 87 seats to will she win this election, which I mean, both you and I remember very well.</p>
<p data-start="819.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> We were running different campaigns. It was</p>
<p data-start="819.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> campaigns. It was polling so badly that when we presented the polling findings to caucus, they said it was a push poll.</p>
<p data-start="828.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Caucus is, you know, kings of denial, in</p>
<p data-start="830.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> in my experience.</p>
<p data-start="830.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> in my experience. Well, it was</p>
<p data-start="831.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, it was an IVR, so I think they meant IVR, and they just thought it was a push button. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="835.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. And</p>
<p data-start="836.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> And they don't know what a push poll is. I</p>
<p data-start="837.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, that's really impossible. I mean, your profession is</p>
<p data-start="838.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's really impossible. I mean, your profession is politics. Why would you know that?</p>
<p data-start="842.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. Can you say something really interesting? Because you talked about, like, lawyers and communicators in the room. Can I say, in my experience, in government and in politics, which is, you know, not insignificant, you know, I've been here for a few of those statements myself, there is a difference between a statement written by communicators run by lawyers and a statement written by lawyers run by communicators. But also, if</p>
<p data-start="863.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="863.9"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="863.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> and a</p>
<p data-start="864.0"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="870.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's not that serious, it tends to be the communicators take first pen. And when it's deathly serious, the lawyers take the first pen.</p>
<p data-start="877.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> This feels to me like a lawyer's run by communicator statement, not communicator's run by lawyers. Absolutely. The lawyer wrote this first and made</p>
<p data-start="880.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> not communicator's run by lawyers. Absolutely. The lawyer wrote this first and made sure that the deniability was in there. We wouldn't have put that in.</p>
<p data-start="883.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> made sure that</p>
<p data-start="890.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> We wouldn't have put that in because it implies a certain amount of guilt. Absolutely. I mean, especially when you parse the statement and you kind of go, hang on for a second here. It doesn't say she didn't know. It doesn't say, like, we wouldn't have put it in. it</p>
<p data-start="893.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Absolutely. I mean,</p>
<p data-start="902.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> um we would have allowed</p>
<p data-start="903.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> allowed people</p>
<p data-start="904.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> people to to reach the conclusion by</p>
<p data-start="906.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> by writing something else right um one of the things that's missing is we don't have a scapegoat you</p>
<p data-start="912.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> know a good political communicator would be pointing a finger somewhere else so fast your fucking head would spin</p>
<p data-start="918.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="919.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know yeah</p>
<p data-start="920.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i think i think it would be pretty easy to say we all know ahs has been pretty chaotic and we all know that there's been troubles along there but a lawyer is going to say you</p>
<p data-start="928.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> you have your you fucking mind you can't you can't</p>
<p data-start="928.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> have your you fucking</p>
<p data-start="929.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> you can't point the you can't point the finger at the hs and its problems we're</p>
<p data-start="931.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> the finger</p>
<p data-start="933.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> problems we're already in a situation where people are sending letters through lawyers like this was a leak of a letter that athena sent basically</p>
<p data-start="940.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> with 44 pages alleging these things right oh absolutely you know as part of a dispute over her being terminated by hs so well</p>
<p data-start="947.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> well and that's just it too like why terminator like why why</p>
<p data-start="952.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> are you taking these types of actions in order to like if you're trying to protect yourself you're doing the opposite of protecting yourself i</p>
<p data-start="957.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> the opposite</p>
<p data-start="959.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> i mean this is is the other challenge with it all and we we really breezed past it but apparently some of this was known a little bit earlier these concerns were brought by uh the ceo of alberta health athena metzalopoulos um to</p>
<p data-start="973.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> the board the board was poised to vote on it the board was let go she was let go i i mean there</p>
<p data-start="980.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> there are i'll just say from inside government sometimes these things happen because you're like oh my lord this person's off their rocker now that's not been been my experience with a thana just to be clear but like sometimes them doing these things is the thing that makes you say okay they gotta go right but like the combination of both her and the board it's</p>
<p data-start="997.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> right but</p>
<p data-start="1001.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> a little weird well</p>
<p data-start="1002.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> well</p>
<p data-start="1002.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> well you</p>
<p data-start="1002.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you ever go fishing with dynamite uh</p>
<p data-start="1005.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> no no no no i mean does anyone do that it's pretty crazy thing to do it</p>
<p data-start="1010.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> it is a pretty crazy thing to do but this is the political equivalent of going fishing with dynamite everybody</p>
<p data-start="1016.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> everybody who's touching this that's not guilty is getting hit it with the dynamite yeah</p>
<p data-start="1021.0"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="1021.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> right everybody else is is trying to like they</p>
<p data-start="1025.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> didn't come up with any scapegoats they didn't push any any like the the this just doesn't make any sense from a political point of view i'm completely flummoxed by it i'm also completely flummoxed by the apparent lack of ethics um which uh has has to govern and govern you know government requires requires ethics and uh you know the old wild rose used to rail against it right yeah and</p>
<p data-start="1050.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah and</p>
<p data-start="1050.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> and the wild rose crazies are now in charge and now they think they get to rob the piggy bank can</p>
<p data-start="1056.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> can i just say like can i just paint a picture of this not being the government's malfeasance can i just can we throw that out there just so i can oh get it on the record sure</p>
<p data-start="1064.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> sure what</p>
<p data-start="1065.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> what and when we're doing it is the color of the sky pink all</p>
<p data-start="1065.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> and when</p>
<p data-start="1070.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> right so obviously there were procurement challenges maybe they They were isolated to one person. In terms of the board and the CEO, maybe the government had soured on the CEO. Maybe things were awkward. Maybe at that point, the CEO starts trying to create almost a reason like, look at this.</p>
<p data-start="1089.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> This happens in jobs. I'm certainly not saying it happened here. OK, just want to be crystal clear on this. But then they say, oh, she's got to go. And so many people will know that Andre Tremblay is the Deputy Minister of Alberta Health, is the Administrator of Alberta Health Services having replaced the board, and the Interim CEO of Alberta Health Services. Do you</p>
<p data-start="1090.7"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> certainly not</p>
<p data-start="1110.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you think he gets all three checks? It's</p>
<p data-start="1112.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> It's like Pokemon. He's going to catch them all, right? I know Andre pretty well. I've worked with him for a long time. Pretty competent guy, I just have to say. But you could easily imagine where they say, oh, geez, well, she's got to go. Oh, so we will just replace her. And actually, Andre, we wouldn't mind you being the administrator, too. Now, that's where it's a bit of a jump, like why. But the minute you do that, half the board of AHS is deputy ministers, like colleagues of Andre. Yeah. Andre. So at that point, do you not just say, well, that's an awkward situation. So we'd have to let half the board go anyways. So why don't we just make Andre in charge? You know,</p>
<p data-start="1144.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Andre.</p>
<p data-start="1153.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> charitable read.</p>
<p data-start="1155.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> But that's my charitable read right now. So</p>
<p data-start="1156.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> So if</p>
<p data-start="1156.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> if that's what happened, and that's how we ended up here, is that so crazy? Yes,</p>
<p data-start="1160.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yes, it is crazy.</p>
<p data-start="1162.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> It is nuts. It is not the way that things should go. Yeah, it's weird,</p>
<p data-start="1165.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> go. Yeah, it's weird, for sure. Because,</p>
<p data-start="1166.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> sure. Because, you</p>
<p data-start="1168.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, souring</p>
<p data-start="1169.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> souring on the CEO is one thing. Souring on the board is another thing. I've</p>
<p data-start="1172.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I've</p>
<p data-start="1173.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I've seen both of those things happen. And you know what? Ginning up a reason to hold on to your job is a skill I never acquired.</p>
<p data-start="1175.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="1176.1"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="1184.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, that's a real failing of yours. Yeah, it's a failing of mine</p>
<p data-start="1185.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yours. Yeah, it's a failing of mine particularly.</p>
<p data-start="1187.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> But,</p>
<p data-start="1188.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, I mean, this</p>
<p data-start="1191.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> doesn't strike me as something that's ginned up to hold on to a job. This strikes me as something that is legitimate and real. And when you put everything else into that filter, then the legitimacy and the realness of this takes apart, takes away from the capacity to say, you know, this is something that could have happened through non.</p>
<p data-start="1213.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> so let's just clean up what you said. like when you say legitimate real we don't know what it is but like we're saying there's smoke it's strange it's certainly not proper in terms of process and procedure even if it's not illegal that's what you mean at this case right because we don't know enough to make the broader claim i</p>
<p data-start="1230.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> i see the litigious claim and blue lights i see red and blue lights in the future here don't</p>
<p data-start="1230.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> i see the litigious claim and</p>
<p data-start="1236.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't you no</p>
<p data-start="1236.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> no jesus christ just stop just stop you</p>
<p data-start="1238.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> just</p>
<p data-start="1238.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> just stop</p>
<p data-start="1240.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1240.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1240.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you don't see</p>
<p data-start="1240.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> see that like</p>
<p data-start="1240.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> see that like</p>
<p data-start="1242.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's all serious we just don't know no i don't you're gonna you're you're so afraid of getting sued i've been serious it's not that hard it's</p>
<p data-start="1243.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's all serious we just don't know no i don't you're gonna</p>
<p data-start="1248.4"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> serious</p>
<p data-start="1248.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> serious it's</p>
<p data-start="1248.8"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="1250.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's not that hard we're</p>
<p data-start="1252.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> not we're not doing that um okay</p>
<p data-start="1255.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> so back to the situation like we're going to continue with our frame of like what should the government have done so we talked a little bit about it we deconstructed we talked about statement written by communicators run by lawyers versus statement written by lawyers run by communicators anything else you want to say on that before you want to say what this should have been well</p>
<p data-start="1273.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i i think</p>
<p data-start="1275.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> the question is really predicated on whether or not the premier feels she's innocent which</p>
<p data-start="1280.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> we have stipulated as part of this program as part of this program you know for the purposes of this program she's completely innocent in which case um she needs to do more than just a simple uh tweet uh demanding that a report be laid upon her desk and that the auditor general get involved if the uh if</p>
<p data-start="1283.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> program</p>
<p data-start="1297.8"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> if the</p>
<p data-start="1300.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> there is no merit to the complaint uh then there's no problem calling the police right why wouldn't you call the place. Call the fire down on your own hole, right? Like, let's go. Let's make sure that this thing is absolutely 100% clear. And it's not like they can be expected to actually finish the investigation before your next election anyways. There's only two and a half years. I'm</p>
<p data-start="1324.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> anticipating that it's going to take at least, what, three, four years to get through this based on the current speed and progress of the RCMP on other investigations that are political in nature. This feels like Like it's you know, if if if if the premier honestly didn't know what's going on, then she should be absolutely furious that one of her staff put</p>
<p data-start="1345.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> put her in a position where she could go down for it.</p>
<p data-start="1349.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, again, allegedly a</p>
<p data-start="1349.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> again, allegedly a</p>
<p data-start="1351.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> a staffer's job is to protect the principal. And</p>
<p data-start="1354.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is the exact opposite of protecting the principal.</p>
<p data-start="1355.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> the exact</p>
<p data-start="1358.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Allegedly.</p>
<p data-start="1360.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Allegedly.</p>
<p data-start="1361.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> So allegedly,</p>
<p data-start="1362.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> allegedly, I</p>
<p data-start="1364.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean, I think that you've you've unspooled a lot. That's true there. Right. right? I'm not so convinced I would call in the RCMP. I'm not really sure I want to create the precedent that whenever I'm accused of something, I'm calling in the RCMP. You've</p>
<p data-start="1376.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> RCMP. You've been accused of things for the last 18 months. For the last two years, you've been accused of things. This is not new to be accused of things. Being accused of something that has this type of connotation is new. It</p>
<p data-start="1376.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> been accused</p>
<p data-start="1387.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> new. It</p>
<p data-start="1388.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> is</p>
<p data-start="1390.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> beyond the pale. A half billion dollars worth of expenditures. One fifth of which, or 75 million of which, every</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> beyond the</p>
<p data-start="1400.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> every Albertan knows was lunacy.</p>
<p data-start="1405.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is the</p>
<p data-start="1407.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Tylenol, the children's Tylenol. It was absolute lunacy. And now you put it all together and you tied it together with the red string, and it's not really that much red string.</p>
<p data-start="1416.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> string.</p>
<p data-start="1417.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, can I say, this is actually what I think is one of the challenges that danielle smith has is let's just say if let's just say something happened it doesn't even need to be like the biggest things that are claimed right with her staff and all of that if</p>
<p data-start="1430.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> if this becomes a thing if there are red and blue lights at any point even if she was a hundred miles away from this particular situation the challenge she has between the hockey tickets and the turkish tylenol is that people are just gonna they're gonna do the red string thing and they're gonna going to say well like look at all of these connections here like it's just it's way you know it is character it is known associates right like i mean it's like one of those things in like a police procedural this is a known associate of danielle smith i</p>
<p data-start="1458.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i said to a friend of mine today that everybody's going to get painted with the same brush even if all they did was take a ticket to the to the box they're</p>
<p data-start="1466.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> they're going to be treated to whatever is found to be the worst sin committed by the cohort right</p>
<p data-start="1471.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> right i mean that's the risk yeah whatever</p>
<p data-start="1473.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> whatever the cohort has done to this stage everybody who's going to be guilty of the same sin because they were playing for the same team i</p>
<p data-start="1478.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> they were</p>
<p data-start="1480.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean daniel smith is very much in the splash zone i guess we would both agree oh</p>
<p data-start="1484.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh absolutely absolutely so</p>
<p data-start="1486.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="1486.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> so the challenge that is let's go back to this statement here and some of the conversation that was had how do you get out of the splash zone in that situation i don't think this statement does that no</p>
<p data-start="1497.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> no the statement doesn't go nearly far enough first of all i think you need You need to make sure that you're painting a villain.</p>
<p data-start="1504.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Whoever the villain is going to be, there are two people in any good story. There is a protagonist and an antagonist. If you want to be the protagonist, you must define who the antagonist is. That is the very, I mean, simple literature, reading your kids a story at night, there's a good guy and there's a bad guy, right?</p>
<p data-start="1521.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> right?</p>
<p data-start="1521.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> You're going to tell a story to your kids in the car to make the long trip exciting? exciting they're the good guys there's a bad guy good guy who triumphs over bad guy so</p>
<p data-start="1531.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> so danielle did not set that up she needed to have a bad guy or at least a potential bad guy and</p>
<p data-start="1537.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> she didn't do that</p>
<p data-start="1539.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> and the the this the second piece is she really didn't tell us much of a story at all right</p>
<p data-start="1545.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> right remembering that we this is one of our constant criticisms of rachel notley we learn by stories.</p>
<p data-start="1552.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> The story that is being told now by Nahid Nenshi isn't that good a story, but it's still much more of a story than Danielle Smith told us. Danielle Smith should have told us the story of an AHS that's out of control, an AHS that was being run by people</p>
<p data-start="1571.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> who didn't have the competence or the character to make sure that this type of stuff didn't happen.</p>
<p data-start="1577.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And this</p>
<p data-start="1578.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is is clearly</p>
<p data-start="1580.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> an ahs problem uh</p>
<p data-start="1582.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh but i think that one of the reasons she didn't tell us this cory and cory can you whisper it to you it's</p>
<p data-start="1591.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> no no no no listen it's</p>
<p data-start="1594.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> if you whisper something you</p>
<p data-start="1594.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you whisper something you</p>
<p data-start="1595.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> you can't get sued for it right can i make a broader point sure about this please yeah can i make it brought please when</p>
<p data-start="1599.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> about this please</p>
<p data-start="1600.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah can</p>
<p data-start="1602.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> you are constructing in a statement like this one of the challenges you you have is you worry about where it might go and you don't want to put yourself into a corner you don't want to make statements that you're then going to have to walk back right you're trying to make it durable because you know what they always say is like it's the cover-up that kills but like in this case the broader point is like if you say something and then tomorrow you have to say the opposite because you were just loose with your words it starts to look like a cover-up even if it was just an accidental fuck up so when i say it's the lawyers run by communicators that's when language gets super tight when it gets super specific you can't say that you can't say that you don't know that for sure you absolutely must stick to this line very carefully here and um and and so i've</p>
<p data-start="1649.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> been on the inside there you've been on the inside there what often happens is you sit and you don't know where the next hit's coming from you don't know what the next shoe to drop is you don't know what information might be out there that you don't know or sometimes you either is information out there that you do know and you don't know if anybody else knows it and it creates very very interesting very narrow communications for the purposes</p>
<p data-start="1669.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> for the purposes of this podcast we were assuming she was innocent i</p>
<p data-start="1673.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> still am you know like i think</p>
<p data-start="1675.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think</p>
<p data-start="1675.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> think but if she's innocent then she's not worried about the information that she doesn't know because</p>
<p data-start="1680.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> because she knows that she</p>
<p data-start="1680.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> because she knows that she knows that she hasn't done any there's no wrongdoing on her behalf no</p>
<p data-start="1686.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> no no no i disagree with that because i think even if you're there knowing you did nothing like listen that the police came to my house today and said we want to talk to you about a bank heist that happened in downtown calgary where were you at this time okay thank you very much i'm gonna go on my way and then it started to be reported out there like oh there's a bank heist and it looks like stephen carter might be involved and cory hogan's a known associate of stephen carter right yeah i'm putting out a statement i'm gonna be like i wasn't involved involved at all.</p>
<p data-start="1715.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Am I putting out a statement that says, and Stephen's innocent too?</p>
<p data-start="1718.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, no,</p>
<p data-start="1719.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> no, no, no. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1721.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="1721.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. But</p>
<p data-start="1721.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> But just for the record, I'd have lawyered up really quickly instead.</p>
<p data-start="1722.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> the record,</p>
<p data-start="1725.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'd be dollar bill Stern, baby.</p>
<p data-start="1728.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Lawyer. Because I don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1729.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1729.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Lawyer. Because</p>
<p data-start="1731.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I don't know. Because you don't know. So if you're Daniel Smith.</p>
<p data-start="1731.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because you don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1733.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you're Daniel Smith.</p>
<p data-start="1734.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Lawyer. You</p>
<p data-start="1736.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> only know what you know. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1737.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1738.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> But here's the thing. You don't know what</p>
<p data-start="1738.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> here's the thing. You don't know what other people are doing. If</p>
<p data-start="1739.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> If you don't know what other people are doing and you think that they've been doing something wrong,</p>
<p data-start="1744.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's where you're you're fucked that's</p>
<p data-start="1746.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's where you're fucked yeah that's</p>
<p data-start="1748.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's where i'm fucked in this story too then because like you clearly robbed that bank i'm</p>
<p data-start="1752.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm</p>
<p data-start="1752.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm obviously would rob a bank i'm a bank robber yeah</p>
<p data-start="1755.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah because my face is so um you</p>
<p data-start="1755.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah because</p>
<p data-start="1758.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> know so generic generic white guy it'd be like could you imagine trying to pick me out of a lineup they'd have like five of us and we'd all look the exact same yeah</p>
<p data-start="1758.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> so generic</p>
<p data-start="1758.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> generic generic white guy it'd</p>
<p data-start="1766.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah dominic cummings would go down for your crime dominic</p>
<p data-start="1768.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> crime dominic cummings mike mike bullard oh he's dead well</p>
<p data-start="1769.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> mike mike</p>
<p data-start="1771.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> well</p>
<p data-start="1772.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's perfect patsy then yeah aaron</p>
<p data-start="1774.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah aaron</p>
<p data-start="1775.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> aaron</p>
<p data-start="1775.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> aaron o'toole aaron</p>
<p data-start="1776.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> aaron o'toole goes down for this yeah</p>
<p data-start="1778.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i mean there's thousands absolutely thousands of us</p>
<p data-start="1781.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> us</p>
<p data-start="1781.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> us but</p>
<p data-start="1782.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> but you know so like you do get into place but like let's go back to this statement and dissect it this to me shows it's a premier's office that doesn't feel fully in control of the issue doesn't have a full sense of what the facts are doesn't know what's going to get out there next yeah that is how it's written right now of course i agree yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="1797.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> course i</p>
<p data-start="1799.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah which</p>
<p data-start="1799.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> which then you</p>
<p data-start="1801.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know so allowing</p>
<p data-start="1802.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> that statement to go out when you don't know when you don't know what the next thing is that's a problem like</p>
<p data-start="1808.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you can't like she's made it worse before making it better yeah</p>
<p data-start="1813.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah well and here's the other challenge she has because we've talked about just the words here but this is the only thing she said on this yeah</p>
<p data-start="1819.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah that's</p>
<p data-start="1819.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's that's the other challenge my understanding is she is slash was in panama she's now in washington dc right</p>
<p data-start="1826.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> she</p>
<p data-start="1826.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> she has made many statements about the u.s tariff situation both before and after if you go on her feed you'll see all of those have pictures and they're designed to look big on the feed and this one's designed to look small on the feed right and</p>
<p data-start="1836.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> the feed</p>
<p data-start="1841.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's starting to feel a bit absurd it's starting to feel a bit absurd that a half a billion dollar allegation has only been addressed in this particular fashion doesn't it oh</p>
<p data-start="1849.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> doesn't it oh</p>
<p data-start="1850.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh absolutely i mean that's a lot of money like</p>
<p data-start="1853.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> like like</p>
<p data-start="1853.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i mean that's one of those numbers that's so big people have trouble processing the oh</p>
<p data-start="1858.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh yeah the size of the challenge here well</p>
<p data-start="1858.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah the</p>
<p data-start="1862.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> well let's just say for shits and giggles you</p>
<p data-start="1864.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> and i were involved in a fraud that had about 500 billion or 500 million dollars sure</p>
<p data-start="1868.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> sure absolutely just you know allegedly allegedly</p>
<p data-start="1871.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> allegedly first of all we would be we'd be small minnows right</p>
<p data-start="1874.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah we</p>
<p data-start="1874.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah we</p>
<p data-start="1875.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> we wouldn't be doing the whole thing we're just gonna get a small what</p>
<p data-start="1878.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> what we're gonna get two percent we're just gonna wet</p>
<p data-start="1879.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're just gonna wet at our beak yeah two percent each absolutely ten</p>
<p data-start="1882.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> ten million dollars each ten</p>
<p data-start="1882.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> ten million</p>
<p data-start="1886.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> million bucks yeah</p>
<p data-start="1888.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah we're</p>
<p data-start="1888.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> we're not we're not we're not people who we're not overly greedy two</p>
<p data-start="1892.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> two percent feels good to us yeah take two points on the back end sure</p>
<p data-start="1894.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah take two</p>
<p data-start="1896.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> sure oh my god that's pretty modest and that's ten million dollars right yeah</p>
<p data-start="1901.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah this is exactly when it gets to numbers this big and</p>
<p data-start="1905.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> and what do you think the profit line would have looked like on that 75 million dollar tylenol deal yeah</p>
<p data-start="1911.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> well Well, let's not even bring that one in, right? We just don't know enough about it. But like the point is now- No, I'm just saying, what does</p>
<p data-start="1915.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> is now- No, I'm just saying, what does the profit line look like on that? Like</p>
<p data-start="1916.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> the profit line look</p>
<p data-start="1918.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Like what is the incentive- It's got to be 100% margin.</p>
<p data-start="1918.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> what is the</p>
<p data-start="1919.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> the incentive- It's got to be 100% margin. At</p>
<p data-start="1920.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> At least 100%. It has to be 100%</p>
<p data-start="1921.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> 100%. It has to be 100% margin. At least 100%</p>
<p data-start="1923.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> At least 100% margin.</p>
<p data-start="1925.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Given that the government was over a barrel, wanted these things in a hurry, was willing to take these extraordinary steps, has to be. Has</p>
<p data-start="1931.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Has</p>
<p data-start="1931.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Has</p>
<p data-start="1932.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Has to be.</p>
<p data-start="1932.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> And also just looking at margins, like pharmaceutical margins can be like 90% in some cases. Exactly.</p>
<p data-start="1937.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Exactly. Not usually</p>
<p data-start="1937.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Exactly. Not usually for a commodity like Tylenol, but- But</p>
<p data-start="1939.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> But this is just it. How hard is it to make, you</p>
<p data-start="1940.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> is just</p>
<p data-start="1942.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, what</p>
<p data-start="1943.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> what is it, acetaminophen or whatever? What's in Tylenol?</p>
<p data-start="1945.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Tylenol? Yeah, that's Tylenol. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1947.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I mean, how hard is it to make? It's nothing. It's nothing. This is a known compound that everybody's been making. And you just have to, like, holy shit, 75 million of it?</p>
<p data-start="1960.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I can't imagine how much real Tylenol you'd be able to buy for that.</p>
<p data-start="1965.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just insanity. A</p>
<p data-start="1965.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> insanity.</p>
<p data-start="1966.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> A lot.</p>
<p data-start="1967.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just insanity.</p>
<p data-start="1969.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay. My point is just simply this.</p>
<p data-start="1969.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. My point</p>
<p data-start="1971.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. That when you start to deal with numbers that are that large, the</p>
<p data-start="1971.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. That when</p>
<p data-start="1974.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the amount of incentive to</p>
<p data-start="1976.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> to actually start</p>
<p data-start="1976.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> actually start</p>
<p data-start="1978.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> to</p>
<p data-start="1978.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> to behave or misbehave becomes insane.</p>
<p data-start="1982.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> It is insane.</p>
<p data-start="1982.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> insane.</p>
<p data-start="1983.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Which is why for contract, the bigger the contract, the more safeguards you put on it. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1988.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Absolutely. So that is why you don't have people being</p>
<p data-start="1990.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> is why you don't have people being directed from the premier's office to</p>
<p data-start="1993.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> to hand out on</p>
<p data-start="1994.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> on</p>
<p data-start="1994.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> on</p>
<p data-start="1994.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> on half a billion dollar contracts. Well, if if that were to happen, like we again, we don't know. I just want to be really clear on that. Right. There are a bunch of things that are stated.</p>
<p data-start="1996.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, if</p>
<p data-start="2001.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> are a</p>
<p data-start="2004.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Nobody knows. But now the Premier's Office is going to have to deal with this. At the very least, there's going to be an Auditor General report.</p>
<p data-start="2009.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know what, Corey?</p>
<p data-start="2010.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> At that point. I</p>
<p data-start="2012.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> think we've made a real mistake here.</p>
<p data-start="2014.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Doing this podcast. I think we should</p>
<p data-start="2017.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think we should have assumed that she was guilty.</p>
<p data-start="2020.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> We might have been a little more careful.</p>
<p data-start="2022.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We might have been a little bit more careful with our words.</p>
<p data-start="2025.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> But by presuming she was innocent, now we put ourselves in a real pickle.</p>
<p data-start="2029.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, we've actually caused more problems that way. It's a great point. OK, we touched on it briefly, the Nenshi response, which is almost like the</p>
<p data-start="2036.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the Nenshi response,</p>
<p data-start="2039.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> the Nenshi response came before the,</p>
<p data-start="2041.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> the, you</p>
<p data-start="2042.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know,</p>
<p data-start="2042.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2042.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2042.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2043.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2043.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> know, the premier's rejoinder, I guess we'll call it. But</p>
<p data-start="2046.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> thing with the Nenshi response is the man has never found a way to say two</p>
<p data-start="2051.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> words when 200 will suffice.</p>
<p data-start="2055.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> It</p>
<p data-start="2057.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> lacks a soundbite, doesn't it? Jared Wesley, who said that the definition of a real scandal is one that can be written in a single tweet.</p>
<p data-start="2057.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> lacks a soundbite, doesn't it? Jared</p>
<p data-start="2060.0"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> Jared</p>
<p data-start="2060.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Jared Wesley, who said</p>
<p data-start="2060.7"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> said</p>
<p data-start="2067.7"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="2067.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> And then he wrote the single tweet about</p>
<p data-start="2069.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> about this particular scandal.</p>
<p data-start="2072.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I don't have it in front of me. I don't want to misquote him. But</p>
<p data-start="2077.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> it was a banger of a tweet.</p>
<p data-start="2080.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I thought to myself, you know what? You</p>
<p data-start="2083.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> know who should have written that tweet?</p>
<p data-start="2085.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Nahid Nenshi should have written that tweet. that tweet he would have yeah he would have had the ability to define this entire thing i got a note from christina gray today which makes no sense to me at all this is a leader all the way issue i</p>
<p data-start="2100.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i got a quote i got an email from christina gray that was paragraphs long explaining</p>
<p data-start="2104.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> explaining this whole thing to me if you take paragraphs to explain this you are losing this war yeah</p>
<p data-start="2105.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> this whole</p>
<p data-start="2112.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> like wesley's tweet which i just pulled up here is allegedly you know so this is him stating like like this is how you would summarize it in one tweet right be the scandal right jesus we should have started with this can i say can we we should have started with this do you want allegedly yeah</p>

<p data-start="2188.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> So those are the allegations. And so this is the challenges that we're now facing here. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2193.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> So here we are. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2195.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're now talking about Nenshi. Nenshi's response wasn't pithy.</p>
<p data-start="2200.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> It was, however, I think, a pretty good prosecutorial laying out of the case. I actually thought he was pretty good. I think</p>
<p data-start="2205.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> actually thought he was pretty good. I think if we had 12 jurors in a box who</p>
<p data-start="2209.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> who had to pay attention, right,</p>
<p data-start="2212.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> right, at the risk of the judge throwing them out and into jail for contempt, I</p>
<p data-start="2218.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I think</p>
<p data-start="2218.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think those 12 people would have paid attention. All</p>
<p data-start="2220.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> All right. Tell</p>
<p data-start="2221.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> me I'm wrong. You're not wrong. Tell me I'm wrong. And your point about like the emails and all of this, it's true. And actually, I'll say another challenge people have with, with allegations of scandal like this is the longer your, your explanation, the more you come off, like you've lost your mind, right? That you're just piecing together random things. And like, you're picking up this piece of the scandal and that piece of the scandal. And, and what Jared points out, I think rightly is like when you can put succinctly and everyone like just sort of gets it like, oh, that's it. Like, that's the scandal.</p>
<p data-start="2241.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And like,</p>
<p data-start="2256.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's the real power. And the power of</p>
<p data-start="2257.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> And the power of this needs to be this needs to be the defining factor. Right. We need to learn from Pierre Polyev on this. Right. Pierre Polyev has said this is where, you know, the carbon tax, the carbon tax, the carbon tax. And it's all been the carbon tax. And of course, the weakness of that is now the carbon tax is gone. But this scandal never goes away. This scandal is there for the remaining two and a half years of Danielle Smith's tenure. And if you do this right, if you set this up properly and you start just simply saying a half a billion dollars for a few hockey tickets and Lord knows what else.</p>
<p data-start="2293.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. They</p>
<p data-start="2294.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> got a half a billion dollars in the contracts, Corey, for a few hockey tickets and Lord knows what else. See</p>
<p data-start="2301.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> what I did there?</p>
<p data-start="2302.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I do. And, you know, in many ways, I think that Smith's tweet about defamatory allegations was aimed at an audience of one. yeah</p>
<p data-start="2310.9"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2310.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah and it</p>
<p data-start="2311.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> and it wasn't you i think it was not hidden in she i think that she was trying to imply that she would sue not head for oh that would be spectacular i</p>
<p data-start="2317.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> be spectacular</p>
<p data-start="2317.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> spectacular i</p>
<p data-start="2317.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="2318.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="2318.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> i mean it would be wild you</p>
<p data-start="2320.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know what this scandal this quote-unquote this alleged scandal needs though what</p>
<p data-start="2323.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> what nickname</p>
<p data-start="2324.8"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> nickname right</p>
<p data-start="2326.2"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> right oh</p>
<p data-start="2326.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh it needs a gate i don't</p>
<p data-start="2327.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't hate the gate or i</p>
<p data-start="2328.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> gate or i don't you know it doesn't need to be a gate it could be something like smith backs instead of kickbacks that's not a good one it's not a good</p>
<p data-start="2334.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> good one</p>
<p data-start="2335.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> one you</p>
<p data-start="2335.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2335.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2335.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2335.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know what we you know this is where we really need zane he</p>
<p data-start="2339.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> can</p>
<p data-start="2339.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> can be pithy he</p>
<p data-start="2340.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> he can be can</p>
<p data-start="2342.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> can he that's</p>
<p data-start="2343.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> not been my experience no actually you know what now that</p>
<p data-start="2344.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> no actually you know what now that i'm thinking about it yeah</p>
<p data-start="2346.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah the</p>
<p data-start="2347.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> the this is one of the joys of doing the carter and hogan episodes right</p>
<p data-start="2350.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> right like look at this sucker 39</p>
<p data-start="2352.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> 39 minutes in 39</p>
<p data-start="2354.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> 39 one</p>
<p data-start="2354.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> one take yeah</p>
<p data-start="2356.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah so so much rich content here okay god</p>
<p data-start="2357.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> so so</p>
<p data-start="2360.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> god so</p>
<p data-start="2361.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> so where do the ndp go from here they</p>
<p data-start="2363.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> they need</p>
<p data-start="2363.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> need</p>
<p data-start="2363.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> need What do they do now? They</p>
<p data-start="2363.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> they do now? They need to start over. They need to define this again and make this a Nahid Nenshi exclusive and just go at it every single day. And then when they get into the legislature, they've got to go at it every single day. There is nothing else but this. There is no concern. Like, today there was an open house talking about the coal mining on the eastern slopes. Interesting. Fantastic. Another situation, I would totally be behind it. In fact, I'm</p>
<p data-start="2393.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> the eastern slopes.</p>
<p data-start="2400.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm behind it. I don't think that there should be coal mining on the eastern slopes of the Canadian Rockies. Does not fucking matter. matter only thing that matters is danielle smith and her government gave a half a billion dollars worth of work to a company that in exchange it appears or or the</p>
<p data-start="2403.2"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> eastern slopes</p>
<p data-start="2420.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> same company that gave them</p>
<p data-start="2420.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> same company</p>
<p data-start="2422.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> hockey tickets you</p>
<p data-start="2423.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know the ndp what else</p>
<p data-start="2423.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> know the ndp what else</p>
<p data-start="2424.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> else</p>
<p data-start="2425.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> else figure</p>
<p data-start="2425.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> figure out a phrasing that gives you that legal shield and you use that exact same phrasing every single</p>
<p data-start="2429.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> single like</p>
<p data-start="2430.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> single like</p>
<p data-start="2431.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> like you don't need to struggle the way steven and i are to talk about being allegations just find the way to say it and say it right i think</p>
<p data-start="2431.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> like</p>
<p data-start="2436.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right i think i said it better earlier uh</p>
<p data-start="2438.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh you know you</p>
<p data-start="2439.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know but</p>
<p data-start="2439.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> but then you i saw the look on your face you went a little green yeah</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i was like</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i was like well maybe i'm a little close to getting sued well you know</p>
<p data-start="2445.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> well you know this is a podcast that we're gonna have to run by lawyers but it's not like the lawyers are gonna write the podcast so you know we're still in that ground we're okay no we're not gonna run this by you know</p>
<p data-start="2451.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know we're still in that ground we're</p>
<p data-start="2455.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> know who we should call jonathan</p>
<p data-start="2457.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> dennis i</p>
<p data-start="2458.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> hear he's got some free time he's got some free</p>
<p data-start="2460.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> he's got some free time and he's still still</p>
<p data-start="2462.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> still a lawyer</p>
<p data-start="2464.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> qc casey i guess casey now yeah yeah</p>

<p data-start="2472.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah you</p>
<p data-start="2473.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> exactly it makes it it's hilarious yeah</p>
<p data-start="2475.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah we're</p>
<p data-start="2476.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> we're of a certain age when we come up with kc and the sunshine</p>
<p data-start="2480.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> how many how many people in our podcast listening i</p>
<p data-start="2481.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> people in</p>
<p data-start="2482.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> i mean actually probably a lot of them yeah you know that's just life hey so okay we should promote the discord though</p>
<p data-start="2483.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean actually probably a</p>
<p data-start="2484.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah you know</p>
<p data-start="2487.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> we should promote the discord though we should promote you know being a patron yeah</p>
<p data-start="2491.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah six dollars get the discord have we done this is lit</p>
<p data-start="2494.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is lit you guys You guys got to be on that. You</p>
<p data-start="2496.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> got to be on</p>
<p data-start="2497.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> You got to be on the Discord. You got to find your way to the Discord.</p>
<p data-start="2500.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're breaking stuff there all the time. Okay. So we got the Nenshi response, the</p>
<p data-start="2506.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> NDP response, we're going to call it. We've got Smith in a bit of trouble. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2509.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2510.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="2510.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. How</p>
<p data-start="2511.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> about the media? What do you do if you're the media? Now, where do you go? First of all, let us give</p>
<p data-start="2515.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> First of all, let us give props to Carrie Tate for breaking the story. Once</p>
<p data-start="2520.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Once again. For getting</p>
<p data-start="2520.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Once</p>
<p data-start="2521.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> For getting the information. Because</p>
<p data-start="2521.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> information. Because we did that, but we can do it again. We're</p>
<p data-start="2523.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> again. We're doing it again. We're giving props because props are free. And that's the type of stuff that we give away. You</p>
<p data-start="2528.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know what? Free shit. Unlike the Discord, which is $6. Props are free. Props are free.</p>
<p data-start="2531.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> which is $6.</p>
<p data-start="2532.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Props are free. Props are free.</p>
<p data-start="2534.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Problem</p>
<p data-start="2536.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> is, how much more can they continue to invest in it? It's the Globe and Mail. If this was post-media, this thing would be over already.</p>
<p data-start="2546.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's the Globe and Mail, so I suspect that we're going to see an awful lot more chasing by Carrie Tate and her colleagues. And they're going to go after this like shit on a stick. No, they're going to go after this like... Is that a saying</p>
<p data-start="2557.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> this like... Is that a saying that anyone has ever used before? No, I'm</p>
<p data-start="2559.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> used before? No, I'm lost on my sayings. I</p>
<p data-start="2563.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know what idiom to use.</p>
<p data-start="2565.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Wow. Okay. Here's the thing. Shit on a stick. I think they're going to continue to do it, and they're going to continue to push, and they're going to find more stuff. Because I think, you</p>
<p data-start="2565.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Wow. Okay. Here's the thing.</p>
<p data-start="2567.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Shit on a stick.</p>
<p data-start="2577.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, Carrie Tate has been the one who's been the closest to this UCP government and seeing how they actually are working. And it's no surprise to me that she's the one who's broken the story.</p>
<p data-start="2588.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. you talked about one more thing i wanted to try to get in there which is this is not the only thing that the ucp is dealing with right now right and so the coal mining oh yeah is</p>
<p data-start="2598.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> is also getting pretty big mla is having to cancel coffees with constituents and whatnot because there's so many angry constituents out there yeah</p>
<p data-start="2605.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah who</p>
<p data-start="2605.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> who do not want to see it's</p>
<p data-start="2606.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's a seven eastern slopes seven</p>
<p data-start="2607.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> seven eastern slopes seven to three issue yeah</p>
<p data-start="2609.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah right</p>
<p data-start="2610.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> right like it is a big fucking issue and and danielle has tried to hide it um Maybe tried too hard to hide it because she unleashed this AHS thing. But this is the</p>
<p data-start="2621.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> coal mine stuff is huge. If</p>
<p data-start="2624.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> If they go ahead with this, they're going to have they're</p>
<p data-start="2624.6"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> If they go</p>
<p data-start="2629.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> going to have a lot of angry constituents. And I don't know that the NDP can win in every place it's going to be angry, but I suspect that they can win in some. And</p>
<p data-start="2639.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I don't know if you followed the last election, Corey,</p>
<p data-start="2639.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> I don't</p>
<p data-start="2643.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> but it was pretty close. Pretty</p>
<p data-start="2645.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Pretty close. It's pretty close.</p>
<p data-start="2646.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> pretty close.</p>
<p data-start="2647.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> A few hundred more votes here, a few hundred more votes there. Suddenly, Rachel Notley's not practicing law. I'm just saying.</p>
<p data-start="2650.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Rachel</p>
<p data-start="2654.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, it's interesting to me because you wouldn't normally think that the ridings on the Rockies, with the exception of Banff-Canmore or Banff-Cochrane, whatever it's called now, right, is</p>
<p data-start="2666.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> in play. But this</p>
<p data-start="2669.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> this could at least mess things up for the UCP in some challenging</p>
<p data-start="2673.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> challenging ways, right, where they're playing some defense. fence and and certainly it's one of those issues that while it's intensely felt in the communities that are affected it's also felt in the cities like you don't have to work real hard to walk</p>
<p data-start="2685.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> walk around calgary and see signs where people are mad about this i mean one of the reasons people like to live here for those of you not here is the proximity to the rocky mountains and the and you know the landscapes and the outdoor living never</p>
<p data-start="2697.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> never been my thing no</p>
<p data-start="2699.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> no i'm not really sure why i'm here I mean, maybe</p>
<p data-start="2699.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> really sure why i'm here I mean, maybe</p>
<p data-start="2701.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> maybe</p>
<p data-start="2701.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> maybe that's</p>
<p data-start="2701.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's why Zane can't record.</p>
<p data-start="2703.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Maybe he's lost in the Rockies.</p>
<p data-start="2706.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Maybe. He would</p>
<p data-start="2706.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> He would be having a hard time finding his way out. You</p>
<p data-start="2706.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> be having</p>
<p data-start="2709.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know what? It's both not at all likely, but very likely if he tried. Yeah, exactly. I heard one time</p>
<p data-start="2713.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I heard one time he went to Canmore. I was worried for him.</p>
<p data-start="2717.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2718.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah. Canmore is like a city, but even then I am worried. They still call</p>
<p data-start="2722.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> They still call it the town of Canmore, hey?</p>
<p data-start="2724.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Do they? What a fraud. They're trying, but it's a city now. What a fraud. It's</p>
<p data-start="2726.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> but it's a city now. What a fraud. It's a city for sure.</p>
<p data-start="2729.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> It's a city for sure? Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2729.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2731.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay, so we didn't say anything substantive about coal mining, but It's</p>
<p data-start="2734.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's bad.</p>
<p data-start="2738.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. There</p>
<p data-start="2738.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> There you go.</p>
<p data-start="2739.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Strong ending.</p>
<p data-start="2740.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> is this the end?</p>
<p data-start="2742.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Do you have anything else to say? I</p>
<p data-start="2747.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> thought you looked good tonight.</p>
<p data-start="2749.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p data-start="2749.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you. I'm</p>
<p data-start="2753.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> not returning that compliment. I'm</p>
<p data-start="2755.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm wearing my sweater.</p>
<p data-start="2758.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, is that what that is?</p>
<p data-start="2782.4"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> They're</p>
<p data-start="2794.9"><strong>SPEAKER_01:</strong> here to give you the takes and you're here for them.</p>
