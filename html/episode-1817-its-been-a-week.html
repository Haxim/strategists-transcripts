  <div class="said">three three points i totally would understand right three points because they were spying on new zealand uh so they had an advantage on new zealand i totally get that but they didn&#x27;t have an advantage on france when they kicked their ass today there was no advantage to the uh to the canadian women&#x27;s soccer team uh they sent home all the coaches were involved i mean six points that&#x27;s a punishment on the athletes when this was a uh a crime committed by the uh the nso and the coaches that they employ.</div>

  <div class="said">the shit out of my Corey, this was a mistake on my part, clearly, walking into that analogy. You know, even though it&#x27;s true, we did actually use some of our Patreon dollars to buy a drone and send it across the country to another podcast. In fact, Team Canada Women&#x27;s Soccer is copying a strategy that is well known in the strategist&#x27;s playbook.</div>

But let&#x27;s start with the, I wanted to talk about Kamala Harris, how the Democrats have fallen in line just so quickly. It seems like it&#x27;s been a month. It&#x27;s been a week. The excitement continues. We talked about the money and the initial excitement. I want to talk about what this sort of like media narrative and the media attention that the campaign has been getting, and including social media, I should say, over the last week means for the campaign. Have they set this impossibly behind bar for themselves? We&#x27;ll talk about all that sort of stuff. But can we start with the J.D. Vance stuff? Because as much as I want to make fun of J.D. Vance, the memification of Vance, which is going on last week, it was Diet Mountain Dew, which led to the cantaloupe talk on our part. This week, it&#x27;s this thing about, you know, couches and childless cat women that he&#x27;s kind of talking about. I&#x27;d be scared if</div>

And so then he went to try to find a picture of it to reference. And so he searched for the things that he thought would lead him back to that story so that he could effectively do a quote tweet.

And Corey, I want to ask you the same thing, because I find that to be really fascinating. We can talk about the tactics of the press releases, these three liners being like, this creep went out today and said some really weird stuff like i&#x27;m paraphrasing but that&#x27;s kind of their their new tone of the press releases especially around jd carter do you like it and is it effective</div>

It&#x27;s a running down the drain. But I also acknowledge that Donald Trump has found an awful lot of success this way.

And then it said, I am Kamala Harris, and I approve this message. And the internet guffawed and laughed and went nuts about it. Joe Biden did the exact same thing four months ago with a very similar Donald Trump clip. And nobody gave a shit, because Joe Biden is an 81-year-old man who nobody believes is actually on top of social media. So a lot of it is, I</div>

And that, to me, absolves you in some respects of the actual sin that Corey&#x27;s kind of focused on of doing the negative. I disagree. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a sin to doing negative.

I don&#x27;t think anyone does, right? But it&#x27;s the stuff about J.D. Vance. Then there&#x27;s also like the memes of Kamala Harris, the ones of previous clips, interviews, speeches, etc. And here&#x27;s one thing I found interesting about that, is the larger suite of memes about her on Twitter, on Instagram, are trying to spin what would be conventionally seen as a negative. her charisma, which is certainly there. And man, oh man, she had a killer week. But</div>

All this is is Kamala Harris getting her people out there, and this is more organic.

Today&#x27;s actually 100 days to the election. We record on Sunday night. Today&#x27;s 100 days.

This is almost like how do you try to capitalize on your success without having to keep going with all of this success in the same way? That&#x27;s a question that someone might phrase much more articulately than I have to you guys in the HQ today, being like, fuck, this is great, but I wish the election were tomorrow in some ways.

Maybe you need that moment, that jolt in the arm where people can just get really excited and propel themselves to the next exciting thing. thing. And so if I&#x27;m in the Harris campaign, if I&#x27;m sitting there saying, okay, we got 100 days to go, armed with these lessons, I am thinking to myself, some tactical like, well, okay, well, how do we make sure that we always have that feeling of fresh legs?

It&#x27;s been a week. By the way, tightening, still losing to Donald Trump. Still losing, still a lot of work to do. But the viability seems a lot higher than it was for Joe Biden, which I think is a fair statement. Carter, do you have the ability to go under the radar?

Once we get through the convention, once the, I&#x27;m sorry, first thing they&#x27;re going to do is name their vice presidential pick. Then they&#x27;ve got their August 6th roll call. Then they&#x27;ve got their convention. Then they&#x27;ve got everything is going to go boom, boom, boom, boom, right? After Labor Day, it starts to get a little tricky, but from between September the 15th and September the 30th, because there&#x27;s nothing really organic happening. Well, okay, well, what do we manufacture? What can we manufacture? And that is the way that campaigns are won. And the other way that I used to describe it is never let your opponents get oxygen.

They don&#x27;t want Pierre Poliev. What snapped Americans to attention was a change of candidates, an assassination attempt, RNC convention, because it&#x27;s not just that Harris&#x27;s positives are bigger than Biden&#x27;s. Trump&#x27;s negatives increased with exposure over that time. As people pay attention, the results can change pretty significantly.

They want to be proud of the whole thing they got going down there.
