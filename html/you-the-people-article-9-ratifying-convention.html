  <div class="said">It was the tale of two conventions, one on the heels of an unsuccessful assassination attempt, the other on the heels of a replacement coup. One of the conventions featured muscle in the form of UFC president Dana White and washed up professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, while the second featured power performers like Pink, Stevie Wonder, John Legend, and the Chicks. Each convention brought their own version of the power couples. The Trumps, although Molina really didn&#x27;t show up. J.D. Vance and his couch. While the Democrats field couples like Bill and Hillary, Michelle and Barack, and Oprah Winfrey and Gayle.</div>

And not even because they&#x27;re better, but because just by weight, more of the activity happens there.</div>

You know, a Canadian, a big Canadian convention is 2,000 or 3,000 people. It&#x27;s just not the same. Although, who knows how big the convention is going to be in November. eh? Huh?

  <div class="said">Let me ask you, though. So, like, what did you think, like, when you compared, when you think back, and I chose some, I think, some rather egregious examples, but when you think back to the Republican convention, are there speakers that jump out at you beyond the Dana White and the Hulk Hogan moments? Or, like, I was really struggling to kind of come up with a list of speakers that really anybody noticed in the Republican National Convention. convention no</div>

    <span class="ts">7:12</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">okay i&#x27;m gonna say no but i&#x27;m gonna put two caveats on that first of all i wasn&#x27;t nearly as engaged in the republican convention i just wasn&#x27;t and</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">7:25</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">kind of felt for a minute like maybe this was all over right well biden was still in and that but second of all also my most lingering memory of the rnc i I have to say, is the people who were wearing bandages on their ears in solidarity with Trump. I just cannot understand that energy, but that&#x27;s fine. Second of all, I do think that the Democrats are just better at this stuff. You know, there&#x27;s more Hollywood connections, there&#x27;s more entertainment industry, there&#x27;s more design industry. The spectacle of the DNC is something that the Republican, first of all, I think it was just the best DNC I&#x27;ve ever seen in terms of and packageability in television, but</div>

<div class="turn" data-start="484">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">8:04</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">they&#x27;re always better than the Republican one. The Republican one always feels a little dark. The red light that promenades through everything because it&#x27;s the Republicans and red&#x27;s their color these days, it creates this dour energy. I don&#x27;t know. It was much more cheerful in Chicago.</div>

    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">8:22</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">That&#x27;s so funny because blue light traditionally is seen as cold, and red light is generally seen as warm. and it seems to have the opposite impact uh at the dnc versus the rnc this is my you know theater training coming back to haunt haunt me</div>

  <div class="said">I&#x27;ll find the specifics in a minute here. I thought I knew exactly where they were, but I do not. Here&#x27;s Here&#x27;s the rough data. Let&#x27;s call this the simple fact. Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, both were ahead of Donald Trump by more at this point in the cycle. There&#x27;s no question that Kamala Harris has really turned around the polls for the Democrats, pulled them up a significant amount in the past month.</div>

  <div class="said">still kind of a toss-up. You can certainly argue the most recent polls do put Kamala Harris in the lead, but it&#x27;s by like this, you know, just like razor thin, and Donald Trump has historically outperformed his polls. So as much as there&#x27;s this jubilance in the Democratic movement, should there be? Is there any this here? Or are we just, they were so down in the dumps, and now they&#x27;ve managed to pull themselves back up into a horse race?</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah, I think they&#x27;re back to where they should have been, right? I think that they&#x27;re back to the horse race, that the age of the primary candidate is no longer the anvil that was dragging the campaign down. But they&#x27;re back to where they should be. They&#x27;re not 1% higher than they should be. They&#x27;re at the 3% mark that is, you know, in the polling averages that is kind of anticipated between the, you know, at the national polling level. But that&#x27;s no good. You can win this election by 3% and still lose the Electoral College. And that&#x27;s where, you know, I&#x27;ve been doing 270 to win, you know, like some sort of drug addict, trying to figure out exactly how she gets to 270 electoral college votes, because that&#x27;s really all that matters. Winning the popular vote, well, we&#x27;ve seen a couple of times where winning the popular vote doesn&#x27;t really matter. Hillary Clinton lost, and so did, who lost to Bush? Al Gore. Al Gore lost. So just winning the popular vote isn&#x27;t going to be enough.</div>

I&#x27;ve seen averages where she&#x27;s up as much as four, right? Yeah.

It seemed to be supported by staff because there were semi-coherent thoughts put out, but he was live tweeting or live truthing, whatever his truth social network is, the speech by Kamala Harris last night. And clearly, clearly he is reacting to this in a way that&#x27;s different from how he he reacted to Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden, where at those times he had, it was always still chaotic Trump energy. It was always still asshole energy, but it was a confident asshole. You don&#x27;t get confident asshole from this guy anymore. You get, you get somebody who seems quasi panicked about everything that&#x27;s going on. My God, he even, he said nice things about the governor of Georgia yesterday, who he fucking hates. Right. But Kemp is a Republican governor. It&#x27;s a close race. And And all of a sudden, I think he&#x27;s starting to find Republican religion on this. The biggest sign to me that this is real is Donald Trump&#x27;s reaction. And I don&#x27;t know if that makes any sense because I don&#x27;t have any confidence this guy has a thought</div>

But what if Harris is living her bump right now? What if 1.5 points up today in this aggregator, others I&#x27;ve seen as high as four, right? What if this is her bump?

  <div class="said">know first of all the former president doing it on the stage is maybe maybe a little bit newer but we didn&#x27;t have around the clock coverage of some of these others like Truman, right? Like LBJ, man who famously said, call him a pig fucker and make him deny it. Do we really think that this is somehow a worsening of that relative to the times? You could argue that Barack Obama&#x27;s dick joke, very tame by 2024 standards. LBJ&#x27;s comments back in the 50s, 60s, not so tame relative to those standards. So I don&#x27;t know. I just want want to challenge your assumption there a little bit but on the on the question of whether if trump is gone everything goes back to normal the answer is like an emphatic no absolutely not right he&#x27;s created a blueprint that other people are going to pick up there are enough mini trumps around who have seen the components of trump like how many republicans out there do you think are thinking if trump just did the same things but did this a little different he&#x27;d be he could take over this this fucking country, right? I&#x27;m sure J.D. Vance is one of them. I&#x27;m sure Vivek Ramaswamy is one of them. I think at this point, we&#x27;ve just had too long of a period of incubation for this. And it&#x27;s not even like the Trump movement came from, the mega movement sort of came from the Tea Party movement, came from some of the Newt Gingrich tactics of the 90s. There&#x27;s a pretty straight line that takes you all the way back to Nixon if you&#x27;re really looking for it in terms of what the Republicans are doing here. So what, do I think one person going away is going to change that? I don&#x27;t. You know, I also believe in my core.</div>

Right. And for example, North Carolina, Stein is continuing to destroy the the opposition, the governor opposition. And so the Democrats continue to be five points up and the Democrats aren&#x27;t five points up in the in the presidential race. But I do think that that&#x27;s their high watermark. I think that the high-water mark for the Democrats is to lift themselves back up to the Senate standings, right? So Bob Casey in Pennsylvania is up by five to seven points. I mean, Mark Kelly in Arizona is winning. Nevada is going Democrat for the—in fact, everything as far as Montana. Tester just recently had a poll that put him up by five points over his competitor in the Senate race. There is a very real possibility in what can only be described as a devastating map for the Democrats Senate wise. They could even they might they might they might they might hold the Senate.

  <div class="said">if they hold the Senate, then it seems impossible to me that Harris would actually lose because the high watermark of the Senate remains the the objective goal or the objective reality. Yeah. You know, a reality, a real point where I think that Harris can get to. Do you think that that&#x27;s attainable or do you think that I&#x27;m just kind of talking, you know, wishful thinking that that these these known known governor, you know, known Senate candidates are reaching are too high and too far out of the scope for for for Kamala Harris?</div>

  <div class="said">Well, but I&#x27;m only all I&#x27;m doing is adding one seat in the Senate test. Right. Right. Because right now the polling has forty nine relatively strong, you know, Democratic seats. The only one that&#x27;s up in the air is Montana. Well,</div>

And I think it&#x27;s interesting that the Democrats might be able to, for those who are not as keyed into, I think there&#x27;s pretty basic Senate knowledge, but I&#x27;ll just say it anyways, the Senate, only a third of the seats are up for election every six years. And every other House of Representatives seat is up for election in the United States over two years. Yeah, it&#x27;s not a great seat for them. Sometimes there&#x27;s good years for the Senate. Sometimes there&#x27;s bad years. They&#x27;re defending. They&#x27;re on the offense. You know, this should be a year where the Democrats lose. Looks like it could be a year where the Democrats hold on. But to pull it to your previous thought, you were saying, is everything good if Donald Trump&#x27;s gone?

And do you really think they will have, quote unquote, learned a lesson at that particular moment? If it&#x27;s a 50-50 Senate, do you think they&#x27;re going to learn the lesson? And I agree with you that this is probably as good as it&#x27;s going to get for the Democrats at this moment. But that&#x27;s also in some ways a little discouraging, right?

There&#x27;s a vice presidential debate, which normally I would say who cares, but I&#x27;d say Walls has had a level of celebrity a a little beyond what I expected. And certainly Vance has been in the discourse more than I think Trump had hoped. So maybe that&#x27;ll be a bit more likely to be another debate, I would imagine.</div>

I think both of those are improbable, if not impossible, because Putin and Netanyahu are both basically holding out, hoping for a Trump victory. They&#x27;re not going to give the Democrats that type of victory. But I think that that&#x27;s really the other one. Now, I think that Those are the known inflection points. Where things could be interesting is the unknown inflection points. The thing that happens on the campaign trail that changes everything. And we&#x27;ve seen those, you know, Alison Redford had a staffer say that Danielle Smith couldn&#x27;t understand family issues because she didn&#x27;t have her own kids.

  <div class="said">always is but i kind of agree you know No, I mean, again, recency bias, and there are conventions that mean more to me personally than I&#x27;ve been to, but it certainly showcased a deep bench. To your point, there did seem to be a very generous sharing of spotlight. I don&#x27;t know, I mean, maybe that&#x27;s more of our, maybe it&#x27;s simply because we knew that the Biden convention was trying to do things like have the roll call weeks in advance and all of that. And there was like this defensiveness that was at the core of it. For somebody who basically walked into the convention, having not even been a possibility to be candidate three weeks earlier, four weeks earlier, I thought that the ease with which that spotlight was shared was pretty remarkable, pretty significant. Really well produced, really entertaining convention as far as political conventions go. Did really show a deep bench, lots of great speakers. Certainly, if you&#x27;re a Democrat, you&#x27;re thinking pretty bright future, some pretty incredible talent up there.</div>

  <div class="said">But, you know, best convention ever is in the eye of the beholder. Was it the most substantive convention? No, not remotely, right, in terms of policy. And I don&#x27;t know if this is going to set America on a different course. Was this the convention that brought together and really rebalanced the, you know, one of these moments in American history where everything gets flipped up and maybe there&#x27;s new parties and there&#x27;s new people and there&#x27;s new approaches? No, I don&#x27;t really think so. But if your goal was to capture attention and entertain, I don&#x27;t know how this is not the best convention.</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, but this is being compared and contrasted, I think, to the 1968 DNC in Chicago. where all the anti-war protesters came and disrupted and there was a threat that there was going to be the the Palestinian pro, you know, the pro-Palestinian protesters coming out, being met by pro-Israeli protesters. You know, this was going to to create chaos at the convention. None of that happened.</div>

  <div class="said">none of that happened. And and not only did none of that happen, it seemed that they were prepared for it. There were comments, you know, Joe Biden said, those protesters out there, they&#x27;ve got a point, right? Like he recognized and brought in that side of it. And even with the specter of these Palestinian protesters and potential Israeli or Jewish responses, it just never really materialized. Everybody just seemed to, I mean, there were protests, but it was pretty run-of-the-mill. It certainly wasn&#x27;t 1968.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">38:12</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, look, I&#x27;m not sure that could ever happen again. A modern political event, especially if it involves the vice president of the United States, but just in general, there are, I mean, even in Canada, there&#x27;s so many guardrails on them. Really big police presence, really big security presence, free speech zones, quote unquote. quote, you know, they&#x27;ve been rebranded and renamed, but largely it comes to you can protest over there, you cannot protest over here. Because there are so many security and police, if something starts to look like it&#x27;s going to go south, they will act promptly before it even has the opportunity to become a scene. And that&#x27;s true in a lot of jurisdictions. And we&#x27;re not driven there exclusively because people don&#x27;t like the optics of it. We started this talking about the fact that somebody took a shot at Donald Trump just weeks ago, right? Right. There are legitimate security concerns because a bullet can undo the will of 300 million people like that, you know, and that&#x27;s a pretty scary thought when you think about it. So I just don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;re going to see that again. 68 was chaos. We had so many political assassinations around that time, too. People started saying, we&#x27;ve got to do this a little bit differently. And that&#x27;s unfortunate in many ways. Free speech certainly took a dent, but I just don&#x27;t think that it was ever going to be like 68. I think that was a weird thing for people to be thinking about. And I think some Republicans were almost wishing it would occur that way. Some Democrats were living in fear. But this</div>
