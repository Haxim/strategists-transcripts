  <title>Episode 1813: Cowboy cowardice | The Strategists</title>

  
  

  <meta name="description" content="The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth begins, but without regular guest Justin Trudeau - who, with his premiership under fire, skips the ten day festival to go to a four day meeting.Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss challenges - explicit, implicit and accidental - to Justin Trudeau&#39;s leadership, and Trudeau&#39;s decision to skip the Calgary Stampede. Has a bunker mentality set in at the PMO? Do attempts at caucus management risk making the caucus unmanageable? And why did none of the gang make a joke about the Flair Airlines Stampede Party serving half glasses of ginger ale and tiny pretzels? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line." />

We need to do better on housing, better on affordability, but we&#x27;re united behind Justin Trudeau.</div>

  <div class="said">Let&#x27;s talk about the Justin Trudeau saga, Corey Hogan. One of the questions that&#x27;s been, you know, dogging at me since the time we got to record last is, why the refusal to meet with the National Caucus? This is a fascinating strategic question for me. And there is probably some strategy behind I just can&#x27;t see it. So what do you think in your mind? Start with your thoughts on this, Corey. It&#x27;s been well reported that Trudeau has been wishy-washy, outright rejecting, not accepting, right, to add a third word, of wanting to meet with his national caucus. Why would he not want to do that, Corey?</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">yeah well i guess first of all the charitable reason it would arguably be because this is a moment where everybody is really in their feelings and he just wants a little bit of space and he wants everybody to calm down so they can have a rational not panicked conversation about what has to come and that&#x27;s probably more manageable in his mind if it&#x27;s done in small groups where the overall weight of the conversation can be managed where you have a number of supportive voices in there as well as a few of the skies falling people and this sense that if you have 10 skies falling people in a caucus of 150 but they&#x27;re all talking one after the other that might feed a bit of panic and feed some of the anxieties that exist with the other members and he just doesn&#x27;t want that right and so he thinks this is a conversation to have but not at this moment that&#x27;s my charitable okay that&#x27;s my charity the more realistic read is he thinks it&#x27;s going to hurt him and he doesn&#x27;t want to get hurt and it&#x27;s as simple as that but you know there&#x27;s there&#x27;s always of course a bit of a challenge with that because if it starts to look like you&#x27;re avoiding that kind of accountability that can exacerbate the problem too the least charitable read and i do want to throw it on the table as well is simply people are asking him to do it and he says this is an affront i&#x27;m the leader i get to decide these things and it is a weakening of me if other people are calling caucus meetings. And the least charitable read is it&#x27;s kind of a petulant reaction to a request for a caucus meeting. Because you know who normally requests a caucus meeting? Someone trying to give you a hard time.</div>

It went so bad that the parents that were there, we were trying to manage them so that you would speak in small groups to the trustees. The parents that were there pulled out the bleachers in the gymnasium and demanded that the trustees start talking to them. We literally evacuated the trustees into a hallway. This was all over school lunch programs. I mean, like, it was a fucking gong show. Corey, dude. So people aren&#x27;t reasonable, and especially they&#x27;re not reasonable in groups</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah. And so that is part of the problem, though, Zane, right? On one hand, of course, your caucus needs to be managed. Of course, you can&#x27;t do stupid things that are going to get you abuse at caucus. But it can never feel like you&#x27;re managing the caucus. And so one of the interesting things that they are now having to contend with is they are clearly doing the things Stephen said, which is trying to get into small groups to diffuse the situation. And the minute somebody feels they&#x27;re being managed, your ability to manage them drops to zero. It&#x27;s probably the same reason why Stephen had that bleacher situation at the CBE, right</div>

That said, I think it probably is going to work for him okay, but only because he&#x27;s incredibly lucky. If the entire political world hadn&#x27;t become just absolutely captured by the Joe Biden story, I think that the MPs would be hearing more about these things. The Toronto St. Paul&#x27;s by-election would be more on the tongue of the public and the political watchers. And then I don&#x27;t think his buying time scenario would work at all. Now, maybe if we&#x27;re being fair to him. He would have picked a different strategy if that wasn&#x27;t the case. But yeah, there would have been a real bigger risk, I think, if the world wasn&#x27;t so bloody distracted right now by the implosion of Joe Biden&#x27;s presidency and candidacy. Carter,</div>

So that they feel like, because you don&#x27;t want to go in with all your changes, and then the caucus says, well, that&#x27;s not enough, and you don&#x27;t have another change in your back pocket. You want to go in and say, these are our first changes, or these are all of our changes. And then they say, that&#x27;s not enough. And you say, tell me what would be enough.

  <div class="said">no that&#x27;s not really on the table anymore at least i mean you&#x27;re going to have to set the table a little bit maybe you do it with materials ahead of time or whatnot but people will be waiting they&#x27;ll be champing at the bit waiting to have the conversation that they want to have here so you know my advice to any prime minister&#x27;s office any premier&#x27;s office is facing a similar thing is like, you know, anything you do before it, they&#x27;re not going to hear. So just, you gotta, you just gotta get it out of the way. You find it an opportunity to sort of like reset the agenda being like, okay, we&#x27;re going to lunch. We&#x27;re all going for drinks. It&#x27;s the end of the day and try to reset back to all of that table setting activity you do the very next day. But in that first part where you have to directly address these things, I think Stephen&#x27;s advice is, is pretty good. I mean, I would, I would make small tweaks, but I don&#x27;t even think it fundamentally changes what he said it&#x27;s probably more style stuff that would come out like you don&#x27;t go in and say here&#x27;s what i&#x27;m going to do i&#x27;ve been thinking about this alone you say hey in those smaller meetings i heard this so here&#x27;s what here&#x27;s what i&#x27;m thinking we can do based on the conversations i had i&#x27;m now validating that with you right i heard these things in all of my calls with you all and all of the meetings i had my team had with you over the summer george i heard you about the carbon tax ken i heard you about my hair you know whatever it is right and you just you go through and then inevitably steven&#x27;s right your opening bid can&#x27;t be your your walk away position you&#x27;ve got to have something in kind of the reserve that you can then go and say whoa okay okay i hear that&#x27;s not enough ken what if i shaved my hair entirely off like you don&#x27;t have to look at it at all i&#x27;m not even saying a short haircut ken no hair that&#x27;s what i can offer you ken so you know there&#x27;s got to be that ability but i do think it would be a real fucking mistake to schedule it in such a way that you&#x27;re doing a bunch of shit nobody cares about or is just like all they can hear is that ringing before this conversation and then you leave with that conversation being the last thing you want the last thing to be your reassertion of the agenda so find a way to insert a hard break and then come back and reassert yourself as prime minister with a plan and do the stuff you normally do at a caucus retreat after</div>

Do you want to see him engaged, energized, out there, sleeves rolled up, pride, Markham, stampede, whatever, you know, folks, he&#x27;ll do a bunch of these. Do you want to see him that way?

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">27:32</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I do for two reasons. One is optics. I believe that he will look like he&#x27;s got a bunker mentality if he just starts to avoid all of these events and all of these MPs. And, you know, point taken, he&#x27;s the prime minister, he&#x27;s not going to be sitting around talking to people there, but he should be mindful that people are talking about him at these events. And you&#x27;ve also got a good chunk of your caucus, I think 30 MPs is some suggestion here, right? That&#x27;s a fifth of your caucus who are going to be wandering through a city where you&#x27;re not necessarily beloved talking to each other. And I&#x27;ve got to tell you, like I was talking to liberal organizers today, people, you know, who were like, oh, Trudeau, you know, even people who were with him earlier. So I don&#x27;t know if you want that all just to go on without you being there, because it&#x27;s pretty easy to point and say, yeah, he didn&#x27;t even come. Like, what the hell is that about? Right. And then the other thing is, it&#x27;s not just about the optics of bunker mentality, it&#x27;s the reality of bunker mentality. My firm belief in politics is the minute you are avoiding events because you&#x27;re afraid of your own caucus, and I do believe that&#x27;s at least part what&#x27;s going on, you&#x27;re at the end of the line, right? right? Like it&#x27;s really hard to come back from that. The tent gets smaller with time, not bigger, unless you really aggressively try to make it bigger. So you got to go out to these things. You got to be trying to make friends where you don&#x27;t have friends. And you&#x27;ve got to do what you can to not lose the friends you&#x27;ve got for these small, lazy reasons. Like it&#x27;s the easiest thing in the world just to talk to the people who love you, just to talk to your team, just to say those other people are out to lunch, or can you believe these fucking guys, or man, they&#x27;re so annoying but open your horizons get out there talk to them build those bridges keep those connections that&#x27;s so important in politics and um yeah i can hear half of the country who&#x27;s listening to us here you know half our listeners saying it&#x27;s just the stampede guys calm the hell down it&#x27;s just the calgary stampede but the reality is there&#x27;s not really many events like this in canadian politics where everybody comes to it you know everybody comes to it all the party Party leaders are here.</div>

Is it effective that these all come out as single, shingle, two signatures, five signatures, one person, former MP, former minister, current MP, current senator, 20 random caucus members, five this? Or is it a consolidated show of force that&#x27;s most effective? Right now, the Liberal Party does not have the choice of not airing their laundry publicly.

And, you know, instead of dripping them out one after the other, after the other, they got one day of news stories, right? right, we were able to come in on the Thursday and promise, I think it was $120 million for schools, and we took away their media.</div>

And the rebuttal is not news the way that the original story was. However, if you got multiple letters, and it&#x27;s this was the letter, and this was the prime minister&#x27;s reaction, and this is the pundits, then the next day, you can come up and be like, here&#x27;s another letter. And by the way, they take exception with what the prime minister said in the rebuttal. Like it allows you to sort get the last word or at least attempt it and kind of do your last line change if you want to think about it in a hockey metaphor sense right they get their word you get your word and at a certain point people kind of run out of words and allows you to sort of optimize towards a goal there and if you&#x27;ve got a lot of players and he&#x27;s only got his one that&#x27;s a bit of an advantage you can play with along the way there</div>

Like they just pop up out of nowhere. It&#x27;s worse. It&#x27;s way worse because you think maybe you have the thing managed and then something else comes up. And that&#x27;s just way more stressful. You&#x27;re sort of always on. You&#x27;re always in meetings talking about how to respond to these things. You have to be alert to it all. and there&#x27;s an asymmetry here that let&#x27;s just think about it in content let&#x27;s just assume ill will by the mps who are sending it which i don&#x27;t necessarily believe is the case but let&#x27;s just assume that there&#x27;s this adversarial thing that&#x27;s coming up one mp sending one letter can get the entire pmo spinning taking meetings making calls getting together doing all of these things and that&#x27;s fucking exhausting if you have to do that five times in a week right because you&#x27;ve You&#x27;ve got five different letters that have come in and it&#x27;s varied your situation so significantly requires people to come together. I think what people really sort of underappreciate in these situations is a small action can sometimes generate big conversation, even if it doesn&#x27;t generate a big response. And there is only so many hours in the day and people only have so much rope. And so there&#x27;s no question in my mind, the more random things you throw at an office. office i&#x27;m sure steven can say the same i&#x27;ve seen this so many times like people just sort of hit almost their breaking point they&#x27;re like i can&#x27;t be fucking bothered anymore and they stop thinking straight they stop responding clearly and all of a sudden advantage other side yeah</div>

And we know a prime minister that&#x27;s playing games with their caucus like this and sees their caucus as an adversary is in a lot of trouble. And Jesus, you know, there&#x27;s no path to government that doesn&#x27;t go through exposing yourself to areas that have real problems with you right now when you&#x27;re sitting at 20%. And I don&#x27;t know. I think he actually needs to kind of step back. And that seems like tread advice, but I would literally write out, the prime minister, like you could just associate, put it third person, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, was having a bad day. He got yet another letter, almost like a business case where you go through, and this is what had happened. And his advisors said this, other advisors said that. What should he do? And he should sit back and he should look at that and say that. Like, how does this character, how would I expect this character to act? Like, this is not actually that hard at the end of the day. But the emotions I&#x27;m feeling and the way I&#x27;m tied up in it and the frustrations that are around all of us make it very difficult. Like, Justin Trudeau right now risks getting to a place where he&#x27;s acting like the character in the movie. We&#x27;re all screaming at the TV and saying, what the fuck are you doing?

He does need to outmaneuver them chess style, but that&#x27;s like on an individual thing. They&#x27;re not their opponent.

But I think that that&#x27;s not going to solve anything. I think that what needs to be solved is the relationships between the over 150 individuals that make up his caucus and the prime minister. And I wouldn&#x27;t be staffing any of these calls out. I&#x27;d be saying, okay, I&#x27;ve got 30 days. I&#x27;m going to make five calls</div>

You sort of maintain advantage. You don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re afraid of people. Well, that ship may have sailed, but imagine that he just said, okay, well, caucus meeting it is then. Gang, let&#x27;s get together. I know it won&#x27;t be convenient for everybody, but let&#x27;s do it. Obviously, this is an important thing. And you just, you kind of look like a leader, right? You look like a leader. You weren&#x27;t dragged into it. You moved in a way that said, I can handle this. And that&#x27;s so much of what the concern about him is right now. Like, he&#x27;s lost the touch. He doesn&#x27;t know how to do these things. He&#x27;s become too insular. And you somewhat reinforce it if you don&#x27;t call the caucus meeting and you start playing these games. That&#x27;s my feeling. I think he should have called the caucus meeting.

And when you consider that Reform UK now has representation and SNP has collapsed and like, there&#x27;s a lot of storylines now that now that the storyline of the Tories are down is kind of out, we&#x27;re going to have to sit and be like, oh, fuck. I mean, this has consequences. This is interesting, right? What does this mean? I mean, Starmer&#x27;s been so cagey about European relationships. Farage is obviously going to go just absolutely mental in the House of Commons. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a lot of things we need to watch here. This election is probably, I</div>

  <div class="said">think steven&#x27;s right it&#x27;s obvious there is a huge there there like let&#x27;s not discount it like part of the reason why it&#x27;s so hard to be an incumbent is we&#x27;re in this world of like we call it often negative partisanship but i think it&#x27;s just negativity it&#x27;s like the the fuck all of you attitude is just taking down parties left right and center you&#x27;re quite literally and uh you&#x27;re ending up with these new splinter groups that come up you&#x27;re having even parties that continue to exist be taken over by other parts of the parties here and it just seems to be all driven by how much they hate things like we seem to have really optimized the counterfactual right being critical is something that all political parties have gotten and all political actors have gotten super good at but we&#x27;re just in absolute teardown mode right now and we don&#x27;t have a lot of examples out there of people successfully building like we We end up with like, I tore those guys down. Maybe I gave it a bit of a Hopi changing message. I get to be the leader for a bit. And then you have everybody turn on them and you have a further fracturing and you have more left and more right.
