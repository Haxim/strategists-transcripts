And because there&#x27;s no way, you know, we talked yesterday, Zane, you got us talking about how to spin this both ways</div>

  <div class="said">There was a spin for the Liberals last night. Um, I&#x27;d be really hard pressed to come up with a, anything vaguely resembling a spin for the liberals right now. I did a little, little bit of research this morning. Only 45 ridings fared better than Toronto St. Paul&#x27;s in the last election. So if you&#x27;re one of the other 115 members of the, of parliament, you are shitting your pants right now because the lies that you may have been telling yourself, we can get over the top. I&#x27;ve got the, I&#x27;ve got the, uh, the special sauce. i&#x27;ve got the ability when it&#x27;s a 20 point 26 point shift when you lose nine points and the and the conservatives gain 17 points in toronto in</div>

  <div class="said">pants look i mean by elections Actions are weird, and people can convince themselves of that. But just to, I think, further underline Stephen&#x27;s point here, inexplicably, David Coletto and Eric Grenier managed to get out a joint piece this morning before I was even awake. I mean, weird. Congratulations. Pretty good, actually. Hey, look at that. And this is a direct quote from it. 2011, when the Liberals held on to only 11 seats in Ontario after its worst performance in party history, the Liberals still won Toronto St. Paul&#x27;s by nine points.</div>

  <div class="said">So here we&#x27;re facing down kind of something pretty seismic, if you&#x27;re the Liberals. If you want it to be. Like, you can read this and you can freak out, for sure</div>

  <div class="said">There&#x27;s a few dates being thrown around here, right, Corey? 2011, one of them, the Ignatius cratering. The low water of the Liberals. Yeah. 1993, also being thrown out this morning, right? As we recall, the historic PC cratering, and could this be similar in scope and size? Let me ask you this. Let me go with Carter&#x27;s sort of academic sort of thought exercise here, and I&#x27;ll start with you, Corey. As far as I understand it, we&#x27;re recording at 8.15 in the morning right now on Tuesday, our time, Mountain Time. I have not seen a statement by the liberals.</div>

  <div class="said">No, I haven&#x27;t either. The last thing that was on the prime minister&#x27;s social feeds was like, hey, tough luck, Oilers. And so I think that there&#x27;s probably a bit of a regrouping going on right now</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">6:41</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah. Well, obviously, you&#x27;ve got three envelopes, right? You know, you had scenario of a pretty convincing win, scenario of close win, scenario of close loss. And hopefully, the liberals aren&#x27;t thinking about what this means for the very first time. And hopefully, they can give it a little bit more thought than perhaps what we&#x27;ve provided. But I think you have to go with something along the lines of, you</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">7:04</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">know, by-elections are, you know, they&#x27;re unique beasts. This is not a general election, but we received a message and we take that message seriously from the voters. And we&#x27;ll be working very hard over the next year to re-earn the trust of the voters of Toronto St. Paul&#x27;s. And this is the first step in a march towards a general election. Like, I think you have to take that we lost the battle, but not the war approach in your communications. But you have to acknowledge you lost the battle. Like, there&#x27;s no polishing this turd to the point where you could say, no sweat, right? You will look out of touch. The panic in your caucus will become multiplied because people will say they don&#x27;t even fucking understand how terrible this is. And that&#x27;s a very dangerous place to be. One where it doesn&#x27;t look like you can even properly assess the size of the hole that you&#x27;re in. So you&#x27;ve got to acknowledge the hole. But you&#x27;ve also got to chart a path out of that hole with your messaging this morning.</div>

Is this anything else? Does this have anything to do with the local candidates? Leslie Church today, you know, we talked about her in the past, because she&#x27;s a former political staffer very close to Krista Freeland. Is there an element there around her not being from the riding? Or do you just kind of like Occam&#x27;s razor, this was about the prime minister, very clearly, very cleanly in that regard.

Leslie Church, on her own, is a very accomplished person. the connection to uh freeland makes her i think even even more of a star and uh the fact that she lost is a uh direct slap in the face to the party i mean this is the leaders and it doesn&#x27;t take an awful lot of strategic advice or strategic reflection uh to see that what everybody is talking about is the leader right they&#x27;re not talking about uh even the carbon tax uh they&#x27;re talking about the leader and the leader&#x27;s performance. So I think that this would be impossible to lay at the feet of Leslie Church. It&#x27;s impossible to lay at the feet of those who are designing and executing the campaign. And instead, I would say that this is the natural outcome of the leader not being popular. That is Occam&#x27;s razor. And I think that we need to uh to</div>

Maybe it would have made a difference of two points. You swing two points, you swing the election. And so that&#x27;s an unfortunate consequence, and that&#x27;s part of, that&#x27;s not on Leslie Church, but that is maybe on the Liberal Party as a whole for not thinking about this thing in terms of what&#x27;s most likely to win locally.

And I&#x27;m not going to pretend it never happened. I&#x27;m not going to pretend that political organizers didn&#x27;t get elected. But often it was like, yeah, you&#x27;re a great political organizer. Now go show me you&#x27;re a great lawyer, go show me you&#x27;re a great community builder, and then you get to run, right? So it does feel like the liberals have turned into this permanent political machine, where you just work your way up the ranks in a way that, again, you can kind of, it&#x27;s so easy at a moment like this to say, that model&#x27;s broken.

And instead of putting the pressure on the prime minister, instead of saying that this is the result of weak leadership, he&#x27;s saying this is a result of a bad policy.

And I think that that&#x27;s very telling because it&#x27;s showing exactly what Pierre Palliev does not want. He doesn&#x27;t want to see a leadership—he doesn&#x27;t want to oppose someone else.

  <div class="said">This is a, you know, Justin Trudeau steps down in July. The party takes two months to determine the leadership rules. and opens it up on August the 31st and the leadership candidates run until what, November the 28th, something like that. And you run a relatively short leadership process, September, October, November, and you have yourself a brand new leader heading into the Christmas season. That to me would make a tremendous amount of sense. The leader has enough time to put their own spin on the budget and come out the other end with something vaguely defining the Liberal Party. You don&#x27;t need to run immediately on the budget, but I would. I&#x27;d run right on the budget. You&#x27;ve got lots of time. You&#x27;ve got enough time to do it. If you don&#x27;t think you have enough time, then you slide the leadership into January and present a late budget.</div>

If you&#x27;re a leadership candidate, if you&#x27;re seriously considering this, if you&#x27;re a liberal, you know what I would be saying as a candidate? I would say, we got some work to do. So I&#x27;m running. I intend to use the entirety of the mandate that the canadian public gave us which allows them to put the election in 2026 obviously it&#x27;s a minority government obviously we&#x27;d need to work with partners throughout the house of commons but by the way ndp</div>

Now you can easily orchestrate your fall and go to the polls if you decide it&#x27;s advantageous. But I think you want to start thinking now about how you create that future space. And let me tell you, I&#x27;ve worked with a lot of governments and a lot of parties who have sat there in the fourth year and said, oh, we just can&#x27;t do the fifth. We would look so weak. I hear that all the time. I see no evidence that the public gives a fuck about this. And by the way, you are weak. You are weak right now. So maybe try to find the time to get out of that hole.</div>

How do they weather themselves against something like we just chatted about? Can they? And, and how do they stay disciplined here? Because I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re suggesting this, but the sloganeering was simple and now it&#x27;s becoming very long in some ways. And I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a tell, if they&#x27;ve just got micro-targeted slogans for different audiences, but it is now starting to sound like a bunch of word salad. It used to just be axe to tax. Now it&#x27;s starting to be every issue under the sun that the liberals are weak on. And guys, conservatives, I&#x27;m speaking of, they&#x27;re going to be weak on a lot of issues. So are we going to develop a three-word slogan for a lot of these issues? Like, do you feel like there&#x27;s a lack of conservative discipline here? And what lessons would you have for them as we go down speculation lane around what we just chatted about, if the liberals try to manufacture what Carter just suggested here?</div>

And politics also often rewards novelty. novelty and so you try something it really resonates so you do a variant of it and you do a variant of it you do a variant of it and at a certain point not only does it not work but you break the original thing and i do think the conservatives are somewhat at risk of that if they continue to create a three-word slogan with the in the middle for fucking everything that the liberals do and and so i would just suggest to pierre polliev your</div>

And it&#x27;s so annoying in politics when you do something and it works and it works.

This is why governments, they just have a shelf life, right? At a certain point, they just got to go. Because in this democracy, they have to make decisions and people hold on to the decisions they disagree with more than the decisions they agree with. That&#x27;s just life. That&#x27;s reality. I wonder, as Stephen was was talking this out if there isn&#x27;t um let&#x27;s i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;d call it an opportunity or a risk or both with the liberals given the demographic considerations in toronto st paul&#x27;s right 15 percent uh vote of the jewish faith well if you&#x27;re the trudeau liberals in a way does this help you hand wave it away say look we we obviously know this is a very charged matter israel hamas war we know that the liberal party has been hearing about it from from all sides, right?
