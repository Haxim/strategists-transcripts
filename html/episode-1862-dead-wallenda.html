I thought that Pierre Polyev did fairly well and almost almost to the line of good, very well, but fairly well. And I thought that Jagmeet Singh was was just terrible. Blanchett lived in there somewhere. But when he said he didn&#x27;t want to be prime minister, it becomes easy to not really listen to him.</div>

  <div class="said">boring is fine if you&#x27;re Carney. It&#x27;s absolutely fine. The way I&#x27;d analyze Carney&#x27;s debate performance, and in fact, this is my wife who kind of said this, and I think it&#x27;s absolutely correct, which is he looked less like someone who was actively at a debate and debating others versus the guy that was chairing a debate. All the attacks came to him, and rather than trying to fend them off, he reconciled them. He pretty much said, I like this point. This one is dumb. This one is stupid. Four points. Here&#x27;s the solution to all of them, what&#x27;s the next question? It looked like what a really experienced board chair would be doing at like a board meeting versus like a candidate debating three other candidates. And you&#x27;d think that that would actually be a losing strategy. But in this case, when we&#x27;re looking for consensus, unity, someone to lower blood pressure, really not really caring as a country who came up with which idea, when, where, and how, the guy who can kind of say, say, Jagmeet is right. Pierre makes a good point on Iran. I will work with Quebec and then just kind of reconcile and say, this point doesn&#x27;t make sense to me. I need to examine it more. That&#x27;s actually kind of the vibe Mark Carney has been building as a candidate. And it&#x27;s the vibe and energy brought to the debate. So in some ways, he was boring. In other ways, you could look at what I just said. And if you agree with and say, he just won that debate just by being the guy that reconciled all those things. Now, on pure debate metrics, I think Pierre Polyev was fantastic. I think Pierre Polyev last night was really good. I think he dialed in on his emotional answers. I think he dialed in on his propositional, what he was going to do. A big criticism of Pierre Polyev was not just vibe and tone, but was like, what the fuck do you stand for? You got to see some clear distinction between him and Carney around what they stood for. What I found fascinating was just if you look at the focus on energy development projects last night, I took, I don&#x27;t know, like maybe 40 minutes of the two hours, Carter, between the first segment and then the actual dedicated energy segment. And both men were talking about reaching the same outcome, but I thought were really substantive around how to get there. And I frankly thought Jagmeet was not just entertaining, but quite helpful to his cause to be like, as these two fuckers talk about development projects, are you forgetting about climate change? Are you forgetting about all those things? I thought he was like a positive additive, not a distraction to kind of ground us as Carney and Pierre went down the policy rabbit hole on how you would fast track one approved development projects in this country. So on the overall basis of it, my argument would be Carney chaired a debate effectively well. Pierre debated effectively well. Jagmeet made a case for his cause, which he has not been able to do over the last number of weeks. And let&#x27;s not forget, for Jagmeet Singh, it&#x27;s about winning two to five percent more back of his voters. It&#x27;s not a huge task. It&#x27;s a hard task. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s an easy task, but he needs to win that two to five percent back. Blanchet was like entertaining non-factor to me in both debates, which is an issue for him for the first one, because he had to be a factor on the first one. It seems like the consensus is that he was not. Of course, I&#x27;m not Quebecois. I&#x27;m not French. I&#x27;m not from Quebec. so my analysis of that and</div>

  <div class="said">No, we didn&#x27;t. And I think there&#x27;s two things at play that I think are quite interesting. Number one, we&#x27;ve taken this idea of taking a two-hour debate and then taking one viral moment, which is what the play was, Carter, when like the internet began. I&#x27;m going to talk like an old man here, right? Or like when this concept of organic virality began on a broader sort of digital platform it was about taking two hours condensing it to one moment and saying this is what matters and i think campaigns have lost the plot which is what you saw every campaign do is they took the two hours and then they took the 25 most viral moments threw them at the wall and said that was the debate who the fuck does that serve right like the the lack of discipline to be like Like my guy nailed it in this moment and this is the moment I want to almost engineer as going viral versus let me give you 25 mediocre answers to mediocre questions is not the strategy. I feel like campaigns have lost the plot on this, right? It was supposed to be one or two things that define a debate. Rachel Notley in 2015 did not clip 25 moments. They found one that they saw a little bit of buzz on and that was it. Do we remember anything else? No. Is that deliberate? Yes. But these campaigns now are trying to throw shit at the wall, which means they&#x27;re throwing nothing. It&#x27;s like if you have 20 priorities, you have zero priorities. And I think that same lesson applies to when you&#x27;re trying to engineer moments. Carter may disagree. So that&#x27;s point number one. Point number two. That was point one? Yeah, Carter. I&#x27;ve got substantive fucking things to say. You wanted me to wrap the puck up.</div>

And last night was really interesting. when someone would get on a roll, especially Pierre Palliev, you could see he did this thing that no other can. There&#x27;s two things that I noticed, body language wise, that no other candidate did. Thing number one, Pierre Palliev was the best at making a point to someone and then slowly pivoting directly into the camera and then saying the rest of that point as a monologue. Did you guys notice that? He was</div>

They&#x27;ve lost the plot on that. And now notice what each campaign is doing as everyone tries to get their clips.</div>

It should be to say, here&#x27;s one fuck-up moment. Mark Carney not knowing that Keystone and TMX are different, throwing out a fucking example, and saying, this actually proves something. It was pretty fucking bad. But the problem is that the CPC have crowded it out with 15 other things. Rather than being like, this guy doesn&#x27;t have... And I I would much rather take in my bet on one like sort of slip up moment and say this proves something rather than throwing up 30 things. You and I don&#x27;t disagree that we watch for the same reasons. But more and more, those outright like stabbings or falling off a tightrope are not going to happen in these debates. You&#x27;ve got to pick your strategy correctly and say, what do I want to amplify to 11 rather than just spray and pray, which is what every campaign seems to be doing.</div>

  <div class="said">epic we are in a position that six months ago the question around the liberal party still existing which is a the question I was circulating on this podcast and other places, being like, guys, if we go now, the Liberal Party&#x27;s dead. Because the theory was the Liberal Party goes away, Trudeau loses all his seats, they&#x27;re done, and they don&#x27;t have a provincial infrastructure across the country, at least a reasonable, robust one like they did 10 years ago, to get back up. You need those provincial infrastructures to get back off the mat. Now we&#x27;re talking about a similar reality with the NDP, the saving grace for the NDP, and we&#x27;re projecting into the future a bit. But let&#x27;s just say they lose party status is that they&#x27;ve got decent provincial infrastructures however</div>

But Jagmeet Singh, last two elections, every time he&#x27;s had something to lose, he&#x27;s always come out a winner. And I&#x27;m not saying that as like he&#x27;s going to have it&#x27;s going to happen this time. I think third time is not the charm. Right. You&#x27;re smiling.</div>

Why not take this as your chance before they&#x27;re decimated? Take it as your chance. You&#x27;re not had Nancy say, hey, once in a lifetime election, we&#x27;re endorsing this liberal or this liberal or like, why not? Oh, no upside for them. Do the separation now.</div>

I mean, you&#x27;d get a lot of attention, but you wouldn&#x27;t necessarily be able to do the full breakaway in the next eight days. So that&#x27;s not going to work. And secondly, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to give you any long distance lift in the future. So your best bet is to wait, watch the NDP flounder, perhaps disappear at a national level and then become the Alberta Democrats like I&#x27;ve suggested 36 different times on this podcast. But obviously Nahid doesn&#x27;t listen to the podcast either. And, you know, that&#x27;s going to be a bit of a problem</div>

  <div class="said">if the federal NDP lose their status, Carter, the Corey Hogan question is, would someone rebuild that party from the ground up if it died, right? Like a version of that. And I think there is still a case for the federal NDP. If Carney becomes prime minister, he&#x27;s going to move to the right. There&#x27;s really no one left fundamentally to the left. I think the rebuild for the NDP might be a lot quicker and swifter than people realize. But the short-term pain seems almost inevitable at this point. By short-term pain, I mean the electoral pain that Jagmeet Singh might face in, what, 10 days now.</div>

That would give time for things Things to kind of settle before the advance polls, you know, people would have time to talk about it, talk about it, because this is really the moment in a campaign, right? There is no other moment. It&#x27;s not like, you know, someone&#x27;s announcement at a car factory is going to really shape the news for the rest of the campaign. The debate is the confrontation and the confrontation is the moment that people are looking for. so with the confrontation happening only you know the day before advanced polls everybody&#x27;s trying to minimize it now i&#x27;m not sure if if the conservatives were pushing super hard for last week if it were me i would have been same with the new democrats uh but at any rate they wound up holding it uh possibly at the least effective time in part because they wanted to manage the the overall impact of the potential negativity of the debate.

And the Q&amp;A, frankly, the failure wasn&#x27;t the second day when they stopped it. The failure was the first day when the rebel got to ask all the questions in english after the french language debate as though they were real fucking media and this this mistake was made um years ago when people started letting the the rebel actually pretend that they were a real media organization they&#x27;re not fucking journalists they&#x27;re not journalists ezra levant is a fucking hack he is not a journalist he has stumbled upon a fantastic way to make money.

  <div class="said">of thing but it&#x27;s a bit layered right because you you add a few so the premise is rather the preface i should just say is i want the debate commission to succeed because if the debate commission does not succeed i think what opens up is a world of fucking insanity with like different networks trying to hold different debates fucking right wing debates left wing debates we&#x27;re going to put pierre pauliev on a stage with maxine bernier whoever the next leaders are they&#x27;re going to debate the right wing insanity of the world and then we&#x27;re going to have the the union labor debates with carney and uh you know the left wing part it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a world of hurt uh what we saw last night on the stage the two hours i thought was actually really good i thought was i think pagan was good i think the leaders were good i listed three out of the four of them helping their cause i think that was good like i think that served the democratic process it may not have like tickled everyone&#x27;s political fancy and and had people falling to their you know demise but it was good it was a debate But everything around it, like I&#x27;ll kind of list, because Carter and I agree, timing didn&#x27;t mind that. Green should have never been invited. You knew about this weeks ago. BQ, why are they showing up in the English debate? The stuff with rebel media, though, is interesting because people are scared of rebel media. That&#x27;s an ongoing mindset. One of the reasons they&#x27;re scared of rebel media is because they sue a lot. They&#x27;re litigious. And one of the reasons that they were able to make an appearance in the last federal election is because they took the commission to got a question in in 21, I believe, and the commission did not want to take the chance this time to find themselves in a courtroom with Ezra Levin and Rebel News, so they handed out the press passes. Rebel News, of course, knowing how, you know, squirmish the commission was, applied for multiple passes, including with their third party registered advertiser, which is not a media organization, which should, in any given circumstance, even if they were to kind of sue them, be very clear cut that this is not a news organization, but a right wing organization, which was running trucks around like video wall trucks around the CBC in Montreal with like anti- Carney messaging, that that group would be able to ask questions. um think part of it was just a commission that was just scared and did not have the facts i think that very much became clear around that second part not having the facts that rebel media had as actually um you know being paid by for canada which is a third-party advertiser kind of like the one that i&#x27;m involved in right like a registered third-party advertiser there&#x27;s business asking questions at a debate. But that relationship exists. And I think that that was not made aware or was ignored by the commission.</div>

  <div class="said">I am surprised it took Stuart Benson at the Hill Times to call these folks out. I was really surprised by that. I don&#x27;t know if you guys saw this moment that was that kind of led to the ultimate weird scrum that Ezra did with the media that he hates. But Stuart Benson of the Hill Times pretty much was yelling at Ezra, talking to him about like, you know, breaking down the facts. All the rebel folks were recording this this moment that kind of led to this space where one was asked to calm down, the other one was asked to leave. Ezra then did a scrum with journalists in which this for Canada relationship was brought up by Justin Ling. And then the added element of this is how the rebel media folks tried to storm the CBC set with David Cochran, rosie barton to the point that those two had to have security details have them escape their own fucking building this</div>

Hello, Mr. Polyev, very nicely. And it&#x27;s, you know, it is a disgrace to have these people pretend that they&#x27;re journalists. You know, we all work for different organizations. Some of ours may have editorials maybe lean to the right or to the left or in the middle. But the journalists themselves conduct themselves themselves honorably and try to be as fair as they possibly can these journal these are not journalists these are people who are political partisans who try to raise money off of uh because of their what they&#x27;re doing with their right-wing antics that&#x27;s simple it is</div>

  <div class="said">I should think the commission should have, in this particular round, despite the fact that they had court precedent back from 21, in this particular round with the Rebel News and For Canada relationship, the media outlet and the registered third party anti-Carney advertiser, they should have taken the risk to be sued because the case is much more clear cut than it was back for them. But I just think they lacked, frankly, Carter, I think it&#x27;s one thing we go back to a point we&#x27;ve made often on this podcast, what are political instincts? And you&#x27;d expect that the commission would have political instincts. We talk about political instincts at a corporate level, what those look like, how to kind of understand them.</div>

  <div class="said">They just don&#x27;t have the political instincts, ironically, for a group organizing a political debate. I think they look at themselves as a democratic institution that is here for broader sort of democratic appeals. They need to be an institution that has a political IQ. In this case, I hate to criticize them so aggressively, and I&#x27;m just piling on to what many people are saying today, but I want them to succeed, but they need a better political iq than the one that they had that put these debates together on the onstage product i thought was great everything around it was a lot of stuff around it was a ton of bullshit well</div>
