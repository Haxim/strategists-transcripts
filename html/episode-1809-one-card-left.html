Stephen takes down numbers and intends to hold people to account for their predictions.Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a column where outgoing Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley appears to attack incoming-with-83%-of-the-vote Alberta NDP leader Naheed Nenshi - before turning to the looming Toronto-St. Paul&#39;s byelection. How should Nenshi engage (or not) with Rachel Notley and Jagmeet Singh at Notley&#39;s farewell dinner? Is Toronto-St. Paul&#39;s a referendum on Justin Trudeau&#39;s leadership?

I mean, he doesn&#x27;t, in my reading of this leadership, he doesn&#x27;t have a central idea. But one of the pieces of the puzzle is that he&#x27;s going to remove the relationship between the provincial New Democratic Party and the federal New Democratic Party, currently led by Jagmeet Singh. saying so he&#x27;s going to leave that that&#x27;s one of the things he said one or a few times but it&#x27;s not a central theme of his campaign and she just fucking laid into him and then not only that cory cory not only that not she decided to say i don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s got as many supporters as he thinks he has</div>

If that were the case, he would have sold a hell of a lot more than 83 percent of the memberships that were sold in the NDP leadership race. He is loved by some Calgarians, but certainly not all Calgarians. Rachel Notley is supposed to be handing off to him her brand value plus his brand value equals NDP new brand value.

And frankly, you might just say, well, sounds bad, but isn&#x27;t every race and every by-election a referendum on the leader? Is there something extra worrisome for Trudeau here, if we&#x27;re to believe that, maybe not universally, but for a good chunk of voters, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re thinking about when they&#x27;re voting in toronto st paul&#x27;s on monday</div>

I just don&#x27;t know. For me, it&#x27;s not so much, will his party turn on him if he loses? I think that those things happen incrementally, and they happen in ways that are sort of hard to describe sometimes. But it&#x27;s, what is this story you are going to tell your supporters that&#x27;s going to keep keep them from being utterly despondent and politically suicidal if you manage to lose Toronto St. Paul&#x27;s. Because you&#x27;re not going to be able to offer them that cabinet shuffle. You&#x27;re not going to be able to offer them our messaging will turn it around. You&#x27;re not going to be able to offer them policy, as we&#x27;ve described. We&#x27;re at a point where people are just tuning out what he says because it&#x27;s him who&#x27;s saying it. And there&#x27;s just not a lot of reason even for false hope at this point. So that&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s such an important by-election for him. It&#x27;s not It&#x27;s not because by-elections mean everything. It&#x27;s not because if you lose a by-election, you&#x27;re destined to lose this leader. It&#x27;s because this is a man at the end of his rope. And this by-election comes at a critical point. And if this goes bad for him, I</div>

It is an entertainment topic, but I find this one more entertaining. The game of trying to keep a weak leader on. You know this game, right? It&#x27;s the game that the opposition who has a leader on the ropes wants them to stay until the next election because they don&#x27;t want to run against the unknown. known. They don&#x27;t want to run against an X factor. And there&#x27;s probably some in the Polyev orbit right now that say, fuck it, bring on any liberal, anyone wearing red, we will crush them.

How would you, if you keep the macro question of Trudeau with the micro question of St. Paul&#x27;s, how are you as a strategist, Carter, balancing that act for Pierre Polyev and then to you, Corey?</div>

Canadians, when they actually are given the choice between sensible, progressive liberal government and Pierre Polyev&#x27;s, I don&#x27;t know, Lunacy, whatever you want to brand them as, they pick the liberals. And that&#x27;s what you say. And you just sort of move on. We are glossing past the fact that that&#x27;s still a bit of a loss there.

Let&#x27;s say you lose by four points. You&#x27;ve never been that close. How does he mobilize his troops? How does he show that there&#x27;s something here?

We&#x27;re going to stand up in the House of Commons. We&#x27;re going to be demanding far more for the citizens of Canada, because if this coalition is going to continue, it&#x27;s going to continue on our terms.

And so they pooled their votes with the Conservatives. But we know that&#x27;s not where their hearts are. We know that ultimately Canadians are progressive. Canadians want environmental action. They don&#x27;t want the inaction of a Polyev government. Canadians want social justice. They don&#x27;t want the injustice of a Polyev government. Canadians want economic fairness. They don&#x27;t want the cronyism of a Polyev government. So we&#x27;re going to be bringing that message everywhere over the next bit. We are the alternative to the Pierre Polyev conservatives.
