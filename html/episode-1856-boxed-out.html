  <meta name="description" content="The evening before the big April 1 announcement, the gang convenes to discuss the state of the campaign.Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss whether the ballot question is set, if public criticisms of the Conservative campaign are sincerely well intentioned, and how Jagmeet Singh can get back into the game. Is affordability doomed to be just one bullet under a bigger issue called &#34;Trump&#34;? Can early public discussion about campaign challenges strengthen a campaign? And why is Zain not buying domains somehow more dangerous than Zain buying domains? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line." />

I have a very simple question, one that I think is the foundation of all, not all, that&#x27;s maybe too much, a lot of the political chatter right now. And I want two strategists to give me their perspective on it. And the question Stephen Carter, and of course, one Corey Hogan, who&#x27;s, of course, busy Is he buying a domain? Registering a domain. No, I know. I know you&#x27;re multitasking right now. the question is, how do you know if a ballot box question is baked?

I know we&#x27;ve talked about on</div>

  <div class="said">this show, just to add a bit more context before I let you answer, that we&#x27;ve maybe entered an era where there isn&#x27;t a singular ballot box question, that there isn&#x27;t one issue driving Canadians. So if that&#x27;s the case, how do you think about where we find ourselves right now? And then let&#x27;s get into specifics of this campaign and how the Liberals and Conservatives should be dealing with the one and the 1A, which has been a nuanced and oftentimes interchangeable dance?</div>

  <div class="said">Well, I&#x27;d say right off the top that it&#x27;s very difficult to win on someone else&#x27;s ballot box question. So if someone else has framed the ballot box question, you know, like it is going to be about Donald Trump and the tariffs, which is Mark Carney&#x27;s question, then it is very difficult to imagine that Pierre Polyev is going to sweep in and suddenly redefine the ballot box question question to suit himself, to suit his party. That is highly unlikely to happen. So instead of having a singular ballot box question, he needs to have another ballot box question, and he has to switch people over to it. So in 2012, Alison Redford, the ballot box question is, do we want to change? That is the Wild Roses ballot box question, and Danielle Smith. We changed it over to, do you want to elect those bigots and our ballot box question wound up holding the day and it was only framed about eight days before the election so yes there is the opportunity to frame late a ballot box question but you have to frame that to be your own question you can&#x27;t there is very little chance i think that pierre poliev is going to go in take over the ballot box question of Donald Trump and the tariffs. He needs to develop some sort of new ballot box question, and cost of living could be it. I&#x27;m not convinced that it is, but who</div>

I get wrapping yourself up in the Canada flag is, right? And maybe that&#x27;s a subset of the Trump question. But does Trump have to be a losing proposition for Pierre? Like, there are elements in the very recent past, prior to the Carney wave and the Trump tariffs, the particular element of Trump that maybe have shot Carney up in bull, where Pierre&#x27;s qualities were considered to be advantageous to dealing with Trump. So I want to just question the premise, because do you feel like Trump has to be the loser loser for Pierre here? Or do you think we&#x27;re perhaps skipping a beat?</div>

  <div class="said">No, I&#x27;m pretty old fashioned about this. I think if you&#x27;re talking about the other person&#x27;s question, you&#x27;re talking in their message frame, right? And that, that message frame is something that you don&#x27;t want to be involved in. Now, there can be a time when someone&#x27;s chosen a losing ballot box question, right? Where, where, you know, Jagmeet Singh, for example, every question he&#x27;s ever asked has been wrong. So, you know, there&#x27;s losing frames. But I don&#x27;t think that this is a losing frame for Mark Carney. And therefore, I just don&#x27;t think that Pierre Polyev can work on that frame.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah, look, I think that there is the possibility that you can look at the Trump issue and find a conservative answer to it. But they seem to be struggling with that. And think part of it is just how their base is divided. You know, there&#x27;s this idea when you look at polls that one in five conservatives are actually willing to join the United States, let alone have sympathies to Donald Trump&#x27;s views, which is an even higher percentage. And so that&#x27;s a challenge he has. That means if he goes too far, he&#x27;s going to be dealing with a bit of an internal war. Or as soon as I&#x27;d say safely 30% of your base feels so strongly different from the other, you&#x27;ve got a big fucking problem on your hands because that&#x27;s a large enough group that it&#x27;s not going to feel like the minority. They&#x27;re going to feel like they&#x27;re in the majority and they&#x27;re going to say, what is the leader doing? Why are they so offside with me? So I get his challenge and I get why he&#x27;s tried to avoid finding the conservative answer to Donald Trump and instead say, let&#x27;s find the thing that unites all of us as conservatives, which is affordability. But I fundamentally reject that even if prices go up, people are going to say now it&#x27;s about affordability. I understand they&#x27;re selfish, but they&#x27;re going to say it&#x27;s not affordable because of Donald Trump. And they&#x27;re going to say</div>

He&#x27;s got to find something as existential as Donald Trump threatening to conquer our nation through economic force in order to sustain a different ballot question. And I don&#x27;t know how you do that. I honestly don&#x27;t. I think that he&#x27;s got a fundamental flaw in his campaign right now.</div>

One is that you&#x27;re not playing on the question that the majority of Canadians care about right now, which is Trump. And Carter, you&#x27;ve refuted that.

Who is the enemy for Should it be, even if Trump is not your ballot box question, but enough people want to talk about him. Is Trump the enemy or is Carney the enemy? Who&#x27;s your political enemy right now if you&#x27;re Pierre Polyev in this election? And you could get twisted and pretzely about this and, you know, come out the other end being like, I don&#x27;t know. Or you could play it straight and be like, of course, it&#x27;s Mark Carney.

But it doesn&#x27;t need to mean that&#x27;s how you play it in terms of your advertising, in terms of your commentary, in terms of how you talk about things. And I actually think Trump could be a fine enemy for the conservatives if they were willing to do that. It doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re willing or able to do that. And I talked about this last time on the Patreon episode, but I find it really, really interesting and a bit transparent how they want us to project all of our bad feelings about Justin Trudeau onto Mark Carney and act as though that makes any sense. And I think that that&#x27;s going to be a problem for them because there&#x27;s going to be enough people who say, well, hold on, I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;m buying it.

And there are ways you could do it as a conservative that probably would be somewhat appealing to Canadians. I think the best one is actually talking about a strong Canada, which is why it&#x27;s so interesting that the Liberals took the slogan Canada Strong. I mean, in some ways, it&#x27;s fine. I wouldn&#x27;t call it great, except for the fact that it might be great because it boxes out the conservatives, right now they feel like they can&#x27;t talk about a strong canada and canada strong also implies you&#x27;re going to be strong in a canadian way which goes back to how the liberals perceive themselves and how i believe canadians perceive</div>

So yeah, it really speaks to me in that sense. The idea of Canada Strong, It&#x27;s Time to Build is not inherently about defending Canada. Canada Strong is. And if we&#x27;re going to take our own advice about ballot box question, that&#x27;s a much cleaner connection to the ballot box question. because in a way it elevates it and it makes it harder for Pierre Polyev to just then go and say here&#x27;s my alternative position to make Canada strong like think about it if you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s time to build what you&#x27;re implicitly saying as Mark Carney is I&#x27;m going to make Canada strong through building and then you&#x27;re going to be fighting with Pierre Polyev saying I&#x27;m going to make Canada strong through lower taxes but you&#x27;ve just come in and said I&#x27;m just gonna make Canada strong like you&#x27;ve ignored all of that argument and you&#x27;ve just owned that space for yourself.

Whose face do you have in your war room with a circle on it? is it trump or is it carney i</div>

  <div class="said">think it has to be carney i mean carney&#x27;s a a relative unknown who&#x27;s got sky-high positives right now but uh one would have to assume they&#x27;re wafer thin and if you started to poke holes in them uh but you can&#x27;t poke holes into in them by saying that his thesis his thesis was copied right you can&#x27;t poke holes in him by by trying to tear him down by with with paper cuts. You&#x27;ve got to poke holes into them by what we don&#x27;t know about them. What don&#x27;t we know about Mark Carney? This is not a person who&#x27;s had a chance to lead yet. That&#x27;s how I would go after it if I was the conservative. It&#x27;s not what we know or the inconsequential, but what we don&#x27;t know that could be consequential.</div>

  <div class="said">They&#x27;re up in the polls, depending on which poll. I think the aggregators got them about five, which is a very modest but people like nanos on ctv are you know gesticulating um and being like this is like unheard of and a lot of this is right like he wouldn&#x27;t be wrong being like oh my god this is reversal of fortunes is incredible and the lead is growing is what he was saying earlier today um you got other polls showing that that similar level of growth which is you know you combine the growth in in the horse race combined with the liberal vote efficiency and you&#x27;re you&#x27;re looking at a landslide majority in certain cases. Today, though. So Corey, what would the advice that Corey Hogan strategists would give the liberals right now, as a word of caution, so to speak, because there is, you know, a narrative out there saying this week is going to be Trump week, you got next week, and then debate week, and then here we are, we&#x27;re voting, and it&#x27;s over, the cake is already baked. There&#x27;s a large group saying, are we ready to call time of death on the conservative campaign, including some conservatives right now? So what advice would you have for the liberals uh both on strategy but as well as a caution for them</div>

  <div class="said">don&#x27;t see much evidence of this right now in terms of his actions with tariffs, but Donald Trump has gotten pretty quiet about Canada the last week. I think he really does understand that anytime he opens his mouth, he risks helping the liberals and he&#x27;s, he has very poor impulse control. He will fail, but he is going to try not to, and he could easily get distracted. distracted and i think distraction is probably donald trump moving on to something else is probably something that as canadians we shouldn&#x27;t feel very comfortable about because it&#x27;s not as though he&#x27;s lost interest he&#x27;s just had interest distracted so</div>

  <div class="said">what&#x27;s what&#x27;s some advice for the liberals right now four weeks to go cory makes a good point next week&#x27;s a week weeks after but you know there are something to be said that if the conservatives want to make something land they may not have enough soak time per se with the with the public they may not have enough time to get some of the voters that they&#x27;re actually losing to the liberals because of liberal growth, certainly on the backs of the NDP predominantly, but also taking away some conservative vote in certain areas. So the point there to be made is a good one, Corey. But Carter, word of caution, advice from Stephen Carter, who&#x27;s seen this before, what would it be?</div>

We&#x27;ll get to that in a second, because I find that fun to talk about. But Carter, as a strategist, there&#x27;s two elements here.

So it&#x27;s a character critique. And that&#x27;s the point I want to make. You&#x27;re not talking about the tactics at that point. You&#x27;re talking about the character of the individuals and how they will not take advice. The other thing I would say is if they wanted to take that advice, now it&#x27;s really fucking tough for them to do it because it looks like they had to do it under duress and nobody&#x27;s going to give them credit for it. It&#x27;s going to undermine their credibility. It&#x27;s going to encourage people when they see things they don&#x27;t like to take this exact same tactic going forward so in a funny way to</div>

Are they going to say, I just need to go into the media and raise a bunch of shit up and get a bunch of conservatives angry and I&#x27;ll get them to do that that way instead?

There&#x27;s a lot of examples of what we&#x27;d call in the business, abandoned strategies. There&#x27;s a lot of examples of what we call in the business, emergent strategies, where we just say, oh, I&#x27;m going to grab that. That looks really good. I&#x27;m going to take that strategic opportunity. To continue to run the way he is, to me, like it&#x27;s almost operatic, right? It&#x27;s this perfect example of how like in act one, the hero is there and he&#x27;s going to do these things this way. But by act three, you see, he&#x27;s kind of sealed his own fate, right?

People are relishing in the fall. Will they also be excited about the potential rise, and should the liberals be cautious? I know the celebrity trajectory is what we&#x27;ve talked about, but the people loving the fall, but also being excited about the rise here, which could get Polyev some momentum.

Switch things out by four points either direction. You know, liberals come down by four, the conservatives go up by four. And suddenly you&#x27;ve got yourself a conservative minority at the very least, and potentially a conservative majority. You know, that that&#x27;s not a huge shift. Especially when you consider how much it just shifted to the liberals in three months, that has to be soft. It can&#x27;t be be firm because it didn&#x27;t exist before. so</div>

They could have triggered an election. They could have been in a position where they took advantage of the vote split, not being on the historically low receiving end of it, at least from what the polls say right now. Carter, I&#x27;m a bit of a fan myself of admitting you&#x27;re not going to win. I don&#x27;t know how much further I would go, though, than that. And I don&#x27;t even know if you agree with my strategy. I may advise the NDP today being like, we acknowledge this is not our race. Maybe you don&#x27;t acknowledge that the questions of this race are not our thing, because I think that could have historic sort of consequences, being like, it&#x27;s about the economy. And of course, we&#x27;re not going to, you know, that&#x27;s not our thing. So we&#x27;re just good. Like, you wouldn&#x27;t do that.</div>

  <div class="said">Actually, you know, let me pick up on that because you mentioned a campaign that I ran there. So in 2012 for the Liberals, our vote collapsed overnight when Alison Redford was elected leader of the PCs. Literally, it went from about 23, 24 percent to 10, 11 percent. It was pretty crazy. And we had five incumbents running again. And we expanded the net a little beyond that to, I think, nine ridings, maybe it was eight. And we said, there is no rest of Alberta. Our entire platform, our entire resourcing, our entire everything is focused on what&#x27;s going to be popular in these eight ridings. And we did that. And we stuck pretty tough to it. And we had a platform and we pulled in all at the time, 83 ridings of Alberta, every single individual component, we found the most popular ones. We put together bundles in those eight ridings, didn&#x27;t care what the rest of the province thought. And we put together bundles that allowed us to see whether those would resonate with that group. And then we carpet bombed those ridings. We printed full booklet platforms and we dropped them in those ridings in swing areas. We put all of our advertising in those areas on those issues and anything else that was existing outside of those ridings was mostly just to show ourselves as minimally viable so that we would be viable in those ridings. And that is available to the NDP as well. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s a pretty tough strategy to deploy on week two of a campaign</div>

  <div class="said">Right, with four weeks left in a historically short campaign. The question I have for both of you, maybe starting with you, Corey, did you ever acknowledge that with your outside voice, that that is what you were doing?</div>

  <div class="who">

    <span class="ts">55:03</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">No. I mean, even I think on the campaign manager meetings in the morning, that would be a pretty difficult sell. so i think there were certainly people inside the party who were very well aware of the strategy right um and uh that you have to and and this is maybe where steven like that&#x27;s a hard strategy to be very public about we certainly had a version of it where we said you know we want to make sure that this is a story that resonates with our base we had ways to talk around it for sure but no we&#x27;re not saying to the entire public we&#x27;re only viable in these writings because Because unfortunately, then we wouldn&#x27;t get coverage. And one of our strategies was, when you pick up the newspaper, different era, people cared about this, right? When you picked up the newspaper, there&#x27;d be four stories, there&#x27;d be the, you know, Party A, Party B, Party C, Party D. In our case, in Alberta, it was the PCs, Wildrose, Liberals, and New Democrats. And like clockwork every day, you would have those four stories, right? But if we had said to the media, we don&#x27;t stand a chance outside of eight ridings, and frankly, we don&#x27;t think we stand a chance outside of five ridings, they never were going to cover us like that. Our tour would have collapsed. It wouldn&#x27;t have worked</div>

Almost like free ourselves of the national burden. You may not look at it that way. But if you do acknowledge it, you do also potentially have that risk of saying you&#x27;re no longer seen as a national party. Now, whether that stain lasts for one election or more, if there&#x27;s like deeper effects of that is to be determined.
