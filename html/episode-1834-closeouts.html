To see her in the 90s is crazy. That&#x27;s a really high number for a party that has historically consumed its own leader every four years, right?</div>

  <div class="said">she could yeah she could just you know move to panama if she wanted to but the uh you know the the reality is she also got in the 90s when she was leader of the wild rose and she crossed the floor to the pcs and was out as leader in part because she was having trouble controlling that cast of anything could happen happen, but this is, by right-wing political standards in Alberta, quite the coup, shall we say. When&#x27;s the last time a leader of the main right-wing party in Alberta got a percent like this?</div>

    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">3:40</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Help me understand this from your strategist perspective, Carter. Is this our time to say goodbye to Take Back Alberta, or is this a time to reassess their influence? Is this a time to lean into them even more? Talk to me about how I should be thinking about the opposing even further right flank to Danielle Smith that we&#x27;ve talked about existing. After this result, how should one think about that group? They&#x27;re not as monolith, but how should one think about them if I were</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="249">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">4:09</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">The only thing that we can assume from this result is that Take Back Alberta is firmly in the House, right? They&#x27;re not outside anymore. They&#x27;re inside because 91% is a big number. 91% is 6,000. I mean, we&#x27;re looking at 5 400 people that voted to keep her. I mean,</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="269">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">4:29</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">has to assume that there is no opposition and that opposition that does exist or did exist is now firmly inside the House. On top of that, if they are a spent force, we saw in the regulations that came up for Bill 20, which is the Local Authorities Election Act, they prohibited parties from organizing for school board trustees, which is one of the big things that Take Back Alberta really wanted to be able to do. they are a spent force and maybe we&#x27;re just the last ones to recognize it.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">5:05</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah, that&#x27;s an interesting interpretation by Stephen. I guess I half agree. One of the reasons why Danielle Smith was so successful where premiers like Kenny were not, premiers like Stelmak were not, premiers like Redford were not, is she is more to the right. She has the people on the right of the party that have caused so much pain and grief for Premier&#x27;s past that have come from the PCs and the UCP. But I only half agree because I do think that for a long time, it&#x27;s been suggested to take back Alberta&#x27;s – its authority was overstated, right? And yes, they helped get Kenny out of the chair. They helped get Danielle into the chair. But that was an aligning of interests rather than one</div>

    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

  </div>
  <div class="said">organization exerting their will Pulling the strings, right? I mean, that&#x27;s been the argument from the premier&#x27;s office forever, forever. And I think you have to give a little bit of credence to it. But I also believe that Danielle Smith has used her last couple of years wisely in terms of party politics, her and her circle. And they have tried to make sure that she has her own power base. One of the things that I was saying on West of Center a couple of weeks ago was I didn&#x27;t think she was really in jeopardy because I hadn&#x27;t talked to Stephen yet. So I didn&#x27;t know she was likely to lose that leadership review. Yeah, absolutely. That things are happening.</div>

Even I would argue more than she herself is. Does that mean it&#x27;s not her? No, I think at this point, that&#x27;s a distinction without a difference. But it&#x27;s clear that she wants to placate these, placate might not even be the right word. she is she is doing politics she is getting groups together and they&#x27;re getting support behind her that that is politics and she&#x27;s decided that she wants to do that in a big way and she has perhaps rightly assessed that the risk to premier is if they&#x27;re with the ucp and the pc party in alberta is the call is from inside the house right and and so she has said i&#x27;m not just going to get them to get me the the premiership i know that i need to maintain their support to maintain that premiership in the long haul. And so she&#x27;s governing accordingly, right? So there&#x27;s two ways to read it. And I guess I read it in that she has shown that she herself is in charge, right? She is the power broker who&#x27;s making those decisions. She is building those coalitions. But the other way to read it is kind of the root fact that Stephen and I agree, which is in a very right-wing party, right? And this very right-wing party has clearly been given significant</div>

She&#x27;s the one who&#x27;s chosen all of these right-wing policies. She&#x27;s the one who&#x27;s made all the decisions, and I was incorrect in thinking that the person that I knew was incapable of making some of these decisions.

I&#x27;ve got two questions here to finish off the Daniel Smith weekend that she had. Not to take really much away from her, Carter, but I&#x27;ll start with you on this, but the conservative mood music of the country, which is dominant by Pierre Palliev and conservatives kind of seem to be the party of choice. You see Russet and others being buoyed by Polyev. How much of this big victory belongs to that broader conservative trajectory we feel? It&#x27;s a distinction without a difference to use a quarry term before, but I do want to tease it apart if you have any thoughts on this. Does the fact that she leads this right-wing party and that version of conservatism is now in vogue have something to do with it, or no, this is just who she is and the party she&#x27;s running here? I&#x27;m just curious if either of you have thoughts on this</div>

And so Daniel Smith has either by accident or intention, and I think you&#x27;d be doing a disservice to her to say it&#x27;s by accident, has said, okay, well, I guess that&#x27;s what politics is right now. And they&#x27;re just going hard in the paint. They&#x27;re just right-wing all of the time. And so you ask if this is part of a movement of conservatism. I don&#x27;t know. I think it&#x27;s just what politics looks like in 2024 and certainly more accentuated on the conservative side. People just are not interested in moderation. moderation, but on the same vein, Danielle Smith has identified exactly how to turn that into political success with her party. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because Pierre Polyev is successful, I think they&#x27;re both riding the same wave.</div>

  <div class="said">think it&#x27;s pretty early to say but if i am smith one of the concerns and this i&#x27;m going to get to your answer about the albert ndp here is increasingly there&#x27;s nobody to blame right the ndp government is now looking very much in the rear view mirror that hasn&#x27;t been since 2019. that was a ways ago and there&#x27;ll be even more ways to go by the time we get to the 2027 election sure right uh even kenny very far in the rear view mirror and i I guess to that point, you can&#x27;t even say, well, you know, I&#x27;ve got a balanced interest within my party. No, it&#x27;s you. You&#x27;ve got the whole party. You&#x27;ve got everything. You&#x27;ve got 91.5%. You&#x27;ve been in government for years. Your party&#x27;s been in government for years longer. It&#x27;s you. And by the way, your biggest opponent, your biggest boogeyman is going to lose too. And that is, of course, Justin Trudeau. So if I&#x27;m Danielle Smith, I guess it&#x27;s a bit of a double-edged sword that absolutely everything now lands on my feet. I no longer have anybody to blame. at least very easily, right? And so that&#x27;s maybe something that&#x27;s of value to the Alberta NDP. They can paint it with everything that&#x27;s happening from this point forward. And she&#x27;s not going to have as easy a time by the time you get to 2027 to walk away, to disavow, to deny, to deflect, to say that this was the other people at other times in other jurisdictions. That&#x27;s just not going to be available to her at the same time. And while this is not the biggest component of that story it&#x27;s a component of that story she has total control of her party you can&#x27;t you can&#x27;t as an albertan look at it and say well she&#x27;s just trying to maintain the good will of the right in order to govern that&#x27;s no longer a story that anybody should or could believe at this point but i think if you&#x27;re looking at it as the alberta ndp you also have to be pretty you shouldn&#x27;t you shouldn&#x27;t be so naive as to think it&#x27;s all good news for you you have an opponent that is clearly very united, clearly very strong. They can get thousands of people to show up at a convention like Red Deer. And that should give you pause. And I guess it should also give you pause that as wild from a sort of left-right spectrum as these last few months have been, Danielle Smith doesn&#x27;t seem to have been hurt by it at all with the general electorate. I mean, I haven&#x27;t seen a ton of polling lately, but I definitely don&#x27;t get the sense that she would be in dire, dire straits if an election were called next</div>

  <div class="said">Well, we talked a little bit about this during the NDP leadership and one of the things that that the Hoffman campaign had going for it, that the other campaigns didn&#x27;t. I think this was even before Nahed Nenshi entered the race as like the 800-pound gorilla race over, right? Everybody knew it except you, Zane. The race was over the minute he entered. But we said one of the benefits of Sarah Hoffman&#x27;s campaign is she always knows exactly what her position is. There&#x27;s no nuance needed. There&#x27;s no complexity. She is the party candidate. She is the left-wing candidate. And And she&#x27;s able to immediately know where she stands on every issue, every issue, whether it be crisis in the Middle East or health care. And there&#x27;s a lot of value to that when you&#x27;re trying to build a team and trying to build a sense of mission and a cause. You know, like we&#x27;re mad as hell and we&#x27;re going to compromise as nobody&#x27;s rallying cry. but the idea that somebody is going to take take those views and they&#x27;re not going to adulterate them and they&#x27;re going to fight for them and they&#x27;re going to move the yardstick and they&#x27;re going to say and they say yeah we heard this for years and it turns out it might actually be true the problem is only that we&#x27;re watering these things down if we just give people a bold vision people will vote for us so there might be some truth to that right but i the last thing i&#x27;ll say say.</div>

  <div class="said">when you see a poll and you see, hey, 19 times out of 20, it&#x27;s supposed to be within 3%, right? Yes. Two things about that. One thing I will always tell people is it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s equally likely to be 3% off and not off at all. It&#x27;s a curve. So you should assume that it&#x27;s as close to this, but the probability goes down. But that one time out of 20, it&#x27;s going to be more than 3% off, right? It&#x27;s going to be more than three points off. It&#x27;s going to be further outside of that. And if you start going into like one in a hundred, it&#x27;s going to be a lot more than that, but we&#x27;re not seeing that. Instead, we&#x27;re seeing pollsters all very, very close perpetually. A couple of points difference, max. Harris up one, Trump up one. Trump up one, Harris up one. even you know this is what people are getting and the odds of that are basically zero you know they are zero that pollsters would all be coming independently to such close numbers and the suspicion is that pollsters are looking at the numbers and they&#x27;re trying to play it safe because a modern pollster is not doing what we call a purely probabilistic sample they are not just getting a thousand random people and saying whatever those people are wherever they live within this jurisdiction we just assume that they are a random sample that just because that&#x27;s not how the world works now it&#x27;s harder to get a hold of certain demographics so every pollster does something called waiting which is where they say okay well we wanted 30 young people and we only got 20. so every young person&#x27;s opinion will essentially wait for 1.5 and we wanted to have 500 people over the age of 50 and we ended up with 700 so we&#x27;re going to wait them down So those opinions are worth less. And so this is what every pollster does and they wait by different things. And one of the things that the polling industry did after their miss in 2016 where they didn&#x27;t see Donald Trump&#x27;s victory coming is they said, well, how did we miss this? And they went and they looked at their models and they decided where they didn&#x27;t consider enough was education. education we talked a little bit about this on the last one right</div>

  <div class="said">so then they rebuilt their models and they asked demographics about education and then that helped find those um you know rust belt voters that were all breaking for trump in a way but you know the problem with that is you&#x27;re fitting it always to the last election and you&#x27;re always fixing towards the last election and you miss the changes in the current election you miss the changes in you know what&#x27;s the important uh demographic that you should be looking at. You miss the changes on who&#x27;s a likely voter. There&#x27;s a lot of reason right now to believe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening. I&#x27;ve talked for a minute on this fucker. Maybe I&#x27;ll stop and get Carter&#x27;s reaction here, but I do want to tell the H&amp;K story about our own- No, no, no. The floor is yours. Keep going. I</div>

Oh, everyone else has Harris only up by one. I&#x27;m going to look pretty dumb if Donald Trump ends up winning this thing because he often overperforms his polls and it&#x27;s actually Trump plus two. I&#x27;d rather my poll set plus one. So, what might I be missing? So, then they go back into their analysis and they look at what they&#x27;re cutting it against and and they will say yeah okay well you know this sample&#x27;s looking a little shaky maybe i need to shore it up maybe i need to go ask 500 more people so they might run up their sample more to see if that changes things they might actually change their demographic weighting most pollsters will try not to do that in the middle of like an election but it&#x27;s very possible and they they end up getting a result that&#x27;s the same and they do that out of fear more than um malfeasance I guess that&#x27;s the thing I would say.

The piece of evidence that exists that Harris is going to win is the early voting data. data. That</div>

  <div class="said">early voting data seems to be skewing very strongly, very strongly to the Democrats and Harris right now, just based on the demographics that are showing up, based on what we know, and based on what we can intuit about elections more generally, right? Doesn&#x27;t look great for Donald Trump there. So that&#x27;s the main reason I think that Harris is going to win, the early voting numbers.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="2465">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">41:05</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah. I mean, if you look sideways and squint, than the early voting numbers look good for Harris. But the truth of the matter is, the Republicans came out in 2016 and 2020 on election day. That&#x27;s the day that they choose to vote. So the fact that the Democrats are again winning by a lesser margin than 2016 and 2020 on those advanced votes, you have to squint in order to see an actual victory here. Because the actual victory comes from Trump, who is going to get his vote out because his voters are fanatical. Fanatical.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">But there&#x27;s also this added element. We talked about this from the Patreon episode where Elon Musk and others have been delegated to take on the GOTV canvassing operation, and those operations have been pushing early voting a bit as well. We don&#x27;t know how aggressively on the throttle they&#x27;ve been pushing for early voting, but But we know it&#x27;s not the bastardization of early voting that happened in 2020, where they talked about it as being fraudulent and otherwise. Trump&#x27;s kind of backed off that rhetoric a bit. So if you can also think about early voting being part of the Republican mix, and so if that&#x27;s the case, the point becomes even stronger for Harris that Republicans are not just sitting out early voting. Some of them have encouraged friends, family, and others to go vote early, and you still see this massive gender split. But I do want to go to you on this, Carter, because you talked about male voters being reliable. Tell me more.</div>
