  <div class="said">was the night before tariffs, and all through the land, Canadians worried what fate was at hand. The leaders had warned us the headlines were dire, with duties and levies set soon to transpire. The workers lay restless awake in their beds, as visions of hardship swirled in their heads. Factories slowed, their future unclear, as whispers of layoffs rang sharp in the ear. When out from the news came a clamorous sound, a tweet from the South that twisted the wound. America first, a message declared, leaving a nation both shaken and scared. The markets grew tense, the dollar fell low, as industries braced for the oncoming blow. The farmers stood silent, surveying their fields, uncertain if trade would still bring them yields. then out on the lawn a red duke appeared a voice once so steady now laced with some fear my friends he called out we must stand tall but i fear the worst could befall us all he spoke of hard choices of belts pulled in tight of shelves growing bare and wallets grown light they tax our our timber, our auto, our grain, and every Canadian will feel the strain. The people stood somber, their hopes wearing thin, as uncertainty darkened the future within. A chill filled the air, no comfort to find, a nation held hostage to deals redefined. Then came the decree, a signature signed from the hands of a leader so cruelly inclined. Trump grinned as he spoke, his voice filled with glee. Canada loses, but America&#x27;s free. The factories fell silent, the trucks left unfilled, the workers dismissed, their pockets unfilled. The shelves stood empty, the streets filled with cries, as winter crept in with no heat to supply. The towns became hollow, their futures erased, as debts turned to ruin, a nation disgraced. And as dawn broke forth on a country in pain, we whispered in terror, will we rise again?</div>

But I don&#x27;t think we have a real sense of what the ramifications are. Because each of us has the individual insulation, right? Where we&#x27;re all like insulated, where this isn&#x27;t going to happen. This isn&#x27;t going to impact the me. mean, this could impact someone else, but it&#x27;s certainly not going to impact me. I think that&#x27;s where most Canadians are right now. Sure. But it&#x27;s going to impact a lot of people really quickly, I think.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">have been somewhat trained to overreact in these moments right because you don&#x27;t want to and also it is just kind of modern day uh capitalism that you run a little closer to the line than you did in say 1950 like you don&#x27;t have tons of inventory on hand i&#x27;m sure people have used the last month to build some of that stock but yeah run it lean, you run it close to the wire. And that means that you&#x27;re getting those parts a little bit later, which means these things are going to affect you a little bit sooner.

Certainly, I hope Donald Trump backs down quickly. Doug Ford is out there threatening to turn off electricity. So that&#x27;s kind of nice. i&#x27;ve appreciated doug ford in these moments right but uh yeah i mean i think that people are a little bit nervous but i also think there&#x27;s a bit of a well fuck you too attitude that maybe wasn&#x27;t even there in the same way a month ago i i think that we were more stunned a month ago but now it almost feels like we&#x27;ve had time to sit with this for a while what are your thoughts</div>

But there&#x27;s also increasing hints that there&#x27;s going to be quote, unquote, non-tariff responses to I think that was in the in the memo that Trudeau put out there today, or the government did.

It&#x27;s going to be different than that. it&#x27;s going to create immense pressure on the system there might be people needing to talk to industrial clients and saying you&#x27;ve got to use a little bit less electricity but i don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to get to rolling brownouts because there&#x27;s excess capacity in the system unless we happen to be in a situation where say a bunch of coal plants are in turnaround or something i don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s called turnaround in the context of like the power sector right but but if there&#x27;s a situation where they&#x27;re just offline maybe</div>

You just have to own it. And if you want to be a rational, independent thinking human, instead of a cult member, you&#x27;ve got to be willing to call them on it. And you&#x27;ve got to be willing to hold them to account on it. That is how democracy works. That&#x27;s how democracy has worked. Otherwise, you don&#x27;t have a democracy.

  <div class="said">Did not happen. And it was Didn&#x27;t happen. And that didn&#x27;t happen, not because American tanks were there, not because American munitions were making their way into the country, but because the Ukrainian people said, absolutely fucking not. And they stood up and they put on a resistance and they pushed Russia back. Right? right so let&#x27;s not forget let&#x27;s never forget that the fundamental ingredient of their resistance is their own will to resist and i see no reason to believe that that&#x27;s gone away in any meaningful sense right so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s number one the other thing that gives me kind of hope is that the nature of warfare has changed and i think ukraine has been a bit of a testing ground for that like it&#x27;s just it&#x27;s there&#x27;s drones everywhere you know the the view of like the value of a tank versus is not as different some of this has changed i&#x27;m not diminishing for a minute the value of high mars and some of the systems that the americans put forward but it war is going to be different america has uh helped ukraine but i think innovation that ukraine itself has brought forward has also told us a little bit about what the path forward might look like and then the third ingredient that gives me hope is that there is a coalition of the willing there are people saying well, we better fucking figure this out, right? And while Canada has been a bit of a defense laggard, and while no country really matches the United States in their defense spending or capacity, Europe&#x27;s pretty big. And Europe has an awful lot of a defense industry too, that can help fill some of these gaps as everybody tries to figure it out here. So that&#x27;s on the pro side. On the con side, that&#x27;s a huge hole to fill. And the Ukrainians, even back in those first days, benefited from American intelligence and American support in ways that I think are a little hard to exactly quantify, but certainly were real. And that doesn&#x27;t exist, it seems, anymore as of today. So it&#x27;s a scarier world now. but there</div>
