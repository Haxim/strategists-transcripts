  <meta name="description" content="Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dive into Calgary&#39;s latest water main break and what it reveals about crisis communications, political leadership, and governing in an attention economy. They break down why &#34;Mayor Jeromy&#39;s&#34; response is actually working, and how tone and authenticity matter more than polish. What does good crisis communication look like when everyone is tuned out? How do you keep people conserving water without panic, spin, or scapegoating? And should Carter be allowed to name-and-shame entire neighbourhoods while creeping on his new neighbours&#39; dog-walking habits?
