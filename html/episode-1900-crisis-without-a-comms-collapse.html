  <div class="said">and we watched it. You can&#x27;t do that this time. It&#x27;s like on the highway. People needed to be rescued. It was bad. December 30th. And second time, as I said, in a year and a half. And it&#x27;s a critical pipe. It&#x27;s like 60% of Calgary&#x27;s water comes from this pipe. And there&#x27;s interesting contrast here because last time when it happened, we had a different mayor. We had a different council. So we&#x27;ve also learned things from last time. And we have a mayor who less</div>

  <div class="said">I think he&#x27;s doing just fine. I think the problem is that people don&#x27;t pay attention, right? And they don&#x27;t pay attention at the best of times, and they certainly don&#x27;t pay attention when it comes to the middle of the winter and the water main breaking just before New Year&#x27;s Eve. There&#x27;s just so many different things that are dragging at their attention. so i&#x27;ve been surprised at actually how well he has done in</div>

  <div class="said">well I think You have to be strong in the first response to a crisis in the phase one. And I would argue that phase one actually moved really fast for the city of Calgary on this, because you&#x27;ve seen this movie before. So in the immediate response, though, in phase one, you have to be strong. And whatever strength looks like, it has to be authentic to you. And that&#x27;s why this is working for him. because he is he&#x27;s communicating authentically but he is also uh communicating often enough uh often enough to maintain uh the the strength and the control over the situation now</div>
