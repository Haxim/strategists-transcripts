  <div class="said">pressure is building on the prime Prime Minister and his office has a growing number of anxious liberal MPs are coordinating an effort, Stephen Carter, to force Justin Trudeau to step down as liberal leader. Multiple sources have told CBC News, Toronto Star, now Globe and Mail. It turns out, Carter, that this is a document, isn&#x27;t a letter to be circulated. Sources describe it as a vehicle to secure commitments from MPs within the liberal caucus to seek a leadership change and to bind MPs to that goal if the prime minister and his supporters push back. So what I hear, it&#x27;s a physical open letter, I guess, Carter, where MPs are signing their intent to be in solidarity for a call to seek a leadership change. That&#x27;s what it seems like. Stephen Carter, let&#x27;s start here.</div>

So it&#x27;s almost like a, a secret vote count, like the 1922 committee in the UK conservatives, right. Which allows a leadership vote to be triggered by a certain number of letters to the executive committee of that particular committee. Right. And I think it&#x27;s interesting because it, it both says something about the current state of the liberal party and the liberal caucus, but it also says something about um i think the patience of some people within that that party and what they&#x27;re looking for strategically to to be able to pull here and let&#x27;s put it this way we&#x27;ve heard forever and look you don&#x27;t have to have your ear very close to the ground to hear lots of rumblings coming out of the liberal caucus as they&#x27;re plummeting in the polls the prime minister&#x27;s office has taken on a bit of of an aura of aloofness, I guess would be the charitable, you know, way to put it. And people aren&#x27;t happy, but people also haven&#x27;t been particularly mutinous. And in part, because there is a sense that the prime minister has a pretty tight grip on things here.

So is it enough to kill it or is the rumor that there&#x27;s 20 plus MPs already enough to keep it on the tracks? So that&#x27;s a big question. And the next, I mean, how long do they have, right? How long do they have before something actually has to give way? And one would argue that they have until last June. And that&#x27;s already a past date, right? Maybe the best before date on this strategy has already come and gone. on i</div>

  <div class="said">gotta tell you the timing like i think that this tactic maybe would have been useful to apply six months ago to steven&#x27;s point but the timing now is crazy like it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a minority government there are just so many first of all there&#x27;s going to be so many people who say we don&#x27;t want this kind of bullshit right now the government could fall at any time and by the way if you&#x27;re the pmo when you&#x27;re thinking well the pressure&#x27;s getting too high you can just orchestrate your own defeat like that like how hard could it possibly even even a pmo that&#x27;s that&#x27;s way past its prime can figure out how to orchestrate its own defeat that&#x27;s that&#x27;s one-on-one stuff they might do that by accident in the next four weeks anyhow but it&#x27;s pretty meaningful when one-eighth of your caucus is willing to sign a letter like that or like a pledge like that however you want to frame it i guess um that&#x27;s pretty meaningful but it is just the timing is wild</div>

A particular name, name representation from regions gender splits amongst the list um years of service uh how many of them are seen as i&#x27;m just giving you random sort of like quote unquote like intersectionalities of of other things but is it just a raw numbers game carter or is it actually other more subjective features as well because we don&#x27;t know these 20 names right there are 20 names or so</div>

And they know that their loyalty to the prime minister is the only reason that they hold on to their jobs. I don&#x27;t know. Well, I think that maybe just sheer numbers would be enough. If you got to 35 I don&#x27;t know, just guessing, maybe tips over and people start saying, well, if it&#x27;s 35 that are willing to actually say this, then surely it&#x27;s got to be more than that that are at least thinking it.</div>

And by soft landing, I mean, we can come to terms together, hard landing, meaning, you know, here&#x27;s what you got to do. And we&#x27;re going to get louder, more abrasive, more aggressive. Not to say that this group of one would assume backbenchers has all that power. But how would you strategically think about this? Are you playing hardball?

Like that&#x27;s it. because otherwise you&#x27;re going to go splat uh that&#x27;s the only that&#x27;s the only opportunity that exists to make it a soft landing unless someone tries to get a new job for him we got the un secretary general for you justin how&#x27;s that sound right but i i don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s particularly feasible this you know for the</div>

Like in some ways it&#x27;s like, is there any truth to any of this? Is there anything we should be dealing with here? What should we address that they are rightly calling out as a problem? And you do this not out of the goodness of your heart and you don&#x27;t obviously do it because you think it makes you seem really strong, but you do it to make sure that they&#x27;re not going to find other people that are on the edge who might otherwise then be sympathetic to that. So I actually think we got a pretty good case study of that this weekend with the announcement of the two new national co-directors of the liberal campaign. One of the criticisms was, as</div>

Well, God, what, within 24 hours of that story hitting the wire and there&#x27;s the announcement of that and maybe no i&#x27;m not even going to say that it was never actually timed for that time that would be it&#x27;s fucking thanksgiving weekend that</div>

  <div class="said">that&#x27;s that&#x27;s horseshit and that&#x27;s nonsense but what it was was people taking grievances off the table so when that letter or that oath goes to the next office of the next mp that&#x27;s not something they can point to as a legitimate grievance anymore right and so So leaders&#x27; offices look around the edges and they say, who&#x27;s weak, right? In terms of like support for us, what are their concerns going to be? What are the concerns out there? Is there any legitimacy to this? If you happen to have a list of grievances, that&#x27;s great. You just start saying, okay, what can we deal with? What do we want to deal with? What should we deal with? All of those questions.</div>

  <div class="said">I do believe that good strategy comes from good analysis. So the first move is to get people who will not believe their own bullshit, shit but can clear-eyed look at this and try to craft what we think is some version of a whip count for support for the leader like absolutely in the tank for us to you know they wouldn&#x27;t cross the street and spit on us if we were on fire and and really try to understand exactly what the lay of the land is and uh from your you know you&#x27;ve got your two poles right then start to try to understand the middle like move in towards it and say like who&#x27;s who&#x27;s kind of up for grabs here Like, what&#x27;s the conversation? And then you move through them and you try to understand what exactly it is that motivates them, what they&#x27;re looking for, how you might be able to manage this situation. And I&#x27;m not saying that you have to give them it, but I&#x27;m saying you need to at least understand what you&#x27;re looking at before you move any further. You also do need to be clear on goals, but I&#x27;m taking a bit for a given. The goal here is to survive as prime minister. yes i do think that as the prime minister&#x27;s office they should be having that conversation like not everybody in a room but the chief of staff with the prime minister should be saying and justin you know it&#x27;s me it&#x27;s katie we&#x27;ve known each other a long time is this a goal like are we trying to fight this out like is that what you want right now just need to confirm i&#x27;m with you 100 wouldn&#x27;t be doing my job if i didn&#x27;t ask i think you should fight but i you know this This is your moment to sort of decide what your goal is for the next bit here. So once you&#x27;ve understood what your goals are and once you&#x27;ve understood where everybody lies and what motivates them, you then begin the conversations and you then begin the airdrops of different things. And so I would call the national directors an airdrop, right? Hey, we&#x27;re going to, we&#x27;ve just got to have that out there so that we&#x27;re able to reference it during the conversations. conversations like</div>

We also know that the focus right now is on us in an unhelpful way and Pierre Polyev in a helpful way for him. And that&#x27;s all going to change during a campaign. And we&#x27;ve done this before. We&#x27;ve been here before. Do you remember before the 2015 election, how much everybody counted us out in the Liberal Party? Well, look, we know how to deal with that. And we deal with that by doing the good work and staying united as a team and all of the crap that you would normally go through when you just start moving through that list it&#x27;s moving through that list will also tell you if you&#x27;ve approached it strategically because you want to look at the people you</div>

Any thoughts on that? Because lip service is easy, especially in a remote week where people are all across the country.

  <div class="said">couple of first of all i will just say generally how do you ascertain trust ever right it&#x27;s a pretty like complicated dance of how well you know the person what they&#x27;re saying whether it makes sense and all of that But there are some political practical approaches. One of them is force public displays of commitment, right? Well, listen, I need you out there. If you can pick up the phone and call this reporter at the CBC and let them know what you think about this on the record, that would be very helpful, right? So you put people, if you want to test their words, you make them live up to their words. You then say, okay, well, if those are your words and I take you by your words, naturally what would follow are actions A, B, and C. Maybe it&#x27;s a public display of commitment. Maybe it&#x27;s calling some other MPs and reporting back. Whatever it is, you</div>

  <div class="said">can test trust and you can test it at lower stakes ways and then move to higher stakes as you go along. But that&#x27;s the short answer. or it&#x27;s obviously always more complicated, but also it&#x27;s always in the background. Like trust is always a conversation or a consideration or contemplation in these moments.</div>

One data point, one data point only. We&#x27;ve seen with the Bevan announcement that they can try and change the channel on you, right? Well, you guys wanted us to have a better campaign director. doesn&#x27;t matter who the fucking campaign director is going to be. We&#x27;re going to get annihilated, right? It could be a mixture of all the deities and we&#x27;re still going to lose, right? There is no way that we&#x27;re going to win this election.

The question is, will they be the official opposition or the third party in the House, or maybe even the fourth party um they have gone they they didn&#x27;t fall the two seats but falling to the 30s and then trying to recover is a very very difficult lift and the other problem that they have because i&#x27;m going to do two because cory kind of did two is that they have no capacity at all to look forward read the bevin announcement right strengthening our public health care centers system with dental care and and pharmacare, and building a stronger economy while creating new middle-class jobs, and $10 a day childcare, and making housing more affordable. This is the same shit. They couldn&#x27;t change their message if their life depended on it. This is the message that brought them to this stage, where they are losing by 20 points.

So the prime minister, if he&#x27;s going to step down, has only one choice, and that is to prorogue. The opposition have only one choice, and that is to get a motion of non-confidence across the goal bull line. Those are the two next plays that we see.

So I&#x27;m not sure that the best people in the world are going to change things unless the mindset of the leader changes.

I think it&#x27;s so exceedingly unlikely that for day-to-day purposes, you can assume you&#x27;re going to have a Pierre Polyev government next year, right? Oh, We&#x27;re talking like the longest of fucking odds here. I mean, I guess I already have Stephen. Zane, do you think they&#x27;re cooked? Like, do you think there&#x27;s any way the liberals can win this campaign? Because I think that that fundamentally is the difference in answers and difference in perspectives on this particular question of yours here. I think that it is possible for them to win it. I think, again, the longest possible odds. And I think if you had 10 of the best people in the world empowered, as Stephen said, yeah,</div>

Which would be the top three positions that you would recruit for the international pool of all-stars to help rehabilitate this liberal campaign? Okay. So you guys are on a train that says, maybe this is possible. I don&#x27;t give you 10, I give you three. What are the three? In which order? Three titles? Yeah. Well,</div>

Give me your three in order. Who would it be? Is it air, war, is it ground? I want to just get your thinking on this through this question.</div>

  <div class="said">cannot cannot be done without the camp without the government without all the levers of government working for you and the only person who can bring all the levers of government working for you is the chief of staff to the prime minister can&#x27;t be done without it second person would be the a campaign strategist like a real campaign strategist um someone who understands how to move uh regions of people uh and regions of people is super duper hard to move you know like we talk about the alberta regions there&#x27;s british columbia regions um i mean we&#x27;re talking the whole fucking country and that&#x27;s a super hard strategy to implement um and probably the third thing would be someone who&#x27;s an excellent ad cutter</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">yeah yeah you know you&#x27;ve somewhat sold me on the chief of staffing not because it would give you the levers of government but because that seems to be a real fail point for liberals right now like the ability to facilitate facilitate across all of these various groups of people and i think that&#x27;s a natural role for the chief of staff both within government and and beyond but i will say for me it is it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s impossible for me not to put strategy one um simply because for how long have we been saying i can&#x27;t fucking figure out what they&#x27;re trying to do here like i and i think that&#x27;s a real problem like that&#x27;s not like a super sneaky secret strategy that&#x27;s a that&#x27;s a problem You should be able to tell what their goal is and how they&#x27;re trying to put it together and how they&#x27;re positioning themselves. So that has to be number one. But like 1A for me, because I think storytelling is such an essential component of it, is comms, which, you know, as a comms guy, that&#x27;s pretty self-serving. But they need to figure out the story of not just this government, but what a future liberal government would be like, really a future liberal government to a point Stevens made a couple of times here. What do you get? And that story then needs to be driven through everything. And yes, it needs to be driven through the ads. And yes, it needs to be, you know, implemented through all sorts of candidate materials and whatnot. not but if you just had a really crystal clear vision of both strategy and communications i actually think that most of those other pieces would fall away and you wouldn&#x27;t have too too much to worry about there in terms of the third position um i</div>

They&#x27;re getting crushed in the quality of their digital right now. And I think in terms of the various channels that they need to tighten up on, it&#x27;s that like, that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s unconscionable that the conservatives are running 30 circles around them for everyone they managed to do. And they, they need to find somebody who can really help them pick up. I feel like they&#x27;re in a different, it&#x27;s so funny how quickly this stuff moves because what was cutting edge 10 fucking years ago, if you&#x27;re still like, we talked about this the other day, like if you&#x27;re still trying to hit those dopamine centers, you&#x27;re losing. You&#x27;re running a losing path. They seem to be playing a game that went stale 10 years ago.</div>

Although I will say, nothing sucks like having a campaign with no money. But I don&#x27;t know that that&#x27;s the liberals most pressing concern. I think ultimately,</div>
