  <meta name="description" content="Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dig into Alberta&#39;s latest separatist referendum push and ask the two questions that actually matter: is it inevitable, and is it likely? They break down the math behind the new 177,000-signature threshold, the organizational reality facing separatist groups, and why last summer&#39;s &#34;Forever Canadian&#34; petition may have been lightning in a bottle rather than a new normal.What political price does the UCP pay for flirting with separatism? Do pro-Canada forces need to organize again, or is ignoring the petition the smartest strategy? And if this thing somehow makes it to a referendum, which of the three hosts is least emotionally prepared to live through the campaign without yelling at strangers on the internet? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.You can also watch our episodes on YouTube.https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod" />
