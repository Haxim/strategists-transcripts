  <title>Episode 1899: Schulz Resigns | What Does This Mean for Unity? | The Strategists</title>

  







  <meta name="description" content="Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips talk about Rebecca Schulz’s sudden resignation from cabinet and what it signals about unity inside the UCP, and the country. They dive into the subtext of the resignation letter, whether this is about an oncoming referendum or possibly even an early election. Is this actually a problem for Danielle Smith or just another data point in a noisy political moment? What should we actually take from the Alberta Next panel? Signal? Noise? Or a roadmap to bigger trouble? And will Carter’s MP return his calls about getting his toilet to flush? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line." />
