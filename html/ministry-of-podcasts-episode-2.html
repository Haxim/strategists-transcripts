  <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Be it resolved that the Minister of Podcasts, Stephen Carter, together with the Chair of Oral Questions, Zain Velji, do convene this sitting of The Ministry of Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be it further resolved that the House shall hear testimony from the newly sworn Member of Parliament and Parliamentary Secretary, Corey Hogan, on matters pertaining to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eternal balance between message discipline and authentic self,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials of assembling IKEA furniture between Question Periods,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lonely burden of representation,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the etiquette of grocery shopping in a baseball cap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore be it finally resolved that this episode, having no formal agenda but much informal candour, stands as both a record of proceedings and a cautionary tale for any who would confuse a parliamentary headset with a proper microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;&#34;&gt; Hosted on Acast.

Stephen Carter is the Minister of Podcasts. Corey Hogan is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Podcasts. That's good. And, of course, this show is brought to us by Flair Airlines, the new Ministry of Transportation. Yeah, no, it's true. It's true.

<p data-start="247.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> It's</p>
<p data-start="247.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> 1110 at night here. It's entirely on you.</p>
<p data-start="251.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Your</p>
<p data-start="251.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Your lighting is questionable as well. I said this, you look like you've eaten the corpse of Dracula with this lighting. It looks very spotlit.</p>
<p data-start="251.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Your</p>
<p data-start="262.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="263.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah well</p>
<p data-start="264.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know i'm just trying to create a sense of drama for the minister of podcast here who also has very dramatic lighting i don't see you coming after him yeah</p>
<p data-start="272.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> i do i have very dramatic yeah he</p>
<p data-start="274.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah he</p>
<p data-start="274.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> he</p>
<p data-start="274.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> he does</p>
<p data-start="274.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> does yeah</p>
<p data-start="274.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah it's uh it's you zane who's the problem yeah</p>
<p data-start="278.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah carter</p>
<p data-start="278.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter we have a sitting mp and i think we're talking to him about the right things uh personally as i review the last five minutes i think we're nailing it um we have no form or structure on this show yeah i know other than Other than at some point to get Corey to uncross his arms and not be tense. Yeah, do you want to maybe do that so</p>
<p data-start="294.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> not be tense. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="297.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="298.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> that you could be hospitable? Oh, fantastic. Carter, we ask Corey questions. We ask him how his summer was, I suspect. We ask him what's going on. Where shall we start? I've got a few questions for one of Mr. Hogan, but of course, I will let you as the minister get us started.</p>
<p data-start="299.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> that you could be hospitable?</p>
<p data-start="312.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I'm really interested primarily in what it's been like going back. You know, the first time going into the House, I think, is kind of exciting. You know, you're, you're a rookie, you're getting sworn in, you're flying to Ottawa. It's all tickety-boo and exciting. Uh, now you've got an apartment. Now you're, you know, you live in Ottawa for all intents and purposes, uh, during the session. What's it been like for, for you to find yourself in this new situation where you're really, for the first time, more than a kilometer and a half away from me and Zane?</p>
<p data-start="348.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> is actually it's great it's true it is actually i feel that absence every day too i want you guys to know but i think</p>
<p data-start="353.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> know but i think so i</p>
<p data-start="356.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> i don't still early days right like it is what you said is totally true like the feel of coming back was is not the same as the first time that i went there but we're still setting everything up like both in a kind of a literal household sense but also just in terms of just figuring out our lives like it's a really funny job because every day you're you're doing something for the first time, but it also feels like you</p>
<p data-start="365.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="380.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> log so many miles so quickly, you're also doing something for what feels like the millionth time every day too, right? Like, God, another question period. Here we go. Even</p>
<p data-start="390.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Even though, like, honestly, it's only been, I don't know,</p>
<p data-start="393.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> 25</p>
<p data-start="394.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> 25 of them? Like, it's not like a lot of question periods yet. And just to give you a sense, like, I flew in Sunday night, Monday morning, landed at like 1 a.m., went</p>
<p data-start="404.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> to an apartment I've never been to before. I had one of my staff go with their phone and kind of look around and give me video of it there he also accepted a giant ikea delivery so i'm i'm in like stonehenge ikea like there's just boxes everywhere my</p>
<p data-start="420.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> bed is not like my bed is still in one of those shrink wrap tubes so that i have to like open the bed and find the sheets i put that on i sleep on the floor on the mattress and and</p>
<p data-start="430.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> and i still haven't managed to assemble anything besides that because when you're in parliament like it's 7 a.m to 10 p.m every night I sometimes</p>
<p data-start="436.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> sometimes later, if you're going to do, uh, you know, you</p>
<p data-start="439.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know, a C tier podcast from, uh, from Calgary, Alberta, but, uh, yeah,</p>
<p data-start="444.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah, man, it's, uh, it's a weird time. It's a really weird time.</p>
<p data-start="449.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> I've, I've got a question for you. Okay. So maybe we'll go back and forth, Carter. Um, it's a new novel. Oh, I like this. You ask one and then I ask one. Two hosts. And then we keep it fresh. No, this is good. We keep it fresh. So the three of us, Corey, have done media training for several executives, organizations. We've</p>
<p data-start="455.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh,</p>
<p data-start="456.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh,</p>
<p data-start="456.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh,</p>
<p data-start="456.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, I like this. You</p>
<p data-start="457.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> You ask one and then I ask</p>
<p data-start="458.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> ask one. Two hosts. And then we keep it fresh. No,</p>
<p data-start="461.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> No,</p>
<p data-start="461.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, this is good. We</p>
<p data-start="461.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> We keep</p>
<p data-start="461.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> keep</p>
<p data-start="462.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> it fresh.</p>
<p data-start="468.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> executives,</p>
<p data-start="469.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> organizations. We've</p>
<p data-start="471.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> We've media trained a lot of people. You have recently been in media. I am curious if any of the media training you have given has applied to you or if you've caught yourself. And is the training you've provided in retrospect been sufficient? Has it been interesting? Have you internalized it? how are you thinking of media i mean we three of us did a ton of media when we were pundits but this is different you're like you're doing accountability interviews right like yeah often um give</p>
<p data-start="501.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> give me that sense when when like you're you're in the big leagues that way and what your training and pedigree has kind of like led you to or any insights you have yeah</p>
<p data-start="510.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> well i would say first and foremost like it is a great foundation like you you know exactly what you're supposed to be doing and of course we've been doing it for so long and even in the pundit version like you're</p>
<p data-start="521.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> not gonna get swayed by some of the conventional tricks you know these things that uh reporters do where</p>
<p data-start="528.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> where they take you through a bit of a roller coaster you know they're they're your best bud oh man that answer really dissatisfied them though don't you want your best bud back like give a better answer tell us more information you know i'm</p>
<p data-start="538.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm never</p>
<p data-start="538.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> never gonna fall for any of them without naming names</p>
<p data-start="539.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> any of them without naming names have you seen that roller coaster play out in recent media of course yeah i mean you</p>
<p data-start="542.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> out in recent media of course yeah i mean you know and one of the things is it happens not just on camera like beforehand Beforehand, everyone's like, oh, hey, how are you doing? Blah, blah, blah. And then on camera, they start a little warm and they're like, what the f**k?</p>
<p data-start="554.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, you create this sense almost that these answers are unsatisfactory. And that's like a</p>
<p data-start="559.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> regular tactic of media. It's not a bad thing. It probably serves them very well. But, you know, so some of that fundamental stuff you just have a good understanding of. But there's also key</p>
<p data-start="569.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> key messaging, bridging back to your key message, making sure you don't get too lost into the weeds. Of course, nobody does it perfect all of the time. And sometimes you do find yourself in the weeds. But knowing</p>
<p data-start="577.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> sometimes you do find</p>
<p data-start="579.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> knowing how to pull yourself out of it, know how to get your point across, that's all useful stuff. And I think that in</p>
<p data-start="585.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> general, if you're going to be working with the media, you should have a pretty good sense of how that all works. You</p>
<p data-start="590.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> got to do the major projects thing. That was your big media last week, right? Where you got to stand in front of all the cameras and do the major projects. Political shows,</p>
<p data-start="599.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> projects. Political shows, at least. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="600.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> at least. Yeah. And you got to be the spinner.</p>
<p data-start="601.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> And you got to</p>
<p data-start="602.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> to be</p>
<p data-start="606.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, it's not so much even, well, it's an interesting one, right? Like, so it is my job, like I'm parliamentary secretary for energy, natural resources. And there were a couple of programs I went on for sure. And a couple of different interviews I had. And,</p>
<p data-start="620.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah, I mean, when you're a pundit, like we all were, it's more like, give us your analysis. Well, maybe I agree with that. Maybe I don't. Hmm, interesting. Let's move on. Whereas when it's, you know, the government, and to Zane's point about accountability, it becomes much more like, hmm, but is that, like, can I trust that? Like, tell me more. Like, tell me why that's not BS, you know? And so you end up in a more charged environment. I wouldn't call it confrontational, but certainly it's not loose and easy. It's not like, whatever</p>
<p data-start="649.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you say, who cares? You're just talking for yourself. You're carrying the weight of a government initiative worth billions</p>
<p data-start="656.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> billions of dollars, like $60 billion of development for the country, right? You just don't want to kind of screw it up. And so</p>
<p data-start="658.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> development for</p>
<p data-start="663.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> there is a totally different feeling. And of course, one of the things that I think is a risk that comes from having done too media in different contexts and by the way i think</p>
<p data-start="672.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> think you can both attest we saw this a lot when reporters went to the other side like when they became pr people you</p>
<p data-start="676.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> they became pr</p>
<p data-start="678.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> can be too comfortable and you can be too loose and you can just go off script a little too easily so you have to keep that in mind and you have to check yourself as you're going to because it's not one</p>
<p data-start="681.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> and you can just</p>
<p data-start="688.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> person's riffing it's not the column you're writing tomorrow it is you know a controlled conversation about the government's message because the government's message is important and it's It's really easy to get knocked off message. So you</p>
<p data-start="701.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> got a bit more of a weight on your shoulders. I think when you're doing media like this, there's no question. Was there any instinct</p>
<p data-start="705.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> question. Was there any instinct that you had to be like, like enter into pundit mode a bit or be like, play things off as, you know, like use humor or anything like that. Like things that you would do on our pod. Right. When you were like the part of the trip to be like, this could be helpful here. Or like, are you sticking to the ground rules? Cause I find that really interesting. Right. Like you've got this other persona that you've had on the podcast for years. Right. Like, And, like, that's looser, more like—and it's because it's the three of us, I would imagine. Rarely crossed</p>
<p data-start="716.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> you were like the</p>
<p data-start="732.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Rarely crossed his arms for interviews, you know? Yeah, rarely. I would say, yeah, I</p>
<p data-start="734.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> know? Yeah, rarely. I would say, yeah, I think this suit count is suit count number five across thousands of episodes. So, like, did you—and do you think about, like, bringing any of those charms—and I'm not saying you're not being authentic. That's not the code behind what I'm trying to say. But, like, do you feel like being more authentic is part of what you want to do? yeah</p>
<p data-start="757.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i i mean i think it's funny because you're sort of like almost like asking knowing that me saying oh i'm doing this could feel like a tactic and like feels like you're trying to do me stuff i'll tell you this like one of the things that i tried to do when</p>
<p data-start="769.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> i when i got elected was i thought like you know like and</p>
<p data-start="773.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> in fact my wife was like she's like just don't become like another like absolute robot fucking loser yeah yeah well i don't think she used those words but i did fucking losers yeah yeah that's</p>
<p data-start="778.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> fucking loser yeah yeah well i</p>
<p data-start="782.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> i did fucking losers yeah yeah that's just another lame ass personality less loser</p>
<p data-start="783.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="784.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="784.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="784.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> just another</p>
<p data-start="784.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> another lame</p>
<p data-start="788.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> loser yes i mean like you're gonna you're gonna have to be thoughtful about it your comments can move markets you can you can really wreck big things you know for not just for yourself but for the country in a job like this so you can't be flip</p>
<p data-start="802.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> flip but</p>
<p data-start="803.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i do think that sometimes in uh you know in media in politics politics, people are controlled to the point of like, not saying anything. And I didn't want to be that guy. So like, I was certainly hoping I could still talk</p>
<p data-start="816.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> a little bit, like go through it, not just stay at like the the platitude, but actually go into the next line underneath it. And I try to do that. But</p>
<p data-start="823.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's a limit to like, seriously, there's a limit, like, there's only so much you can do before you're like, now,</p>
<p data-start="828.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> now,</p>
<p data-start="829.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> maybe this is not a wise idea, right? So like, it's like, you don't get to go into like the five minute monologue, like you do on the strategist, but But maybe you could do a minute and a half where you're like, oh, and like, hey, we've got this other thing to consider. And hey, have you thought about that? But, you</p>
<p data-start="843.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know,</p>
<p data-start="844.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="846.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> tricky.</p>
<p data-start="846.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> tricky. Like, you really don't want to blow it up. I don't know. What do you guys think? You've seen Night Media.</p>
<p data-start="852.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="852.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I</p>
<p data-start="852.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> I mean, I honestly genuinely don't ask as a criticism. I ask almost thinking of, like, armchair quarterback. If I got elected tomorrow, what would I be in the sense of, like, public persona? You know what I mean? Like, would I just be like, oh, I'm just going to drop an F-bomb. No one's going to like, because that's how I talk or like part</p>
<p data-start="852.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="852.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="852.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I mean, I honestly</p>
<p data-start="853.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> honestly</p>
<p data-start="862.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> sense of, like,</p>
<p data-start="864.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Like, would I</p>
<p data-start="868.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's how I talk</p>
<p data-start="871.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> of me likes to think I would,</p>
<p data-start="873.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> but I'm not faced with the reality you are, which is caucus responsibility. Like, I get it, right? Like, intellectually, I get it. But I guess what's the balance in this world where people want more authenticity, people want more real people. And I'm not saying you'd be Beto O'Rourke and drop F-bombs. That's not what I'm suggesting at all. But I'm just kind of curious, like, have you found the balance or are you comfortable with thus far with like this tone? I'm not asking you to introspect. It's not a criticism. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="873.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="899.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, like I'm not uncomfortable. It's interesting. Like, but to your point, I did drop an F-bomb earlier in this episode. I thought I probably shouldn't have done that. And, you know, I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm not sure that swearing means as much to me. Right. Maybe it does you and Beto O'Rourke. But I think it is one of those things where you start to wonder, okay, well, what is like additive being yourself and what is diminishing being yourself? self like like like what are the parts that are actually going to help this conversation along or because like look i didn't i didn't come here to be funny on television i came here to get stuff done i think that the country is like at an important crossroads and so okay so</p>
<p data-start="908.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="908.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm not sure.</p>
<p data-start="909.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="909.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="909.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> sure that swearing</p>
<p data-start="910.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> swearing</p>
<p data-start="937.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> so okay so that's where we're different okay i see yeah yeah okay okay okay that's</p>
<p data-start="938.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah okay okay okay that's why you ran instead of me you know what's really like listen another context about the three of us i was talking to somebody about like what's a good show right yeah like of the strategists and you know i was was saying to them for steven it's no question it's was the show entertaining like that's that's like his bar like he's never happier than when the show is entertaining for zane it's is this different than what everybody else is doing like is this zaggy yes right and for me it was like was it informative and that was always kind of the the difference between the three of us when we're approaching a show and when a show was like all three of those then like we were all happy but generally speaking most shows can't be all three of those right but</p>
<p data-start="941.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="942.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> me you know what's really like</p>
<p data-start="944.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> another</p>
<p data-start="944.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> another context</p>
<p data-start="958.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> he's never</p>
<p data-start="964.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> zaggy</p>
<p data-start="978.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> but you know i think that that is a bit of the difference between us and maybe why i sort of ended up you know doing this at least first i don't know i could still see you running some days ain't but like what about</p>
<p data-start="987.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> what about me i'm right you're right here</p>
<p data-start="987.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> me i'm</p>
<p data-start="988.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> you're right here</p>
<p data-start="989.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> here</p>
<p data-start="989.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> here like poised</p>
<p data-start="990.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> poised i'm</p>
<p data-start="990.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> i'm right</p>
<p data-start="990.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm right here carter i</p>
<p data-start="991.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="991.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> right here</p>
<p data-start="991.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> here</p>
<p data-start="991.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> here</p>
<p data-start="991.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> here carter</p>
<p data-start="991.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter</p>
<p data-start="991.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> carter</p>
<p data-start="991.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter</p>
<p data-start="992.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah one thing i'll let you i'll let you have the mic carter uh one thing i don't like is that cory's talking about the podcast the three of us as if it was something in the past and not something that's going to happen again once he loses yeah uh the next election i don't like that i don't like that about you you live You live in my writing. I know, and I will vote, and that's all,</p>
<p data-start="1002.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah uh</p>
<p data-start="1003.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> i don't</p>
<p data-start="1004.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> that i</p>
<p data-start="1006.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you you live</p>
<p data-start="1008.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> know, and I</p>
<p data-start="1011.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> all, but I will vote for you. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1015.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I appreciate that. Well, it depends. It depends, actually. Well, we'll see. We'll see what happens. But no,</p>
<p data-start="1015.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> appreciate</p>
<p data-start="1015.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> appreciate that. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1015.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, it depends.</p>
<p data-start="1015.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> depends.</p>
<p data-start="1016.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> depends.</p>
<p data-start="1016.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> depends. It depends,</p>
<p data-start="1017.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="1017.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="1017.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, we'll</p>
<p data-start="1017.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> we'll</p>
<p data-start="1017.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> we'll see. We'll</p>
<p data-start="1017.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> We'll see what happens. But no, I mean, like, look, to your question, it's like, these are, I</p>
<p data-start="1025.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> came to do something, right? And I don't want to get in my own way while trying to do those things. So, like, you try to think about that, too.</p>
<p data-start="1031.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's just difficult to imagine a scenario where you have to change your personality, you know, kind of dramatically to fit into a new role. because it's not just a nine to five job, right? Like it is all day, every day you're on the stage, whether you're on the stage on main media or you're jumping into a caucus meeting or you're jumping into a meeting with the prime minister's office, wherever you are, you're on stage, even if it's a meeting with a constituent, right? Whereas, you know, before, like we</p>
<p data-start="1060.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1063.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> have time off, right? We don't have to be the member of parliament for Calgary Confederation all the time. How's that wearing on you? And is it wearing on the family unit as well? Like, has it changed the relationship with the gen pop that we that we get to interact with? You know, I know a lot of people come up to me and say, really glad Corey's a member of parliament and off the podcast. But is you know, is that is that something that you get all the time, too? Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1073.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> family</p>
<p data-start="1094.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> So I did a video about this just the other day. It</p>
<p data-start="1098.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> is weird. Like on a Saturday morning before April of this year, like, you know, Laurie would say something like, oh, we need breakfast. And I'd be like, okay, I'll go to the store. And I'd put</p>
<p data-start="1108.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> put on a ball cap and I'd put on a sweater or something. I'd be wearing like just clothes that look like absolute garbage. And I'd walk out and I'd go to the store. You don't get to do that anymore, right? You got to be like, okay, well, if I'm going out, I got to shave, I got to shower, I got to do my hair, you know, I got to hit that level of like weekend professional where it's like, no, I don't need to wear like a suit, obviously, but I should probably wear a collared shirt or like, you know, something. And I know</p>
<p data-start="1133.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> know it sounds dumb, but you're also pretty mindful a lot of the time that you are their representative. And there's a lot of people are like, you're not representing me well, if you're not like wearing something nicer, right? right? Is this how I want to be? Isn't that such an old</p>
<p data-start="1145.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> how I want to be? Isn't that such an old school way of... Sure, dude, but it's</p>
<p data-start="1148.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Sure, dude, but it's a big ride and there's like 130,000 people who live in it and some of them are older, some of them are more traditional, you know? And some of them are happy to have you supporting it. And to my point about you don't want to get in your own way, is it the biggest deal? I agree, I don't think it has any effect on whether I'm a good representative or not, whether I wear a baseball cap to the the grocery store but you do think to yourself like why would i get in my own way if this matters to them and</p>
<p data-start="1164.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> agree, I don't think</p>
<p data-start="1167.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> representative or not, whether I wear a baseball</p>
<p data-start="1175.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> and me</p>
<p data-start="1175.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> and me just it doesn't matter shit ton to you it doesn't matter to me at all and i what am i gonna stand on like some principle that i want i want the right to be grubby on a saturday morning like what what's that mean so so there is a little bit of that and and so it does mean that you</p>
<p data-start="1180.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> all and i</p>
<p data-start="1190.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> think about that a little bit more and um i don't know like so far for the family stuff it hasn't had had like a huge effect i mean i think the kids are still in that fairly</p>
<p data-start="1199.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> malleable age where they're like oh okay this is the thing we're doing now oh okay you know and</p>
<p data-start="1203.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh okay</p>
<p data-start="1205.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> and um and while it certainly had an effect on everything i don't i don't think it they're not being like oh my god it's the worst every time we go out you know i think they're still thinking it's pretty fun check in with me on that one in six months yeah</p>
<p data-start="1216.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="1216.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i will i will for sure it's something that's interesting because it is a you know it is uh two things being away all the time yeah well that's It's tough being</p>
<p data-start="1216.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i will i will for sure it's</p>
<p data-start="1224.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah well that's It's tough being</p>
<p data-start="1226.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> being on all the time. Both of those, you know, make it more challenging to be yourself in in your normal situation. I</p>
<p data-start="1235.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I remember being chief of staff and having a hell of a time trying to figure out how to to</p>
<p data-start="1241.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> to be</p>
<p data-start="1242.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> be yourself and represent the government at the same time.</p>
<p data-start="1246.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> It was kind of a a tricky little line and not one I managed well. well so i think that you've made more more good choices uh but then you know i i trailblazed for it has cory been a has</p>
<p data-start="1246.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> It</p>
<p data-start="1257.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> trailblazed for it has</p>
<p data-start="1258.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> has cory been a has cory been an mp longer than you've been a chief of staff i just want to do the cumulatively or</p>
<p data-start="1262.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> cumulatively or</p>
<p data-start="1263.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> or uh</p>
<p data-start="1263.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> uh</p>
<p data-start="1264.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> sure yeah yeah do you think he's gonna laugh you know over under on if cory's</p>
<p data-start="1268.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> do you think he's gonna laugh you know over</p>
<p data-start="1269.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> under on if cory's gonna be an mp longer than you were chief of staff i</p>
<p data-start="1270.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> cory's</p>
<p data-start="1273.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think it's gonna be longer i I think it's going to be longer. That's nice. Don't jinx it. Not</p>
<p data-start="1275.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's going to be longer. That's nice. Don't jinx it. Not</p>
<p data-start="1278.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Not a lot, but</p>
<p data-start="1279.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> but a bit longer.</p>
<p data-start="1279.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> bit longer. I think it isn't. I think he's going to take my conversation of authenticity to heart. And there may be a national interview that Corey gives that doesn't go so well.</p>
<p data-start="1291.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1292.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> I mean, actually, it's funny. The other thing about interviews is you think about that a lot, especially in the early days.</p>
<p data-start="1297.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> I've had a few under my belt now, and it's like, I could probably have one that's not ideal, and it wouldn't be the end of the world. They'd be like, oh, off day. What's your first one? Right. Like, oh, go do this for us. And you're like,</p>
<p data-start="1310.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'd like not to screw this up. Isn't that interesting,</p>
<p data-start="1311.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> to screw this up. Isn't that interesting, though? Like you are carrying the load of spokesperson on some of these files where you are the parliamentary secretary, not the minister, so to speak. There is a there there where it's like you're taking one for the, I guess, in your case, the triad that is the natural resource, like you, one of the two parliaments and the minister, but also like by extension, the entire government. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1317.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> the minister,</p>
<p data-start="1331.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> well, especially when the file is so real to it. But Zane, when you were talking, or Carter, I guess, when you're saying it's tough to know how to be yourself in it, I</p>
<p data-start="1339.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="1339.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think a</p>
<p data-start="1339.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="1340.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I think a lot about, I had a boss, she was the clerk in Alberta, Marsha Nelson, and I was new DM there, and she said something to me, which I think is advice that a lot of people get, but it was the first time I had really heard it. And she said, hey, you got to know something like these are lonely jobs. Right. Like you. Everybody treats you a little bit differently. You know, it's just a bit of a different feeling. There's a bit of a like hierarchy. You can't go like hanging out with people the same way you used to do it. And</p>
<p data-start="1368.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's a huge truth to that. Right. People treat you very differently when you have a job like that. Like, I'm not a different person. You know, I'm the same kid who was on this podcast four months ago. But it does like people do treat you differently. So as much as it's like, how do I stay being myself? The other reality is, Carter, people don't treat me the same as they used to. Thank</p>
<p data-start="1377.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> same kid who was on</p>
<p data-start="1390.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Thank God you've got Zane and I then. Let's</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> got</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> got</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> got</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> got Zane</p>
<p data-start="1390.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Zane</p>
<p data-start="1391.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Zane</p>
<p data-start="1393.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Let's be clear about that. Have you noticed, let's make this a bit meta and self-involved, which is the other subtitle of this podcast. Have you noticed us treating you differently in</p>
<p data-start="1399.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> other subtitle</p>
<p data-start="1400.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> subtitle</p>
<p data-start="1405.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> any meaningful way? No, not in a meaningful way. I'm curious if the answer is yes as well, because I think that is fascinating. because i</p>
<p data-start="1405.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> any meaningful way? No, not in a meaningful way. I'm curious if</p>
<p data-start="1408.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> if the</p>
<p data-start="1411.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i have been and i'm curious if you've noticed have you i don't think i've noticed this i look i would listen and i'm now i'm feeling like i'm not a very observant friend but</p>
<p data-start="1421.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> but uh no</p>
<p data-start="1421.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh</p>
<p data-start="1421.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="1421.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> no no no i'm curious i'm curious if you notice and just this is only in one one way and it's very</p>
<p data-start="1421.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="1422.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> no no i'm</p>
<p data-start="1426.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> very meaningful uh but keep going okay well i'm looking forward to hearing this but like uh you know i i think you notice it a lot less with the people that you've known for longer and i've known both of you for a really long time like you're both very good friends of mine and i think uh you</p>
<p data-start="1436.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> both of you for a really</p>
<p data-start="1437.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> time like</p>
<p data-start="1441.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> really hang on to those people at moments like that right like and and i think it's great that i yeah i've got lots of good friends but like ah it's more like that you know not even the next hero but the tier after that where all of a sudden they're like calling you mp hogan or yes mike i</p>
<p data-start="1458.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> yes mike i can't tell you like</p>
<p data-start="1459.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i can't tell you like when i got elected my phone no slight to anyone listening who was one of these many hundreds of people who did it but my phone blew up with people who all i hadn't talked to in years is who are like oh let's grab coffee right holy shit yeah awesome right</p>
<p data-start="1470.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> holy shit yeah awesome right</p>
<p data-start="1472.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> right and not all lobbyists not</p>
<p data-start="1472.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> and not all lobbyists not all looking for</p>
<p data-start="1474.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> for something not all lobbyists not all looking yeah yeah listen yeah</p>
<p data-start="1474.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> something not all lobbyists not all looking yeah yeah listen yeah</p>
<p data-start="1477.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> love you all and i will try to get to all of you for coffees at some point in the near future but like there isn't like you're like i</p>
<p data-start="1484.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean i like haven't really heard from you in five years right and like i'm glad that i'm back on your radar like life is fun like that like it all of a sudden like people pull back into your life but like you</p>
<p data-start="1493.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> do you can't help but wonder at those moments like Like, do they want something, right? Yeah, it's just transactional.</p>
<p data-start="1498.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> right? Yeah, it's just transactional. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1499.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1499.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Well, you know, and that's, or like even banking for future use. And so that does kind of, you</p>
<p data-start="1500.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="1506.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know, you think about that. And that's not great that you think about that. And I should think about the fact that I think about that to go even more meta than you're talking about, Zane. But it is definitely, it's hard not to notice the sheer volume of engagements you have that you just, you</p>
<p data-start="1521.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you hadn't had in a long time.</p>
<p data-start="1523.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> The way I've been treating you differently is I've been deliberately reaching out less because i think you are so much busier you have explicitly reached out to me more cold called me texted me than i've actually sent to you because i'm like well fuck this guy is just like why would he want to shoot the shit about this you know what i mean like and in some ways i wonder and i heard this from someone else is that like it's a lonely job because a people treat you differently but often the people that are your closest friends like they just sometimes stop reaching out because they're like well this person like i'm gonna park them on the side and i'm not i'm not naming the person but very close to me you can kind of put the pieces together potentially also had a version of this where the friends around them were like oh we're not reaching out because we're sorry like we we thought we were like on the outs like not because we don't like it because yeah you got big shit to do now like you know i mean that's</p>
<p data-start="1575.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="1575.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's kind of that's a</p>
<p data-start="1575.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's kind of that's a hundred percent true zane like you say it and i hadn't really thought it's so true like you hear from your friends less and you hear from your acquaintances more when</p>
<p data-start="1582.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> when you're in a relationship. I imagine.</p>
<p data-start="1582.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> when you're in a relationship. I imagine. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1584.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah. That's wild. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1585.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's wild. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1587.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm going to start calling him every</p>
<p data-start="1587.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm going to start calling him every day.</p>
<p data-start="1590.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> No, but it's true. Corey has called me more randomly just to chat about stuff. I think that's actually true</p>
<p data-start="1590.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's true.</p>
<p data-start="1591.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Corey has</p>
<p data-start="1591.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> has</p>
<p data-start="1594.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> stuff. I think that's actually true of you too, Carter. Oh, absolutely. I think I call you more than you call me. And</p>
<p data-start="1595.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, absolutely. I think</p>
<p data-start="1596.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> think I call you more</p>
<p data-start="1596.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> more</p>
<p data-start="1598.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And it's for the same reason.</p>
<p data-start="1599.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm always, like, when I'm thinking about, oh, I got to call Corey, right? I have to think, eh, where is he? What's he doing right now? Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1607.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah. And</p>
<p data-start="1608.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> And what's the relative priority of this? and then you</p>
<p data-start="1613.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> know i'm also very not fussed when it doesn't go through right when we're unable to connect but i'll tell you i also answer your phone calls a lot more than i used to you</p>
<p data-start="1624.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> you i i i i don't oh i know that</p>
<p data-start="1624.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> i i i</p>
<p data-start="1624.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="1626.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> i know</p>
<p data-start="1626.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> know that for it's i well i'm still don't because zane you you you are who you are your core you're like you don't want to change this is true i appreciate that i fucking said a lot i bent</p>
<p data-start="1632.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> this is true</p>
<p data-start="1633.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> i fucking said a lot i bent over for him so you know that's the wrong phrasing yeah i shouldn't say yeah i said that incorrectly uh</p>
<p data-start="1639.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i shouldn't say yeah</p>
<p data-start="1640.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i said that</p>
<p data-start="1642.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> but i i never changed her never</p>
<p data-start="1643.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> never changed her never</p>
<p data-start="1644.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> never</p>
<p data-start="1644.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> never</p>
<p data-start="1645.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> never changed no this is this is the reality we you know when he calls i i could be in a meeting and for the most part unless it's like a really important i have to go oh excuse me this</p>
<p data-start="1646.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> no this is this is</p>
<p data-start="1652.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> a really</p>
<p data-start="1656.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is a parliamentary secretary they say what the hell is a parliamentary secretary he</p>
<p data-start="1660.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> still has that animation of himself as his avatar i do yeah well that doesn't that doesn't seem serious at all i should probably change that phone number but</p>
<p data-start="1663.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> do yeah</p>
<p data-start="1665.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> probably change that phone number</p>
<p data-start="1668.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="1668.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> but this This is, okay, can we put that phone number</p>
<p data-start="1670.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> can we put that phone</p>
<p data-start="1671.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> number</p>
<p data-start="1671.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> number out before you post this bloody video? Look,</p>
<p data-start="1673.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> video? Look, I'm going right here. Your phone number's not exposed. We're good. Trust me.</p>
<p data-start="1675.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> phone number's not exposed. We're good. Trust me. I beg you. I beg you.</p>
<p data-start="1678.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> beg you. We're not exposing the phone number.</p>
<p data-start="1681.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're just going to make the episode title the phone number. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="1684.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay. But no one will figure it out unless they listen to the 30-minute mark.</p>
<p data-start="1684.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. But no one will figure it out unless they listen to</p>
<p data-start="1687.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> But, you know, on that front, right, it's interesting because the other aspect of it, just to kind of close the loop on this conversation, is I also don't want to reach out to you in In the sake that you're like, oh, shit, he needs something from me or wants something from me. And then you prioritize that. Like, it's just weird. Like, it's not true. Like, we're friends. But I also don't want you to be like, fuck, Zayn needs something from me. So maybe I should. It's like, there's a thing, right? Like, I don't want you to feel like, I kind of feel like, oh, I'm jumping the line. And so even though I don't know anything or, you know, it's like one of those things. And it's also like, I actually</p>
<p data-start="1715.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's also like, I actually don't know how to be friends with the MP.</p>
<p data-start="1718.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Like,</p>
<p data-start="1718.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Like, I was talking to someone about this the other day, right? Is that like, I've got two close friends who are now members of parliament. of it i actually don't know how to be friends with you like what's appropriate what's not because of like the like i'm adjacent to the space not in the space it's one of those like uh like anchorman i don't know what to do with my hand sort of thing um and i made it about myself uh all of a sudden cory i</p>
<p data-start="1721.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> I've</p>
<p data-start="1734.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> hand sort of thing</p>
<p data-start="1739.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> do have carter do you have anything i've actually i want to like switch gears like dramatically and talk to cory</p>
<p data-start="1744.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> cory yeah this has been like quite like uh like uh yeah i don't even know how i would describe this at this point introspective like just kind of like yeah no he's I have a</p>
<p data-start="1744.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> cory yeah this has been like quite</p>
<p data-start="1750.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> like yeah no he's</p>
<p data-start="1753.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> I have a serious thing to talk to Corey about, like a pretty serious thing, because I had, despite me just saying I didn't reach out to him, I did send him a text the other day about something that I thought was, that I was really proud of him about. So can we go there, Carter? We're</p>
<p data-start="1754.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="1767.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> proud of him.</p>
<p data-start="1781.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> cancel other folks to try to like push people on certain narratives to restrict free speech um and i'd say a lot of his past uh transgressions words are kind of being sanded down and he's been memorialized across sports stadiums and sports leagues and television programs and there was a statement uh to that broader effect in in our house of commons and maybe i'll kind of let you carry the story from there uh take the story on from there cory and talk to me about how you process that and and what that felt like and what that moment was like and why you didn't stand and clap for it yeah</p>
<p data-start="1800.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> cancel other folks</p>
<p data-start="1831.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> so look there was a statement that was done and we do statements every day in the house of commons right like there is like a slew of one minute statements that have occurred uh and they can be on anything from the opposition complaining about something that we've done to um you</p>
<p data-start="1848.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know it is uh carafest and let me tell you about what it's meant it means to my community to you know i did one for the university of calgary and the graduates going going across uh in the spring too you</p>
<p data-start="1859.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> name it and often there's also memorials for people who you know meant something in the community that you know they want to make sure that they're recognizing in the house of comics because then you're you're on like the record forever you're on the record yeah</p>
<p data-start="1869.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah there's</p>
<p data-start="1870.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> there's a there's a video you can provide loved ones and all of this stuff right and</p>
<p data-start="1870.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> there's a there's</p>
<p data-start="1874.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> i guess i really want to start i</p>
<p data-start="1876.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> appreciate that you're proud of me for it but i like i i i don't even i</p>
<p data-start="1881.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i let me just get it all out and then we can chat about it okay yeah</p>
<p data-start="1883.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah yeah like i'm giving you my interpreter you give me yours there was a statement uh</p>
<p data-start="1888.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh that was done uh about political violence and largely it wasn't even about charlie kirk until the end when it was like you know charlie kirk his his wife and his kids and you know we feel for y'all and you know it became a little bit more about charlie kirk just in the turn as much about his family as him in my opinion but like and</p>
<p data-start="1908.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> about his family as</p>
<p data-start="1908.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> as</p>
<p data-start="1910.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> and then uh there was a standing ovation that occurred it started on the conservative side died and then it like kind of flowed to the liberals it's very common by the way there's lots of standing ovations and they tend to like start by the people who know them most like oh look at them they lost somebody or like somebody in their community up and then it flows across and it's not really i say this because i don't want you to think it was like unusual</p>
<p data-start="1931.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> for it to be contagious in that sense right we're pretty free with standing ovations for people who've died in the house of commons right i</p>
<p data-start="1932.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> contagious in</p>
<p data-start="1934.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> we're</p>
<p data-start="1935.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> we're</p>
<p data-start="1940.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> however was</p>
<p data-start="1941.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> not very comfortable with the way it kind of of flipped at the end and became about charlie kirk and while i certainly appreciated the message about political violence right which is i think something that we we all should really think about i</p>
<p data-start="1954.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i wasn't prepared to do something that could be interpreted as being a standing ovation for charlie kirk a man who i think has</p>
<p data-start="1960.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> has caused a lot of harm and hurt you</p>
<p data-start="1962.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> know uh in his his life as well and and well i think it is outrageous that he was shot uh it was just not you know it's just not something i was willing to do i wasn't the only one like in my immediate orbit i know of a couple of other mps who didn't but</p>
<p data-start="1971.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know it's</p>
<p data-start="1977.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> i just i say this for two reasons one is like i</p>
<p data-start="1982.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't think that that was that special that i did it um but i also don't think it was bad that the other people did it like because i know why they did it and part of it is that kind of contagion of oh somebody died part of it is the uh okay it was about political violence but</p>
<p data-start="1998.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> expanding on the second part i</p>
<p data-start="2001.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> think what um he's you know this is like a really like on the couch oprah style almost episode you're crazy but like i think one of the things that is really not easy for politicians to talk about is</p>
<p data-start="2015.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> um like</p>
<p data-start="2017.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're</p>
<p data-start="2018.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> public figures and charlie kirk is a public figure who was assassinated in front of his family right insane like it's insane like it's insane and there is not a person in that house of commons who didn't sit there and say holy</p>
<p data-start="2025.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's insane</p>
<p data-start="2026.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> it's insane and</p>
<p data-start="2031.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> shit like that could have been me that could have been my family right it's not because we think that we're charlie kirk god most of us perish thought thought right but it's just this is where it seems to be going to and and there is like there is a feeling that feels selfish but it's real where we we are starting to get really worried like there are conversations that happen behind closed doors about should</p>
<p data-start="2056.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> we do something about this and then like there's often like the well if we do it'll look like we're creating rules just to protect ourselves from the public and so maybe we should you know like these are conversations what do you mean</p>
<p data-start="2064.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> conversations what do you mean like well like conversations around like i'm not even gonna get into it i</p>
<p data-start="2067.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> i'm not even gonna get into it i i'm not gonna get into it i'm just gonna say let</p>
<p data-start="2069.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> gonna get into it i'm</p>
<p data-start="2071.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> let us</p>
<p data-start="2071.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> us fill in the blanks</p>
<p data-start="2071.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> us fill in the blanks got it yeah please</p>
<p data-start="2072.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah please uh but like we</p>
<p data-start="2075.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> worry we worry because we have families we worry because we don't want to die and we worry because the world seems really crazy so like there is an emotional component to it that</p>
<p data-start="2085.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's easy to intellectualize from a distance and say like ah he's a bad guy why did why do people stand for or like you know he said bad things if you don't want to call him a bad guy i don't maybe i won't want to go but like you</p>
<p data-start="2097.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> know people feel things and and it's hard it's</p>
<p data-start="2100.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> hard to begrudge people for in that moment having been like</p>
<p data-start="2105.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> jet you know like this is true this is crazy like and like you know walk through the statement from like you know we settled we should be settling our differences more civilly his family was there you know rest in peace charlie you know that's sort of where it took a turn and see it started to feel more like a state but like it</p>
<p data-start="2122.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="2123.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> was like it was not about char i don't think it was about charlie kirk for anyone in the house i guess is what i'm going to to say like okay interesting charlie cook charlie kirk was the hook on which this sentiment was hung by</p>
<p data-start="2128.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> like okay interesting</p>
<p data-start="2130.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> charlie cook charlie</p>
<p data-start="2134.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> i appreciate the full side of that carter i'm i'm wanting to let you jump in here um i i do want to talk a lot more about the political violence thing uh a bad if cory's open to the carter it's</p>
<p data-start="2143.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> if cory's</p>
<p data-start="2144.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's it's not new i mean the threat of political violence has certainly been around for quite some time and you</p>
<p data-start="2151.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know when when allison redford was prime was the premier and and uh i was following around close to her you you know you were worried uh you were worried about being too close to the principal uh you knew about the the threats um even joe t gondek you know the face threats every every day of of her uh mayoralty um the uh the proper way to deal with politics is to you know elect to to outspeak to to to combat in the in the world of rhetoric not in the world world of violence. And yet you</p>
<p data-start="2189.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> see other, you know, you see Charlie Kirk advocating for violence against others, right? So, you know, it's okay to spill some blood. It was one of his kind of catchphrases, not his phrases, but his intentions. And I</p>
<p data-start="2207.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> abhor that type of discussion because it It is real for those of us in the game. There is a threat of violence all the time, and it doesn't need to be elected. You</p>
<p data-start="2222.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't need to be elected. You can just be around them. I often worry for the staffs because just being around them is sometimes enough</p>
<p data-start="2231.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that you're going to get impacted. And if you kind of go back and rewind, you know, there were families that were impacted. I can't remember the exact details, the Democrats that were essentially assassinated as well that didn't get the same attention as</p>
<p data-start="2245.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> didn't get the same attention as</p>
<p data-start="2248.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> as Charlie Kirk. And that's devastating because ultimately every act of political violence should be treated the same. I</p>
<p data-start="2250.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> as</p>
<p data-start="2262.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> think your point, Carter, is fascinating around like the orbit around the politician. politician like kirk was like a media person like an american equivalent to a and a significant like degrees are different but like a gig like ours oh yeah right like it was like very much media right very much like loud mouthy very much like you know get his name brand out there and yes there's differences in infrastructure and reach and all those things i'm not trying to compare those two right so anyone wants to come after us on that's not what i'm saying it was like a it was part of the political class in the broadest sense not the narrowest exactly well</p>
<p data-start="2294.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> exactly well and that's That's why I said political actor and not politician, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I think this</p>
<p data-start="2297.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> politician, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, I think this</p>
<p data-start="2299.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> this is, like, democracies aren't</p>
<p data-start="2303.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> supposed to settle differences this way. Tell</p>
<p data-start="2307.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> me this, Hogan. Like,</p>
<p data-start="2307.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> me this, Hogan. Like, you have, and I'm going to use this term just as a shorthand, but there's a lot of shotgun MPs. They became MPs because the carny wave was happening. Nominations happened quickly. It was like a rollercoaster high. I'm not pointing fingers at anybody. That guy.</p>
<p data-start="2318.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> like a rollercoaster</p>
<p data-start="2322.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> That guy. That guy right there. That guy. that</p>
<p data-start="2324.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> That guy right there. That</p>
<p data-start="2325.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> that guy with the atrocious house of commons microphone um buyer's</p>
<p data-start="2326.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> guy with the</p>
<p data-start="2331.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> remorse have</p>
<p data-start="2332.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> have you not for you yeah unless you want to talk about it but have you heard of buyer's remorse have you heard of buyer's remorse amongst people like essentially like a them or their families being like holy fuck i didn't sign up for this shit not on the all the in where the direction of the government's going etc we can get into all that but i mean more so on this political violence question being like oh fuck like this really snaps shit into focus this is not what i signed up for well</p>
<p data-start="2335.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> but have you heard of buyer's</p>
<p data-start="2354.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> well i haven't heard that on the political violence front i but again like it is something that we we do talk about in the halls right um i have certainly heard people talk about the pressures that it's created on their families and their lives you know more generally and and</p>
<p data-start="2370.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> how um maybe</p>
<p data-start="2372.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> maybe maybe even some comments about like this isn't quite what i thought it was going to be right</p>
<p data-start="2375.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> right like</p>
<p data-start="2376.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> like because</p>
<p data-start="2377.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> of the places</p>
<p data-start="2378.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> i've worked in the background i've got it's kind of exactly what i thought it would would be in most ways right but uh um</p>
<p data-start="2385.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> um but some people clearly it's not and uh but i don't think there's like a lot of people being like i don't know why i did this but i do think there</p>
<p data-start="2393.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> think there</p>
<p data-start="2394.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> are a lot of people who are having to figure out what the job is and you can tell that not all of and i'm talking on both sides i'm not i'm not calling out like liberals or the carny wave right you can tell in the new class those of us who are sometimes like is</p>
<p data-start="2403.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> liberals or the</p>
<p data-start="2409.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> this my favorite thing no i don't think it it is like for me like i keep going on about question period i hate question period right i find it we've</p>
<p data-start="2416.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> we've</p>
<p data-start="2416.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> we've heard please underline it here but we've heard yeah i find it painful to sit have you had to</p>
<p data-start="2416.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> please underline</p>
<p data-start="2417.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> but we've heard yeah</p>
<p data-start="2420.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> have you had to do anything on qp interest yet no</p>
<p data-start="2423.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> no actually interestingly enough not</p>
<p data-start="2423.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> no actually interestingly enough not like we're sitting here at 11 45 p.m yeah</p>

<p data-start="2432.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="2432.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="2432.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="2433.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> i am</p>
<p data-start="2433.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> am up for qp tomorrow if there's any questions on energy or natural resources so maybe by the time somebody's heard this i will be But yeah, as</p>
<p data-start="2436.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> resources so maybe</p>
<p data-start="2438.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> somebody's heard this</p>
<p data-start="2440.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> it stands, not in QP. Oh, that's not true. I actually asked a question in QP.</p>
<p data-start="2446.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> A friendly before I was parliamentary secretary. Yeah. Will</p>
<p data-start="2449.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Will the minister explain why he's so good at doing what he is? Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2452.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> doing what he is? Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2454.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, thank you, member. As a minister of transport, co-sponsored by Flair Airlines. Yes. Corey, I'll let you get into if there's any other things you want to talk about. But Corey, you brought up something that I find interesting.</p>
<p data-start="2461.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'll</p>
<p data-start="2469.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> You said both sides. How's</p>
<p data-start="2471.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> your relationship been with non-caucus members, MPs of your freshman class, MPs of other political stripes? We often hear that that is eroded, the decorum of that. Has it, though, on the back end? Are there still friendships? Is it to stick to your own teams? Explain to me how your experience has been. yeah</p>
<p data-start="2472.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> been</p>
<p data-start="2494.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah first of all i'll say like one of the things about like the canadian system is when i say both i literally mean the physical geography of the house like i know there's more than two parties like the blocker they're the ndp or they're the greener there but you know both sides of the chamber um you</p>
<p data-start="2510.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> know it's interesting like i'll say this like i think elizabeth may is a delight she's like one of my favorite people in the house on a personal level elizabeth</p>
<p data-start="2517.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> elizabeth may yeah i mean the the</p>
<p data-start="2518.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i mean the the soon</p>
<p data-start="2520.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="2521.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> soon to be once again re yeah man i'll get into it</p>
<p data-start="2523.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah man i'll get into it but like yeah i think i think she is a delight right on a personal level there are mps that i just really really like uh on the other side that i have very warm relationships with on the other side there's a lot of block mps that i find like very funny and very interesting uh there's a lot of conservative mps that i i find uh to be you know pretty stand-up folks yet i i get so funny like especially when it comes to the conservatives i almost feel by me saying i like them i would be doing them a disservice in this environment that we live in right now you</p>
<p data-start="2526.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> think i</p>
<p data-start="2558.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> know so maybe i shouldn't name names maybe you should name</p>
<p data-start="2560.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> names maybe you should name name name name one i should yeah maybe name three names i</p>
<p data-start="2561.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> name one i should yeah maybe name three names i because i see them all the time like uh greg mclean you know we share the bow river and we're at events together that's a lame name i mean like greg's not lame i mean greg's kind of lame that's why i said it that's why i said it though like because like look i think you know the reality is there will be time pretty much a liberal you</p>
<p data-start="2569.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> at events together that's</p>
<p data-start="2571.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> a lame name i mean like greg's not lame i mean greg's</p>
<p data-start="2574.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> lame that's why i said it that's</p>
<p data-start="2577.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> like</p>
<p data-start="2581.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> pretty</p>
<p data-start="2582.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2582.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> you should</p>
<p data-start="2582.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> should pretty</p>
<p data-start="2583.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> pretty much caucus with you guys do you know what it's funny based on what pierre is going to do between now and january greg mclean should just cross the floor exactly</p>
<p data-start="2586.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> based on what pierre is</p>
<p data-start="2590.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> exactly</p>
<p data-start="2590.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> exactly</p>
<p data-start="2590.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> exactly</p>
<p data-start="2590.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> exactly</p>
<p data-start="2590.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> exactly you</p>
<p data-start="2590.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2590.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2590.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="2591.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> you could just laugh but carter and i could</p>
<p data-start="2593.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> could talk yeah</p>
<p data-start="2593.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah we know like i think you're actually</p>
<p data-start="2593.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> we know like i think you're actually doing him a solid right now he's in a very liberal writing right where like i think the idea that he's actually kind of a liberal is helpful to him so i don't know if that's your fair fair but like uh</p>
<p data-start="2595.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> actually</p>
<p data-start="2604.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's your fair fair but like uh it's it's not i'm just like reading the guy and i know him a bit and i yeah generally don't mind him yeah</p>
<p data-start="2606.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's</p>
<p data-start="2611.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah but you know because because of geography and flights and all of that i've just you know i know him a little bit more uh both ivy graduates too so you know you find little things i'll say this you find these little things that are like oh that's our connection and</p>
<p data-start="2611.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> but you know</p>
<p data-start="2624.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> and now we have that thing right like no matter how big or how small it is like you find that thing like me and pierre polyev we went to the same high school i haven't you know i haven't talk to pierre probably i've ever not even once but if i do we've got that we can go you notice he's starting</p>
<p data-start="2625.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> thing right like</p>
<p data-start="2637.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> go you notice he's starting to look a little bit more like pierre or</p>
<p data-start="2641.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2641.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i'm gonna comment on that i'm</p>
<p data-start="2641.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2641.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> yeah i'm gonna comment on that i'm</p>
<p data-start="2643.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm</p>
<p data-start="2643.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> i'm gonna comment on</p>
<p data-start="2643.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> i'm gonna comment on that cory i'm</p>
<p data-start="2646.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> not i'm not um i might start wearing glasses again yeah</p>
<p data-start="2648.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> wearing glasses</p>
<p data-start="2650.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah okay</p>
<p data-start="2650.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> okay</p>
<p data-start="2653.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter what do you want to talk about you</p>
<p data-start="2655.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> know what i i'm just intrigued with all of this one of the things that i'm i'm i'm actually really intrigued is um do you find this tight rope of this podcast now to be more daunting than it was when we used to, than we were recording before. 100%. Like, are you, are you, like, stressed out? No, I'm not stressed out. His arms were crossed for</p>
<p data-start="2671.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> 100%. Like, are you,</p>
<p data-start="2676.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> No,</p>
<p data-start="2676.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, I'm not stressed out. His arms</p>
<p data-start="2678.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> arms</p>
<p data-start="2678.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> arms</p>
<p data-start="2678.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> arms were</p>
<p data-start="2679.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> for</p>
<p data-start="2679.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> for five</p>
<p data-start="2679.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> five</p>
<p data-start="2679.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> five minutes, so. Yeah, I think so. This has more to do with the seat. Like, I have nowhere to put them. Like, it just feels kind of like, I'm in a weird spot. I have to hold my microphone,</p>
<p data-start="2679.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> five</p>
<p data-start="2679.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> five</p>
<p data-start="2679.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> five</p>
<p data-start="2679.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> five minutes,</p>
<p data-start="2681.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> This has more to</p>
<p data-start="2684.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> it just</p>
<p data-start="2684.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> just feels kind of like, I'm in a weird spot. I have to hold my microphone, otherwise I'm just hurt. Yeah, you got a</p>
<p data-start="2688.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm just hurt. Yeah, you got a microphone to hold. I don't even have that. But, like, no, listen, for sure. Sure. So we</p>
<p data-start="2694.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> had the podcast, I, you know, when I was on the podcast, like I was a university vice president, like I, there were lines I shouldn't reasonably cross. Right. You've always had more barriers than Carter. For sure. Like that's been true, like basically the entire existence of this podcast. But so it's not like, you know, I have a certain comfort with knowing like, oh, there's things you can't do and there's things you can't say.</p>
<p data-start="2705.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> For sure.</p>
<p data-start="2706.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's been true, like</p>
<p data-start="2716.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> But Carter, to your point, like one of the things that's going through my head is like, and I'll always be a guy who likes to talk about the mechanics and the nuts and bolts and all of that but you do well i started worry even just today i'm like we're talking about the nuts and bolts in a way that maybe makes it sound like i don't care about the substance of it but like they are just a delivery mechanism for it right and um so</p>
<p data-start="2737.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i think about that too and it definitely makes me think</p>
<p data-start="2741.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's not the same you know it's like i've got to be a little more mindful for sure no</p>
<p data-start="2746.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> no i like you struggling it it has always made me happy and suffering is one of the things i look for so</p>
<p data-start="2747.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> has always made me happy and suffering is one of</p>
<p data-start="2752.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> so this is good uh and i think your lighting has somehow improved through the course of this podcast do</p>
<p data-start="2758.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> do you know why because these lights are on a motion sensor and just if you still use your hands to talk you still use your hands to</p>
<p data-start="2761.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> if</p>
<p data-start="2761.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you still</p>
<p data-start="2761.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> still use your hands to</p>
<p data-start="2762.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> to</p>
<p data-start="2762.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> to talk you still use</p>
<p data-start="2763.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> use your hands</p>
<p data-start="2763.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> hands to talk so yeah</p>
<p data-start="2764.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> to talk so</p>
<p data-start="2764.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="2766.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> so it gets to be a challenge uh</p>
<p data-start="2768.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter we should probably let him go it's nearly you guys</p>
<p data-start="2768.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> carter</p>
<p data-start="2770.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> you guys gonna talk</p>
<p data-start="2771.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> talk about like policies</p>
<p data-start="2772.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> policies do you want them well i want to but i want to save it um i i guess at this point carter and i are probably going to to be principal secretary and then get fired in a couple of weeks so yeah uh maybe maybe carter do you want to do what i'm up for i got an interview which part of the foreign service do you want to go to yeah i hear i hear carter's just tilching those out no</p>
<p data-start="2774.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> i want to but</p>
<p data-start="2782.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah uh</p>
<p data-start="2784.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> what i'm up for i got an interview which part of</p>
<p data-start="2791.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> no you</p>

<p data-start="2812.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, we will do an accountability of Corey, Vashti Capello style, where we ask you the same question, not in a different way, but in the same way three times, which is what makes Vashti a star.</p>
<p data-start="2816.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> we ask you the same</p>
<p data-start="2821.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> which</p>
<p data-start="2826.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Love to watch you scrub a bit.</p>
<p data-start="2828.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, this is the final segment of the show. I don't know if you remember. Remember, as a minister, we each get to ask our guest, Corey Hogan, one on-the-record question, okay? Oh, yeah. This is where Corey</p>
<p data-start="2838.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, yeah. This is where Corey provides us one on</p>
<p data-start="2839.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> provides us one on-the-record. This was all off the record before? We'll allow it. What has happened to the listenership</p>
<p data-start="2840.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> This was all off the record before?</p>
<p data-start="2843.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> What has happened to the listenership number since that was on? Trust me, it's gone up sky high.</p>
<p data-start="2845.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> that was on?</p>
<p data-start="2849.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> high. Sky high. Sky high. Rebuilding the patrons, but sky high. Okay. Carter, I have my question locked and loaded. It'll give you a bit of time to think of your question. Thank you. Corey, as a Canadian member of Parliament, I want you to opine on, did Steve Ballmer purposefully circumvent the salary cap for Kawhi Leonard?</p>
<p data-start="2849.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> high. Sky</p>
<p data-start="2849.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Sky</p>
<p data-start="2850.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Sky high.</p>
<p data-start="2858.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> question. Thank you. Corey,</p>
<p data-start="2874.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Man,</p>
<p data-start="2876.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> look, I think we've</p>
<p data-start="2879.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> got to follow the smoke. We've got to follow the smoke on this. There's a lot of smoke, Zane. And I'm just asking questions. And maybe I'll ask longer questions in the house where I've got, you know, libel shields. But I'm just asking questions. Could</p>
<p data-start="2880.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> got to</p>
<p data-start="2881.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> the smoke. We've</p>
<p data-start="2891.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> asking questions. Could you ask that to the Minister of Sport? Do you have a Minister of Sport? Yeah, I do. I do, but I</p>
<p data-start="2895.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I do. I do, but I don't get to ask questions. I'm part of the government. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2898.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, well, you literally threw a softball to someone the other day. That was before I</p>
<p data-start="2900.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> day. That was before I was, sorry, like, you know, so an MP who's not a minister of primary sector. Oh, fuck me. Okay, I got to talk to a conservative</p>
<p data-start="2904.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> a minister of primary sector. Oh, fuck me. Okay, I got to talk to a conservative to get this question asked. Yeah, you do. Okay,</p>
<p data-start="2909.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm going to get</p>
<p data-start="2909.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> get</p>
<p data-start="2909.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> get this question asked.</p>
<p data-start="2909.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> this question asked.</p>
<p data-start="2912.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> How big of a deal would it be if I get this question asked to the House? I</p>
<p data-start="2915.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> would be pretty impressed based on how QP lists are made. If I could do this, if I could do this, would I go down in House of Commons? I think so. This is my new project, Carter Carter, I'm unavailable to record for the next six months I've got a project</p>
<p data-start="2917.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> QP lists are made. If I could</p>
<p data-start="2921.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> I go</p>
<p data-start="2924.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> think so.</p>
<p data-start="2925.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> This is my new project,</p>
<p data-start="2930.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> project You have</p>
<p data-start="2932.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> have one on-the-record question To ask the Parliamentary Secretary To the Minister of Podcasts Corey Hogan, what would you like to ask him?</p>
<p data-start="2940.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Which is your favorite strategist host?</p>
<p data-start="2944.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Annalise I don't know where she went</p>
<p data-start="2947.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> She's still doing the civic ones We're doing civic ones together</p>
<p data-start="2951.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="2952.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> by the way With the remaining 30 seconds Let's begin your accountability episode for the Calgary Party and the Edmonton Accelerants. Why didn't it work out? What is the actual name of the Edmonton Party?</p>
<p data-start="2960.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Why</p>
<p data-start="2960.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Why didn't it work out? What is the actual</p>
<p data-start="2963.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Better Edmonton.</p>
<p data-start="2965.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> He doesn't like that I'm fucking up.</p>
