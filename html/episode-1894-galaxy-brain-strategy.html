  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

  </div>
  <div class="said">I think so. I think that there was all kinds of signaling that it wasn&#x27;t going to fall. You know, like I think that the Liberals appeared pretty confident in the last couple of days. And, you know, the Conservatives did what they needed to do to make sure that it didn&#x27;t fall. and the NDP did what they needed to do to make sure that it didn&#x27;t fall. So I think everybody wants this government to continue and Pierre Polyev&#x27;s, what did Corey say? His words and his actions are on two different continents</div>

    <span class="ts">4:31</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I appreciate it. Shannon, this is, the outcome of this is not a surprise. There was a bit of, I don&#x27;t want to say high drama, but mild drama leading into this. But I&#x27;m curious to just get your take on the outcome before we kind of try to pick up some other pieces that might be interesting.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="284">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">4:44</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Oh, I think that anybody who expected drama was a very stupid person and was just, you know, wanting to drum up interest in Canadian politics at a time when sometimes it wanes and talk about something besides the budget. It was never going to be that we were going into an election. And the way you knew that was the way that Mark Carney comported himself. He, from the very beginning, essentially said to the House of Commons, no, I don&#x27;t have a parliamentary strategy to pass this budget. Like it or go to an election. And that was his, you know, the way he conducted himself, his whole House strategy from the very beginning. and it was never going to be the case that this budget was going to have major amendments made to it or if there was going to be horse trading. The government never really opened the door to that. He had some performative meetings with Polievre and with Don Davies and others, even Elizabeth May, but he was never going to be making changes to this budget. This is not he is not basically</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="353">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">5:53</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">acting like he has a minority at all. He&#x27;s acting like he has a de facto majority. And for now, that&#x27;s probably the smart thing to do. If anything, he wrote this budget so that he would get more floor crossers from the Conservatives so that they could find some palatable things in it, which means that that will probably get them through the Budget Implementation Act votes that have to happen in the spring as well.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="381">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">6:21</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Carter, I agree with Shannon in the sense that anyone expecting the government to fall was definitely drumming something up that was not there. However, the other sources of drama also didn&#x27;t manifest. And I&#x27;m not saying you said this would happen, but you did say on a previous episode that a way for a conservative to leave would be on the budget vote. We didn&#x27;t see that. And I&#x27;m not saying you predicted it, to be clear again.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="405">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">6:45</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Does this kind of, does this, the lack of that not happening and the Conservatives getting through this budget, which is a funny way to say it because it&#x27;s the Liberals who kind of get to celebrate their budget. But the Conservatives getting through this moment, is that a bit of a strategic victory for Polyev here? Is that one of the hurdles crossed as we revisit some of the work that we did in the previous episode talking about Polyev&#x27;s three acts and what he needs to do?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="428">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">7:08</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, I think this was a theatrical opportunity, not necessarily, you know, there would be some strategy behind the theater, later but not necessarily the the best time I think that the PR Polyev has weathered the storm of crossers I think that the the they&#x27;re not going to move now not now that you voted against the budget you&#x27;re not going to move over to the governing party with the budget unless something changes but I think that something could change in the next four to six months I think that something could happen later in the in in the new year but I don&#x27;t think that anything&#x27;s going to to happen in the rest of this year. And I don&#x27;t think it needs to. I think that Mark Carney&#x27;s, to Shannon&#x27;s point, going to operate as though he has a majority. He doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to have a whole bunch of floor crossers when the NDP knows that if they fall at this, if they go to an election at this stage, I mean, how can it get worse? Well, let&#x27;s find out, right? So, So I think that there&#x27;s a reality that says that this isn&#x27;t going to go to an election. This government&#x27;s not going to an election until such time as Mark Carney wants it to go to an election. Because in the near term, it doesn&#x27;t benefit the conservatives and it doesn&#x27;t benefit the NDP.</div>

  <div class="said">Well, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any time a W when, you know, somebody doesn&#x27;t leave your caucus. The assumption is when you form a caucus after an election, that everybody&#x27;s there for the long haul. You know, he had a really bad time with General Rendon Samoan leaving. And, you know, by all accounts, there were more. It&#x27;s not a W for him. uh and but what he needs to do is keep himself out of any bad headlines like the uh you know the threatening to or wanting to fantasizing i guess about locking up his jailing his opponents uh and you know calling into question the uh neutrality and competence of the rcmp uh he needs to not do any of that he needs not to you know basically uh not indulge the ostriches put it that way. The ostrich caucus needs to be nice and quiet. And he&#x27;ll just, you know, come out, throw some red meat to the base every once in a while between now and January, and he&#x27;s good. There&#x27;s going to be more budget votes in the spring, and there&#x27;ll be more confidence motions in the spring. And there&#x27;s going to be some off-cycle funding as well, right? We know this because the government has said, well, for example, we&#x27;re going to do a nature strategy between now and then, because that was left out of the budget. There&#x27;s some other stuff that we we know is probably coming that might uh</div>
