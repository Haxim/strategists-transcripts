  <title>The World Famous Annalise and Carter Show: Episode 3 | The Strategists Transcripts</title>
  <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Step right up to The World Famous Annalise and Carter Show, the three-ring political circus you didn’t know you needed. In the municipal ring, Stephen Carter spins three slates in the air, keeping each campaign teetering but never tumbling. Over in the federal ring, Canada’s trade spat with Trump transforms into a roaring grassroots rally. And in the provincial ring, Carter unleashes a fiery high-wire takedown of the Alberta NDP’s fumbles - all while Annalise, the unflappable ringmaster, keeps the whole spectacular from collapsing into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join our Patreon for ad-free episodes, bonus episodes, and access to our exclusive Discord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/c/strategistspod&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/c/strategistspod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also watch this episode on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;&#34;&gt; Hosted on Acast.

<p data-start="329.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> those are the three those are three topics i</p>
<p data-start="329.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> the three those</p>
<p data-start="331.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> i thought oh Oh, I better write these down. I like</p>
<p data-start="332.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Oh, I better write</p>

<p data-start="337.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> pay attention to you, Annalise. Wow. I pay attention.</p>
<p data-start="338.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I pay attention. I'm not like those other boys. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="341.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay. Let's start</p>
<p data-start="342.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Let's start with the most important. Let's go with municipal. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="343.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Let's go with municipal.</p>
<p data-start="344.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Oh, municipal. Okay. It's</p>
<p data-start="346.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's the one that impacts us the most. Water goes uphill, poops goes downhill. I'll</p>
<p data-start="349.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> goes downhill. I'll keep municipal short. I could talk about municipal for hours. You know this. I know. We both could. Because you and I together,</p>
<p data-start="355.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I know. We both could. Because you and I together, we love it. We</p>
<p data-start="358.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> We love it. Other people don't.</p>
<p data-start="360.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay. Municipal elections in Alberta. you're you're helping you you're running three slates calgary edmonton medicine hat yeah</p>
<p data-start="366.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> edmonton medicine</p>
<p data-start="368.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah what</p>
<p data-start="368.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> what let's talk about ballot box questions and this is a glimpse into a conversation you and i had earlier this week uh what before i ask you specifics how how do we go about getting</p>
<p data-start="383.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> a ballot box question and when when like when is it like in lock that this is a ballot box question</p>
<p data-start="391.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Sometimes it's been in lock right from the first day. I would say that Jyoti Gondek's campaign in 2021, we had the ballot box question right from the beginning. And that was, who can take on Jason Kenney? Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="402.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="402.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> And that was, who</p>
<p data-start="405.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="406.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. And</p>
<p data-start="407.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And so we we ran against Jason Kenney more than we ran against our other campaigns. And that enabled us to go past Jeremy Farkas. I</p>
<p data-start="416.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I would argue that right now the population like the the question is hard</p>
<p data-start="422.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> to form in Alberta right now, especially in Calgary and Edmonton. Why? Because</p>
<p data-start="426.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Why? Because there's so much going on</p>
<p data-start="428.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> because infill continues to dominate and no one has a really good answer for infill.</p>
<p data-start="432.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> good</p>
<p data-start="432.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> good answer for</p>
<p data-start="434.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> The zoning question is is not I don't think the zoning question is anybody's actual ballot box question. Maybe Sonia Sharpe thinks it can be her ballot box question. But the problem is that there's going to be a group of people who are on repeal. And I think that those people are hopelessly naive. And I don't want to run on ballot box questions that we can't actually achieve. I did that in 2012 with Redford. You know, we could shrink the size of government, reduce your taxes and increase government spending. It was kind of like, you can't do all that. You can't. That's an impossible thing. So from that time on, I've been really trying to make my ballot box questions something</p>
<p data-start="469.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You can't.</p>
<p data-start="479.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> that can actually be achieved. And I don't think that repeal is one of those. When</p>
<p data-start="480.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> achieved. And</p>
<p data-start="482.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> When you're starting your slates or your campaign, are you,</p>
<p data-start="486.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> in that first brainstorm, first plan, you have your ballot box, what you want the ballot box question to be? I</p>
<p data-start="494.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> do, but it shifts. I don't have 100% control over it. You have to see what the population wants as well. The population right now is massively unfazed by actual events. What they want is change. So change seems to be the ballot box question, but what kind of change? In Calgary</p>
<p data-start="512.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> but what kind of change? In Calgary and Edmonton and Medicine Hat? In both, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="514.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> In both, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="516.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Edmonton, Calgary, and Medicine Hat, all three markets want change. But change to what or what type of change seems to be less</p>
<p data-start="526.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> understood by the electorate at this point. How</p>
<p data-start="529.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> How do you think in Calgary, the fact that we're seeing the three front runners, the top three finishers from last time, Gondek, who's been mayor for four years, and Jeremy Parkas and Jeff Davison, all ran four years ago, are all running again. How does that impact or does it impact the ballot box question? Like people have a more familiarity than perhaps other elections with these names. Well,</p>
<p data-start="529.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> How</p>
<p data-start="544.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> does that impact</p>
<p data-start="553.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> names. Well, it</p>
<p data-start="554.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> really forces us to change the ballot box question from whose name do I recognize? If we leave the ballot box question as whose name do I recognize, then we'll definitely lose for the Brian Thiessen campaign. Tim Cartmell might be able to do better because he's got higher name recognition, but I don't think that it serves anybody to have a name recognition ballot box question. Who do I know is usually the ballot box question for council candidates, but that doesn't really serve anybody. everybody how do</p>
<p data-start="582.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> how do you change it if if it if it's looking like it's whose name do i recognize and we're what two months out less yeah i mean you've basically got a shift more than that you've</p>
<p data-start="589.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> less yeah i mean you've basically got a shift more than that you've got to figure out what they care about more right what type of change they're looking for that's what i'm that's what i'm working on right now is what</p>
<p data-start="599.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> what type of change do people want do they just want change for the sake of change do they want to change to the</p>
<p data-start="605.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> most capable candidate do they want to change to someone that they know do</p>
<p data-start="608.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> do they want to change like what kind of change do they Do they want experience? Do they want no experience? And then I have to try and</p>
<p data-start="615.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> muscle my candidates into those positions and kind of create a ballot box question around them. Like</p>
<p data-start="621.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Like for Joe Clark, the ballot box question was, would you rather have the right honorable Joe Clark or what's his name?</p>
<p data-start="626.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="628.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, I imagine that there'll be some sort of ballot box question in Calgary that, you know, focuses right now on the changing personalities and changing moods of Jeremy Farkas.</p>
<p data-start="640.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> But does that not help Farkas because it comes down to the name recognition thing?</p>
<p data-start="646.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> If it comes down to name rec, then it will. But if it's which Jeremy Farkas do you want to elect or do you want to just elect the real Brian Thiessen? So, OK,</p>
<p data-start="654.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> So, OK, let's say Farkas's campaign is pushing of</p>
<p data-start="658.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> of</p>
<p data-start="660.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> the name recognition. Who do you know more? Who's a better leader? Whatever. And you have Thiessen who right now you and I have talked about this is not polling very well compared to the others. How do you go about changing what the question is if there's a campaign that's polling better, that has more momentum, that's pushing a different question?</p>
<p data-start="679.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, you have to create a momentum structure. And then once you create the momentum structure, then you change the question.</p>
<p data-start="684.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> So you can't necessarily do it all. You can't achieve it all in one fell swoop, at least. You have to do it in a couple steps. Right now, the next step is momentum. And then once you've done momentum, then you do a ballot box question. You've</p>
<p data-start="696.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> You've got more sign loopholes that are coming. Is that what I'm hearing? Is that some foreshadowing? There's</p>
<p data-start="696.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> You've</p>
<p data-start="702.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> no evidence that I've ever worked on a loophole.</p>
<p data-start="704.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> loophole.</p>
<p data-start="705.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> There's no evidence that I have some cards up my sleeve. Always. Short sleeves today. No cards up there. Up</p>
<p data-start="712.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Up those short sleeves. I didn't know you had short sleeves until you just raised your hands up like that. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="715.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I didn't</p>
<p data-start="718.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> like that. Yeah, and then I showed my weak-ass limbs.</p>
<p data-start="719.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="719.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah, and then I showed</p>
<p data-start="722.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is</p>
<p data-start="723.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is it as someone have you have you ran this many campaigns at the same time before like the three slates in alberta that's not that's a new experience right well</p>
<p data-start="735.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> just in the sheer number of candidates it would equate to a provincial campaign yeah</p>
<p data-start="739.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yeah right but it's three different cities well</p>
<p data-start="739.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> right but it's three different cities</p>
<p data-start="743.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> a provincial campaign has all the cities yes</p>
<p data-start="745.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yes i know that</p>
<p data-start="745.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> i know that i</p>
<p data-start="747.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> know that but</p>
<p data-start="747.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> know that but</p>
<p data-start="748.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="748.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="748.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="748.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> but a provincial campaign okay</p>
<p data-start="748.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> but a provincial campaign okay we'll talk about this is it like what's similar what's different about it because a provincial campaign is like i</p>
<p data-start="756.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i don't it just seems like you stretched you you got lots of things happening in different places and are you like in in terms of the ballot box question do you see like this is what's happening in calgary and now we can meld it this way in edmonton like is there like does like uh</p>
<p data-start="770.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> they're different you you can't i mean The difference between a provincial-wide campaign and the municipal's is that the provincial campaign, you have one brand. And that one brand then dictates all the decisions that you're making. And working on this many campaigns simultaneously, you have to keep three different brands separate in your brain and construct—</p>
<p data-start="790.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> construct—</p>
<p data-start="790.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> construct— How's that going?</p>
<p data-start="792.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's</p>
<p data-start="793.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> It's</p>
<p data-start="793.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's going fine.</p>
<p data-start="793.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> It's</p>
<p data-start="795.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> No,</p>
<p data-start="796.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, you got three brands. You've got three brands.</p>
<p data-start="799.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> brands. That screenshotted face that you just made needs to be the image. Yeah, it's going to be the image for them. That's like old man Carter.</p>
<p data-start="799.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> That screenshotted</p>
<p data-start="803.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, it's going to be the image for them. That's like old man</p>
<p data-start="806.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. I mean, it's frustrating because sometimes, you know, the Calgary brand would work really well in Edmonton and sometimes the Edmonton brand would work really well in Calgary. And sometimes the brands aren't quite as formed as you'd like them to be. So I still have to keep working on those brands. brands um but you know the brands are there's there's multiple multiple variables that are being managed annalise things are going great things are</p>
<p data-start="832.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> things are going great things are going great carter's feeling confident carter</p>
<p data-start="837.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> carter carter's</p>
<p data-start="839.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> carter's in all markets carter</p>
<p data-start="841.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> carter it's been an</p>
<p data-start="841.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> carter it's been an adventure carter</p>
<p data-start="842.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> carter is stretched thin and has a lot of confidence in himself let's as you</p>
<p data-start="847.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> as you</p>
<p data-start="849.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you should at the beginning of at the beginning it was going to be just i'm a strategist in all these markets and how hard could that be but then invariably you get more involved than just being a strategist and</p>
<p data-start="860.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> that's what was your how would you describe your role now uh</p>
<p data-start="860.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's what was your how</p>
<p data-start="865.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> i get to do whatever needs to be done in all the markets i</p>
<p data-start="869.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i like it wasn't the initial vision and full disclosure i'm not involved in the calgary party at all i like a couple of your candidates not involved at all but wasn't the initial vision that you were going to be like very behind the scenes involved you weren't going to be public</p>
<p data-start="882.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> face. Well,</p>
<p data-start="883.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> face.</p>
<p data-start="885.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="885.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> and I'm not really a public</p>
<p data-start="885.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> really a public face. I'm not a public spokesperson or anything like that. But we found out very, very quickly that people knew that I was involved. So there was just, you know, there's just, you know, Carter.</p>
<p data-start="892.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> there was</p>
<p data-start="894.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you know, there's just, you know, Carter.</p>
<p data-start="897.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. So once it became evident that I was involved, then, you</p>
<p data-start="901.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, I'm not I'm not I'm not a spokesperson for any of the parties. I'm not a spokesperson for any of the candidates. You know, I come on here and I talk about my experiences, But I don't think that, you</p>
<p data-start="913.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, that I'm not giving away any state secrets. Do you</p>
<p data-start="915.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Do you think the way the party system has been created in Alberta, it creates positions like what you're doing now, where like instead of focusing on just one city, it's like almost you're like franchising it in essence, because you're like,</p>
<p data-start="928.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> like, does it does a party system help your,</p>
<p data-start="931.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="932.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="933.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="933.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I was gonna say, does it help your career? It's clearly helping your career. You have three paying slaves. But does it that that's because of the party system, right? I</p>
<p data-start="944.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> think I would have had at least two campaigns, regardless of whether or not there were parties. I think that the party system, I've</p>
<p data-start="948.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> of whether or</p>
<p data-start="954.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> been so willing to be involved in it. I've been so willing to push it that maybe I've helped to push the party system into both markets. You're going to blame.</p>
<p data-start="963.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> You're going to blame. You're blaming yourself. Well, no.</p>
<p data-start="965.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, no.</p>
<p data-start="967.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Danielle Smith created the rules.</p>
<p data-start="970.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> My</p>
<p data-start="971.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> job is</p>
<p data-start="972.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> is to take advantage of whatever rules have been created for</p>
<p data-start="976.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the betterment of my candidates. But you</p>
<p data-start="977.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> But you don't have to play by those rules.</p>
<p data-start="980.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I mean like you you have to play by those rules but you that doesn't mean you have to make a party I know you're going to say you can double your fundraising that's why you have to do a party double your</p>
<p data-start="987.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> double your fundraising that's why you have to do it you can double</p>
<p data-start="989.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> it you can double the ability to fundraise but if you can't if you can't raise those funds the</p>
<p data-start="994.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="995.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="995.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="995.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> the ability I'm finding that it's a hell of a lot easier to raise money given</p>
<p data-start="995.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> ability I'm finding</p>
<p data-start="998.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> given the party structure than it is outside of the party structure Daniel</p>
<p data-start="1002.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Daniel Smith created the system you were playing within the system that was creative it is i</p>
<p data-start="1003.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> created the</p>
<p data-start="1007.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i play within the system that is in place every single time i do a campaign right right i will always go to the end of the rules what is the end of the rule not loopholes</p>
<p data-start="1016.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> not loopholes end of the rules end</p>
<p data-start="1018.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> end of the rules because whatever the end of the rules are that's what you have to do and whatever is in the best interest of your client that's what you have to bring in right</p>
<p data-start="1025.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> right and you're doing it you're</p>
<p data-start="1027.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="1027.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you're doing it that's what i have to do uh</p>
<p data-start="1027.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's what i have to do</p>
<p data-start="1028.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh</p>
<p data-start="1029.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> uh okay i've got we've got provincial and federal you can look at your notes we've</p>
<p data-start="1033.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> provincial</p>
<p data-start="1033.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> provincial just crossing off municipal federal</p>
<p data-start="1033.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> provincial just</p>
<p data-start="1034.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> just</p>
<p data-start="1035.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> off municipal</p>
<p data-start="1035.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> federal to talk about do you i would like to do is there anything wait wait wait is there anything else you want to say on um on municipal i think i think as we get closer to i think it's worth saying it's like august is fairly slow for gen pop i think september late september october are going to be like wild times for i</p>
<p data-start="1037.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i would like to do</p>
<p data-start="1037.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> is there anything wait wait wait</p>
<p data-start="1039.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> wait</p>
<p data-start="1056.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> surely hope so i'll be honest annalise i this feels more sleepy than any election I've ever been involved in. In</p>
<p data-start="1063.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> In both Calgary, Edmonton, and Medicine Hat?</p>
<p data-start="1066.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Calgary and Edmonton, for sure. Medicine Hat's a little trickier because it doesn't really start until later.</p>
<p data-start="1071.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> But,</p>
<p data-start="1072.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> But, I</p>
<p data-start="1073.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean, this is ridiculous. Why</p>
<p data-start="1074.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> ridiculous. Why do you think it is sleepy? Do you think it's because people are just tired of politics and we just had a federal election and we hear about Trump non-stop? Like, why is it so sleepy? Is it the candidates? I think it's because the</p>
<p data-start="1084.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> candidates? I think it's because the</p>
<p data-start="1086.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> thing that they're angry about, you know, housing is the thing that we're all excited about. vote i i just don't think that there's a um i</p>
<p data-start="1096.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't know i don't know i mean it could be the candidates uh i don't think it's the candidates especially given that it's the top three as you mentioned the top three that ran last time are running this time maybe it's the fact that we don't have a provincial government to rail against um i</p>
<p data-start="1110.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i still would like to rail against danielle smith but for whatever reason she seems like teflon right now you just can't seem to throw shit but if</p>
<p data-start="1116.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> just</p>
<p data-start="1117.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> but if it is if it is sleepy then is it not your job especially as like i think it's fair to say t-son is kind of an underdog at this point to to like to make it exciting to make him do i see your smile you can fight me on that but like isn't it isn't it your and the party's job to make it exciting and do some like interesting things that people are talking about right</p>
<p data-start="1140.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> right but when</p>
<p data-start="1141.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> when right september when september i think is is the only time you can do it yeah i don't think that i think that the rest of august is uh you know it's just work just go do work right go go and knock doors handle it</p>
<p data-start="1144.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> think is is the</p>
<p data-start="1146.1"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> yeah i</p>
<p data-start="1154.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> go go and knock</p>
<p data-start="1155.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> knock doors handle it and then make it make a splash carter i want to see him on like tiktok i want to see him on reddit i would like make it exciting i told you this a couple days ago when we talked it's boring it's really boring right now your</p>

<p data-start="1212.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> bet he loves that.</p>
<p data-start="1214.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And the best part about it is Tim Cartmell's coming down from Edmonton to join him. So it's going to be epic. No, but</p>
<p data-start="1219.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> epic. No, but okay, I know you're being funny right now. But don't you think there should be, aren't we in that era where you need to be bold, especially if you're kind of coming from behind?</p>
<p data-start="1219.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I know you're</p>
<p data-start="1230.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> It is a really tough thing to get attention right now. Social media is broken. The traditional media is broken. How do you get attention? how do you get yourself seen is the question of this of the 2025 election what's</p>
<p data-start="1241.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> what's the answer yes</p>
<p data-start="1243.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yes</p>
<p data-start="1243.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yes</p>
<p data-start="1243.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yes</p>
<p data-start="1243.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yes</p>
<p data-start="1243.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> yes</p>
<p data-start="1244.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yes</p>

<p data-start="1278.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> give him uh probably an a minus a minus i don't think there's a lot more that he could do in order to generate positive impression outside of making to donald trump a sane human being um</p>
<p data-start="1280.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> minus i don't think</p>
<p data-start="1290.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> um</p>
<p data-start="1290.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> um he's</p>
<p data-start="1291.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> he's doing exactly Exactly. He's doing the he's taking the low hanging fruit that's available to him and doing the best things with it.</p>
<p data-start="1300.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> The low hanging fruit is going to go away pretty soon because at some point you will need to do a project that is Canadian defining. Right. There's going to have to be instead of just talking about building, building Canada and making Canada stronger. You're</p>
<p data-start="1315.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> You're going to have to actually do something to do that. And that's when you go from having low hanging fruit to having fruit that you just can't reach in a normal setting. You're going to have to deal with indigenous issues. You're going to have to deal with nations across the country that don't want the same things that you want. And that is going to be when</p>
<p data-start="1337.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> when the low hanging fruit is all gone. on but right now you get to talk about everything as though it's but there's a high degree of potential as though it could all happen and i think he's taking good advantage of it especially through a relatively sleepy summer um and i'm looking forward to seeing what happens in september uh when when he kind of comes back to it i think that it's really strong</p>
<p data-start="1357.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i think that it's really strong how long can you keep that up that like i like i said the low-hanging fruits it just can't reach fruit but how how long can you you stretch that out i</p>
<p data-start="1367.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> think you can stretch it for 2025 until</p>
<p data-start="1369.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> until the end of 2025 i</p>
<p data-start="1371.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think so 2025 because i don't think that anybody anticipates you know a country defining capital project by the end of 2025 but</p>
<p data-start="1371.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> so</p>
<p data-start="1371.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> 2025 because</p>
<p data-start="1379.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> but but 2026 the clock starts then they 2026</p>
<p data-start="1382.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> 2026 people are like okay what is it right</p>
<p data-start="1384.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="1385.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> right i mean you made a nice lumber announcement you know or forestry announcement that's exciting right</p>
<p data-start="1385.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i mean</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right hundreds of millions of dollars for forestry i'm excited that makes me excited I don't know what it means. You sound so</p>
<p data-start="1394.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> me excited I don't know what it means. You sound so excited, Carter. I'm</p>
<p data-start="1396.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm so excited. I</p>
<p data-start="1397.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> excited. I</p>
<p data-start="1397.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I don't know what it means. I</p>
<p data-start="1398.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know what it means. I</p>
<p data-start="1399.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't know what it means. Corey will explain it to me at some point. But I don't, you know, great. But it's not a country-defining project. Corey</p>
<p data-start="1405.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Corey will explain it to you at some point. Well, he's, you know, I don't know if you know this. That's his job. He's the parliamentary secretary.</p>
<p data-start="1408.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't know if you know this. That's his job. He's the parliamentary secretary. His job as</p>
<p data-start="1410.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> job as MP is to explain things to his pal, Stephen Carter.</p>
<p data-start="1415.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> That is his job. Yeah, that's his job. How do you think he's doing? What's his grade? A plus?</p>
<p data-start="1416.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, that's his job.</p>
<p data-start="1420.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> For Corey Hogan? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1420.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1421.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1421.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1421.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1421.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> He's</p>
<p data-start="1421.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> He's</p>
<p data-start="1421.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> He's</p>
<p data-start="1421.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> He's a solid B. A B. Wow.</p>
<p data-start="1423.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Wow. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="1423.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay. OK, he's his constituent communications could improve, be better.</p>
<p data-start="1423.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay. OK, he's his constituent communications could</p>
<p data-start="1426.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> be</p>
<p data-start="1427.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> better. How could how could Mark Carney improve his A minus to an A plus? What what do you think he could be doing better? And slash, would you want him to? Because if the expectation is like that he's operating at that level and then he doesn't, does that change things? I</p>
<p data-start="1428.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> how could</p>
<p data-start="1443.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> think the hardest thing is that the actual change requires a focus on Trump. Right. If he was succeeding in the tariff war, if he was succeeding in the trade negotiations. on some level if he could bring home a deal by a deadline um i think that he would be you</p>
<p data-start="1463.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> know operating in the a plus category i don't think that that's attainable for anybody right now i don't think that anybody in this class is getting an a plus uh anybody negotiating with donald trump is is hampered let's let's talk about</p>
<p data-start="1468.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i don't think that</p>
<p data-start="1475.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> let's let's talk about that there's still canada has not secured a trade deal this august 1st trump imposed deadline has come and gone um</p>
<p data-start="1483.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> um our blanket tariff on canada it is now 25 to 35 is is no deal better than a bad deal like strategically well</p>
<p data-start="1492.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think because i think that there's some nuance here and there's some details that we're not that i'm still a little fuzzy on right you need you need cory to</p>
<p data-start="1499.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you need you need cory to explain it to you exactly</p>
<p data-start="1501.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> exactly well i'm going to call cory and have him explain it to me um what i understand is that the blanket tariff is for For goods that are outside of the Canadian-Mexico agreement. CMT or whatever. There's no T. Whatever</p>
<p data-start="1512.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Canadian-Mexico agreement.</p>
<p data-start="1514.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> CMT or</p>
<p data-start="1516.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> There's</p>
<p data-start="1517.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> There's</p>
<p data-start="1517.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> There's no T. Whatever</p>
<p data-start="1518.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Whatever</p>
<p data-start="1518.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Whatever the acronym</p>
<p data-start="1518.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> the acronym is. Canada</p>
<p data-start="1519.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Canada-US-Mexico agreement.</p>
<p data-start="1522.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Sure, that one.</p>
<p data-start="1524.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> But there's, so this blanket</p>
<p data-start="1527.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> tariff, well,</p>
<p data-start="1529.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> well, challenging, isn't as challenging as it could be. If he was ignoring that previous agreement. He is,</p>
<p data-start="1535.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is,</p>
<p data-start="1536.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> is, to a degree, ignoring the previous agreement, but he's not ignoring the previous agreement wholeheartedly. It's not actually</p>
<p data-start="1536.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> is,</p>
<p data-start="1536.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is, to</p>
<p data-start="1541.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> wholeheartedly. It's not actually like 35 percent.</p>
<p data-start="1544.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Across the board. Exactly. On everything that we've ever shipped. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1544.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Across the board. Exactly. On everything that we've ever shipped. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1547.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Yeah. So we understand this.</p>
<p data-start="1548.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah. So we understand this.</p>
<p data-start="1550.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> If it</p>
<p data-start="1552.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> were, we'd really be in trouble. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1554.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1554.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1554.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1554.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah. But</p>
<p data-start="1555.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> But as it currently stands, I think that we're just at a level of frustration, not necessarily a level of really economic devastation. Now, I say that, but I'm sure there are industries that are being economically devastated or will be economically devastated in the future. I know that, you</p>
<p data-start="1555.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> But</p>
<p data-start="1575.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, each of these times that Trump opens his mouth, I'm sure that the markets just kind of, you</p>
<p data-start="1581.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, teeter on the edge of something, either going up or down or whatever,</p>
<p data-start="1586.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> whatever, some sort of major reactions.</p>
<p data-start="1589.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> But my view is that, you</p>
<p data-start="1591.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, like the people who've negotiated the deals, like the European Union taking the 15% tariff across the board and opening the European Union to more American goods, I'm</p>
<p data-start="1596.3"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> tariff across</p>
<p data-start="1602.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> not sure that they deserve an A-plus either. I'm</p>
<p data-start="1605.6"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="1606.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm not sure that that's the solution</p>
<p data-start="1608.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's going to make it better for the United States and better for the European Union. So I'm</p>
<p data-start="1614.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm not sure that anybody in the class can</p>
<p data-start="1617.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> can get an A-plus. I think that the teacher may have taken that off the table. Okay,</p>
<p data-start="1620.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay, but you didn't, is no deal better than a bad deal was the question. I just totally answered that. No, you didn't. Totally answered. You said it's complicated and then you just talked and talked. Is no</p>
<p data-start="1625.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I just totally answered that. No, you didn't. Totally answered. You</p>
<p data-start="1631.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Is no deal. And talked. Yes. You're writing it down. No deal is better than a bad deal. Check.</p>
<p data-start="1633.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yes. You're writing it down. No deal is better</p>
<p data-start="1636.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> deal. Check.</p>
<p data-start="1637.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Check on</p>
<p data-start="1638.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Carter's list. Have you liked his communication around no deal?</p>
<p data-start="1642.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah, I actually, I</p>
<p data-start="1643.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I like his communication in general. Yeah. Yeah. I</p>
<p data-start="1643.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I like his communication</p>
<p data-start="1646.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> find him to be easy</p>
<p data-start="1648.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> easy to listen to right now. One of the things that always bothered me about Justin.</p>
<p data-start="1652.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> bothered me about Justin.</p>
<p data-start="1652.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Justin.</p>
<p data-start="1652.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Justin. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1654.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you're about to say I was about to find him easy to listen to because he's like one</p>
<p data-start="1655.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> about to find him easy</p>
<p data-start="1657.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> one of the things that always bothered me about Justin Trudeau is that you never had the sense that he was being authentic. And</p>
<p data-start="1664.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think that with with with Mark Carney, every time I hear him speak, I think that he is being 100 percent authentic. I</p>
<p data-start="1670.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> authentic. I</p>
<p data-start="1671.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> think that the his authentic meter for me is super high. What about you? Do you think he's authentic? yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="1678.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="1679.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i think he's authentic i think he's authentic but i think you're more the uh i mean you guys look alike you're similar age like you</p>
<p data-start="1688.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you you like him because he's like you you know is that why i like him that's why you like because i'm a multi-millionaire you see yourself hundreds of millions you see yourself in in the prime minister yeah my next iteration is</p>
<p data-start="1692.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> like because i'm a multi-millionaire you see</p>
<p data-start="1694.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> yourself hundreds of millions</p>
<p data-start="1699.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> my next iteration is is like this Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1702.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> no, I think that his authenticity is super high. I like listening to him. I like it when he tries to explain something to me. When Justin Trudeau did it, I did not like it.</p>
<p data-start="1714.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I could poke some holes in there. Poke some holes, go for it. I'm not afraid of you. You can bring your A-game. Bring your A-game, Annalise. I've been on vacation for a week, Carter. It's just the way you said it. You're like, I</p>
<p data-start="1718.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Poke some holes, go for</p>
<p data-start="1719.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> for</p>
<p data-start="1719.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> for</p>
<p data-start="1719.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> for it.</p>
<p data-start="1720.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I'm not afraid of</p>
<p data-start="1721.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> of you.</p>
<p data-start="1721.2"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> you.</p>
<p data-start="1721.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you. You can bring your A-game. Bring</p>
<p data-start="1723.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Bring your A-game, Annalise. I've been on vacation</p>
<p data-start="1727.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I like how he talks to me.</p>
<p data-start="1730.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Don't you like the way he speaks? It's weird.</p>
<p data-start="1730.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Don't you like the way he speaks? It's weird.</p>
<p data-start="1733.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> um i wouldn't say i love it i wouldn't say i hate it yeah</p>
<p data-start="1737.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i feel like it's actually being communicated directly to me when i talk to him yeah</p>
<p data-start="1737.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i feel</p>
<p data-start="1742.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> because you're like him you're uh yeah okay</p>
<p data-start="1746.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> i've asked you to step in you're not like him no</p>
<p data-start="1746.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i've</p>
<p data-start="1746.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i've asked you</p>
<p data-start="1749.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> no i know i'm not like him i'm not like him um</p>
<p data-start="1753.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> um when okay but here's the thing we were talking about campfire</p>
<p data-start="1757.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> campfire conversations right</p>
<p data-start="1759.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right right</p>
<p data-start="1760.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> right and so So mayoral race in Calgary, not breaking through to Gen Pop. But what is, I was just camping with people for several days, is like the</p>
<p data-start="1770.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> the American thing, right? People being like, oh, we changed our summer vacation plans. We're not going to America. Oh, check out these hot dogs I brought. They're Canadian. Have you tried them before? How</p>
<p data-start="1780.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> How much do you think that, like, the fact that this, like, America bad, Canada good narrative is seeping into the Gen Pop the normies as you like to call them how does how much does that help carney i</p>
<p data-start="1797.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> think it helps him tremendously um and that's probably one of the reasons he's at an a minus how long</p>
<p data-start="1799.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> that's probably one of the reasons he's at an a minus how long will it continue to help him for i</p>
<p data-start="1804.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i didn't think it would last this long you</p>
<p data-start="1806.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know um you didn't</p>
<p data-start="1807.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you didn't think it would last this long no</p>
<p data-start="1809.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> no i'm i'm actually surprised usually you know like consumer boycotts let's you know let's call it a consumer boycott generally fizzle very very quickly they have usually no no impact on the intended target. They fizzle and oftentimes they'll have the opposite reaction where people just become more aware of the product that is being, quote unquote, boycotted. So, you know, you're boycotting Oreos because they put up the flag, put the flag on their products for, you know, Pride Week or Pride Month or whatever. That tends to do better for Oreos. this case we are actually seeing real declines on the number of people who are going to the united states that</p>
<p data-start="1852.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> that and that has been sustained now for a period of months that</p>
<p data-start="1855.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> months that like the numbers but then also anecdotally it's like i'm so fascinated by this it's like going to the states is a bad thing like i probably shouldn't say this to your how many listeners do you have twenty thousand thirty thousand but like my business partner was in the states for a month and it was like he didn't hide it but like he was he felt really bad about it he tried to like change around his vacation plans and see if he could get his deposit back and this and that because yeah it's like frowned upon and i was chatting with people when we were camping who were going to um palm springs this weekend and it was very like oh we're going because it was booked ages ago but we shortened our trip it's like people are like have excuses for why they're going to the states because they know they're going to be judged for going to the states yeah</p>
<p data-start="1860.2"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> fascinated</p>
<p data-start="1860.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> fascinated by this</p>
<p data-start="1860.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> this</p>
<p data-start="1896.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah and you know like we are buying bc apples and bc cherries and bc fruits instead of buying buying some, you know, American, like, I never used to look and see what kind of apples they were. Do</p>
<p data-start="1906.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> were. Do you know? Or is it? I do. You do? Okay. I</p>
<p data-start="1908.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> it? I do. You do?</p>
<p data-start="1909.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I do. And, you know, so when I go in and I'm shopping for the products, I'm, I mean, I'm</p>
<p data-start="1915.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm probably not doing it consistently enough, but I'm doing it. I notice every single time when I'm buying the apples or when I'm buying fruits or when I'm buying vegetables. But is it because the</p>
<p data-start="1919.6"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> every</p>
<p data-start="1919.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> every single time</p>
<p data-start="1923.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I'm buying vegetables. But is it because the labels are still up there or is it because you're like thinking, I don't want to support. It's because I'm thinking. You're thinking, okay, interesting.</p>
<p data-start="1927.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> support. It's because I'm thinking. You're</p>
<p data-start="1929.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Which is weird. Yeah. because most of the time people think i don't think most of the time you're not thinking but i actually am thinking yeah i don't want to support the united states right so it is</p>
<p data-start="1931.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah. because most of the time people think i</p>
<p data-start="1933.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> think most of the time you're not thinking but i actually am thinking</p>
<p data-start="1939.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> so it is when you go into the grocery store you're</p>
<p data-start="1941.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="1942.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="1942.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you're thinking okay yeah</p>
<p data-start="1942.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> thinking okay</p>
<p data-start="1943.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="1944.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i want mexican</p>
<p data-start="1944.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> want mexican africa like i find</p>
<p data-start="1945.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> like i find it fascinating how long this has gone on for and probably will continue do you do you see a point where it stops or is this like the new norm i</p>
<p data-start="1946.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> find it fascinating how</p>
<p data-start="1957.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> think this is our new norm for a while um because because I don't think that Donald Trump's going to give us anything vaguely resembling a decent deal. So at some point, the Prime Minister is going to say, I signed a deal because it was in the best interest of Canada, but it's not necessarily in the best interest of all Canadians. And I think that we continue to be angry.</p>
<p data-start="1976.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Do you think, what's the strategy from the Prime Minister's office in terms of like, stoking that anger or fueling that pride of like, be thinking about this when you go to the grocery store, don't vacation in America? It's</p>
<p data-start="1991.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> really interesting because I'm not seeing that messaging from</p>
<p data-start="1994.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> from them.</p>
<p data-start="1994.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> from them.</p>
<p data-start="1995.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is a grassroots response to, you know, to a to a treetop issue. And that to me is the most powerful types of responses. It's not just the people on our podcast that aren't buying, you know, that aren't buying American goods or traveling to the United States. It is a countrywide phenomenon and it is traveling through social networks by word of mouth. And that to me is, you know, that's something you try and get when you're in the prime minister's office. You never get right. This is something that is is only happens at the at</p>
<p data-start="1996.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> response</p>
<p data-start="2029.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> at the true grassroots level. And it's it's staggering to watch. I love it. So</p>
<p data-start="2034.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> So is there are there lessons? And we're several months into this. Like, are there lessons to be learned in terms of that grassroots thing? And we can get into this when we get to our provincial section on the Luke Hazlick's question. But like, are there lessons to be learned from the grassroot? You're taking notes. You're taking notes. Are there lessons to be learned from the grassroot thing of like, this is how you do it? Or can it not be copied again? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2064.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I mean, this to me is a variant of wag the dog, right? right? Wag the dog, you get into a war. So you have a made up enemy and the population rallies around the flag. This is a variant of wag the dog. We have an enemy. His name is Donald Trump. We are asking our Canadians to rally around the flag, but you don't have to ask them because the enemy is so clear that they just simply rally around the flag. And I think that that that type of rallying, that type of positive posturing is really valuable to the prime minister's office. They didn't start the rallying. They didn't start it. And they're not necessarily in a position where they have to try and continue it. It's doing its own work because the enemy that they've defined is so clear. And which side they're on is also so clear. How many times have have you heard mark carney say i'm on the side of canada right</p>
<p data-start="2101.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> They didn't</p>
<p data-start="2121.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> right i</p>
<p data-start="2122.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> right i will only sign a deal that is good for canada right</p>
<p data-start="2124.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="2124.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> right</p>
<p data-start="2125.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> right that is he's</p>
<p data-start="2127.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> not saying that's your enemy he doesn't need to say that he's saying i've got your back because we all know who the enemy is trust</p>
<p data-start="2135.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> trust um</p>
<p data-start="2136.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> um okay on the federal front i have another one for your list there pierce pierce by election uh</p>
<p data-start="2140.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> pierce pierce</p>
<p data-start="2143.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> uh we're just over a week away from from the August 18th by-election in Battle River. Very exciting. 11 days. 11 days. Look at you and your numbers. Do you just have like a list of like X number of days till this election? X number of days till this? 102 days since this. Do you?</p>
<p data-start="2147.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Very exciting. 11 days. 11 days. Look</p>
<p data-start="2157.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> days since</p>
<p data-start="2159.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I took 18 and minus seven and it came up with 11. It's pretty good.</p>
<p data-start="2164.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> 11.</p>
<p data-start="2165.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> It's pretty good. Okay. So he's trying to get a seat. What do I have here? He's been doing some, do you keep, is that you who keeps tapping? on your list what's that tapping yes it is okay i'm</p>
<p data-start="2177.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> tapping yes it is okay i'm</p>
<p data-start="2178.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> doing this with this</p>
<p data-start="2181.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> so annoying okay pierre polly f he's been doing candidate forums which conservative candidates typically shy away from i think and i think you would probably agree with me it's going to be a slam dunk for um polly f do we do we agree on that we</p>
<p data-start="2196.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> we totally agree okay um</p>
<p data-start="2197.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> okay um it's one of the safest conservative seats in the country is why he's running there but what i what i want to ask you on this is like what's at stake for him here in terms of actual vote percentage so the mp who stepped down um four days after being re-elected he had 82 of the vote typically that's what conservatives get in there is like high 70s um 82 what what the question for you is what's the number that is a loss for polyev even when he wins the person the vote percentage well</p>
<p data-start="2229.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> i would imagine if he dropped 20 points and came in at only 62 uh that would be a loss number yeah</p>
<p data-start="2233.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> that would be a loss number yeah</p>
<p data-start="2235.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah</p>
<p data-start="2235.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i think that you know you're coming at 65 66 you know you're up against 200 candidates you can make a case realistically though i</p>
<p data-start="2246.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> think he's gonna get in 78 to 80 yeah it's gonna be a do you think i think it's gonna be do you think we're</p>
<p data-start="2251.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> do you think we're seeing a lot of coverage of it because of the the longest ballot thing or because it's summer or like i i feel like because</p>
<p data-start="2260.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> because</p>
<p data-start="2260.2"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> because it's polyeth i feel</p>
<p data-start="2261.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> feel like normally by elections i i could not tell you anyone who's running and i can name like</p>
<p data-start="2266.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> more than one candidate there because you hear them on the news yeah</p>
<p data-start="2271.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think that we are getting more coverage because it is the summer and it is the only thing that's happening um but you</p>
<p data-start="2279.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> know it's also happening in our neck of the woods right so we are getting more coverage because it's in in it's in alberta um i don't think that this is necessarily going to be getting the same type of coverage in toronto or ottawa okay</p>
<p data-start="2283.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> we are getting more coverage</p>
<p data-start="2294.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i</p>
<p data-start="2295.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean it may be ottawa because ottawa always you know they live and breathe on all this stuff yeah but it's</p>
<p data-start="2297.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you know they live and breathe</p>
<p data-start="2298.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yeah but it's ottawa toronto</p>
<p data-start="2299.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> toronto montreal i</p>
<p data-start="2301.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> just think it's where where</p>
<p data-start="2301.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> just think it's where where we are do you think some of it's the longest ballot stuff or not at all i</p>
<p data-start="2307.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i mean yeah because we got we got longest ballot stuff the last time they did this which was pierre pauliev's writing in Carlton.</p>
<p data-start="2313.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="2314.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know, we get longest ballot stuff everywhere. We get a</p>
<p data-start="2317.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> a number of articles every single time. Now, it</p>
<p data-start="2320.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> doesn't have any impact because no one thinks that their protest is particularly effective. People are</p>
<p data-start="2325.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> are talking about it though, Carter.</p>
<p data-start="2327.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Isn't that what you want in this hard to break through environment?</p>
<p data-start="2332.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I guess, I guess. But does anybody advocating for it? I mean, the proportional representation people continue to advocate for proportional representation. representation. I think we should just can</p>
<p data-start="2343.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> that and put a single transferable vote and call it a day. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="2348.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p data-start="2352.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay. We're not going to get into that. We should totally get into</p>
<p data-start="2353.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> We're not going to</p>
<p data-start="2355.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We should totally get into that discussion. No, we need to talk about... That's a great conversation. No,</p>

<p data-start="2405.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> the next six months? There</p>
<p data-start="2407.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> has to be two concurrent plans that are implemented for the NDP. The first has to be a leader-centric communication strategy to move the leader into to a place of leadership uh and right now nenshi does not have a place of leadership in uh the alberta conversation he is outside of the conversation you know and the stuff that they are doing like the um feedback</p>
<p data-start="2435.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> that they're collecting on uh the alberta separation they're not doing alberta next they're doing a i don't know something</p>
<p data-start="2443.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> similar a parallel process that That is absolutely fucking meaningless because people don't engage in those things. What we're looking for is some sort of actual activity that is generated to get the leader attention. That has to be the very first piece. You're so heated</p>
<p data-start="2459.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> to be the very first piece. You're so heated up about this. I'm</p>
<p data-start="2462.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm very heated.</p>
<p data-start="2463.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Do you hear how much your voice is rising? I am</p>

<p data-start="2489.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> they let that fade away and now they're letting alberta separation fade away two gimmies for an opposition party and they are fucking it it up and</p>
<p data-start="2497.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> then the second piece that they need to do keep yelling</p>
<p data-start="2500.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> keep yelling keep waving those hands keep making their face take</p>
<p data-start="2500.4"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> yelling keep</p>

<p data-start="2517.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> the constituencies need to be strengthened the first thing</p>
<p data-start="2518.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> constituencies need to be strengthened the first thing the second thing first is the leader</p>
<p data-start="2520.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> the second thing first is the leader second is the community is the constituency level these things what are you making fun of me i'm gonna get angrier with you as we progress through this you</p>
<p data-start="2524.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> constituency level</p>

<p data-start="2548.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> yeah although</p>
<p data-start="2548.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> although i</p>
<p data-start="2550.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> still pan for their fucking phones although i'm I'm not supposed to. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="2555.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Leader-centric comms and constant level are the two things. That's your game plan. That's your six-month game plan.</p>
<p data-start="2562.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That's</p>
<p data-start="2562.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's your</p>
<p data-start="2566.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> You're not getting an election in the next six months, right? Both. But you are getting an election. Both words, Stephen</p>
<p data-start="2570.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> But you are getting an election. Both words, Stephen Carter. But you</p>
<p data-start="2572.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> But you are getting an election within the next year, right?</p>
<p data-start="2575.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> So six</p>
<p data-start="2577.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> months, focus on getting your leader out there, getting your leader understood. So how do you do that?</p>
<p data-start="2580.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> leader understood. So how do you do that? What's the game plan? How do you get your leader out there? How do you break through? Well,</p>
<p data-start="2587.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> you got to come up with a set of tactics that aren't the same communications, masturbatory communications material, right? Like doing an engagement structure, like you're basically taking the Alberta party listening tour and incorporating it into the NDP. It's not going to work. Like</p>
<p data-start="2606.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> not going to work. Like what we've talked about, you</p>
<p data-start="2609.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> you and I have, and I think on recent episodes, like how it's hard to break through. There's so much going on. Daniel Smith is very good at communications. It's hard to break through. I'm not excusing the NDP, but how do they break through and how do they increase the profile of their leader who's known in Calgary? but</p>
<p data-start="2630.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> but focus on calgary focus</p>
<p data-start="2633.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> on edmonton focus on where your seats are going to come from and get in there and actually start you</p>
<p data-start="2642.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> know use</p>
<p data-start="2642.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> use some language that is incendiary that actually gets people talking about you you know um light yourself on fire a little bit go crazy get some attention um if you start getting attention and start fighting for the person like but how is fighting for canadians how do you like why the fuck isn't the head nenshi fighting for alberta how do</p>
<p data-start="2657.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> how is fighting for</p>
<p data-start="2660.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> canadians how do you like why the fuck isn't</p>
<p data-start="2663.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> do you light yourself on fire and and get and get attention how</p>
<p data-start="2669.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> i mean i'm not consulting with the ndp i'm not</p>
<p data-start="2672.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> not gonna give you're</p>
<p data-start="2672.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> you're not gonna give them free advice you're</p>
<p data-start="2672.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> them free advice you're gonna use all those strategies with brian cheeseman i</p>
<p data-start="2676.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> i mean you gotta put him on naked on a on a horse riding</p>
<p data-start="2678.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> a horse riding through a park horse</p>
<p data-start="2680.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> horse naked horse is what it all comes down to i</p>
<p data-start="2683.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think you need to use a different language set i think that you need to get nenshi riled up uh put him in different situations where he's talking to people so</p>
<p data-start="2691.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> so just do like a full reset</p>
<p data-start="2691.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> so just do like a full reset be like what we've been doing for the last year is not working it's not working we're doing something new we're trying out something new full reset exactly</p>

<p data-start="2731.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> sam barry's landlord story should have broken which was</p>
<p data-start="2731.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> sam barry's landlord story should have broken which was my point like two months ago right</p>
<p data-start="2736.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> right oh well you were right and i was wrong so you're looking for you're</p>

<p data-start="2760.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> right? It is hard to break through. It is super hard to break through. Anybody trying to run in politics right now, I've talked about it a million times. The general media has fallen apart. We've filled that void with social media for quite some time. It has fallen apart. news</p>
<p data-start="2778.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> is not getting shared there is no mechanism available to actually share uh information except sitting around a campfire apparently and how that information gets there is a giant fucking mystery we</p>
<p data-start="2787.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> and how that</p>
<p data-start="2790.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> we don't understand social network construction enough to create consistently create information that travels through social networks well</p>
<p data-start="2799.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> well i see yes but i think it's part of it is that just people People relied before on solely traditional media. And traditional media, I think, is still a small portion of it. But as you say, there's these other social media people don't understand. They don't understand where</p>
<p data-start="2813.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> where it's gone and what it is.</p>

<p data-start="2912.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> one-year-old</p>
<p data-start="2912.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> -old and me i'm having flashbacks of my um my</p>
<p data-start="2920.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> three-year-olds</p>
<p data-start="2921.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> -olds yeah</p>
<p data-start="2922.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah uh when he's just had too much when he's just had too</p>
<p data-start="2923.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> had too much when he's just had too much sugar and not enough sleep while camping okay the question for you now that you're calm is</p>
<p data-start="2925.1"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> too</p>
<p data-start="2929.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is what is the best strategy to get 300 000 in-person signatures in 90 days like</p>
<p data-start="2936.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> the best strategy yeah how how let's say let's say let's say the people lukasik and his and his pals were like stephen carter here's a million dollars you're helping us out and they're They're paying you because we know that you work with people who give you a good paycheck.</p>
<p data-start="2936.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> best strategy yeah how</p>
<p data-start="2938.0"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> how</p>
<p data-start="2951.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> You're still taking notes.</p>
<p data-start="2952.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I'm doing math. You're still taking notes.</p>
<p data-start="2955.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Like, what's the strategy? If someone was giving you a paycheck and said, like, here's the problem. We need 300,000 signatures in three months beginning August 1st. So one of those months this summer. How do you do it? First</p>
<p data-start="2968.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> of all, you time it so you're not doing it in the summer.</p>
<p data-start="2970.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> the summer. Nope. You got August, September, October. You need 100,000 signatures a month. And they're giving you a paycheck. No, they're giving you a huge</p>
<p data-start="2977.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> giving you a paycheck.</p>
<p data-start="2978.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, they're giving you</p>
<p data-start="2980.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> huge paycheck. I will take their money and I will say that it can be done, but it can't be done. Here's the truth. If you want to achieve a $300,000 or 300,000 person petition, you have to have a core group of 4,000 people spread out across the province. How</p>
<p data-start="2995.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> How many? Sorry, how many people do you need? 4</p>
<p data-start="2995.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> How</p>
<p data-start="2996.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> many? Sorry, how many</p>
<p data-start="2997.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> 4</p>
<p data-start="2997.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> 4</p>
<p data-start="2997.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> 4,000. Okay. Across</p>
<p data-start="2998.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Across</p>
<p data-start="2998.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Across Alberta.</p>
<p data-start="2999.4"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> Alberta.</p>
<p data-start="2999.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> 4</p>
<p data-start="2999.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> 4</p>
<p data-start="2999.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> 4,000 means that you're getting 75 signatures from each of them. You tell each of them that they've got a 200 signature requirement, and</p>
<p data-start="2999.7"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> 4</p>
<p data-start="3006.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> then each one of them goes out and tries to generate 200 signatures. So where do</p>
<p data-start="3011.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> So where do you get those 4,000 people from?</p>
<p data-start="3013.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is where the problem lies, right? There's only a very select number of organizations that could generate 4,000 people. Unions maybe would be able to generate that many people. Generally speaking, they wouldn't be able to, right? Right. So if you were to look</p>
<p data-start="3030.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> at somewhere like maybe you could get everybody who has one of those clean coal or no, you know, protect our mountains or defend our water, defend our parks, whatever.</p>
<p data-start="3037.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> or defend</p>
<p data-start="3038.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> defend our water, defend our parks, whatever.</p>
<p data-start="3041.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> whatever. You know, maybe if you got all of those people, you would have 4000 people. You'd have to get them all. You</p>
<p data-start="3042.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> You know, maybe</p>
<p data-start="3047.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> You had to get everyone who has a sign. Everyone</p>
<p data-start="3049.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Everyone who has a sign. And the problem is that their social networks all include each other. Right. Like you're you're you're batting in the same you're you're all in the same pool. right how you get enough people from out like from outside of that pool is where so what</p>
<p data-start="3065.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> so what would this is why it will never succeed would you do it would you take the work the paid the very well paid work hypothetically if the threshold was not the 300 000 it was the new lower threshold of what 177 then</p>
<p data-start="3066.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is why it will never succeed would</p>
<p data-start="3081.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is it possible if that number's cut and almost half yeah</p>
<p data-start="3084.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah i mean you could now go to 2 000 people but your object your first objective is to organize 2 000 people who want to collect so what's</p>
<p data-start="3092.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> so what's the what's the max to 4 000 you're saying totally impossible you can't find your 4 000 people to spread out you think you can find 2 000 i</p>
<p data-start="3098.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> spread out you think you</p>
<p data-start="3100.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> think i could get like 2 000 people if we were doing an olympics in if the question was we want to bring the olympics to to alberta you</p>
<p data-start="3109.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> could get</p>
<p data-start="3109.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> could get 2 000 people because you go to like you go to sport organizations i'd</p>
<p data-start="3111.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you go to like you go to sport</p>
<p data-start="3114.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'd be able to find enough Enough people in sport organizations, people who like the Olympics. It has a broad appeal, economic impact of it. You could probably find 2,000 people who would each go and they would have a broad social network. Here, I'll</p>
<p data-start="3126.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> who would</p>
<p data-start="3127.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> and they would have a broad</p>
<p data-start="3128.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Here, I'll poke some holes in your theory that there's not 4,000 just for fun.</p>
<p data-start="3133.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> We were talking about this Canada movement and how people are into it and they're buying Canadian. Can you just camp outside of the grocery store and be like, hey, you just bought Canadian. Canadian? You'd love Canada.</p>
<p data-start="3147.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Sign our petition and come be one of our people who goes around. And</p>
<p data-start="3152.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> And they will generate</p>
<p data-start="3152.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> they will generate 72,000 signatures doing it that way.</p>
<p data-start="3156.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> They'll generate how many?</p>
<p data-start="3158.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> 72,000. That's my guess. That's how many signatures Thomas Lukasik's going to get. But</p>
<p data-start="3159.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> That's my guess. That's</p>
<p data-start="3160.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> That's</p>
<p data-start="3160.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> That's how many signatures</p>
<p data-start="3162.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> But the threshold is just too high?</p>
<p data-start="3165.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> high? You</p>
<p data-start="3166.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> You can't, I mean, you would have to sit, this is the point about the 4,000 people. You can't just sit outside of a grocery store. A grocery store is drawing maybe, I</p>
<p data-start="3177.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> don't know, 4</p>
<p data-start="3178.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> ,000 unique customers a week, right?</p>
<p data-start="3181.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Carter, have</p>
<p data-start="3182.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> have you been to the Beacon Hill Costco?</p>
<p data-start="3185.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> No one goes to the Beacon Hill Costco. Have you been to the Beacon? It's</p>
<p data-start="3186.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Have you been to the Beacon? It's hell. It is hell. Have you been to the Beacon Hill Costco? Why would you go there?</p>
<p data-start="3190.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Hill Costco? Why would you go there? Why would you go there? The</p>
<p data-start="3191.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> there? The Beacon Hill Costco, if you went to the Beacon Hill Costco on like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Wow.</p>
<p data-start="3198.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> And everybody just signed your petition?</p>
<p data-start="3198.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> And everybody just signed your petition?</p>
<p data-start="3200.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> No, not. You</p>
<p data-start="3201.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> not. You should call Thomas and tell him this. No. Because he could probably, this might get him to 80,000 people. We were just</p>
<p data-start="3204.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> this might get him to 80,000 people. We were just talking about how cool it is that people are like, we</p>
<p data-start="3210.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> like, we don't</p>
<p data-start="3210.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> we don't want to go to the States and we love Canada. So why not try and capitalize on that? You're trying. You should yell it at me. You're not hearing me.</p>
<p data-start="3213.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> love Canada.</p>
<p data-start="3215.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> not try and capitalize on that? You're trying. You</p>
<p data-start="3218.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yell it at me.</p>
<p data-start="3220.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> You're not hearing me. It</p>
<p data-start="3223.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> is not the number of people that you can get to sign up at the Beacon Hill Costco. No, I'm not saying sign them up. I'm</p>
<p data-start="3227.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> No, I'm not saying sign them up. I'm saying recruit them. I am still talking.</p>
<p data-start="3229.4"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3229.4"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3229.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I am still talking.</p>
<p data-start="3232.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Annalise. Recruit them.</p>
<p data-start="3234.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> I don't want that sentence. The work</p>
<p data-start="3235.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't want that sentence.</p>
<p data-start="3241.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> needs to be done to find your 4,000 people first.</p>
<p data-start="3246.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Then maybe you can find the number of people required to sign up. So</p>
<p data-start="3249.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> number of people required</p>
<p data-start="3250.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> up. So get some of them from the Beacon Hill Costco. I will fucking come over to their house. I</p>
<p data-start="3253.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I will fucking come over to their house. I</p>
<p data-start="3255.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3257.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> hate</p>
<p data-start="3258.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> hate the Beacon Hill Costco so much.</p>
<p data-start="3260.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm sensing that. Why</p>
<p data-start="3261.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Why</p>
<p data-start="3261.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Why</p>
<p data-start="3261.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Why would you do that to yourself?</p>
<p data-start="3261.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> would you do that to yourself?</p>
<p data-start="3263.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Why? Because it's slightly closer than the Northeast one. It's a lot closer than the Northeast one, which is so much better.</p>
<p data-start="3271.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay. Didn't</p>
<p data-start="3272.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Didn't they close the Northeast one? Didn't something happen to the Northeast one?</p>
<p data-start="3273.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> something happen to the</p>
<p data-start="3275.0"><strong>Annalise:</strong> one? No, no. There's going to be a new one, too, on the way out to the mountains, hey? By Calloway Park.</p>
<p data-start="3281.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p data-start="3281.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Wow.</p>
<p data-start="3282.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah. Canada's largest. Okay. So even if they said, Stephen Carter, here is a million dollars. Help us get our 300,000 signatures. You're saying, no, I'm not doing it. If you gave</p>
<p data-start="3293.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> it. If you gave me the million dollars, right,</p>
<p data-start="3295.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> right, and you gave me the time,</p>
<p data-start="3295.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> right, and</p>
<p data-start="3299.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> then I could do it.</p>
<p data-start="3301.2"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Now you're changing it. You said it's impossible. you're saying it's impossible you're starting you're</p>
<p data-start="3301.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Now you're changing it. You said</p>
<p data-start="3304.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> impossible you're starting you're</p>
<p data-start="3305.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> you're starting you're starting the clock on me already i need six months to get my four thousand people okay and then then i put in the question and</p>
<p data-start="3311.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> okay and then then i put in the question</p>
<p data-start="3314.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="3314.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> and then</p>
<p data-start="3314.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> then</p>
<p data-start="3314.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> then i</p>
<p data-start="3314.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> i start</p>
<p data-start="3314.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> start so that's how you would do it you're just saying you wouldn't take it you're saying you wouldn't do it now because it's already started right</p>
<p data-start="3315.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's how you</p>
<p data-start="3316.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> wouldn't take it you're saying you</p>
<p data-start="3320.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> right so if you give me a million dollars now and i have to organize for april may and june yeah of next year i could probably get that done and</p>
<p data-start="3327.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> year i could probably get</p>
<p data-start="3329.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> and where are you getting your four thousand people from depends</p>
<p data-start="3332.1"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> on what</p>
<p data-start="3332.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> what</p>
<p data-start="3332.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> what what the</p>
<p data-start="3332.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="3332.6"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> the question</p>
<p data-start="3332.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> question</p>
<p data-start="3332.8"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> question</p>
<p data-start="3332.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> question is</p>
<p data-start="3332.9"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> is is</p>
<p data-start="3333.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> is it about is it sovereignty is it um you know if it's sovereignty it's one way of doing it if it's an olympics it's another way of doing it if it's uh getting rid of daniel smith it's another way of doing it i mean if it's getting rid of daniel smith i don't think i don't think it's doable okay right like i think that there are questions that can be that will not succeed and one of them is on alberta sovereignty i just don't think enough people it's just not one one of their highest issues. It's not something they think about. If a</p>
<p data-start="3333.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> is</p>
<p data-start="3333.5"><strong>SPEAKER_02:</strong> is it</p>
<p data-start="3333.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="3360.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> It's not something they think about. If a group approached you and they gave you the six months of lead time that you want, your strategy would be a totally different topic altogether.</p>
<p data-start="3370.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="3372.6"><strong>Annalise:</strong> What's the top of the list? What's the one topic in Alberta you think would get the most people out? Olympics?</p>
<p data-start="3377.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Olympics? I think coal mining in the Eastern Slope would probably be pretty. I</p>
<p data-start="3379.8"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Slope would probably be</p>
<p data-start="3381.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think it would be really fun.</p>
<p data-start="3382.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Fun, but... I think the Olympics</p>
<p data-start="3383.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> but... I think the Olympics would be my number one.</p>
<p data-start="3386.7"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah, but you think you could get more people out for coal mining then let's say not the exact question and and you still have your six months but like you think you could get more people you could it would be easier to find 4 000 people for coal mining than for we</p>
<p data-start="3400.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> love canada we</p>
<p data-start="3402.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> love canada would be is super hard interesting</p>
<p data-start="3404.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> interesting okay</p>
<p data-start="3406.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's so vague what</p>
<p data-start="3408.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> do i get what do</p>
<p data-start="3408.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> do i get what do i avoid they</p>
<p data-start="3411.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> they don't love canada that</p>
<p data-start="3411.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> they don't love canada that much you know what they love they love going camping in canada no but</p>

<p data-start="3416.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> were just talking about</p>
<p data-start="3420.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I do. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="3422.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I will not sit outside of the Safeway or the Co-op and get those signatures.</p>
<p data-start="3426.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Yeah, you're thinking too small. Costco is so much bigger, Carter. Don't.</p>
<p data-start="3431.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Not the small ones. You need the big ones in the suburb. The Costco gas station? There's like a line up there?</p>
<p data-start="3433.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> big ones in the</p>
<p data-start="3438.5"><strong>Annalise:</strong> Okay, that is a wrap on the world's famous. Wouldn't they kick you</p>
<p data-start="3441.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Wouldn't they kick you</p>
<p data-start="3442.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you off the property?</p>
<p data-start="3444.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Wouldn't Costco come to you and say, what the fuck are you doing? I don't know. You can't just set up a tent on my property. See, you're</p>
<p data-start="3447.4"><strong>Annalise:</strong> don't know. You can't just set up a tent on my property. See, you're thinking it through more. You don't think it's the worst idea?</p>
<p data-start="3452.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> It is. It's worse than the worst idea because you're getting kicked out from it. I'm just</p>
<p data-start="3455.9"><strong>Annalise:</strong> it. I'm just thinking about places where there's a lot of people.</p>
<p data-start="3459.1"><strong>Annalise:</strong> That's all.</p>
<p data-start="3460.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. We'll go to McMahon Stadium. And you know how many people are in McMahon Stadium? 35,000. That's the best case scenario. When is it ever that full? When</p>
<p data-start="3465.3"><strong>Annalise:</strong> best case scenario. When is it ever that full? When is it ever that full? My bottom line is this is what I'm saying. When is it ever that full?</p>
