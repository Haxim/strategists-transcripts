  <div class="said">was basically, basically you know my my version of it would be they just picked like parts of it and it was designed to kind of divide and distract the liberal caucus it wasn&#x27;t really designed to get a pipeline built actually that&#x27;s kind of my big frustration like there is no outcome of that motion that makes a pipeline more likely to be built but they did it because they thought it would divide the liberal caucus and and so yeah i mean i i think because of where i represent this became a this became a thing that people wanted to know my opinion about and there were all sorts sorts of questions about it but you know bottom line is this it felt fine because i i really didn&#x27;t feel like it was how can i put this you know there are things that you&#x27;re sometimes asked to do in a party and you&#x27;re like uh i don&#x27;t know if my heart&#x27;s in it even if you agree with it it&#x27;s not my thing or whatnot but i actually found it was pretty pretty easy to find that you know that fire and that interest in this particular one because hey it had game playing which you know I&#x27;m not always the most enthusiastic about.

Well, and I actually want to enter a broader conversation of how much of your job you feel like is punditry, because we&#x27;re seeing a lot more MPs do what seems like punditry, right? But you are kind of explaining to people the hazards of each direction, if that&#x27;s fair to say, that the Conservatives wanted you to go. And I&#x27;m like, oh, that&#x27;s an old-timer. That&#x27;s like hearkening back to an archive Corey Hogan, in a sense. Am I wrong in</div>

    <span class="ts">7:29</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">saying that? No, you know what? You&#x27;re not just right. I gave a speech in the House of Commons, and I basically said, like hey i used to do strategic analysis i i even mentioned the strategist podcast and i said let me let me unpack it a little bit because there are times where i believe and i&#x27;ve said this on the show in the past right one of the benefits of the show is it exposes to people the marionette strings right like you see how politicians are trying to manipulate you you see the games they&#x27;re trying to play and by exposing those things and exposing that thought thought process. The idea is it actually makes it easier to defend yourself against those kinds of things. So I&#x27;ve always believed that was one of the real benefits of the strategists. I think that was a pretty sensible benefit that we provided. But I also think that we were pretty good at telling politicians when they were fooling themselves and, you know, when they were deluding themselves as to what they were doing was going to serve any purpose whatsoever. So look, I was pretty plain about this in the house. I said, I think let&#x27;s just explain to Canada what what you&#x27;re trying to do. But then let&#x27;s also explain why I think you&#x27;re, you&#x27;re kind of kidding yourselves, conservatives on this particular matter. And, you know, it&#x27;s funny, like I never try to make these ministry of podcast things like overly partisan or anything, but I&#x27;ll just say, like, I really do think the conservatives were fooling themselves on this particular matter. They sat there, they came up with something they thought was oh, so clever, you know, to, to point out divisions in the liberal caucus, try to get people on the record voting for a pipeline. Oh, can you imagine, can you imagine how awkward it would be, right to have people have to vote for a pipeline and uh in doing so they they seem to have like lost the forest for the trees right they they didn&#x27;t seem to consider that&#x27;s</div>

This is ridiculous. You know, this is going to make a pipeline less likely. We just need to vote against this. We can&#x27;t be playing these games with them. And look, I mean, the prime minister called the shot. I have no idea how much of my analysis, if any, made it up to the prime minister. That&#x27;s just a simple reality of when you&#x27;re dealing with office. It doesn&#x27;t really matter. I think he called the right shot there. there but it was um it it wasn&#x27;t something where i asked a lot of people&#x27;s permission i guess is what i would say zane like so you know i was i was saying to these people hey i think we need to talk to them about what pierre poliev&#x27;s trying to do i think we need to discuss with them uh exactly why that would be dangerous to the creation of a pipeline project the so-called objective of pierre poliev like this is what i think i need to do and i got back like yeah okay well that&#x27;s that&#x27;s interesting and you know maybe even like that&#x27;s okay and and it was clear that That, you know, there was not enthusiasm for just supporting part of the MOU. We wanted to support the whole MOU. That was clear. But the thing about Ottawa and the thing about the House of Commons, the thing about West Block is you got reporters everywhere, right? when you&#x27;ve got something like this going on, someone is going to throw a microphone in front of your face. So on the Monday before the Tuesday motion, somebody threw a microphone in front of my face and I thought, well, why not? Why don&#x27;t I just say the thing, right? Right. So I said the thing I said exactly what I just told you all in different words and all of that. And and then on the cable shows that afternoon, Andrew Scheer and others were kind of it was thrown at them. It was like, well, you</div>

  <div class="said">well okay so i think it&#x27;s a healthy thing to say hey did i do this right and i probably thought that maybe a little bit but there&#x27;s two things that made me think no i&#x27;m i&#x27;m actually okay here and one of them is how they stated my position was absurd like it was it wasn&#x27;t even in the same they had to twist as As my actual position. Exactly. Right. And closely related to that, none of them were like quote tweeting the content they were referring to. They&#x27;re all referring to this. I mean, Michelle Rumpel literally took a screenshot of a video on Twitter rather than quote tweeting, you know, the thing. Like she went out of her way. The video. Yeah. To to avoid it. And so I thought, no, no, no. They&#x27;re like they they don&#x27;t want anyone to see the content. They know that they&#x27;re on a weak foot. And I will say this is a pretty classic technique of the conservatives, you know, and I&#x27;m not even saying I hate the game. I understand why they do it. But when they feel like they&#x27;re on a bit of a weak footing, that&#x27;s when they&#x27;re the loudest. That&#x27;s when they&#x27;re the most aggressive, right? They often compensate for a weak argument with volume. And look, again, I try not to be like ultra-partisan on these Ministry of Podcast ones, right? But this is something that I&#x27;ve perceived them do. And so I thought they doth protest too much. But what was funny is this video that was kind of a flop, they salvaged. All of a sudden, it&#x27;s going everywhere. It&#x27;s getting thousands of views across platforms, tens of thousands of views, hundreds of thousands of views. And they made it into the argument in a funny way. I actually believe if they had had the discipline not to swing at that,</div>

Like, do you get positive reaffirmation around your choice and your decision in that moment when you&#x27;re kind of the momentary target? How does that work? How does it play out?

  <div class="said">Yeah, I didn&#x27;t get any direct feedback from powers that be about it, I will say. I will say one of the nice things about being in a caucus is you&#x27;ve got 170 friends. And so a lot of them are reaching out and being like, hey, man, how are you? They&#x27;re like throwing everything in the kitchen sink at you. And I mean, you both know me. It didn&#x27;t bother me very much. I kind of got pumped up by it, like fueled, like, okay, let&#x27;s go. But it was something that they were worried about me about, right? And that&#x27;s really nice. And so most of the conversation back was like, hey, concern, you&#x27;re doing the right thing or whatnot, or I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re taking this stand or what have you. But there wasn&#x27;t like deep strategic conversations. And I guess this is one of the things that maybe I would have even interpreted different from the outside.

And they asked across the 40 questions or whatever they get, they asked one question about this. They asked one question.

We support the whole MOU, which is a careful balancing of the economy, the environment, and it gets us away from the United States as a primary trading partner, and that&#x27;s great news. It also is an MOU that balances the interests of Indigenous peoples and other jurisdictions. We do not support, and we are happy to vote against, games played by the opposition that make a pipeline less likely. That the leader of the opposition would do this is ridiculous. It lets Alberta down, but I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised. Being elected in Battle River does not an Albertan make.</div>

This was about their end of year, as much as was anything. This was about base motivation. But they&#x27;ve got that half-truth that they can float out.

  <div class="said">Well, it bothers me they lie, obviously, especially when you&#x27;re sort of the victim of the lie. And I don&#x27;t think this is one of those things where it&#x27;s reasonable people can disagree. They clearly, clearly lied, which I can say because I&#x27;m not in the House of Commons. Isn&#x27;t that nice? But, I mean, ultimately, I represent Calgary Confederation. There&#x27;s a diversity of viewpoints. It&#x27;s a super educated writing. I really think Pierre Polyev does an absolute disservice to himself and the constituents of both my writing and more broadly in Alberta with such nonsense himself because this is like it takes three seconds to scratch at this and realize that he&#x27;s lying. And then he&#x27;s just undermined his own credibility, right? He&#x27;s just deeply eroded his own credibility. And also, I&#x27;ll say, Zane, I am kind of staking, and I have since day one, kind of my whole political career on a ridiculous theory that people are sick of being spun and lied to and all of the bullshit that&#x27;s going on. So let&#x27;s just try something a little bit different. Let&#x27;s just try to be a little more candid, try to be a little more honest and try to be a little bit longer form, I suppose, about why we&#x27;re taking the stance as we are and not feel like we need to win every exchange. change so i don&#x27;t know it bothers me they lied i&#x27;m not actually even sure that it cuts against me uh i&#x27;m not sure how many votes i would lose and i would observe well it&#x27;s an open question how many votes i or a liberal candidate would lose as a result of this he&#x27;s two and a half mps because of his heel ways you know it&#x27;s not as though there&#x27;s not a counterfactual here which is these games you&#x27;re playing, Pierre, this unserious approach you&#x27;re taking to it, this idea that you&#x27;ve got to win every exchange, you don&#x27;t care how badly you have to torque it, you don&#x27;t care whether the country suffers or not, it is having a serious effect on his own political fortunes. This kind of attitude is exactly what got Chris D&#x27;Entremont to leave the Conservative Party. This kind of attitude is exactly, I&#x27;m not saying this event, but this kind of attitude is exactly what got Michael Ma to leave the Conservative Party. and</div>

Like they are good at talking about issues in the House. They like to talk about issues in the House. There are some that are really good at stakeholder management. And there are some that find a community that they can really champion and be like the liberal representative of community X, you know, whatever it is, the Sri Lankan community or whatever, right? I think about the caucus chair, Jamie Maloney, who wears many hats. I&#x27;m not trying to simplify him. But he is known for his commitment to Canada-Ireland relations, right?

But what they want to do is one sort of iteration or like standard deviation away, which is kind of comms, but kind of nots, which is strategy. Right. Like, right. Funny. Yeah. Yeah.</div>

But people were like, well, if you&#x27;re good at comms, we&#x27;re going to keep you there, right? You know, harken back to our corporate experience where we&#x27;ve seen that play out, right? Harken that to how org structures where we collectively or end individually have seen that play out. So how do you kind of ensure that it&#x27;s not just comms, but you add the strategic in front of comms, and then you maybe drop the comms and add strategy as its whole thing?

I guess the distinction I&#x27;m trying to make, not to use a corporate model too much, is not that you would be a VP of comms and getting rewarded disproportionately. But it&#x27;s that you&#x27;re a leader who can communicate, which are two very different things. right you&#x27;re part of the exact team who can communicate and have a competency so to speak and i think that&#x27;s kind of what i&#x27;m i&#x27;m trying to draw the distinction of and that being a leader with communication skills does get rewarded disproportionately even at the corporate level i would argue with you</div>

  <div class="said">well can i say one of the things that has been a long-standing belief of mine is one of the challenges any communicator has is you you work with a lot of non-communicator well two things one is everybody thinks they understand communications because everybody talks everybody has a sense of aesthetics right it like there is there is nobody lacks an opinion on communications But I think one of the things that is maybe a caution to people outside of communications but also inside of communications is it is really easy in communications to conflate a fluency with communications tactics with good communicator. And they are very different. It is a tactic to be entertaining. It is a tactic to be noteworthy. It is a tactic to be able to manage the media.</div>

  <div class="said">But if you&#x27;re not doing those in service of embedding a message, which is the purpose of communications, I would argue you&#x27;re not actually a good communicator. but stepping back you can be a good communicator and be deficient in some of those tactics you just know that the your goal at the end of the day is to put a message in somebody&#x27;s brain because that is the essence of professional communications and and it gets really muddled around very quickly and it gets observed by people in very interesting ways because you can walk into a room be like oh my god that&#x27;s the most charming person in the world that&#x27;s the funniest person in the world but</div>

I should say in comms. Then he exposed the second thing he was good at, and a third thing, and a fourth thing, and a fifth thing, to kind of being like, oh, that&#x27;s just Corey. That&#x27;s just the Corey we know. He&#x27;s able to do 15 different things.

It was just a different kind of busy. but i was still trying to run my life basically as i&#x27;ll just do it all and i ran a department well at that point we weren&#x27;t an integrated department but i had a big big team you know and the communications apparatus of the government was 300 plus people right and i was still trying to do it as though i was a single performer who could just do it all</div>

That&#x27;s why I ended up getting to be the boss, right? But the most important lesson I learned was in that January of 2017, when I basically almost broke, because you cannot run a 300 person communications apparatus by trying to do it all yourself. And you have to learn that you can&#x27;t do it all. You can&#x27;t try to do it all. You can&#x27;t be the bottleneck where all of the work goes to and not responding to emails. And you&#x27;ve got to get your teams to do it. And I think that, you know, we have not had the opportunity, the three of us, to work together since Hill and Knowlton. You know, we&#x27;ve worked on projects together. But actually, Carter, I&#x27;ll bet you you could attest on the campaign.</div>

And, you know, I guess I just want to kind of ground this all by saying, it&#x27;s not remotely about Ottawa at the end of the day.
