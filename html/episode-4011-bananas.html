  <div class="said">The first of the liberal Largely an uninteresting affair where we could all pick apart and pass judgment on the French of the various candidates who all probably speak French better than us. But, you know, we&#x27;re not running to be prime ministers. So that&#x27;s one thing. But in the debate, Mark Carney couldn&#x27;t really answer what the weekly price of groceries was. Where the bananas comes from.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

  </div>
  <div class="said">That&#x27;s where the bananas comes from. And at some point he said, I think we all agree with Hamas when he meant to say on Hamas. That&#x27;s a mistake that I would make even in my first language. I certainly could forgive it in the second language, but already blowing up the internet in the kind of looking to be offended circles there. and um and the ruby dollar thing uh ruby&#x27;s gonna be next prime minister i don&#x27;t know yeah almost certainly can</div>

    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">3:38</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">think in today&#x27;s political environment everything is there&#x27;s a there and everything because the outrage machine is is just so tuned and so on all the time that uh you know they&#x27;ll this will be clipped and it will be cut and pasted and thrown all over the internet and elon musk&#x27;s x will be uh awash with this type of clip because that&#x27;s what we do now um regardless of the fairness of it it is uh it&#x27;s what we do and you know what the the the question I would ask is why wouldn&#x27;t liberals do the same thing to Pierre Polyev if Pierre Polyev made such a misstep? Absolutely, they would</div>

  <div class="said">Corey, is there, like, I get what Carter&#x27;s saying that this is what we do now. We&#x27;ve got a 24-hour, of course, news cycle for a long time, but we&#x27;ve, of course, got a rapid-fire social media environment in which you&#x27;re producing content all the time. You&#x27;re always looking for content. There&#x27;s really no penalty if it doesn&#x27;t stick. So, yes, there are folks within the conservative movement, third-party groups that are going to make hay of this but i&#x27;m really curious on the on the materiality of my question like you&#x27;re in a debate with your in your second language um is</div>

    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">4:52</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">well i i do think it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch that any sane human being is going to think that mark carney&#x27;s on the side of hamas and like accidentally said what he believed right if there is a there there it is it is exactly the second language point the question is is his french good enough right and i think that there are certainly times tonight that christia freeland was clearly trying to push in that direction trying to nudge you know it&#x27;s finishing his sentences at a certain point i can&#x27;t remember the exact context but being like oh the word you&#x27;re looking for is whatever yeah um i&#x27;m sure she would love it if people were saying is mark carney&#x27;s french good enough but i don&#x27;t know that there is a there there like i said it&#x27;s a fairly innocuous mistake what i actually can&#x27;t get over like the french thing is what the french thing is that was always going to be the hurdle that mark kearney had yeah sure and the reality is that is probably one of the bigger challenges he has you know none of the candidates french is like super fluid but But what I can&#x27;t get over, what I can&#x27;t understand is why would the liberals put on a debate where the liberals pick the moderator and that moderator throw gotcha questions at the liberals? Like, I think in many ways, the more egregious one was like the grocery question. Like, is this fucking bar trivia? Like, we&#x27;re trying to just say like, oh, no, sorry, answer&#x27;s wrong. You know, like, I don&#x27;t, what&#x27;s the benefit? How do you win that question? It&#x27;s designed to make people look out of touch. I cannot agree with you more</div>

My neutrality is unimpeachable, so to speak. that the right move for the party here? No. I got your take, Corey. Carter, what do you think? Carter&#x27;s take&#x27;s the same.</div>

  <div class="said">what the hell is wrong with you you&#x27;ve never seen a subtitle but this is the this is the uh you know i i think that the the moderator wanted to be seen as neutral and uh you know there&#x27;s a degree of of acceptability in that because this is the person they&#x27;re not just questioning the next leader of the liberal party they are questioning the next prime minister whoever wins this leadership will be the prime minister and and And by putting themselves forward as more objective, and I saw the body language. I thought the body language was interesting. But, you know, I think by making themselves more objective, more pushing on this person, I don&#x27;t think that it was the slam-dunk opinion of Corey Hogan. I can see why they would have gone that way</div>

Corey, you&#x27;ve been the executive director of a party, right? You&#x27;ve run a political party. Why was this not the right call to pursue? Let&#x27;s just assume what they were going for was neutrality and objectivity with their moderator.</div>

  <div class="said">Because the thing that a party needs to do before anything else during a leadership contest is no harm, do no harm. And you want to make sure that no matter what happens, the party overall is strengthened coming out of it here. And I get the appeal of going to a like a journalist so this is like a former tva host pierre jobin right i get that because it seems like they should be able to ask questions but i actually think the alberta ndp did it better where they found people who were ndp aligned and came in i&#x27;m just using that because it&#x27;s the example that i can immediately most recently yeah yeah</div>

  <div class="said">of the day they care about the party and i think that matters um there is going to be an awful lot of opportunity for the people on the stage to try to take a round out of the other people on the stage there&#x27;s going going to be an awful lot of opportunity for the media to do media things. But in terms of what the party is trying to do, the party is not trying to embarrass anybody. It&#x27;s the same reason why you wouldn&#x27;t create a, you know what, the best way to think about it is take it outside of a debate frame. Would you create rules that would embarrass people from a membership standpoint? Would you create rules that would embarrass people from an appeal standpoint? You wouldn&#x27;t. If you thought you was doing, like imagine if the party sent a questionnaire around to everybody or did a pop pop quiz on something like this in any other setting, you&#x27;d say totally inappropriate. And I think parties need to think a little bit more about that because Carter is right. We do live in a world where everything gets taken out of context. And this isn&#x27;t even that. This is taken in context. It&#x27;s just an embarrassing thing. But parties need to be a little bit more guarded in 2025. This is not a clip that then dies. This is a clip that shows up everywhere. And it&#x27;s not It&#x27;s not a clip that one of the candidates foisted on the other. I think the liberals learned their lesson on that front from 2006 and Stéphane Dion and his, do you think it&#x27;s easy to make priorities, right?</div>

But Carter, Corey makes some good points. And frankly, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m pretty aligned with him in the sense that you don&#x27;t want to create content for the other team. And I think if the Liberal Party was worried about content being created tonight, it was worried about it from Chrystia Freeland, perhaps. And she didn&#x27;t really give any big blows to Mark Carney. She didn&#x27;t do what she did on the first week of the campaign going after Carney or saying certain things that could be clippable, usable by the conservatives. I believe that was a worry by quite a few in the Liberal establishment going into tonight and, frankly, heading into tomorrow night, too. And let&#x27;s see. Maybe tonight people are going to take it easy. Tomorrow it&#x27;s where the big barbs come out. So I&#x27;m not, you know, calling</div>

If you were looking at this and through the lens of the Liberal Party tonight, would you be worried heading into tomorrow, Carter, around your strategy and the instructions you give for folks tomorrow night where you expect viewership to be higher, clipability to be higher, and frankly, the throughput of anything that comes out of that debate to be magnified significantly more as well.</div>

Like he&#x27;s been on enough big stages. You could say like, look, you&#x27;re, you&#x27;re over scripting yourself. Don&#x27;t worry about it. Be loose.

You ask why? Because of the experience he had, because of the way he was able to articulate his, you know, his expertise, because of the way he comported himself. He just seemed more like the guy who would give Donald Trump a hard time. him and</div>

  <div class="said">Carter, does she have enough time to change the ballot question? Because in some ways, they&#x27;re both kind of leaning into the environment here, right? Which is, the Trump question helps the liberals, so we&#x27;re going to lean into the Trump question. There hasn&#x27;t tried to be a lot of nuance within the liberal leadership to say, which of the sub-Trump questions helps me, per se? Because I think they&#x27;re all thankful that the question&#x27;s not about the carbon tax, which, by the way, they&#x27;ve all said they&#x27;re getting rid of, except Gould, who says she&#x27;s going to freeze at a current level, so to speak, right? So I don&#x27;t think either of them kind of have tried to be like, well, which sub-question about Trump benefits me the most? If you&#x27;re Freeland, Corey&#x27;s question.

And now he seems to be doing this with tariffs. Like, it&#x27;s not going to remotely surprise me if he once again backs down and gives once again another two weeks or 30 days, whatnot. But the risk at this point becomes we stop, you know, we stop actually paying attention. We stop believing anything&#x27;s going to happen. And so that&#x27;s something I think that Canadians need to be a little bit alive to here. It&#x27;s very possible that because Trudeau can&#x27;t go on the you know television and give that solemn like address every saturday you know between now and and you know whenever he&#x27;s not prime minister anymore but trump can continue to just ping off crazy thoughts from his head so there&#x27;s a bit of an asymmetry here and and canadian officials better be thinking right now about how they respond to this thing in an environment where his responses cost nothing and yours cost a lot of time and interest</div>

Incredible moment. Which she heard about on CBC. Incredible moment with David Cochran, where she hears about it on air. And Cochran breaks the story, then gets a statement. She hasn&#x27;t, by the way, she doesn&#x27;t know about the story yet. She knows that she had an interview earlier that afternoon. She doesn&#x27;t know about the story. Tweets back at him about the fact that she hasn&#x27;t heard anything, and what do you know that I don&#x27;t know. Shows up on air, and while she&#x27;s saying she doesn&#x27;t know anything, they send him a statement in which he reads to her on air, which is an incredible moment that people should watch. Like a fucking epic great journalism by Cochran from CBC. Just like getting that one story, getting the interview, and then breaking it to her live on air.

  <div class="said">Well, I think the party—parties are always pretty reticent to exclude people from the race without very good reason, right? And what I think is interesting about it is they did exclude one candidate. Yeah, right off the bat. Yeah. They excluded a sitting MP, but they didn&#x27;t exclude her. But I think because she had been the deputy prime minister, the feeling was, it might be a little awkward. You don&#x27;t necessarily want to do that. And so let&#x27;s just see where this goes. And certainly there was probably a feeling that it wasn&#x27;t a very serious run. And then it&#x27;s like, well, she&#x27;ll get the, if she gets the 50,000, then she gets the 50,000 and it becomes, well, if she pays the deposit. And at a certain point, they probably said, holy fuck, how is she paying these deposits? And I think that partly became a bit the issue, because then they start going into where&#x27;s the fundraising for this campaign going or coming from? Where&#x27;s the financing? And things play out as they will. No, it&#x27;s not a great look for the party. And it&#x27;s very challenging to imagine that they didn&#x27;t sort of regret that they had put the gates up earlier. But my gut says they just thought she&#x27;d never get over those hurdles. And then when she did, it became like something that needed to be addressed. And so I think a good lesson in, well, no, you&#x27;ve just got to apply your rules and you&#x27;ve got to assume that they&#x27;re going to move through it. you</div>

So I think that where they are is we know we can&#x27;t win on Captain Canada. That is a losing proposition for us. But we have been successful in winning on carbon tax carne. Let&#x27;s double down on carbon tax carne. Let&#x27;s keep that as our primary message. We&#x27;ll put Canada first in the window, but</div>
