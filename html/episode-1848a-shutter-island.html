  <div class="said">was going to be premiers only, that federal leadership was missing from this meeting. And yes, the prime minister convened the first minister&#x27;s meeting. But at the end, the meeting ended with the prime minister in a press conference with a couple of his ministers, also the ambassador, all premiers, sans Daniel Smith, who did not show up. And I press conference i might be wrong about that but we&#x27;ll i&#x27;ll find that out while we uh while we discuss uh but all of them including eb uh except smith signing this statement the joint statement that that comes out of the meeting cory daniel smith is taking a lot of heat for for putting alberta first for not putting canada first she&#x27;s taking that heat from justin trudeau sharply today less sharply yesterday but she also took that heat very diplomatically from scott moe from from Doug Ford, certainly. And she seems to be taking it from the commentary class, the political class across the country as well. Let&#x27;s get into this, you know, without bearing the lead. Was what Danielle Smith did strategic from your perspective for the constituency that she&#x27;s trying to represent Alberta?</div>

  <div class="said">I think it was strategic. It depends on what the goals of her strategy were. I would say that if the goals are what we would consider the conventional goals of a premier, which is supporting the economic growth and development of the country, or sorry, of the province over the long term within the country, then no, it was not strategic. And I ultimately worry that it&#x27;s not just Danielle Smith, it&#x27;s a lot of politicians in a lot of different contexts. But short term thinking does seem to be ruling the day. It does feel like the other premiers got there faster and said, No, no, we can&#x27;t screw around with this United, United we stand, divided we fall, as Doug Ford said. And I mean, like just a cliche for a reason, like it&#x27;s just absolutely accurate. But Danielle Smith wasn&#x27;t willing to get there. And I do wonder how much of it actually is the consequence of her not being in the room. Like it&#x27;s interesting, like chicken or egg, right</div>

So I got to protect the oil and gas industry. Interesting, interesting. You&#x27;re going to continue to focus on selling our product at a huge discount into a market that holds us captive. Interesting. I mean, if you really wanted to protect the oil and gas industry, there&#x27;s a number of different things you could do. But I don&#x27;t think that just capitulating to Donald Trump is necessarily in our long-term best interest. Um, the oil and gas industry, uh, you know, if the tariff is applied, the oil and gas industry may do worse. It may not be doing as, as badly, but there&#x27;s, as we talked about in the last episode, there&#x27;s a huge, uh, amount of turnover and cost to turning over from the heavy oil that comes out of Alberta. So I think that this in a short term, this could work out very well, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to see the long picture either. And that is the very definition of strategy strategy is about seeing the multiple moves on the board and seeing how they play out in the long term and a i&#x27;ll</div>

The charges that go beyond this is a strategic mistake or blunder and put her into a very narrow category that might be quite damning. Let&#x27;s talk about that in a second. Before we get there, do you feel like her dusting off an old script, which this is, and putting it out to Albertans will work, in the sense that will she feel political pain from this here? I&#x27;m curious about that from your perspective, because, you know, there&#x27;s all this other noise about what this means to the national conversation, etc. And Doug Ford made a good point, like, this is like me giving up the auto sector and saying, yeah, I could do this carve out for the auto sector, but I&#x27;m not, because Canada comes first, right? So for</div>

    <span class="ts">13:29</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">her to dust off a script that many of us are used to, the ear is very used to this sort of rhetoric. Do you think Albertans will care of context and will care of gravity of situation and ultimately factor that in or not and say, you know what? Yeah, she&#x27;s actually standing up for us. This makes a ton of sense and get a bump here.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">13:52</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, I think it&#x27;s going to be a very mixed response. My sense is that if you are a supporter of the UCP, you&#x27;ve certainly heard enough voices in the UCP. They are hanging together very well on this particular issue, that probably the majority of UCP supporters will think this is an okay idea. My gut says, and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see polling eventually, it&#x27;s going to be decidedly more mixed amongst Albertans broadly. My guess is more Albertans opposed than in favor of Alberta&#x27;s actions, but could very easily be on the other side of that, but close. That&#x27;s my feeling, just based on conversations I&#x27;ve had today, based on some chatter I&#x27;ve had about the various inputs that are available to people here. I think that we are still in those forming times and that a really strong argument one way or the other could really sway Albertans who are just looking at this and saying, holy fuck, what the hell is happening? God, I hate Trump. Well, I don&#x27;t really like Trudeau either. I don&#x27;t know whose side I&#x27;m on. And so what matters the most in the next couple of days in terms of what the outcome with Albertans will be are the voices that come forward. So put a pin in that because I think it&#x27;s really important that Albertans hear the contrary voice from albertans articulated by albertans as to why this would be bad for them here but you know i do want to say one of the reasons why albertans will feel different about this inherently than the auto industry okay like i don&#x27;t want to i don&#x27;t want to be simple about it obviously a deeply integrated auto industry where for a car to be built it might cross the border or the various parts multiple times deeply integrated that&#x27;s</div>

You&#x27;ve got to think about it in terms of both Danielle Smith being the Alberta premier and hearing more from Alberta voices, of course, and also a conservative. These two don&#x27;t stack, like they&#x27;re measuring the same thing. It&#x27;s about 20% of Alberta, right? right? But you have to imagine that there are quite a few conservative voices who are pretty sympathetic to that particular view. And that&#x27;s going to be feeding some of that. We do know from the Angus Reid poll, and last thing I want to throw on here is that when you start throwing things like, well, what if America gave you $60,000? What if America gave you $100,000? What if you lost your job? Would you then be willing to reconsider? Canadians say, no, fuck you. No, I&#x27;m not willing to reconsider. I guess I just lost my job. I guess I&#x27;m still still strongly opposed and i lost my job and then the softening of that 90 number is not as significant as you might yeah and</div>

  <div class="said">she&#x27;s got no conviction. Absolutely she has no conviction. She just wants to be premier, and she wants to be premier of a rich province, not a poor province. And she can see that if you lose oil, we become a poor province very quickly. She&#x27;s not wrong. If this thing led, if we had a 15% tariff and it lasted quite some time. You mean like an export tax on our oil? yeah we would be screwed as a province we would be running you know deficits which she hates she hates deficits because the people around her have told her that deficits are very bad and she doesn&#x27;t like not having royalties to spend because spending money is very good the people around her have told her and you know these are the things that is that she wants to have and wants to be able to do um and she doesn&#x27;t want to raise taxes because obviously the people around her have told her that that&#x27;s fatal for provincial premiers. So I think that Danielle Smith is really between a rock and a hard place. The compromise doesn&#x27;t come from Donald Trump, you know, wrapping her arm around her and wrapping her an American flag and saying, you&#x27;ll be the governor of our 51st state, you know, Danielle.

Let me ask you to be one of Daniel Smith&#x27;s advisors, heading into that meeting, this seems like a decision that was already made. Yeah. Right? Seems like a decision already made. The communication was largely already there on the back end, the justification of not signing on to any joint communique. How would you have done it if you were her? Or what would you have suggested she had done differently that may not have landed her in this situation of being considered un-Canadian in that sense?</div>

When there&#x27;s always someone who&#x27;s an outlier, do they not always politically look better?

If I&#x27;m Danielle Smith, I find a way to stand up, not at the inauguration, but when I&#x27;m in Washington, D.C., find a Canadian reporter and actually say something along the lines of Alberta has to stand up and we have to stand with Canada on this tariff. We&#x27;re not prepared to do it the exact same way, but we are prepared to stand up for Canada.</div>

When the First Minister&#x27;s meeting ended, who was the biggest winner? winner. Justin Trudeau, who was going to be iced out of the press conference, but in fact, got to head up that press conference, or Canadians, because the vast majority of their divided, polarized politics came together and said, we&#x27;re on the same page here. So who was the biggest winner for you? Was it Ford, Trudeau, or Canadians?</div>

  <div class="said">You know, it&#x27;s tough not to pick Canadians at that moment. But that feels like the hallmark answer. So I&#x27;m going to say Doug Ford. Doug Ford was the biggest. You like that? winner and here&#x27;s why here&#x27;s why um can&#x27;t really say that it&#x27;s justin trudeau he can&#x27;t win his game is over like he&#x27;s the guy who&#x27;s walked onto the ice and you&#x27;re like my man you&#x27;re not you&#x27;re not a player anymore yeah right we</div>

I don&#x27;t know about that, Danielle Smith, but I&#x27;m going to put Canada first, right? He looked like a real fucking leader. He stood up against another conservative, and he&#x27;s got an election coming. So his needs are more easily filled by that press conference than Canadians&#x27; needs.

And I think the answer is actually Mark Carney, Christia Freeland, and Nahed Nenshi are the winners. Nenshi got woken from his slumber and has come out of hibernation and now has an enemy again. And the same is true for Christia Freeland and Mark Carney. They are both going to rail and and have another opposition member. They have Pierre Polyev and they now get to equate Pierre Polyev to Daniel Smith. And that is a fantastic way for them to start to to undercut and cut away from the power that represents the conservative movement right now that is, you know, polling light years ahead of the Liberal Party</div>

Two things, Carter. Number one, three times today he&#x27;s asked if he agrees with the Smith no-export tariffs on oil and gas. Three times he tries to skate. Last time the CP asks him, he ultimately says, well, he catches them on a technicality, doesn&#x27;t answer the question, skates away, does not answer it.

So liberals might kill it before Pierre Polyev gets to have an election. The carbon tax, that is, before... Tax was axed. Yeah, yeah. It&#x27;s over. So how much... You&#x27;ve got two potential winners. How much of an issue is that for Pierre Polyev? He&#x27;s got a host of other ballot box questions to choose from. But how much of an issue, how worried are you, if you&#x27;re Jenny Byrne right now, around your pivot? And you might say not at all. You might say quite a bit.

And you&#x27;re you&#x27;re you&#x27;re going to be struggling in the polls. And I don&#x27;t mean struggling in the polls like you&#x27;re going to be losing necessarily the election. But this vote is not efficient. We&#x27;ve we&#x27;ve covered this before. You win all your seats in Alberta, but with 65 percent. And, you know, that doesn&#x27;t help because that&#x27;s part of that 25 point lead is in Alberta. You&#x27;ve got 65, 70 percent. It is difficult for the conservatives to make an efficient vote. The liberal vote is very efficient. Corey has talked eloquently about how it might be too efficient where they dropped precipitously. but it doesn&#x27;t it also means that they can technically lose the election on popular vote</div>

  <div class="said">I think this will wake you up right away, Carter. Here&#x27;s a question. What should Nahid Nenshi do? Are you awake? I have the smelling salts kicked in. Stephen Carter, are you ready to provide advice to our friend Nahid Nenshi, who you said has made a video, was on television talking about this, punching through a bit on this particular matter of Danielle Smith? What&#x27;s his track here? And how does he maximize the political pain? But how does he maximize the Team Canada approach emanating from Alberta, at least with his voice?</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah, he needs to be able to go forward and make a case on relatively narrow grounds, but moral high grounds, right? The thing that I think a lot of us want him to say is something along the lines of, hey, being a country means we all work together, right? And as Albertans, we&#x27;ve benefited from uneven distribution of oil in good times, and we&#x27;ve got responsibilities in bad times. We hang together, we&#x27;re a country. That&#x27;s what a lot of us want to hear, but I think that opens you to a couple of unnecessary critiques here. And so there&#x27;s actually a more absolutist position you can take as Nahed Nenshi, right? My position is no tariff is acceptable. And the best shot we have at no tariff is working together with the rest of the country. You know, showing strength together. Our interest can&#x27;t just be supporting one industry. It&#x27;s supporting all of the industries. It&#x27;s supporting our</div>
