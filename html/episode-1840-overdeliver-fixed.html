  <div class="said">Exactly. But Corey, you can&#x27;t just pretend like you know what&#x27;s going on. That&#x27;s a fair point. Yeah, no, absolutely. Carter, what do you want to talk about? Do you want to talk about Krista Freeland or do you want to talk about Canada Post? We can go in either direction. We&#x27;ll go in both. But you are the special guest back on the show. Joe, which one do you want to go to first?</div>

  <div class="said">old colleague, now Labor Minister Steve McKinnon, after saying he would not order Canada Post back to work, he&#x27;s ordering Canada Post back to work until May. What do you think of our buddy&#x27;s move, our friend&#x27;s move, and let&#x27;s talk about the winners and the losers of where this new phase of the Canada Post strike puts us. Carter, go first.</div>

  <div class="said">I think it was a great move. I think it&#x27;s, if anything, it&#x27;s overdue. It&#x27;s been a full month that we&#x27;ve been waiting for this strike to end. I don&#x27;t know about you guys, but I&#x27;m waiting for a couple of important pieces of mail that are important to me. And I couldn&#x27;t believe, I still cannot believe that this strike has gone on for a month. You would think you&#x27;d start to see some sort of bend from either the union or from Canada Post. I don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s going to happen. And so I think it&#x27;s entirely appropriate that the minister step in and return normal service for a period of time. I&#x27;m not sure if May is the right timeline. I think that getting us through the Christmas season is really essential. This is the only time I think the Canada Post may be an essential service. So getting us through the Christmas season is certainly important.</div>

  <div class="said">Corey, this has been going on since November 15. So we&#x27;re roughly less than a month now that this strike has been happening. beginning. McKinnon ordering the workers back, good move, bad move on his part, and then we&#x27;ll get into the strategy of both sides in terms of this negotiation and where this puts them.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, obviously, this is all done through the Industrial Relations Board, right? The technical language was, hey, if you guys don&#x27;t think a deal&#x27;s within immediate reach, send them back to work. But I think we all agree a deal&#x27;s probably not within immediate reach you know it is a reminder that whenever you have a strike or a lockout or combination of the both it can um you know one starts as a strike rolls into a lockout right you really are are creating consequences in a lot of ways that are often disadvantageous to all and look there&#x27;s a place for labor action i&#x27;m not suggesting otherwise but um the longer something like this goes on with a service like canada post the more we all move on with our lives and And Carter, you made the quip about you don&#x27;t think Canada Post is essential except at this time of year. I think the risk is we&#x27;re learning they&#x27;re maybe not even essential at this time of year for a lot of Canadians. Now, small businesses, for sure, are hurting about it. Lots of people who are stuck in their habits, for sure. It&#x27;s very frustrating for them. But if you are Canada Post, a service that over time has gone from delivering on the weekends to not, delivering to your house to not, right? right? Many of us are now on community mailboxes. It&#x27;s starting to feel less and less essential, especially with all of the parcel delivery services that exist out there that we interact on a day-in, day-out basis. So I think this is not just about saving Christmas. I really feel in some ways this is about saving the essential nature of Canada Post.</div>

  <div class="said">If Canada Post were privatized tomorrow, and if the monopoly was gone and private mail carriers could come in tomorrow, I kind of think 70% of Canadians would not care. And that is very different from the Canada Post labor actions in the past, including in the not so distant past.</div>

  <div class="said">I think Corey might be exposing Carter in terms of where the fault lines are for Canada Post&#x27;s union and their workers here, but also for the overall organization itself. Tell me this, before we move on to those two parties at play, for McKinnon and the Liberals, Is this too little too late to save Christmas? Have they waited in, but also waited in in a strategically poor time where the backlog won&#x27;t save Christmas for many people and now the liberals are a player in that drama in some ways and can be politically blamed? What do you think of that as a premise? I</div>

  <div class="said">think that premise is really good, Zane. I think that this is maybe a week too late. I think that, you know, what&#x27;s the difference between three weeks of strike action and four weeks of strike action? I think that three weeks is plenty. People understand the message. They see the impact. impact. Corey&#x27;s not kidding when he&#x27;s talking about the impact on small business. This is a significant set of impact on small businesses, and it</div>
