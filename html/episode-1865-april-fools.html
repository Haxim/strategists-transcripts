  <div class="said">actually called volunteers who are listening to the podcast as he&#x27;s made the telephone call. This is, it&#x27;s just, it&#x27;s a fucked up world. I think we&#x27;re in a parallel universe where all of a sudden podcasting is relevant again. It&#x27;s pretty exciting.</div>

    <span class="ts">2:33</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">it&#x27;s did you guys not do an episode earlier before about like a lack of volunteers and door knockers we did</div>
</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">2:44</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">was there was a time when we could count on like hundreds of volunteers for a campaign um i mean getting 100 volunteers in a city of the size of vancouver shouldn&#x27;t be that hard yeah it has been pulling teeth yeah</div>
</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
    <span class="ts">3:02</span>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">3:10</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve been proven wrong. I think that we&#x27;ve been proven that there&#x27;s such a thing as momentum and that when you have momentum, people come out. I don&#x27;t think we can say that we&#x27;ve solved the issue. Here&#x27;s how you get lots of volunteers because I know that other campaigns, even successful campaigns, aren&#x27;t able to draw the number of volunteers that we&#x27;re drawing in</div>
</div>

  <div class="said">Congress. Okay, so admittedly, I&#x27;ve been the least involved in the campaign, though I do feel like I want a positive theory. Tell me if you agree with this, Carter. This campaign, win or lose tomorrow, and I know you have a prediction to make, so I&#x27;ll let you go ahead and do that right now</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="227">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">3:47</span>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">3:50</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I&#x27;ll tee you up again very shortly, and you will fall into the trap at some point</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="237">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">3:57</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">He&#x27;s literally forbade me. He&#x27;s told me not to come in tomorrow if I make a prediction on the podcast.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="243">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">4:03</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Here&#x27;s my theory. this campaign potentially doesn&#x27;t redefine, but illuminates what actual profile is and what the value of a star candidate actually should be. And more often than not, a star candidate in a contemporary political sense means someone who&#x27;s got a bit of a profile. Rarely does it mean someone who&#x27;s got a bit of a profile, or even not as a shining star profile per se, but has a deep deep group of folks that would do stuff for them. And I think one of the things that we often oversample on and overweight in politics is the person with a massive profile. And we undersample and undervalue the person with maybe slightly one rung less than that, where I put Corey in. But he means a lot to a very dedicated group of people, many of which are potentially podcast listeners and that have come out to show support for him and i think there&#x27;s really something fascinating about that which is it&#x27;s really a parallel between like the celebrity that has no one showing up for them because everyone else thinks everyone else will show up for them right because like they must have their own machine like you know if you&#x27;re this gregor robertson must have his own fucking thing evan solomon like i&#x27;m just pointing these names out because they&#x27;re bigger names than cory&#x27;s they just must have their own thing Like, why wouldn&#x27;t they?</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:26</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Versus a Corey Hogan who comes in, I think, in part due to the podcast with a group of people who intimately feel like they know him over the course of the last 10 years, feel like they could start mid-sentence talking to him because they&#x27;ve been mid-sentence hearing him for the last number of years in that way. And I think there&#x27;s something really interesting about that. And frankly, from a post</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="349">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:49</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">election perspective, how do you find more of those people and less of the overall sort of, you know, previously defined star version of candidates, so to speak? Because there is a value with someone who comes with the team, even if that team wasn&#x27;t even asked to be mobilized until eight days into the campaign.</div>

  <div class="who">

  <div class="said">that could jump in because to zane&#x27;s point i&#x27;m fascinated by it and there&#x27;s like this parasocial relationship with people having an intimate awareness and and they it&#x27;s like they know cory they&#x27;ve been listening to him and and you too as well in their ears for years in some cases and they feel like they really know them so jump in tell us your thoughts</div>

We have the podcast listeners, which is a pretty big pool of people across the nation and internationally. And then we have the patrons, which is a smaller subset.

  <div class="said">right? Authenticity over time. That time horizon doesn&#x27;t need to be a decade. it. In fact, it could be ours. And I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons that the podcast format, just to kind of hit it on podcasts, not the particular, but the format is so fascinating to kind of unearth realness. And it&#x27;s one of the core reasons why I don&#x27;t even think we&#x27;ve talked about enough, certainly on our show, which is the hesitation that Kamala Harris had to go on the Joe Rogan podcast was not the fact about Joe Rogan and the audience that he spoke to. I think that was a secondary effect, right? Like that whole sort of like, oh, he&#x27;s already in it for Trump. He says crazy shit about vaccines. Like the platforming, I think, was the B track. The A track was, I think that campaign was really afraid of Kamala Harris crumbling in hour three.</div>

Hour three on that podcast, you have to have, you can&#x27;t construct walls around you based on talking points.

I&#x27;m not saying you have to do that over years. Sometimes it&#x27;s just listening to someone an hour or three of a podcast and be like, yep, fucking this person is totally real. Like, I get it. They&#x27;ve shed all the the issues I&#x27;ve had or in Corey&#x27;s case, you know, doing that consistently over many years or being that person in community where, you know, you&#x27;re not the person who&#x27;s who&#x27;s preparing for something and always wanting to do something.

That&#x27;s actually counterproductive to be like, fuck it, I can do this thing in 26 days rather than 38 and I&#x27;m going to spend four of those days convincing people it&#x27;s real. But there was no intention to ever transact with it. And I think building community for community&#x27;s sake, building your network for network&#x27;s sake without having an end in mind, I think is actually quite important. And there&#x27;s There&#x27;s like philosophies on this beyond what Carter&#x27;s talked about around those networks being really important. But I think what&#x27;s more important is that everyone who forms a network in politics often is very clearly like six months later running for office. Right. And I think it&#x27;s not</div>

Like you see, you know, TV journalists run for office. You see like police chiefs. You see people who have profiles. People watch them on television. I&#x27;m thinking of a couple of specific examples in Calgary. But people watch them. But it&#x27;s short and it&#x27;s not like – talk to me about podcasting</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">I think it&#x27;s true. Like I&#x27;ll use my buddy Evan as an example. So Evan Solomon is running in Toronto Centre. For years, Evan was one of the leading political journalists in the country. He continued to be until the time he left, but he added a beeline to his sort of career, which was he was a daily radio show host. And I think what&#x27;s going to help him in politics and what we&#x27;ve already been conversing about without kind of breaking confidences is that it&#x27;s the two or three years that he had the Evan Solomon show, which was nothing to do with politics. it was a radio show across the country that was for three hours that had a call-in segment that he had to talk about whatever the issue of of the day was sure he&#x27;d lean into politics every chance he could because that was a sweet comfort zone but you can&#x27;t do that to a gen pop audience who wants to talk about fucking movie theater prices or whatever happened this week in sports and that ability to to kind of fully flex to like offer your opinion to monologue for six seven eight eight minutes because no one is calling because the lines are not lighting up about any given topic. I think that makes you a lot more relatable, especially when you don&#x27;t have a safety net underneath. There&#x27;s no talking points underneath. There&#x27;s no sort of like go-to underneath. And I think, you know, the format definitely helps that way. And I think there&#x27;s another example of someone who obviously has, you know, political star power. He&#x27;s definitely a known figure in politics. But I think what&#x27;s really helping him, frankly,</div>

Radiolab doesn&#x27;t sound the same as the strategists. The strategist is a conversation between three or four people and or two, three, four people who are in the middle. and you&#x27;re the fourth you&#x27;re the next person in you&#x27;re a part of the conversation you are answering the questions you&#x27;re a part of it and you don&#x27;t have to deal with some of the radio problems i think that it&#x27;s interesting when you bring up radio saying i</div>

  <div class="said">yeah i think you&#x27;re right i think i think they&#x27;re two sides of the same coin though right like i think one side where you&#x27;re kind of having to present your personality i think the similarity between the two is that both of them are unscripted almost fully right because to put out three hours of radio per day you are not scripting that shit in fact i know this because i&#x27;ve guest hosted that show and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s very much you wake up at 8 a.m and you&#x27;re going live at noon and you&#x27;re working with your producer to put in we&#x27;re gonna you&#x27;re gonna you know 10 minutes you&#x27;re gonna fill on this you&#x27;re just that&#x27;s the note you&#x27;re just gonna fill it um so there is that similarity the difference however i agree with you right which is that when you kind of get into the long form you can kind of understand someone&#x27;s values their intentions their activity their their sense of purpose all those sort of thing, which I think the podcast certainly is able to do, especially ours and the issues we talk about.

But he definitely is having the most fun. And there&#x27;s something to be said about that. Where has it gone wrong for them? I mean, you could actually go further back to the campaign. This is a very, you know, this is a well-treaded point. They could have been official opposition if they had taken down Justin Trudeau. Like, that was absolutely on the table</div>

It&#x27;s a kind of convincing line, depending on who you are and how much warm fuzzies you want to feel during the election, which is they knew that if they did that, Pierre Poliev would be prime minister. OK. But where it&#x27;s gone wrong for them is really from the basis of not being able to create an argument that that tries to convince a portion of liberals to a portion of their base to stay with them. He should have, however, I think, okay, depending on the results tomorrow, when realized they were in trouble, they probably should have followed some version of being explicit with people in where they need to vote for new Democrats. I think what might come back to bite them in the ass tomorrow, or bite me in the ass if I&#x27;m wrong about this, but is that their message did get close, but wasn&#x27;t explicit enough around re-elect our incumbents and these other 10 ridings we have a real shot in we&#x27;re being honest with you about what we can do because they went all the way to parliament works when you elect new democrats you get shit done okay which new democrats i think people i think political people often don&#x27;t realize how not tuned in the rest of the country is which meant that their local campaigns had to do strategic voting doesn&#x27;t apply here videos uh for like toronto danforth for for example, where they&#x27;re right. They don&#x27;t. You can elect a new Democrat that there&#x27;s a chance like the conservatives are not players there. So it&#x27;s interesting. I feel like they took on the message of we&#x27;re not going to form government probably at the right time, maybe a week longer. That&#x27;s fine. But I wish they were more explicit with it. And outside of that, really, events, man, they were sweeped. You know, if they the only other thing is like they were swept into events Hence, that perfect storm that helped Mark Carney. They really couldn&#x27;t do much other than maybe be more explicit at the end. And Jagmeet Singh was happy running throughout. And I think there&#x27;s something to be said about that. He&#x27;s probably not going to be the leader of the NDP. There&#x27;s a chance he&#x27;s no longer going to hold his seat.</div>

But the NDP vote efficiency is different than the liberal vote efficiency, but it exists in the sense that it&#x27;s not like on its own natural course. It doesn&#x27;t just balance out like the rest of the country, like the liberal vote does, which is like, it&#x27;s just so perfectly placed. It has very little in Alberta, so they lose by large margins and it&#x27;s got a good, you know, you know all the stuff and listeners do.

I know it doesn&#x27;t sound like it, but 7 to 9 from 10 to 12 is material, 5.0 there. The conservative number was you get 36 and you become government. You get 39 and you get a great majority. Now, if you get 39 to 40, you form opposition in a potential majority against you, which is unheard of. So their biggest sort of success might actually be the opening of a new chapter in federal politics, which is if the NDP lose their party status, we might be entering into like the standard sort of two-party system.

  <div class="said">tend to agree with carter by by the way, just to be clear, like I&#x27;m trying, I&#x27;m reaching a bit, but yeah, I&#x27;m saying if, and there&#x27;s a few things we&#x27;re working against Polyev in that regard, at least for the confines of this election. As it relates to, and before I get to that, as it relates to the broader stuff, but one of the biggest one is that we know the advanced vote number has been a historic high, and we have a good sense with some level of certainty with at least multiple pollsters talking to those folks on a polling basis, we know that those people largely lean liberal and largely lean older. And so with that being said, that group that he has won over and overinvested in has to oversample and show up at a greater rate on election night to actually make it meaningful for Polyev, even with the what&#x27;s the slimmest gap. I think Innovate went back to a liberal victory at three or four points. I think that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s averaging out right now. in order to have that be meaningful across all the different regional elections. As I say again, we&#x27;re running six elections tomorrow night. We&#x27;re six elections leading to one outcome, right? There&#x27;s an Atlantic election, a Quebec election, an Ontario election, a Prairies election, and you could even divide Prairies up a bit if you&#x27;d like to, and a BC election. They just all happen to be on the same night. That&#x27;s how I look at tomorrow versus election, so to speak, that&#x27;s going to kind of determine it all across the board. word, that number would have to outperform in every one of those six, you know, mini elections that we&#x27;re going to have, so to speak, especially with how we&#x27;re dividing and how different the makeup of certain sort of demographics and writings look like. The other point, though, which I think the broader one should not escape, is that there is something to be said about young people going conservative and that this election, despite the headwinds, keeping a lot of young young people, conservative. That is an area, even 10 years ago, Carter, young people want progressivism, young people want free shit, young people want liberal policies was almost baked in. And the second part of the statement was exactly the same as the second part of the statement here, which is, but they don&#x27;t show up. But at some people, at some point, sorry, I should say, if you keep these people in the tents, three, four, five, 10 years later, they will become voters at a greater, more predictable rate. There is something scarier for the broader progressive movement that is emulating itself here, just like it did in the United States, where young people are going conservative. And they&#x27;re proudly going conservative. They&#x27;re not shyly going conservative.</div>

  <div class="said">this is a carter&#x27;s exactly it there&#x27;s two things i will quibble with number one um they built a campaign that was designed to mobilize not to grow and they would have been right to do that because they wanted to win their way with their own mandate they wanted to effectively they wanted to wrap reform party politics which is what the core of this is with populism and and and say we want a mandate for this shit and then go do their thing they didn&#x27;t want to pivot because they wanted to win the election they did or the election they plan to and i and when i say plan to like i wouldn&#x27;t be exaggerating when pierre polievan and jenny burn have been planning for this for beyond the last three four years like this is they want to run the campaign of their dreams their reform party root dreams they want to finished the work of what kind of brought them into their political lives and what made politics their life. And so they&#x27;ve wrapped right-wing populism of the moment in their reform party sort of politics. And they&#x27;ve tried to shove that down people&#x27;s throats. And 39% of people to 41, wherever we land tomorrow, will buy it. We&#x27;ll buy it. We&#x27;re fine. And a lot of them will not be happy campers when they buy it, right? They will just say like, okay, that&#x27;s fine. If that&#x27;s what the conservative party is today. I&#x27;m a conservative. I&#x27;ll buy that. That&#x27;s what we need. It&#x27;s better than the other guy. But the problem is, to Carter point, the other guy is not the guy that they had, which is what the other thing I&#x27;ll quibble with is that Carney is definitely number two on that list, Jagmeet Carney. But you have to say Justin Trudeau. Justin Trudeau leaving and the conservatives engineering both those things, the Singh demise to like single digits. Congratulations. They did that.</div>

And the final thing I&#x27;d say is, you know, it&#x27;s a bit of a meta point, but I&#x27;d say the biggest problem with the Pure Polyev campaign that encapsulates all of this is Pure Polyev.</div>

If you are someone who&#x27;s obsessed with running a type of campaign and winning with one type of mandate, you are not there to pivot. You&#x27;re fighting every urge to And when you couple that with someone who&#x27;s in the same boat as you in Jenny Byrne, this was not an inability to pivot. This was no desire to do so. And if they win tomorrow night, it&#x27;s going to be all credit to them because they ran the campaign that they wanted to and were unflinching about that. even if there was moments of like okay they&#x27;ve kind of massaged a bit um</div>

Everything that he&#x27;s saying, the tragedy that occurred in Vancouver yesterday, or last night with the Filipino community. You know, he, forgive me for making this political. I don&#x27;t mean to make this political as an absolute tragedy, but he gets the opportunity to sound prime ministerial again and like a leader just 24 hours before people are casting their final ballots. I mean, this guy&#x27;s got a horseshoe up his ass. Forgive me for politicizing the Filipino tragedy. I did not mean to do that. But the truth of the matter is politics works this way. Right.

Right. Like, you know, not the strongest, but may not matter. Right. Like it could be as an aside. Carter&#x27;s right about his list. I will say, however, the one thing that stands out beyond he gets to use prime ministership, he&#x27;s boring in a time where we, you know, Polyev is 11 on every issue and we need kind of that stability and that like human valium equivalent. equivalent um i you know all those things everything else carter mentioned applies the one thing i would impress and say this is my number one is that in the first literally in the first hours of um becoming prime minister um he did things sounded like and ensured that the conservative attack of just like trudeau would not last yeah that i think that was part part of Axe to Tax. That was how he spoke, what he spoke about, his areas of focus. It was a whole package of things. That was the savviest, most political thing I&#x27;ve seen with liberals, is that every one of us, if we were given a time machine, would choose, oh man, the ghost of Justin Trudeau definitely lives on this election.

What else will I be looking at? Let me look at Alberta first, so let me throw two more at you. Convett, obviously. Southeast? I&#x27;m curious about Sohi. I&#x27;m really curious about Sohi.

You can expect them to get the higher sort of end of the 15 point gap that they have in certain polls and joining on the conservatives. And then there&#x27;s some three-way races, like Trois-Rivières is like literally a three-way race. Funny, right? Liberal conservatives in the BQ. And then finally, I don&#x27;t know the seat, but Carter mentioned, obviously, Polyev&#x27;s seat, Jagmeet Singh&#x27;s seat. If it&#x27;s a really good night for the liberals, Blanchette&#x27;s seat is also potentially up for grabs. In certain polls, Blanchette is vulnerable. vulnerable. And in fact, a couple of weeks ago, it was going the other way prior to the debate that Blanchette was going to lose his seat. He&#x27;s regained some footing there, at least with some of the local polling that I&#x27;ve heard from folks that are very much attuned to that area.
