  <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shannon Philips and Stephen Carter unpack the recent Air Canada labour issues. What can the labour movement learn from CUPE&#39;s apparent success? Was the government justified in getting involved? And who is going to scrape Carter off the mat after Shannon&#39;s done beating him into a pulp? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody but Shannon in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join our Patreon for ad-free episodes, bonus episodes, and access to our exclusive Discord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/c/strategistspod&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.patreon.com/c/strategistspod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also watch this episode on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;p style=&#34;color: grey; font-size: 0.75em;&#34;&gt; Hosted on Acast.

<p data-start="194.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> them need to be spoon</p>
<p data-start="195.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> They can look it up on the internet. That's where constituency office information is. This is basic, you know, political literacy.

<p data-start="297.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> On the radio waves. Carter, you and I are doing a radio program in about two hours. Actually, that's not even a radio program. That's true. I forgot that he's not on radio. It's</p>
<p data-start="297.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> On the radio waves.</p>
<p data-start="303.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Actually, that's not even a radio program. That's true. I</p>
<p data-start="306.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> forgot that</p>
<p data-start="307.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's a podcast formatted as a radio program, which I will probably, at that point, be awake for in</p>

<p data-start="315.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I feel</p>
<p data-start="315.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> feel like I</p>
<p data-start="320.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> in the fucking morning what do you do at 5 in the morning what show do you do at 5 in the morning that's even excessive for me the</p>
<p data-start="326.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> me the</p>
<p data-start="326.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="327.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> fucking current yesterday morning at 5.30 do you go into the studio to do</p>
<p data-start="329.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> 5.30 do you go into the studio to do that no</p>
<p data-start="332.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> no the Solberg complex Solberg industrial complex and I negotiated with CBC can we just throw a warm body The body?</p>
<p data-start="332.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> no</p>
<p data-start="339.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> negotiated</p>
<p data-start="342.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> can we just throw a warm body The body? The complex just throws whoever's awake? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="345.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> just throws whoever's</p>
<p data-start="346.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Yeah, whoever's awake. And it turns out it's the old one. So, you know, it was me who was also old. And Monty, you always have a wonderful time.</p>
<p data-start="347.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> whoever's awake. And</p>
<p data-start="356.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Monty, you always have a wonderful time.</p>
<p data-start="358.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Monty's ancient. Monty is like, he's</p>
<p data-start="358.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Monty's ancient.</p>
<p data-start="361.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> he's got to be in his 60s.</p>
<p data-start="364.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> just like you, Carter. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="365.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, shut</p>
<p data-start="365.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> shut up.</p>
<p data-start="367.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Should we get into it? Should we get into what has happened? Because Air Canada flight attendants intensified the national strike. We have a tentative deal this morning. That's, of course, the headline. But they defied a federal back-to-work order leading to service travel disruptions for over 130,000 passengers each day.</p>
<p data-start="384.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Mark Carney and his government made that, you know, that back-to-work order. Carter, Shannon, there's a lot of things to discuss, but I want to start at the beginning, which is we don't actually know the terms of this tentative deal just yet. Yet we know a lot of it is surrounding this concept of this political flashpoint of work for no pay, which is, I think, revelatory to a lot of Canadians, which is that airline flight attendants do not get paid until the plane pushes back unless it is, quote unquote, in the air. So even service demonstrations, the time traveling in the airport, any of that stuff, they do not get paid for, which has intensified the narrative and has gained them a lot of public support.</p>
<p data-start="432.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> But let me start with the basic questions, because I know at least one of you has extremely strong opinions on this. I suspect both of you do, which is, Shannon, was</p>
<p data-start="441.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> the union right to go on strike?</p>
<p data-start="444.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I am, as</p>
<p data-start="446.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> as a layperson who is not involved in the negotiations, I always take the view that</p>
<p data-start="451.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> that the labor movement and unions have a right. I take the same view as the Supreme Court of Canada, which is that you have a right to a process, not to an outcome.</p>
<p data-start="457.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> you have a right</p>
<p data-start="461.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And so, you know, in any collective agreement, there's going to be a whole bunch of complicated stuff around seniority, around conditions</p>
<p data-start="468.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> conditions of work, around who pays for what in the uniform and in the safety gear. And what</p>
<p data-start="473.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> what is the composition of the Joint Health and Safety Committee? All these things that are super boring.</p>
<p data-start="478.4"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="478.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And that would make the public's eyes glaze over. As it has for, you know, in the case of, for example, Canada Post. Every once in a while, you get a collective agreement and terms of the negotiation that are really easy to understand, like showing up to work but not getting paid and</p>
<p data-start="481.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> As</p>
<p data-start="481.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> As it</p>
<p data-start="482.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="495.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="495.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and being expected to do a whole bunch of things that are</p>
<p data-start="495.9"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="499.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> are understood by the public as work and that the public sees as work. Yes.</p>
<p data-start="504.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yes. Right.</p>
<p data-start="504.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Right. So when you're this is a highly understood profession. People remember their flight experience for good or for ill. And it is it's not a luxury thing, but it is still something that stands out in people's lives. Especially when you take your kids or your elderly relative on an airplane. These are memorable experiences. And so for that reason, this stuck in people's minds. It doesn't really matter if the union is, quote unquote, right to go on strike or not. eventually what will happen is because if the union's wrong they're going to have to justify that to their members and they're probably not going to get a positive strike vote in the first place right</p>
<p data-start="545.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> right like whenever we're looking at this stuff we have to remember that unions are democratic organizations accountable to their members because at base at base they are a product of our right to free association uh which is guaranteed uh in the charter of rights and freedoms and so there's a a lot of things that whenever we have these flare-ups and strikes that i see as just low levels of labor literacy people don't understand how the process works they don't understand why things work out the way they do um</p>
<p data-start="573.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> um and uh these are always good learning moments for people carter</p>
<p data-start="578.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="579.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> you're the one i'm alluding to that has strong opinions i</p>
<p data-start="581.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> i do should</p>
<p data-start="581.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> should</p>
<p data-start="581.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> should</p>
<p data-start="581.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> should</p>
<p data-start="582.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> the union have been able to should they have gone on strike they</p>
<p data-start="588.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> absolutely should be able to go on strike and they should should have the right to go on strike. Using a strike, though, is one of those tools that really undermines your overall ability to win over the general population. In this case, I must say, CUPE did a great job of making sure that people understood what the issues were and managing that public</p>
<p data-start="612.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> public relations side. People definitely felt like they were on the side of the airline attendants and flight attendants. They felt like they were being</p>
<p data-start="625.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> hard done by, and so the strike was perceived by the population fairly positively. Had it continued on, I don't think that it would have been as positive. At some point, people expect you to reach a deal, and both sides become seen as unreasonable. I don't dispute anybody's right to strike. I think anybody should be allowed to strike. But I also don't think that just because you're allowed to strike, the government can't step in and end that strike prematurely. So</p>
<p data-start="656.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I will</p>
<p data-start="656.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> will</p>
<p data-start="656.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> will add, CUPE themselves have credited the government mediator with helping them reach this deal. So, you</p>
<p data-start="665.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, there is something to be said for being ordered back to work by the government.</p>
<p data-start="669.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> No, there is not. That is patently false. What there is something to be said for is mediation. and using the tools in the toolbox. Binding arbitration. And allowing, well, no, binding arbitration is not mediation. I know, I'm a</p>
<p data-start="672.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> What there</p>
<p data-start="672.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> there</p>
<p data-start="672.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> is something to be said for is mediation.</p>
<p data-start="678.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> arbitration. And allowing,</p>
<p data-start="682.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I know, I'm a big pro of both of them.</p>
<p data-start="685.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Binding arbitration was the threat that was put on the table that enabled them to reach a deal. It was fantastic. This is the way it's supposed to work. Everybody wins in this situation. You don't have to go on strike for two. This is an extraordinarily</p>
<p data-start="687.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> threat that</p>
<p data-start="694.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Everybody wins</p>
<p data-start="697.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> You don't have to go on strike for two. This is an extraordinarily ill-informed opinion. Oh, my God. And the fact of the matter is that when you let labor relations work itself out, only in very, very small sliver of cases will it become an actually intractable impasse. Generally speaking, if government balances the process between employer and the workers, what will happen is that it will negotiate out itself. self. And that is always, always the preferred state. Why? Why is it? Why? Because</p>
<p data-start="698.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> extraordinarily</p>
<p data-start="698.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> extraordinarily ill-informed</p>
<p data-start="699.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, my God. And the</p>
<p data-start="730.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> state.</p>
<p data-start="732.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> is it? Why?</p>
<p data-start="733.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because I'll tell you. It's good for employers. It's good for everyone. We got to a deal faster for Canadians. We got to a deal faster for Canadians. That's the outcome that people actually want. They</p>
<p data-start="733.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Because I'll tell you. It's good for employers. It's good for everyone. We got to a</p>
<p data-start="737.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> deal</p>
<p data-start="737.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> deal</p>
<p data-start="737.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> deal faster for Canadians. We</p>
<p data-start="744.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> They want to be able to hop on Air Canada. When I need to fly, I want to be able to hop onto the airline.</p>
<p data-start="750.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Yes, of course. And quite frankly, flight attendants also want that to be happening because they're making far more money when they're actually working than they are on strike pay. They should be grateful for the process that the government</p>
<p data-start="758.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> pay. They should be grateful for the process that the government put in place. That</p>
<p data-start="762.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> That is horseshit. None of us should be grateful for our essential charter rights, actually.</p>
<p data-start="763.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> horseshit. None of us</p>
<p data-start="764.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> for our essential charter</p>
<p data-start="765.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> charter</p>
<p data-start="767.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> actually. And asking a group of</p>
<p data-start="768.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> asking a group of women, Carter, to go around, you know, like begging for crumbs out of the labor relations system is also a horseshit argument, and I don't think you can actually stand behind</p>
<p data-start="775.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> also a</p>
<p data-start="778.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't think that that's, I don't, first of all, we're not making this about gender. there's many genders represented in the airline association in cupi and what we're making this about is whether or not the government of canada had the right and responsibility to step in to ensure that essentially our national airline continued to function and i say that they did and i say that not only did they have that they have they have proven that it has worked because out of the mediation came a deal that everybody can stand behind and you're you're implying i</p>
<p data-start="806.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> you're</p>
<p data-start="807.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> you're you're</p>
<p data-start="807.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> you're implying</p>
<p data-start="808.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> i said mediation i said out of the mediation but all of it they referred it</p>
<p data-start="812.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> they referred it to branding arbitration carter absolutely they put they put an end</p>
<p data-start="814.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> carter</p>
<p data-start="815.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> carter absolutely they put they put an end date on the negotiation the most important thing is time in any negotiation they put an end date on that time and oh you've got extra coffee oh</p>
<p data-start="827.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> she needs it</p>
<p data-start="827.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> needs it carter are you awake are you awake now well</p>
<p data-start="830.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> well i'm upset now i got called a misogynist seconds ago yeah i will not be putting up with that i will bring it</p>
<p data-start="836.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> up with that i will bring it i</p>
<p data-start="838.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> i will not be putting up with that bullshit</p>
<p data-start="840.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> bullshit the</p>
<p data-start="840.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> bullshit the</p>
<p data-start="841.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="841.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="841.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> the question here is is how the government of canada behaved itself and i would say that it uh behaved itself in a way that is naive to the reality of labor relations oh my god they</p>
<p data-start="841.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> the question here is</p>
<p data-start="851.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> oh my god they did a number of important relationships</p>
<p data-start="852.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> did a number of important relationships</p>
<p data-start="854.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> relationships while doing it they stepped in too early the fact The fact of the matter is that they were probably 48 hours</p>
<p data-start="855.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> doing</p>
<p data-start="858.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> of the matter is that they were probably 48 hours</p>
<p data-start="861.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> hours off of a negotiated settlement because of the reality of public opinion and a number of other drivers. You're</p>
<p data-start="868.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> public opinion and a number of other drivers. You're making up your own reality. The reality is they stepped in, got a mediated deal. Now everybody goes back to work. Everybody's happy. Look,</p>
<p data-start="879.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Look, when they put out that order to binding arbitration, it</p>
<p data-start="883.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> it was earlier than it should have been. And it did not meet a number of legal tests to</p>
<p data-start="889.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> to meet Section 107. And what that means is that, like, that is there so that government can act as a backstop, just as we have in provincial labour legislation around essential services and determining what is an essential service. It is the government acting as a backstop to the negotiating process, not as the front-footed strategy. And that's what Carney did that was wrong. He sort of took the view that, oh, if I'm going to do this in 48 hours, then I might as well do it now. Well, actually, it does matter. It matters legally. And clearly, it also mattered in terms of public opinion. But what he did was he took a situation where he could have stood</p>
<p data-start="930.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> a situation where</p>
<p data-start="931.2"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> where</p>
<p data-start="931.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> have</p>
<p data-start="931.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> have</p>
<p data-start="931.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> have stood</p>
<p data-start="932.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> stood back for 48 hours and kept his friends in the labor movement. And what he did instead was underlined all of the reasons why Labour is suspicious of him in the first place and why progressive voters felt like they lent him</p>
<p data-start="948.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> him their</p>
<p data-start="948.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> their vote in April. But</p>
<p data-start="951.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> But it is by no means a done deal and left a massive lane</p>
<p data-start="955.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> lane for both the NDP, which, you know, they're not really structurally able to take it up right now. But you saw what happened. The Conservatives sure shit did.</p>
<p data-start="961.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> shit did.</p>
<p data-start="963.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, well, they can try. They</p>
<p data-start="965.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> They can try. So</p>
<p data-start="966.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> So the legal is problematic, the moral is problematic,</p>
<p data-start="966.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> the legal is problematic, the moral is problematic, and the public relations are problematic. The</p>
<p data-start="969.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> problematic, and the public relations are problematic. The end has justified the means, the end is successful, and we all get to fly on Air Canada again. That end is what Canadians will judge this on. They will not judge on your process. We'll say what the courts say.</p>
<p data-start="983.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> process. We'll say what the courts say.</p>
<p data-start="985.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> There's that too, right? Carter, you have lots of problems here. What's</p>
<p data-start="986.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Carter, you have lots</p>
<p data-start="987.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> lots of problems</p>
<p data-start="988.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> problems</p>
<p data-start="988.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> What's the Carney government lost in terms of political capital here? Because there isn't a sentiment by many that they have overswung. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="996.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> there's a sentiment by many that they've overswung. But at the end of the day, when you overswing and hit the ball, it's called a home run.</p>
<p data-start="1002.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> So this is one of those situations where it could have gone badly. It could have gone poorly if a deal hadn't been able to be reached. And they did reach binding arbitration. But you know what? You swing hard, you hit the ball. That's called a good thing. And this is a good thing for Canadians. Mark Carney and Minister</p>
<p data-start="1022.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Minister Hadju have put together a program that actually worked. And it worked for flight attendants, too. Let's not pretend that this is some sort of hardship that's coming forward. This is a mediated settlement that the union seemed pretty damn happy about when I was reading about it this morning. That</p>
<p data-start="1038.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> view misunderstands the role of the labour movement and, in particular, specific private sector trade unions in what is happening in the Canadian economy right now. Specifically, what they just did was torch a relationship and expectations of action for the private sector autoworkers, the steel workers, folks involved in aluminum, Other industrial sectors that the government needs right now in order to respond to tariffs. And when we see unions as sort of ancillary or auxiliary to industrial relations, you're going to end up with labor relations that are much more fraught than they need to be. You know what? Politically, this government used these folks to get elected and made certain promises to them that this week's actions have actually torched. That is a problem.</p>
<p data-start="1045.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> specific private sector</p>
<p data-start="1066.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> industrial sectors</p>
<p data-start="1070.4"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> order</p>
<p data-start="1070.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> order</p>
<p data-start="1095.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> is a problem. No one in those movements wants strikes. What they want is deals. They want deals that benefit workers. They want fair deals. And that's what this process has delivered. You're making this into something that is imaginary. And I'm looking at something that is real, something that actually worked. And people don't want to go on strike. You know, the average worker takes years to recoup the salaries that they lose on a long strike. You don't want to go on strike. What they want is a fair deal when teachers go on strike this this fall if they do it won't be because they want to go on strike it'll be because they want a fair fucking deal and they should get a fair deal</p>
<p data-start="1101.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> workers. They want fair deals.</p>
<p data-start="1107.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> this into something</p>
<p data-start="1134.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's structurally</p>
<p data-start="1134.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> that's structurally carter you only get a fair deal when you have a guaranteed right to a process and part of that process is the right to withdraw labor which traces back to the right to free association the courts have ruled this way why but you're again you do not have the right to The right to join a union and to freely associate and to freely bargain is abrogated. I'm not arguing that. Well, yes, you are, because you're saying that the government should step in and end that right to withdraw. And then you are offside the courts, you're offside common sense, you're offside industrial labor relations policy. And it turns out you're also an offside public opinion when you make that argument in the year of our Lord of August 2025, because that's the reality. The arguments you're putting forward there are old timey arguments. They're not. Yes, they are. They are about giving everybody what</p>
<p data-start="1148.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you're again you</p>
<p data-start="1148.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1156.2"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> not arguing that. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1174.3"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> because that's the reality.</p>
<p data-start="1176.4"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> you're putting forward there are old timey</p>
<p data-start="1178.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> timey</p>
<p data-start="1179.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> not. Yes,</p>
<p data-start="1181.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> They are about giving everybody what</p>
<p data-start="1184.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> what they</p>
<p data-start="1184.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> they</p>
<p data-start="1184.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> they want.</p>
<p data-start="1185.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Giving</p>
<p data-start="1185.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Giving</p>
<p data-start="1185.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Giving everybody what they want. The way you know</p>
<p data-start="1185.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Giving everybody what they want. The way you know that, Carter, is what the conservatives just did, which</p>
<p data-start="1188.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> what the conservatives</p>
<p data-start="1190.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> which is the conservatives of all fucking people in this universe put out a strong statement in favor of free and fair collective bargaining. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. All they're trying to do is an emergency or emerging anti-elites consensus. And that is where the political ball is moving. All</p>
<p data-start="1201.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> All they're trying to do is an emergency or</p>
<p data-start="1207.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> All they're trying to do is to ensure that the NDP doesn't find its feet again. And the blue orange switch continues. That's it. That's all they're trying to do. They're</p>
<p data-start="1215.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> They're just trying to make sure that the NDP has spent political force from the past in the year of our Lord, August 2025, has spent fucking political force that doesn't exist, doesn't have any impact. People want fucking deals. people want everybody to be to move forward that's what happened you you're throwing this up like something didn't happen tell you what if it blown up in his face we'd be having a totally different conversation it didn't blow up in his face it fucking worked for all sides boom and the fucking conversation done right there i also want to</p>
<p data-start="1250.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> also want to</p>
<p data-start="1252.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> pick up on two threads here seven</p>
<p data-start="1253.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> seven o'clock in the fucking morning we're talking about labor relations jesus</p>
<p data-start="1254.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> o'clock in</p>
<p data-start="1258.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> jesus christ i</p>
<p data-start="1261.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> think he's gonna fall fall back to sleep soon i think he's expended all his energy for</p>
<p data-start="1264.0"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> for</p>
<p data-start="1264.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> for the</p>
<p data-start="1264.2"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> the</p>
<p data-start="1264.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> the day now</p>
<p data-start="1265.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> shannon</p>
<p data-start="1266.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> shannon can i pick up on one part of carter's argument that maybe politically in this moment might be compelling which is this concept of canadians wanting deals do you think this recent moment with america and the u.s tariffs and carney's lack of deals on that front has kind of changed the tune like he hasn't really shown us any deals in any other way and maybe this is a you know using a west ring reference conference you know you kind of squint and you tilt your head and maybe this looks like a deal of some sort that carney the deal maker carney the guy who gets shit done carney the guy who expedites things got something done here domestically sure with the union sure but it's a deal any part of what carter's suggesting here and then my exposition on it not to say i agree with it but to maybe drive his point home but it's right resonate with you no i'm talking You're talking politically. I'm not talking about what you think is morally right or wrong, Carter.</p>
<p data-start="1315.2"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="1315.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> but it's right</p>
<p data-start="1320.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> is</p>
<p data-start="1320.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> is</p>
<p data-start="1322.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I'm saying it is politically right. Go</p>
<p data-start="1325.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> ahead. Go ahead, Shannon. My apologies. I'd like you to go. No, it's OK.</p>
<p data-start="1328.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> go. No, it's OK. It's OK. Please</p>
<p data-start="1328.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's OK. Please</p>
<p data-start="1329.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Please go ahead. Please go ahead.</p>
<p data-start="1332.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I think there's two Karnings. Right. And there was sort of a minority position that people still were a little bit hesitant on, which is. And David Collado had some polling on this. Right. Like, is he a guy that understands, you know, problems for people like me?</p>
<p data-start="1347.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And that was his least well-performing metric.</p>
<p data-start="1351.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And then there's Carney, the dealmaker, Carney, the, you know, the export onto the international stage to properly represent us, Carney, the guy who's going to keep the economy moving. And</p>
<p data-start="1360.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And that was sort of the majority sort of view of him.</p>
<p data-start="1363.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And the challenge for the PMO is going to be to manage down those negatives of, you know, he's kind of a rich guy, a dealmaker, someone who doesn't really understand, you know, my problems. And the guy that, you know, actually I do want representing me at the NATO summit, right?</p>
<p data-start="1373.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> someone who doesn't</p>
<p data-start="1374.0"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> doesn't really understand,</p>
<p data-start="1374.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> understand,</p>
<p data-start="1381.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Or, you know, in the Oval Office, those kinds of places. And so</p>
<p data-start="1387.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> what he's done is he's gone back to some of those negatives and put them in the window for people.</p>
<p data-start="1393.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And that is distinct of his positive attributes that are still definitely there. And I don't think, you know, having a deal, not a deal. I've said this from the beginning on. We're much better off without a deal and let Kuzma kind of roll itself out, getting closer and closer to the midterms and letting the Trump White House kind of touch the stove on tariffs with other countries. We're better off to kind of, you know, lurk under the surface. So I don't think that Canadians blame</p>
<p data-start="1423.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> blame him for,</p>
<p data-start="1424.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> for, you know, the sort of deal or no deal piece of it. And I don't think that feeds into into his negatives. This Air Canada thing, though, absolutely does feed into his negatives. Carter</p>
<p data-start="1434.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> does it?</p>
<p data-start="1435.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> No.</p>
<p data-start="1436.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> It fed into the negatives for the 15 minutes that people were like, well,</p>
<p data-start="1440.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> well, this may be government overreach. Now we've got a deal. Now there's a solution. Everybody's happy. It's going to be seen as a real positive. You take a risk, you get a reward. This</p>
<p data-start="1449.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is the reward. The reward is coming.</p>
<p data-start="1452.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> And so I'm, first of all, reward. Super hard to say at 7 o'clock in the fucking morning. Who knew? I didn't know.</p>
<p data-start="1459.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Reward.</p>
<p data-start="1460.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Reward.</p>
<p data-start="1461.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Reward.</p>
<p data-start="1463.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> We have a problem here.</p>
<p data-start="1464.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> here.</p>
<p data-start="1465.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1466.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's all I have to say. Let's</p>
<p data-start="1466.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> say.</p>
<p data-start="1467.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Let's</p>
<p data-start="1467.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Let's talk about the union. Let's talk about the union.</p>
<p data-start="1467.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Let's talk about</p>
<p data-start="1469.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay,</p>
<p data-start="1469.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay, because I'm doing great in this conversation. No, wait, wait. This has been a ton of fun for me. Let's</p>
<p data-start="1473.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> No,</p>
<p data-start="1473.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> No, wait, wait. This has been a ton</p>
<p data-start="1475.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Let's talk about the union. Yeah, let's do that, Zane.</p>
<p data-start="1476.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, let's do that, Zane.</p>
<p data-start="1477.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="1479.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> think if this deal was not struck this morning or in the approximation of this morning, Shannon, that Mark Carney was on the verge of giving the union a further shot in the arm. It's not land. They're defiance to the back-to-work order. Hancock saying that he's not, you know, stopping, that he'll happily, if needed, go to jail, etc. I think that only helped the union side. Am I wrong?</p>
<p data-start="1505.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> No, I don't think you're wrong. And in this particular case, I mean, there are lots of instances where, you know, that could zig instead of zag when you defy back-to-work order. And I want to talk about that</p>
<p data-start="1513.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> defy back-to-work order. And I want to talk about that in a second. Why this works with the union. So</p>
<p data-start="1514.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> that in a second. Why this works with the union. So</p>
<p data-start="1517.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> So it's so fucking rare that a union defies a back to work order. Extremely rare because the fines are steep. The penalties are severe. And, you know, it is an untenable situation. It's designed that way in the balance of labor relations and has been since William</p>
<p data-start="1534.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Lyon Mackenzie King had to come to Lethbridge in 1906 to and to mediate out coal miner strikes that kept being wildcatted. And the employers wanted some way and</p>
<p data-start="1545.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and they had to settle for negotiation process to keep people coming to work. That is where this process in Canadian law stretches back to the Industrial Disputes Resolution Act of 1907. And so, you know, of</p>
<p data-start="1560.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> course, of course, defying a back-to-work order is a huge fucking deal in the labor movement. In this case, it helped the union show the public that the government was on the side of people who wanted you to work for free. This was an easy concept to understand. Over time, that may have changed. But the whole point here is that when the government gets out of the way and bargaining just moves along, the situation does become untenable for both sides and the teeter-totter evens out and they come to an agreement.</p>
<p data-start="1598.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And so that's what happened here. The union had to take this chance. The good news is they had the rest of the labor movement behind them in terms of the financial resources to be able to do this and the legal resources and all the rest of it. That's why you have what's called labor centrals, right? The Canadian Labor Congress and others backing them.</p>
<p data-start="1617.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Because what this means for the rest of the federally regulated sectors and folks going into bargaining is that if government is willing to, is trigger happy and is going to step in too early, you're going to get a shittier deal for everyone. And that's why they did it.</p>
<p data-start="1631.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Except they did.</p>
<p data-start="1633.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Except they got a deal that they liked. Except, you know, I mean, again, I just deal with reality. Well, we'll see. We'll see. We'll see if</p>
<p data-start="1636.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Well, we'll see. We'll see. We'll see if the members ratify it, Carter. Like, I don't want to get so happy on that on that front. I am quite certain</p>
<p data-start="1641.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I am quite certain the members are going to ratify it. I</p>
<p data-start="1643.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> going to ratify</p>
<p data-start="1644.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I agree. I suspect that. I bet you a dollar fifty.</p>
<p data-start="1645.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> suspect that. I bet you a dollar fifty. A</p>
<p data-start="1648.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> buck fifty.</p>
<p data-start="1648.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> buck fifty.</p>
<p data-start="1653.9"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> ACAST powers the world's best podcasts. Here's</p>
<p data-start="1657.6"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> the show that we recommend.</p>
<p data-start="1661.8"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Terry Hart, and this is The Heart of It All, a podcast about navigating the messy, beautiful, complicated realities of caregiving for our aging loved ones. Every week, I sit down with experts, caregivers, and families to talk honestly about what it means to support an aging parent. If you're a caregiver or you want to know what to expect when you inevitably become one, you're in the right place. The heart of it all. That's heart spelled H-A-R-T. New episodes every week wherever you get your podcasts.</p>
<p data-start="1694.9"><strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> ACAST helps creators launch, grow, and monetize their podcasts everywhere. ACAST.com Why</p>
<p data-start="1704.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> did this work for CUPE in this acute moment, and it's not worked for so many other unions? Let's throw out Cup W and the postal workers as an example. What was unique about the moment, their strategy, their communications, perhaps even their opponent, that made this work for them? I want to spend a few minutes together talking about this. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1725.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think that this deal, and I'll just compare it to the postal union, because the postal union is in, I think that it's about accepting the same reality, right?</p>
<p data-start="1738.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> right? I think that Air Canada accepted the same reality that the flight attendants accepted. And they were already negotiating on things like getting paid for their full working time, not for, you know, getting paid just for time in the air. There were there was already some big concessions on the table from the from the airline, recognizing that they were in some sort of joint reality that they could both see that there was going to be an end game. I think that with the postal workers, there is not a joint understanding of what the future of Canada Post looks like. I think the future of Canada Post looks much different in 10 years than it does 10 years ago. go. I think that my reliance on my mail delivery has dramatically dropped over the course of the last 20 years, right? And I used to get all my checks in the mail. That was fun. I liked getting checks in the mail. Getting checks in the mail was one of the great things that you could do in life. Now just money shows up. And that's fine. I like money showing up too. But, you know, Well, the postal service has changed. It's becoming more of a package delivery service, 24-7 competing with Amazon type of service, Purolator style as opposed to Canada Post style. Do</p>
<p data-start="1813.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> opposed to Canada Post style. Do</p>
<p data-start="1814.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Do you think Canadians kind of captured that nuance during that postal worker debate and were like, actually, I can't automatically just go to... Okay, interesting. So that's not it. So Canadians</p>
<p data-start="1819.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> can't automatically just go to...</p>
<p data-start="1821.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> So that's not it. So Canadians don't understand the difference. I don't think the postal workers understand the difference. I think there's an unshared reality with the Postal Service,</p>
<p data-start="1830.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Service, and I think that that's going to create much harder negotiations, much longer period of time, and ultimately, I think, will result in a strike and Christmas time this year. The fact that they're not striking until Christmastime tells me an awful lot about how they wish to achieve a deal. Maximum pressure, which is fine, but also maximum consequence. Maximum consequence meaning that they will probably be ordered back to work. Whereas if they struck right now, I don't think that they're going to be ordered back to work in nearly the same amount of time.</p>
<p data-start="1864.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> But, you know, we'll wait and see. But I do think that the difference was Air Canada had a very shared reality with CUPE. And CUPE and Air Canada were going to reach a deal. And that deal was facilitated faster by the government stepping in.</p>
<p data-start="1880.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Do you want to, Shannon, add anything or take anything away in terms of why CUPE in this case was so successful? Of course, we're pending the deal and its ratification, but at least winning hearts and minds why it was so successful. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1894.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> one of the big reasons is that Canada Post is a crown and Air Canada is a private corporation. It's only like super old people like us that might remember that Air Canada was once a crown. But so when people see it as sort of a for-profit entity, you know, they see, okay, well, you have the money to be able to pay people for their time. And</p>
<p data-start="1913.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And it's a much easier public relations exercise than, you know, Canada Post is a crown corporation and it, you</p>
<p data-start="1922.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> you know, might own associated entities like Purolator, for example, it owns 90% of Purolator. But it's a much more difficult, thorny kind of negotiating entity, right? So right there in terms of the public perception. Number two, almost every Canadian has an experience with one of the two major airlines of like delays or reasons, you know, ways that they've pissed them off. Right. And so it's easy to kind of get public sympathy vis-a-vis the airline. Whereas, you know, I can't really think of outside of snowstorms and other things why my mail didn't show up. Right. It's a reliable public</p>
<p data-start="1957.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's a reliable public</p>
<p data-start="1959.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> public service in that way. It's not something that I have to go through a 1-800 line and wait for four hours on the phone to talk to a person to find my luggage.</p>
<p data-start="1959.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> public</p>
<p data-start="1974.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And so it's</p>
<p data-start="1977.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> it's much harder to garner public sympathy. And</p>
<p data-start="1980.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> number three,</p>
<p data-start="1982.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> the government has for years now taken the same view of things that Carter just articulated, which is that this is sort of a phase, a service that has to be somehow phased out and the public kind of sees it that way.</p>
<p data-start="1996.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Right. And so that's the negotiating position at the table as well, which is why you're seeing such frequent labor disruptions, because employer is stuck within a bit of a, it's not necessarily so much a bargaining mandate, but a bargaining position. That essentially means that they have to be pretty intransigent at the table, right?</p>
<p data-start="2015.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> right? And it probably will take, you</p>
<p data-start="2018.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> you know, government resources, government mandate for the crown in</p>
<p data-start="2021.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> in order to get out of that really sticky position, which is why it seems like every two minutes we're in this conversation about striking postal workers, right?</p>
<p data-start="2032.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> So they're kind of managing that crown into some sort of decline. And that's the problem here, right? They're going to have to decide, is this an essential service? How are we modernizing it? And how are we doing so in a way that guarantees sort of labor peace? You also have two different types of unions. Again, back to the point about sort of democratic control of unions. The QP Air Canada component has a large presence in Quebec, a large presence out of Pearson, obviously, in Ontario. Ontario, and they have a different just sort of ethic and vibe than CUPW, which has always been a much more vigilant, militant type of union. So you're just going to have a different bargaining mandate coming up from the workers of what's going on at the table. And I think the final point is just like the Air Canada component blew</p>
<p data-start="2087.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> it out of the park in terms of their public They had Point Blank do it. I just saw, you know, this is public information because Point Blank was talking about it on LinkedIn.</p>
<p data-start="2097.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> They did a hell of a campaign and</p>
<p data-start="2100.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and they had good, you know, raw material to work with. It's harder to, you know, be like, well, seniority and these other kinds of issues, which is what's at stake in so many other labor disputes. What</p>
<p data-start="2113.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> are the lessons, Shannon, to take away if you're like another labor union, if you're even even if you're like a group going up against an employer or government or trying to win hearts and minds like I think there's some things that you could take that may not necessarily apply, like defying a back to work order. order, I think, to your earlier point. Pretty rare that the public agrees with you on that, but they clearly had them. They clearly read the moment correctly in terms of that particular piece acutely. But what lessons would you take? And this is to both of you. I'll start with Shannon. If your other labor unions, other progressive groups, other groups trying to win hearts and minds from what CUPE just did.</p>
<p data-start="2152.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Professionalize your comms and have it out there in advance to set the terms, right? Because that's what, they moved that campaign last week</p>
<p data-start="2162.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> because I had heard about it, you know, two weeks ago from some of my friends in QP of kind of, you know, where things were moving to. And I actually heard about the unpaid work thing. I actually, maybe I should have had some idea, but I did not actually realize that it wasn't until, you know, the doors closed that, you know, the clock starts kind of thing.</p>
<p data-start="2180.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And so they had those products moving And they moved them in a really sophisticated and well-resourced way. They moved them across platforms. I saw ads across all kinds of platforms on, you know, Unpaid Work Won't Fly. They had a really nice tagline. So,</p>
<p data-start="2196.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> So, you know, it comes down to being professionalized around the comms. They didn't do it around, you know, labor leader personalities. You only saw keeping national presence in the last couple of days. Before that, it was letting the kind of flight attendant story, you</p>
<p data-start="2208.7"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="2208.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> it was letting</p>
<p data-start="2212.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know,</p>
<p data-start="2213.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> you know, it wasn't like, you know, some kind of like, oh, here's a, you know, like a union executive explaining the story to me. They used other ways to do that. They used like sort of a almost</p>
<p data-start="2225.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> a fake podcast format to</p>
<p data-start="2227.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> to kind of push some of their cons if you go look at what they did. And</p>
<p data-start="2231.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And they also made sure that all of those materials were in hand at</p>
<p data-start="2238.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> at the places that were easy for traditional media and others to go and look at, right? Pearson, PET Airport in Montreal, YYC, etc.</p>
<p data-start="2249.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, what lessons to be learned? I</p>
<p data-start="2251.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I totally agree with Shannon. I mean, it was a professional communications plan that was implemented in advance so the people understood exactly the terms on the union's side. That made it a much more professional dispute. It made it harder for Air Canada to walk away from it. It made it harder for the government to ignore it. That is one of the consequences, though, of doing a really good communication structure is you're going to have more</p>
<p data-start="2283.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> more attention on you. And there was certainly lots of attention put on to CUPE as this unfolded. I think that they did a great job of ramping up the pressure and making sure that everybody understood what was at stake. I think doing</p>
<p data-start="2303.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> the communications early, it's something that we talk about all the time, setting the table. That is the number one push for any organization, either side, right? If you want to be taken seriously, you got to do your communications in advance. You got to do your homework. If Air Canada wanted to do this better, they would have been talking about their existing offers and taking the free work, the unpaid labor right off the table, right off the bat. And they just didn't. They were caught completely flat-footed.</p>
<p data-start="2335.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I just want to just</p>
<p data-start="2335.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> just want to just add one thing, which is QP was given a gift of an employer that was using old-timey tactics to the point that I made earlier. They were super aggressive. They were super dickish. uh and uh you know at one point i looked at it and went like uh</p>
<p data-start="2338.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> which is QP</p>
<p data-start="2354.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> uh who is running uh these comms and uh you know like somebody needs to save them from themselves they were like using a super 90s anti-union kind of message track and that does not fly in 2025 people are sick of that shit they are are sick of you know like people making a whole bunch of money while i'm going to bust my ass for nothing, right? That is the vibe of 2025. And if you don't understand that as a corporate communicator, you are going to get your ass kicked, which is what just happened here in Canada. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="2385.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, I agree completely. I mean, as a flabby quasi-monopoly, they didn't have their shit together from a comms perspective. But I think they also just had a lack</p>
<p data-start="2395.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> of understanding of reading the room, which I want to kind of lean into as we talk about it in our over-under on our lightning round, Stephen Carter, because my first question is, does this dispute teach</p>
<p data-start="2409.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> you anything or instruct you about anything in regards to Canadians' perspectives on class and class warfare or how they view class? We kind of ignore talking about that as a daily concept in this country. Certain political parties do it. But I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by my fellow Canadians being so on side with the flight attendants. And I think both of you made made excellent points around why the experiences that they've had the types of people that flight attendants are etc regardless</p>
<p data-start="2440.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> of all that or maybe including all of that i was excited to see that that public opinion support held does this reveal anything to you carter about class in canada i</p>
<p data-start="2451.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> wish it did i i i wish i wish to a degree that what shannon said that we care about uh our our common person you know or you know the the people that we work with and those i i still I still think that we are more a selfish society than we are an empathetic society. So I would have liked to, I mean, I'd like to believe that the empathy that was exhibited over the course of the last week towards flight attendants was something that would last. I have a sense that as soon as someone gets onto an airplane and doesn't get a cup of coffee that is tolerable, that empathy will evaporate and disappear. Because I suspect that that empathy exists more in the abstract than it does in the actual reality of our class warfare. You</p>
<p data-start="2502.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, I mean, there is no more classist organization, really, than airplanes. They really put it right up front, if you will, that there's a first class and then there's everybody fucking else.</p>
<p data-start="2518.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's a nice way of bringing it back home. I appreciate that. Shannon, does this moment teach you or tell you anything about Canadians' appetite for class-based politics, for how they see the working class, anything in this broader sort of vein? I'm not asking a specific question on purpose, but I want to kind of give you some runway, pun intended, to go where you need to. It's very</p>
<p data-start="2539.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> very nicely done. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2539.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, no, I'm very good at this. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2540.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, no, I'm very good at this. Yeah, I'm very</p>
<p data-start="2541.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Yeah, I'm very good at this. Flair Airlines should hire you as a cons person. They have.</p>
<p data-start="2546.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> They have. I don't know if you know this. We are a biggest line item for them.</p>
<p data-start="2546.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I don't know if you know</p>
<p data-start="2551.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> We've</p>
<p data-start="2551.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> We've actually taken over flight. We actually, they had flight attendants. I don't know if you know this. Now they have us.</p>
<p data-start="2557.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I think the danger for the left is, again, to my accusation of people being old-timey, uh is to go back to the 70s and uh think about this in terms of you know old-timey class uh politics or class solidarity uh this is always the danger for the left as we're living in the fucking past i i there is not to say that there aren't progressive arguments solutions uh and uh campaigns and you know that can meet this moment for people but it's not either anchored in someone else's experience, like let's say, I don't know, the mayor of fucking New York, you know, what has that got to do with what the politics in Brantford, Ontario, right? Or in Calgary, Alberta, or wherever else, the danger for the left is we look at, oh, there was success over here, or there was success in the past, right? So, you know, they're making mistakes of geography and, well, time and space, basically, is what they're doing. So that should not be the lesson that we take here. But the The lesson that we should take is that the economy is a lived experience, and it is a lived experience that is worsening for individuals who may not see themselves as part of a whole, but</p>
<p data-start="2572.4"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> politics or</p>
<p data-start="2631.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> they do see their pissed-off-edness as part of a broader social conversation in whatever realms of social media that they participate in.</p>
<p data-start="2641.9"><strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> that they participate in.</p>
<p data-start="2643.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And they consume their mainstream media information, which is really, really important and we should not overlook, right? Right. That's how we got the elbows up, you know, boomers. That's how we got like Carney raising his profile in like one quarter in early 2025 was via mainstream media. So we need to understand how people are receiving information from</p>
<p data-start="2665.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> from mainstream media into</p>
<p data-start="2666.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> into their corners of the Internet and how they're consuming that information. And that is a shared experience, right,</p>
<p data-start="2674.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> right, that doesn't necessarily fit neatly into the old categories of race or class or other identities. And that's the problem for the left as they see people consuming this information in really old-time kind of frame, right, old boxes. They don't. um</p>
<p data-start="2693.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> um they're seeing it through an individualized frame generally</p>
<p data-start="2697.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> generally uh and it's it's very like my experience of the economy the fact is that is a shared experience of shittiness for the like a good majority of people even middle-income people right and so what this did was it punched through to a shared experience like what do you mean i have to show up to work and i don't get paid for the first fucking 90 minutes that I'm there or more, right? That is bullshit.</p>
<p data-start="2707.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> majority of people even</p>
<p data-start="2720.6"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> That</p>
<p data-start="2720.6"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> That is bullshit.</p>
<p data-start="2721.0"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> bullshit.</p>
<p data-start="2721.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> bullshit.</p>
<p data-start="2721.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And, oh, that reminds me of the time that, you know, our boss tried to do X, Y, or Z that was kind of the same vibe, right?</p>
<p data-start="2727.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> right? But it's through the me. And that is the piece that the left has got to learn and leave aside its old framing around class.</p>
<p data-start="2740.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Follow-up question very quickly to both of you. Do Canadians have, in your mind, a</p>
<p data-start="2745.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> pretty Pretty good antenna for fairness. And do you feel like that was maybe at the heart of this, like both in the comms with the union, but also just overall, like Canadians don't look at this as, oh, I'm on side of the union this time and I'm not this time. It's just like, oh, just like quickly analyzing this in three seconds. Like that doesn't seem fair. Moving on, making a judgment. What do you think, Carter? That's</p>
<p data-start="2763.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's one of the poles of decision of values that I think really defines Canadians, their sense of fairness versus the United States where selfishness, I think, takes a little bit different view on fairness. What is fair for me is seen as more fair in the United States, whereas there is a definite fairness vibe in Canada. It's one of the polls that I try to work on as much as possible in politics. So I think that fairness versus unfair, absolutely Canadians have a strong sense of it. and a simple story of i don't get paid for 90 minutes of my work is a simple is a as an easy story uh to tell now air canada you know is in a tougher spot because they were they would have been in a spot where they were trying to communicate but we're we're trying to rectify that we've already promised that but um and and when you watch their press conference when they're trying to actually articulate that that was pretty horrible right like they their communication structures were um very</p>
<p data-start="2832.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> very bad so yeah i mean fairness i think is is a great pull um and i think the canadians do see themselves as fair but they see themselves as fair within their class structure</p>
<p data-start="2842.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> to the earlier point the</p>
<p data-start="2843.0"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> to the</p>
<p data-start="2844.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> the danger for unions and union comms that i've noticed over the years is that they'll they will because fairness does pull well to to carter's point and when you do you know focus groups when you do more qualitative research that'll pop out to you and so then they'll you you know, put out billboards or take out ads that are like, this is not fair. It sounds like fucking whining, right? And so you have to find a way that is more compelling for labor communicators, I think. And what this piece showed me is</p>
<p data-start="2872.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> is that they're figuring it out,</p>
<p data-start="2875.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> right? And when you move above kind of the sort of drumbeat of labor comms and into a really well-resourced campaign, you get what just happened with our Canada component, which is popping above just fairness, which is kind of a milquetoast argument, and into like somebody is getting something that I'm not getting and what is going on here, like raising the stakes a bit.</p>
<p data-start="2900.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Final question, bold</p>
<p data-start="2901.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> or risky for the Conservatives to take the position they did amidst this discussion, this conversation in the Canadian zeitgeist to back bargaining, to back the legal process, says to, of course, oppose what the back-to-work legislation was by this government. Carter,</p>
<p data-start="2920.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> you've explained why they've done it. Explain to me if it's bold or risky from a political calculus perspective.</p>
<p data-start="2927.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think it's neither bold nor risky. I think that they did it because they saw the opportunity to keep their foot on the throat of the NDP. The NDP was unable to take advantage of this situation. The conservatives jumped in. There was no conversation that It included the NDP as an entity in this overarching conversation. So it was neither bold nor risky. It was something that was calculated and efficient. It made sense for them to do so. So they opposed the government, as is their want as the opposition party.</p>
<p data-start="2963.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Shannon? I</p>
<p data-start="2965.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> can't decide. Because essentially what they've decided to do is basically lie to people And</p>
<p data-start="2967.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because</p>
<p data-start="2967.5"><strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> Because</p>
<p data-start="2973.0"><strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> so, yeah, yeah, we're</p>
<p data-start="2973.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> yeah, yeah, we're on the side of the workers like you bet your ass they probably would have, you know, legislated back to work. They love legislating back to work. It was their favorite thing to do in the Harper government. They did it within the first six months in 2011.</p>
<p data-start="2984.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> In the summer of, actually it was in the first month, I think.</p>
<p data-start="2988.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> By June, July, they were legislating back. I think it was Cup W at the time when</p>
<p data-start="2994.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> when they won their majority. look uh they've done a turn towards uh taking more um labor-friendly positions they've ditched all of their old like super anti-union you know like the union audit uh legislation commitment all of those kinds of stuff they've they've pulled all that from platform it was in fact it was one of their platform points we promise not to do that again uh</p>
<p data-start="3015.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> uh was one of the things they committed to in the last election um</p>
<p data-start="3018.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> um and</p>
<p data-start="3019.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and uh so i think it's really interesting that like i And I think it goes beyond trying to mow the NDP's lawn. That's actually stupid for them to do. They should be trying to fluff up the NDP's pillows at this point because it's one of the reasons why they didn't get as many</p>
<p data-start="3037.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> many seats as they wanted to was the collapse of the NDP. But I</p>
<p data-start="3040.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3041.0"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3041.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="3041.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I also I think what they're doing is cutting into liberal support as well, in particular in southwestern Ontario. And one of the reasons why that's smart is</p>
<p data-start="3055.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> is because we're going into really rough patches in</p>
<p data-start="3058.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> terms of layoffs and plant closures and other big, big challenges for private sector unionized workers in Ontario, in auto and steel and aluminum, and</p>
<p data-start="3070.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and not just in southwest Ontario, but there for sure. And</p>
<p data-start="3074.3"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And so this is them picking up support and shoring up some of the support that they won, like the Conservatives hold Windsor now extraordinarily.</p>
<p data-start="3083.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And so that's</p>
<p data-start="3085.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> that's what they're doing. I can't decide what it is, because they're most certainly lying there, you know, ever loving faces off of what they would do once they're in power. Look</p>
<p data-start="3097.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> at</p>
<p data-start="3097.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> at this. We started off with Carter not awake, and then we had a debate in between in which I think that might be a strategist record. I didn't speak for maybe 20 minutes. And I made up for it on the back end with my extremely long questions. We are going to leave it there. That's a wrap on episode 1881 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velgey. With me, as always, Shannon Philips, Stephen Carter. We shall see you next time.</p>
