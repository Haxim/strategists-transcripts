  <div class="said">But Carter, where do we want to start with this story? Because we&#x27;ve got the actual action. We&#x27;ve got the staffers in the bar. We&#x27;ve got the war room pushing it. And then we&#x27;ve got the future aspect of Carney having to burn a day. And then we&#x27;ve got the broader strategy question, which is how do you clean up a mess like this? How would Stephen Carter clean up a mess if this article came out on a Sunday morning for you? So where do you want to tackle it? And then I&#x27;ll kind of process the other elements of it thereafter.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

  <div class="said">I think we should start in the war room. I mean, I mean, that&#x27;s obviously where the idea started, right? You know, you and I are sitting around a war room, and we&#x27;re thinking to ourselves, how would we cause difficulties? And we come up with the idea that we&#x27;re going to make some buttons. And we&#x27;re going to put the buttons. I mean, this is after sweatshirts and hats basically saying, do you believe the polls have come out, and it&#x27;s caused trouble on the Polyev campaign.</div>

And the liberal geniuses decide that what they&#x27;re going to do is try and ramp that up by producing buttons that are going to go into this Manning Center conference.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">um you and i are on the same page so i&#x27;m gonna ask ask a bigger question to you perhaps say something blasphemous from a campaign org perspective war actually i&#x27;m gonna say the war rooms at the very least are structured wrong and war rooms are probably doing more harm than good today on campaigns fight me on this no i can&#x27;t i&#x27;ve been i&#x27;ve seen maybe three to four war rooms of some of the fucking smartest campaign people ever that have either throttled way too hard on the aggressive so as the propositional message has not been able to get through and we&#x27;ve suffered as a result um and not by any sort of like they&#x27;re just doing their gig and or and this i put this in the second category they&#x27;re doing stuff that&#x27;s so inside baseball that the rapid response is so like it&#x27;s so online it&#x27;s so of a moment that most of the public hasn&#x27;t actually understood what they&#x27;re doing that they they overcompensate to the point that that they look like the assholes rather than the react they look like react the rather than the reactionary so my statement to you is i think at the very least we&#x27;re structuring war rooms incorrectly either with the wrong type of male bravado energy bullshit which you can argue on i think part of it is that</div>

And the second half of the war room is just going to be handed over to the strategic types, right? Which is the rapid response making, you know, not rapid response to media, but making sure that, you know, the strategic decisions that are unfolding in front of you, the operational and tactical decisions that may have strategic implications. patience those decisions are being made by the top echelon of the campaign because they got to be doing something right like this is this this war room um has</div>

But then you respond to that with your own version of it. Or Andrew Scheer does, in my opinion, a cringeworthy ad about getting back with your ex at a bar having a beer, and you do your clapback version. Funny, cheeky, and maybe that&#x27;s not a great example of the point I&#x27;m trying to make, but they&#x27;re responding to everything. These accounts are so good. These people are so nimble. They&#x27;re so online. line they&#x27;re so so gen z they&#x27;re so with it that at some point that upside of being like everything the other side puts out we squash back may have a cost to it and i and i&#x27;m not saying the button idea is a direct linkage to this but i think it comes from that culture of like oh yeah like they&#x27;re actually like the people have shirt sweatshirts that are doing this and then this is going on and yes that&#x27;s a media story but it&#x27;s not something that people have already heard There&#x27;s not enough soak time. There&#x27;s still more runway available for people to see the conservatives torturing themselves. There&#x27;s days left on that story because it hasn&#x27;t gotten to the normal person.

Do you feel like we&#x27;re in a campaign world, Carter, that that matters anymore, how the story comes out? Because there could also be a case around how modern day campaign media relations has done, especially from the oppo side, which is, do you feel like we&#x27;re in a new reality where I could just put this story out myself with my partisan tinge, and it might have just as much mileage as a long, lengthy investigative piece put out by the CBC or Global News, for example?</div>

I&#x27;m going to throw out a statement to you. Monday, Tuesday, if the trend that Ipsos and, I believe, Abacus, don&#x27;t quote me on this, are reporting that the polls are tightening a bit, that that eight-point lead is turning into five, four, three, right? Let&#x27;s say that replicates a few other polls that come onto our desks in the next 48 hours. Here&#x27;s my strategic statement for you to agree or disagree with. The liberals are not all that freaked out.</div>

They might take that trade with the devil.

There is moral victory for the NDP, should you want it, in terms of preventing Pierre Paulier from forming government by their, you know, historic lows. But, but, but, Jagmeet almost acknowledged on Friday that they&#x27;re not going to form government, that when you elect a lot of us, good shit gets done. and there&#x27;s two ways of reading that that it&#x27;s another frame it&#x27;s another frame at saying the same thing yeah right the other way to read it is we</div>

That part, the crucial part that we&#x27;re not going to form government, that when you elect a lot of us, when you elect some of us, good things get done, almost gives liberals permission. It almost gives folks permission to vote for the liberals, especially in ridings that that&#x27;s going to matter.
