      <p data-start="3.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> This is a strategist episode 1891. My name is Zain Velji. With me as always, Shannon Phillips and two-time Reed Award winner Stephen Carter. You</p>
<p data-start="12.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> can see them in the background.</p>
<p data-start="14.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> You know how many I have?</p>
<p data-start="14.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> how many I have?</p>
<p data-start="15.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Five. Zero.</p>
<p data-start="16.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> You're a liar.</p>
<p data-start="17.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Come</p>
<p data-start="17.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Come to my house.</p>
<p data-start="18.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> house. I have five.</p>
<p data-start="19.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> You have five Reed Awards? I do.</p>
<p data-start="21.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I do.</p>
<p data-start="21.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> do. I</p>
<p data-start="21.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't</p>
<p data-start="21.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> I don't like to brag, but I just saw it off your shoulder and I thought I'd let you know. I've got three more. I think after 10, I can trade one for a daytime Emmy.</p>
<p data-start="29.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think so. I think so. I mean, right now, we should put ours together and maybe we can get a daytime Emmy. Shannon, you know what a read award is?</p>
<p data-start="33.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> we can get a daytime Emmy. Shannon, you know what a read award is? It's a pay-to-play political campaign award, where if you pay a fee, more than likely you're a finalist, and one in three chance you're going to win the award.</p>
<p data-start="38.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> pay a</p>
<p data-start="42.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> In fact, you're probably going to win the award if</p>
<p data-start="46.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you put the money in.</p>
<p data-start="48.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> But you know what? Like all things, they cost money.</p>
<p data-start="51.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, it's America. You know what else costs money, Zane?</p>
<p data-start="51.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, it's America. You know what else costs</p>
<p data-start="55.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> This show. This show costs money. It's good.</p>
<p data-start="57.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> good. So that's why our patrons have</p>
<p data-start="58.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> So that's why our patrons have been fantastic. I love our patrons, except when it comes to the live show. you</p>
<p data-start="65.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know what they'd rather do is they'd twiddle their dicks on discord</p>
<p data-start="69.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="69.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm convinced they're not actually even on discord I think the group of people on discord aren't even patrons I've been going through the lists I've had some extra time on my hands are you going to ice purge people I've</p>
<p data-start="81.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> you going to</p>
<p data-start="81.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> to</p>
<p data-start="81.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> ice purge people I've</p>
<p data-start="82.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I've</p>
<p data-start="82.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> I've</p>
<p data-start="82.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I've gone through the lists I'm going to just ice level purge these guys unless they buy more tickets to the live show my thinking is is if i'm busy on the live show can't do an ice level purge right can't purge everybody on the discord so our</p>
<p data-start="82.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> I've gone through the lists</p>
<p data-start="84.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> I'm going to just ice</p>
<p data-start="90.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> more tickets</p>
<p data-start="90.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> tickets</p>
<p data-start="90.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> tickets</p>
<p data-start="97.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> can't purge everybody</p>
<p data-start="101.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> patrons need to step it up buy more tickets especially the vip tickets because that's where we're making some money buy more or buy any tickets buy</p>
<p data-start="109.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> buy any really i mean there was a there was a moment where uh we sold a lot of tickets at the beginning yeah and then uh cory is is saying it's because he's not going to be there but i have it on high authority that he's He's been invited.</p>
<p data-start="110.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> mean there was a there</p>
<p data-start="115.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="115.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="115.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> and then</p>
<p data-start="124.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> The show is next Wednesday.</p>
<p data-start="124.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> The show is next Wednesday. Let's get some of the details. This is what Shannon is good at. She's the details person. You want to do the details? She also doesn't like my description of our patrons' extracurricular activities, but that's a different point. No, I do not. It's next Wednesday, November 12th, Knox United Church, 730. Shannon, you had a great nickname for Mr. Scaldy here.</p>
<p data-start="127.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> She's the details person. You want to do the details? She also doesn't like</p>
<p data-start="133.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I do not. It's</p>
<p data-start="134.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> It's next</p>
<p data-start="141.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Well, I mean, Carter</p>
<p data-start="142.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Carter is rightfully</p>
<p data-start="144.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> scolding our itinerant Patreon subscribers who have not yet bought tickets. Those of you who have bought tickets, we will uphold your honor for the rest of time, or at least the next live show. But those of you who have not, come</p>
<p data-start="144.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> scolding</p>
<p data-start="145.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> scolding</p>
<p data-start="145.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> scolding our</p>
<p data-start="162.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> come on. And so I was calling, I was saying to Carter, you know, it's time for Scoldy. It's time for Scoldy Han to come out and start yelling at people. I mean, really, Patreon subscribers. Like, we do appreciate that you are not the itinerant losers that the people who don't subscribe to this show clearly are.</p>
<p data-start="169.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> to come out and start yelling</p>
<p data-start="181.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> We appreciate that. But</p>
<p data-start="181.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> We appreciate that.</p>
<p data-start="183.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> But there's one more step we've got to take here. And that is to come to the live show on Wednesday, November</p>
<p data-start="187.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> on Wednesday,</p>
<p data-start="189.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> 12th at</p>
<p data-start="190.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Knox United at</p>
<p data-start="192.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> at 6.30 for the VIP, which we would prefer. 6.30 for</p>
<p data-start="194.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> prefer. 6.30 for the VIP. That's true. And 7.30</p>
<p data-start="195.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> And 7.30 for the main show. But we know that the Patreon people are probably not going to settle for</p>
<p data-start="203.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> for the 7.30 Normie show. they're going to want to come and actually talk to us at 6.30 and participate in the full funeral experience for the Calgary Party.</p>
<p data-start="213.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, I forgot about that. Yes, it's a full funeral experience. And the B-side of the show is where I read every single Patreon subscriber's name.</p>

Do you want to explain this to me for half a second?</p>
<p data-start="266.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> There's not much in the way of economics, but what he did in this particular case.</p>
<p data-start="272.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Carter is like Trudeau. He doesn't spend his time thinking about monetary policy. But it</p>
<p data-start="272.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> like Trudeau. He</p>
<p data-start="276.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> But it takes</p>

<p data-start="277.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> takes care</p>
<p data-start="277.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> care of itself. Or</p>
<p data-start="277.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> care of</p>
<p data-start="277.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> of itself.</p>
<p data-start="277.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> itself.</p>
<p data-start="277.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> itself. Or monetary things. Let's talk about things Carter's spending. So here's</p>
<p data-start="278.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Or monetary</p>
<p data-start="278.8"><strong>Shannon:</strong> monetary</p>
<p data-start="279.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> monetary things.</p>
<p data-start="282.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> spending. So here's what I did. I</p>
<p data-start="284.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> went through with Annalise. We went through the venue and we came up with all the different things we could do.</p>
<p data-start="289.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I just paid for them.</p>
<p data-start="291.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> So everything is paid for. No, that's okay.</p>
<p data-start="294.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> okay. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="294.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p data-start="294.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Okay.</p>
<p data-start="295.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Sounds</p>
<p data-start="295.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Sounds like the Tim Carmel campaign really kind of summed up.</p>
<p data-start="295.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Sounds like the</p>
<p data-start="296.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> the Tim Carmel campaign</p>
<p data-start="304.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> was hurtful. We should just end it there. That's perfect. That was hurtful. Can</p>
<p data-start="304.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> hurtful. We should just end it there.</p>
<p data-start="309.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> we do a show now? Can</p>
<p data-start="310.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Can we just do a show? What's the</p>
<p data-start="310.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Can we just do a show? What's the show?</p>
<p data-start="313.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> The whole show? I attended</p>
<p data-start="313.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> whole show? I attended the show, and</p>
<p data-start="315.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> and it was glorious.</p>
<p data-start="317.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Fan-fucking-tastic.</p>
<p data-start="318.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Speaking of fan-fucking-tastic, this is actually good in the way of transition material. Fine, fabulous, or fucked, it is an oldie but a goodie, and for the patrons they love this format as it relates to being able to dissect shit that has gone on there's a few things of note we'll see how many weight make through through the list i want to i want to mainly talk budget and floor crossers so stephen carter let me start here i'll let you guys go wherever you really want on this and we'll take the conversation uh we'll kind of like move it on as it as it dries up fine fabulous for fuck the budget for the liberals as the last 48 hours have gone you and i have talked historically on this podcast and in other places that the budget is a communications exercise um fine fabulous or fucked for the liberals 48 hours into their budget i</p>
<p data-start="339.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> carter let me</p>
<p data-start="363.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> i think it's fine i think that people are uh you know not blown away by it i think that people are saying you know this is this is different than what we were expecting but i don't think that we're seeing a massive uptick of anger i don't think you know the 78 billion dollar deficit Corey and I have talked ad nauseum about how people don't care about deficit. They like to pretend that they care about deficits, but they really don't. As long as they're getting their stuff, they're happy. And right now, they're going to get more stuff. There's stuff coming down the pipe. And I like the shift from operating to capital. I think that that is a strong maneuver by Carney and Champagne. And I think that overall, people are going to be very happy with this budget. um even</p>
<p data-start="408.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> even even the opposition parties don't seem to want to make it go away they just want to uh do the regular level of rabble rousing without any any real significance i think it's a absolutely fine document</p>
<p data-start="421.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> shannon do you agree on the fine fabulous or fox scale of of this budget for the liberals well</p>
<p data-start="427.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> i think it's fine from a macroeconomic perspective because it's a macro economic document it was written by a macroeconomist uh and it shows um but politics happens in the the micro uh so it's fine asterisk right it is if you and even if you're a leftist and you are looking for good solid industrial policy you will find it in this document if</p>
<p data-start="432.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> by a macroeconomist</p>
<p data-start="434.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> and it shows</p>
<p data-start="448.2"><strong>Shannon:</strong> if you are looking for leaving social policy kind of where it was at there's going to be some some reductions in grants and contributions for a number of organizations fine whatever right well not fine whatever but there there will be politics to be done but that is not gone</p>
<p data-start="448.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> looking for leaving</p>
<p data-start="459.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> but that is not gone for example but no none</p>
<p data-start="461.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> example but no none of the transfers to to provinces or individuals have been touched uh and so therefore Therefore, most of the things that affect me most, that is to say the things that land in my bank account once a month, those things are still there.</p>
<p data-start="461.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> of the transfers</p>
<p data-start="462.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> to to</p>
<p data-start="476.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> Now, there is lots of, depending on what happens with the public sector employment</p>
<p data-start="482.4"><strong>Shannon:</strong> employment losses, you</p>
<p data-start="485.6"><strong>Shannon:</strong> you might see some reductions in services. Certainly the New Democrats and the Public Service Alliance are going to claim that. I'm going to take them at their word on that. But right now, the micro is that I have status quo on all of my transfer programs. And I, you know, despite the fact that the government has not taken a victory lap on it, I'm getting a two income family, I'm going to get an $800 a year tax cut, which</p>
<p data-start="507.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> which is not I mean, it's a huge fiscal lift for the for these guys. um but</p>
<p data-start="513.9"><strong>Shannon:</strong> but uh other than that i'm seeing status quo in my micro which is kind of the problem right if everything goes to shit in the economy uh</p>
<p data-start="522.1"><strong>Shannon:</strong> uh there's nothing really in this document as contingency i think you're going to see um carney kind of govern uh uh sort of off the side of his desk if there is uh uh like a a really big economic crisis because he can right but uh we're not seeing a lot of the the signals on you know ei reform and those kinds of things but what what you are seeing is sectoral supports to the economy you are seeing uh you know obviously a major uh focus on infrastructure defense things that put people to work you've seen language in there around unionized labor so if you're a building trades member uh today or yesterday you're pretty happy with this document because the first time the government of canada has really embedded that beyond the you know some of the boutique ways that christian freeland tried to So that's really good. But there's huge planks</p>
<p data-start="542.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> but what what you are</p>
<p data-start="576.7"><strong>Shannon:</strong> of this that they've just left, right,</p>
<p data-start="580.5"><strong>Shannon:</strong> in their voting coalition. A lot of progressives stampeded to vote for them. At least two of them are probably on this podcast. And yet, they're jettisoning some of those progressive bona fides that A, got them elected and B,</p>
<p data-start="597.0"><strong>Shannon:</strong> are part of their internal coalition</p>
