  </div>
  <div class="said">swanson tv dinner was a delicacy uh from the south asian community we would only see that as as a climb up the ranks i know you guys were enjoying middling poverty with your swanson dinners but that was actually a high watermark for us uh</div>

  <div class="said">also was a high watermark being able to drink cans of something we would always have bottles more efficient more economical corey here just flexing a can that&#x27;s not what we do in the northeast corey it&#x27;s all about i want you to i want you to get your your your sparkling water from a bottle like a four liter bottle not like like a 750 milliliter glass bottle hey</div>

    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">1:36</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">the clock right you you&#x27;re going i stopped the clock because i had things to say now i had social commentary to make and sharp social commentary here&#x27;s what i want to do there&#x27;s so much going on i want to go through three topics uh for 12 minutes each i&#x27;m going to to put you on the clock, and then we&#x27;re going to spend the final 12 minutes with a topic of your choice. It could be a net new topic we haven&#x27;t discussed, or if we want to spend 12 more minutes on one of the three we have, we&#x27;re going to do it, and we&#x27;re going to start right now. Carter, 12 minutes have begun, and we&#x27;re going to start in British Columbia.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="132">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">2:12</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Echoes of 2017, in a sense, it is 46-45-2, 46 for the NDP, 45 for John Rusted, 2 for the Greens, Carter, what happens? Give us a sense of what happens.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="147">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">2:27</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, I think that the recount and the final count is on the 26th of October. That&#x27;s going to be the day when the 49,000 additional ballots get put into play and we see whether or not anything changes. I saw today an analysis that showed that most of the time the NDP does quite quite well on these, on these mail-in ballots and the like. So I would imagine that we will be seeing a very tight NDP government that is held together by the Greens. I don&#x27;t see them picking up another seat. I don&#x27;t see it becoming a majority, but I do think that they will, they&#x27;ll have the Greens as the, always there, always there to be supportive. Because I can&#x27;t see the greens supporting the conservatives that to me would be um</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="195">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">3:15</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">too far it would turn them from green to blue and uh no one wants that and no</div>
</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">3:20</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">one could you see the green supporting the conservatives or are you also with carter on this and what happens</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="205">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">3:25</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">it&#x27;s pretty tough to imagine the greens supporting the conservatives when the conservatives this particular bc conservative party seems to be so afield of where um you know of where the greens are on on their fundamental issue that being the climate right yeah of course but stranger things have happened and politics make strange bedfellows i i think it&#x27;s unlikely i think it might even be unlikely that there is a really solid confidence and supply agreement just given the composition of things it might just be issue to issue and and writing this thing down to the wire or at least that being the drama but behind the scenes of being managed a bit more i mean everything steven said is is correct in the the sense that it is most likely</div>
</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="252">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">4:12</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">It is most likely to be the NDP who either hold their seats, well, hold their seats. He&#x27;s also right that there&#x27;s not really any in play for them. There&#x27;s a couple that they lead by just a couple dozen votes that they could conceivably lose, but the</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="267">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">4:27</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">evidence suggests that they won&#x27;t just based on how these polls have gone, these recounts have gone, these additional votes have come in for the ndp generally in the past but there&#x27;s a big but here stephen carter did predict the ndp would win and um also i think he does owe an apology to the people of bc because he said it would be like 10 seats i seem to recall no</div>
</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">4:58</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">yeah i feel like i feel like it It was double digits. And even if it wasn&#x27;t, it was. It was. So, honestly, it was.</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:08</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah, no. We&#x27;ve got nine minutes on the clock. Corey, I get it. We will draw your point to this natural conclusion, unless you had some blinding insight that you wanted to. No, I just wanted to repeat it. Okay, thanks for running out</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:18</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yeah, no, fuck you. Here&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do. Corey, what are the NDP thinking about right now? And what are they strategically devising, if anything, in this interim period? Carter, same question to you in a second about what&#x27;s going on in conservative land right now from your perspective or what they should be thinking about. Corey?</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="336">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">5:36</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, I think both parties probably read things as we&#x27;ve laid them out that it&#x27;s likely to be an NDP government, likely to be a minority government propped up by the Greens, but also likely they&#x27;ll be back at the polls before you know it because this will be a largely unstable situation for a ton of reasons. reasons and that means they are already thinking about the next election and if they&#x27;re not they&#x27;re fools and i don&#x27;t think either of the parties are fools i i think the two major parties are are starting to think okay how do we position how do we make sure we move forward and how do we make sure we&#x27;re election ready which also includes mundane things like money which i&#x27;m told are the currency of politics so it is it&#x27;s true i do believe that&#x27;s likely how things are going to play I&#x27;ll tell you this, even if by some sort of crazy miracle, the BC Conservatives managed to flip these two seats that are in play here, right? The one in Syria.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="392">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">6:32</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">It&#x27;s not a stable situation. They&#x27;ll have like a one seat majority. And we&#x27;ve seen how that plays out. Again, BC in 2017 gives us some</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="401">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">6:41</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">What happened to the speaker here? here explain to our listeners what happens i don&#x27;t want to go like</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="406">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">6:46</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">run the tape but like that&#x27;s just like there&#x27;s so much that&#x27;s been discussed about it but like it is a challenge because if the speaker come like if the speaker comes from the conservative ranks they basically don&#x27;t really have a majority except they do because they will have enough seats with the speaker to pass confidence votes because the speaker votes with them for confidence but the speaker votes against them for non-confidence because the speaker votes for the status quo in all other situations. I don&#x27;t want to live this again. We might all have to live this again. But it&#x27;s just like the most tedious pain in the ass existence for political parties. So this is where I say deeply unstable, because it also gives this untested conservative caucus, this untested conservative party, it gives every fucking member a veto on the government existing. And just look south of</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="454">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">7:34</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">the border. It&#x27;s like the Matt Gaetz situation. Yes</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="456">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
    <span class="ts">7:36</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">it is. And so I look south of the border and see exactly what that kind of hostage taking could lead to. So there&#x27;s going to be an election in the next year, I think, regardless. Maybe they can ride it out for two if the Greens are willing to play ball and sign some sort of a support agreement. But I truly cannot see it going much further than that.</div>

  <div class="said">Carter, what&#x27;s happening in conservative land? And are the knives out for Rustead? Or are they putting up banners to celebrate his accomplishment?</div>

<div class="turn" data-start="483">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">8:03</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">I think they&#x27;re probably putting up banners. I I mean, the knives coming out for a person who looks like he&#x27;s going to be able to win the next election that&#x27;s going to happen in the next two years because Corey Hogan said so, that&#x27;s probably going to be enough. I think that Corey&#x27;s right. You know, the challenges of, you know, how the speaker gets selected, how all these ins and outs and the workings of government, I think are going to be very tedious for British Columbians. I don&#x27;t think that they&#x27;re going to be looking for this government to fall and to go back and have another election. I think the leader that&#x27;s probably in the most hurt right now is David Eby, not John Rustad. I think that David Eby is the one who couldn&#x27;t lead a majority government back to a majority. And that is a failing on his part. And if he doesn&#x27;t come up with a way to create a stable government, what I would be doing, The earlier question you asked is, what would he be doing? Well, I&#x27;d be looking to see if there&#x27;s any way of prying a Green Party member from the Green Party into the New Democrats for a cabinet seat. Those would be the two phone calls I&#x27;d be making. Because one move and all of a sudden you&#x27;ve got yourself a much more stable government for the low, low price of the Minister of Sport.</div>

It&#x27;s not that hard for them to bring down the NDP, but it&#x27;s hard for them to prop up the conservatives. And going back to the polls, again, money is the currency of politics, I&#x27;m told. I don&#x27;t think that the Greens are prepared to run another election at this particular moment, especially- Without a leader. Well, they have a leader. They may keep her. She&#x27;s not in the legislature. Yeah, I mean, it&#x27;s a challenging situation for them. And I think that&#x27;s just the reality. We did talk last time about Rustad maybe being replaced if he loses because of this one and done. I think the composition of the legislature here, the composition makes that almost</div>

This is one of those situations where the group of people who are in power isn&#x27;t necessarily the majority. It tends to be the group of people who are holding the sway. And, um, if I was a pissed off NDP or I might step out and, uh, and jump into a green caucus that, that I can make, you know, maybe become leader of, um, there&#x27;s all kinds of different things that there could be a play. I suspect though, what&#x27;s going to happen is the most boring route. Um, David Eby is going to form a cabinet. It&#x27;s going to be a relatively strong, uh, government and it will do what it does. Um, and it will try and win Surrey and Richmond back.</div>

  <div class="said">back in the day. Yeah. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m close enough to the ground to have personal thoughts, but I&#x27;ll share a thought that was given to me by an NDP organizer that I was talking to after the election. And they said, Christ, I don&#x27;t know how we became a party of rich white people, right? And there is this sense that perhaps the NDP&#x27;s base has fundamentally shifted away from that working class, ethnically diverse core. Multiracial. Exactly. Even what you would imagine even in a US Democrat setting. Listen, BC is a quirky place and BC has got a lot of trust fund kids, but I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s a rock on which you want to build your government. It is something that I think that the BC NDP do need to think about pretty hard over the next bit. They need to have a broader base than they had. this is like this shouldn&#x27;t have been that close i mean everybody&#x27;s going to be saying that and it feels painfully obvious but there was there was a lot of baggage with rustad this was a new party that didn&#x27;t exist with rustad and the bc conservatives and if the bc ndp pull it off which it looks like they will it&#x27;ll be by the skin of their teeth and there&#x27;s a certain exhaustion that comes with being in government for a while got it sure but i wouldn&#x27;t want to be sitting there if i were them in 10 years and say jesus the warning signs were all there in 2024 and we did nothing about it and so i do think that one of the things they&#x27;re going to need to work on over that next year two years is shoring up expanding out coalitions</div>

And then also ministers coming out from the Trudeau government calling this everything from garbage, this revolt we&#x27;re talking about, the 30-ish MPs in the open letter calling this garbage all the way to recently hearing François-Philippe Champagne calling it something like, well, you know, they may have legitimate concerns. concerns wide variety of responses from cabinet ministers although most i would say gravitating towards the shut the fuck up this is like this is our guy carter</div>

We&#x27;ve got a group of people who seem to have held together in the face of ministers saying that it&#x27;s garbage, in the face of ministers not jumping on board. This is a group that may fall apart before tomorrow morning&#x27;s caucus meeting i mean we don&#x27;t know because you know we&#x27;re not in the room we don&#x27;t get to see how these things unfold but um all it takes is one or two people to start to fold and the whole thing folds like a cheap pup tent so i&#x27;m anticipating uh if it doesn&#x27;t fold then uh if the if this actually does go forward um there has to be consequences right like i think that this is the challenge for Prime Minister Trudeau. Prime Minister Trudeau is either going to need to step away, or he&#x27;s going to need to think of some sort of consequence that doesn&#x27;t cost him his government.</div>

We also know that you&#x27;ve also had an additional dynamic added, which is the alternatives have presented themselves, whether strategically or opportunistically. Right? Right. So the Christy Clarks and now the Mark Carney&#x27;s once again, the Carney clock, you know, he shows up every every six months and he&#x27;s back again to kind of say, you know, I&#x27;d be interested.</div>

That&#x27;s almost impossible. And I think if it spills out into the public of at a caucus meeting, one in four caucus members effectively, more than that when you consider the ones that are not in cabinet, had problems, that&#x27;s got some stopping power. That could significantly change Canadian politics in ways that I think we might have trouble processing right now. i mean us i mean the caucus i mean people are just too close to politics because it&#x27;s pretty significant and i think we dismiss its significance at our peril i think the prime minister dismisses the significance at his peril so</div>

I think that that type of harsh pushback could be too much. I think you need to stomp it down, but not stomp it down so hard that you break things. This is a small caucus. It is going to be really difficult to walk that line, but he&#x27;s going to have to find a way to stay in his position, if that&#x27;s what he ultimately chooses to do, without causing bodies to fall.

  <div class="said">there&#x27;s maybe softer ways you can do this but let me just say this right i feel like the prime minister has the numbers just based on the reporting like if we&#x27;re going to do just a straight up vote of the of the liberal caucus if i were him i would be another way you could fuck this up i guess a way to answer your question is by letting the conversation and the debate and the acrimony become so poisonous and so brutal that you&#x27;re um you lose even when you win so i think that perhaps what he needs to do what he should be considering what his team should be considering you know what i think would be a bit of an interesting power move i want to test this on you too everybody walks into the national caucus meeting there&#x27;s that silence there&#x27;s that tense conversation you know the muttering oh what the hell&#x27;s gonna happen it&#x27;s gonna be an interesting conversation oh what do you think&#x27;s gonna go on here oh blah blah blah uh there&#x27;s a couple of staff in the room who would naturally be there to support everybody knows they&#x27;ll be kicked out for the in-camera discussion prime minister opens the meeting or caucus chair opens i don&#x27;t know how they actually run it but then he says okay we&#x27;re gonna have a vote and he gives them the ballot right away should the prime should i reside none of the conversation has happened No chance of the poison.

But she seems to be stuck on a couple of things. Perhaps, Carter, we may look back on botching a question when she was asked around how her presidency is going to be different than Joe Biden&#x27;s. She&#x27;s tried to clean that up in the days after, but her answer during the moment was not much different, which is not a great answer. Many ways to answer that. That&#x27;s how she chose to answer it. I&#x27;m paraphrasing, of course. And then you have Donald Trump doing Donald Trump things and not necessarily being held accountable for them because they&#x27;re so voluminous. They&#x27;re so all over the place. And you, of course, have the added dynamic on the Kamala Harris side, Carter. I&#x27;m just throwing just a few things on the list of the Michigan politics with the Arab Muslim population. We had another sort of chapter written today by kicking out some Palestinian Americans from a rally. Carter, this is even. No one is willing to predict this unless you&#x27;re on Polymarket now, which is now a right-wing cesspool of people throwing their money in the shitter.</div>

So the vibes is for me, I think the most interesting story, because anything else is arguing about one point in polling, which is like nothing. It means nothing. There&#x27;s no way you can say with accuracy that that one point is real or not when you&#x27;re looking at the national polls. And the swing state polls in a lot of cases are not better. Like you look at it and it&#x27;s like, oh, look at the average. North Carolina, less than one point lead for Harris. Georgia, Georgia, less than one point lead for Trump. Arizona, less than one point lead for Harris. They&#x27;re so fucking close, I guess is my point. We can dissect it and we can pretend it&#x27;s meaningful, but it&#x27;s not.

I think a strong ground game, uh, in, in swing States and in swing, um, districts, uh, all of a a sudden can really change the outcome. We&#x27;ve seen strong ground game here in Canada versus weak ground game. Now, we&#x27;ve also seen what a tsunami looks like. And the thing that I think that Harris and Trump will both concede is that there&#x27;s no tsunami coming here. This is not going to be a giant wave that takes out Trump or a giant wave that takes out Harris. This is in fact going going to be a battle of attrition and it&#x27;s going to be super duper close.

If Trump or Harris can take all of Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, right, like Georgia, Arizona, if they can take all of them, for example, the vast majority of them kind of appears as an electoral college wave. So I&#x27;m not trying to undercut your point, but I wanted to insert that, that this this does have like a one point tilt you know we&#x27;re no longer talking about electoral votes exactly we&#x27;re looking at like 335 or three whatever that number is</div>
