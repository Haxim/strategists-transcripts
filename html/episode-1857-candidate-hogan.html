That you&#x27;ve just automatically gotten knighted as part of your candidate package? it was Sir Thomas Keeper, and now it&#x27;s Sir Corey Hogan. Is that how it is? Yeah, that&#x27;s exactly right. Are they going to keep his knighthood?</div>

  <div class="said">Hey, as a new candidate, is the previous candidate going to have his knighthood kept? I&#x27;m going to have to check with the party office on that. That&#x27;s my answer, by the way. Such a mania, Carter. That&#x27;s my answer to every question going forward. sicken me. What a step down.</div>

  <div class="said">By the way, do you want to confirm or deny that you are the candidate right now? No, I don&#x27;t to do that. Put it unequivocal terms for the people. Because I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a good 50%. It&#x27;s down the middle that don&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re the candidate. So, Corey, I&#x27;ll give you this opportunity right now. This is Corey Hogan, Liberal Party of Canada, candidate for Calgary Confederation, telling you that he is indeed that. Go ahead, Corey. it&#x27;s been reported I&#x27;m the candidate.</div>

  <div class="said">to me, Carter. I feel like I&#x27;m sold. Yeah. On April 1st. that&#x27;s pretty good. On April 1st. That&#x27;s pretty good. I thought that&#x27;s how you create a buzz. You know, you create a little excitement. I think that the launch, like the press release also referencing how I won an Irish stew competition. Yeah. Maybe people had some questions.</div>

    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">2:13</span>

  <div class="said">Carter, let&#x27;s jump right into strategy mode. How would you go after Corey&#x27;s late launch here? Irish stew? How would you undercut the fact that Corey Hogan is the Liberal Party candidate in Confederation? Go ahead. Yeah. As a good friend and personal advisor to Corey, can you broadcast how you would actually undermine his campaign and go?</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">Well, I think that the actual answer was you got to focus on the candidate, right? Like, you know, candidate strengths and weaknesses ultimately matter a lot in politics. And this is where, you know, Corey&#x27;s probably pulling, what, 20, 25 points behind Mark Carney right now. So focus on focus on the fact that, you know, Corey Hogan is running. I mean</div>

Carter, this is what I should have done years ago. I limited my career. Yeah, Zane&#x27;s basically joke aggregator. So I guess this is a breakup episode with Carter, right, Corey? Is that where this is going? Am I out? Is that what happened? No, no, no, you&#x27;re the only one that&#x27;s in. Oh, I&#x27;m the only one left. It&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s us.</div>

  </div>
  <div class="said">here because i think there&#x27;s people that that are still i think we&#x27;ve reduced the number i think at the end of this episode our core objective is to convince a hundred percent of listeners you are indeed the candidate now i think your statement helped but don&#x27;t think it went all the way yeah do you want to actually tell us more to this fiction uh to give us a sense of why you&#x27;re the candidate yeah</div>

  <div class="said">yeah i mean so on friday i got a call that the candidate that did exist in calgary confederation was going to be leaving that post and that that was going to be happening pretty soon and then i was asked you you know can i put your stuff forward to be a candidate for calgary confederation and i you know talked to my wife about it and thought yeah i mean look let&#x27;s even step back from there i think like most canadians have been pretty pissed off about everything donald trump&#x27;s been doing what&#x27;s been going on in the united states the americanization of our politics all of that and in january it kind of came to a head like we&#x27;ve got this lunatic down south calling us the 51st state we&#x27;ve got these tariffs looming uh we&#x27;ve got trouble going on with russia like the world is just such a crazy dangerous place and it just felt like something had to give right and who knew that all we uh all we really needed was a central banker but that you know mark carney really changed the game in the conversation and so it started thinking in probably february march like well is there other ways i can be helpful so when the call came i took the call you know i i thought that&#x27;s interesting talk to my wife and uh and it&#x27;s been kind of whirlwind since friday if i&#x27;m going to be totally honest like i uh</div>
