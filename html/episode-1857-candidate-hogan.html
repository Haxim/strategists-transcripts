<p data-start="5.9"><strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> a show that we recommend.</p>
<p data-start="10.1"><strong>SPEAKER_00:</strong> I'm Terry Hart, and this is The Heart of It All, a podcast about navigating the messy, beautiful, complicated realities of caregiving for our aging loved ones. Every week, I sit down with experts, caregivers, and families to talk honestly about what it means to support an aging parent. If you're a caregiver or you want to know what to expect when you inevitably become one, you're in the right place. The heart of it all. That's heart spelled H-A-R-T. New episodes every week wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

<p data-start="64.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Candidate</p>
<p data-start="64.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Candidate</p>
<p data-start="64.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Candidate Hogan. Do we refer</p>
<p data-start="65.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Hogan. Do we refer to him as the Corey Hogan now? Like, what's the deal? Like, sir? Do we have to go with sir? Oh,</p>
<p data-start="70.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, sir. Have you been knighted? Is that how much the Liberal Party has access? That you've just automatically gotten knighted as part of your candidacy package? Oh,</p>
<p data-start="77.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> part of your candidacy package? Oh,</p>
<p data-start="80.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, so it</p>
<p data-start="80.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> so it was Sir Thomas Keeper, now it's Sir Corey Hogan. Is that how it is?</p>
<p data-start="86.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, that's exactly right. Are they going to keep his knighthood?</p>
<p data-start="91.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Hey,</p>
<p data-start="91.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Hey, as</p>
<p data-start="91.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> as a new candidate, is the previous candidate going to have his knighthood kept?</p>
<p data-start="91.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> as a new candidate, is</p>
<p data-start="94.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> kept?</p>
<p data-start="95.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm going to have to check with the party office on that. That's my answer, by the way. Such a meanian charter. that's my answer to every question going forward for the</p>
<p data-start="97.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> the way. Such a meanian</p>
<p data-start="99.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> meanian charter. that's my answer to every question going forward for the party oh my god god</p>
<p data-start="103.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> oh my god god</p>
<p data-start="105.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> god you sticking me down</p>
<p data-start="105.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="105.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> you sticking me down zane has mark carney opinioned on it because if so that's my opinion that's oh this</p>
<p data-start="112.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> oh this makes sense carter he's like i want to do i want to do a strategist youtube page we're like why less is more and he's like no no people need to see my face they need to get more I want to wear suits during this. I'm like, why? Carter, I never put the pieces together. But this motherfucker had a plan the whole time, okay? No, listen. I knew it the whole</p>
<p data-start="123.3"><strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> more</p>
<p data-start="133.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> knew it the whole time. I'm so good at strategy. I would have bet that</p>
<p data-start="137.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> that on April Fool's Day, he was going to announce his candidacy.</p>
<p data-start="141.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's how I would have done it. I would have bet that. By</p>
<p data-start="141.3"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> That's</p>
<p data-start="141.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's how I would</p>
<p data-start="141.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> would</p>
<p data-start="141.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> would</p>
<p data-start="141.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> would</p>
<p data-start="141.9"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> would</p>
<p data-start="143.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> By the way, do you want to confirm or deny that you are the candidate right now? No, I don't want to do that. Put it in unequivocal terms for the people. Because I'd say there's a good 50%. 50%. It's down the middle that don't believe you're the candidate. So, Corey, I'll give you this opportunity right now. This is Corey Hogan, Liberal Party of Canada, candidate for Calgary Confederation, telling you that he is indeed that. Go ahead, Corey. People,</p>
<p data-start="146.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I</p>
<p data-start="147.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I don't want to do that. Put it in unequivocal</p>
<p data-start="148.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> unequivocal</p>
<p data-start="148.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> unequivocal</p>
<p data-start="148.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> unequivocal</p>
<p data-start="148.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> unequivocal terms</p>
<p data-start="149.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because I'd say there's</p>
<p data-start="152.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> middle that</p>
<p data-start="163.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> People, it's</p>
<p data-start="165.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> been reported I'm the candidate.</p>
<p data-start="168.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Sounds convincing to me, Carter. I feel like I'm sold.</p>
<p data-start="170.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> sold.</p>
<p data-start="171.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> On</p>
<p data-start="171.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> On April 1st.</p>
<p data-start="172.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> April 1st. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="173.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="173.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, that's pretty good. On April 1st. On April 1st. I thought that's how you create a buzz. You know, you create a little excitement. I think that the launch, like the press release also referencing how I won an Irish stew competition. Yeah. Maybe people had some questions.</p>
<p data-start="173.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's pretty good. On April 1st. On April 1st.</p>
<p data-start="184.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah. Maybe</p>
<p data-start="186.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, let's jump right into strategy mode. How would you go after Corey's late launch here? Irish stew? How would you undercut the fact that Corey Hogan is a Liberal Party candidate in Confederation? Go ahead. Yeah. As a good friend and personal advisor to Corey, can you broadcast how you would actually undermine his campaign go?</p>
<p data-start="197.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> a good friend</p>
<p data-start="204.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Undermine Corey's campaign. That's</p>
<p data-start="205.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's right. Yeah, I want you to do it.</p>
<p data-start="206.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think that the actual answer was you got to focus on the candidate.</p>
<p data-start="211.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right?</p>
<p data-start="211.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right? Like, you know, candidate strengths and weaknesses ultimately matter a lot in politics. And this is where, you know, Corey's probably pulling, what, 20, 25 points behind Mark Carney right now. so focus on focus on the fact that you</p>
<p data-start="225.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know cory hogan is running i mean thanks</p>
<p data-start="228.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> thanks appreciate you i</p>
<p data-start="229.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean cory hogan's unofficial slogan and and it might be his actual official slogan is you could do worse so let's</p>
<p data-start="229.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> mean cory</p>
<p data-start="239.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> let's test that premise you know and here's the premise this</p>
<p data-start="240.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> you know and here's the premise this is where i question cory's candidacy because you could do worse sure but the thing is they had worse worse you had worse right you had worse and now you have cory right this is this is why you need the brain power of someone like me on the campaign garter we can't just be you all the time no</p>
<p data-start="257.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> no i let's be clear we've asked you to be on the campaign um we've asked uh i think 17 times uh will you be on the campaign which the answer has been seems</p>
<p data-start="267.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> you be on the campaign which the answer has been seems a light i'm</p>
<p data-start="270.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> i'm pretty busy i'm pretty busy well i've got a new show can i can i launch my new show are we</p>
<p data-start="275.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> we all just talking are we just Is this launching things today? You can go to whateverthisis.ca.</p>

<p data-start="277.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> You can go to whateverthisis.ca. It's very good, I've heard, and I've been told to say. Unfortunately,</p>
<p data-start="283.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Unfortunately, I did tell you that. It is very good. Whateverthisis.ca? Whatever</p>
<p data-start="286.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Whateverthisis</p>
<p data-start="287.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Whatever this is. Not a joke. Did</p>
<p data-start="287.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Not a joke. Did I make it through a whole episode? No, I have not. It's three minutes an</p>

<p data-start="288.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> through a whole</p>
<p data-start="289.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> have not. It's three minutes</p>
<p data-start="291.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> an episode.</p>
<p data-start="292.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> You can make it through. I</p>
<p data-start="293.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I can't. I've tried. It's a brown man yelling at you for three</p>
<p data-start="294.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> tried. It's a brown man yelling at you for three minutes, okay? I've</p>
<p data-start="297.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I've tried two times. You've worked in the Northeast. You know</p>
<p data-start="298.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> You've worked in the Northeast. You know what this is like. This</p>
<p data-start="300.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is missing two people that would have made this thing. Absolutely. It's really pumped. It's</p>
<p data-start="304.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Absolutely. It's really pumped. It's you really take the quality elements of the podcast and or the ones that are not leaving the podcast and you then isolate them. Carter, this is what I should have done years ago.</p>

<p data-start="402.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> realizing I limited my career. Yeah, Zane's basically a joke aggregator. I guess it's a breakup episode with Carter, right, Corey? Is that where this is going? Am I out?</p>
<p data-start="402.8"><strong>SPEAKER_04:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="406.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> joke aggregator. I guess it's a breakup</p>
<p data-start="411.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Is that what happened? No, no, no. You're the only one that's in. Oh, I'm the only one left.</p>

<p data-start="417.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="418.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I was confused. One of the reasons I haven't joined is, you know, I respect you, but I do think at this point you are the flare airlines of candidates, right? You're late and excessive baggage is part of the issue. Thank you. Appreciate that. I'm prepping him, Carter. Carter, I'm prepping your boy for</p>
<p data-start="434.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> for what Jeremy Nixon will throw at you, okay?</p>
<p data-start="440.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, that's what's going to happen. You know, going</p>
<p data-start="441.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, going against one of the Nixon brothers is pretty exciting. Hey, listen, one</p>
<p data-start="442.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> going against one of the Nixon brothers</p>
<p data-start="443.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> brothers</p>
<p data-start="443.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> brothers is</p>
<p data-start="443.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> is pretty exciting. Hey, listen, one</p>
<p data-start="445.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> one of the things you learn as a candidate is sometimes you don't swing at every pitch, Zane, you know? You just let it go. You've not been schooled in the same school that Carter and I went</p>
<p data-start="446.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> things you</p>
<p data-start="446.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> you learn</p>
<p data-start="446.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> learn</p>
<p data-start="446.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> learn</p>
<p data-start="451.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> You've</p>
<p data-start="453.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> went to. Corey, do you want to tell us what happened here? Because I think there's people that are still – I think we've reduced the number. I think at the end of this episode, our core objective is to convince 100% of listeners you are indeed the candidate. Now, I think your statement helped, but</p>
<p data-start="455.2"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Corey,</p>
<p data-start="455.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Corey,</p>
<p data-start="455.3"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Corey, do</p>
<p data-start="455.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> do</p>
<p data-start="455.5"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> do you want</p>
<p data-start="455.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> want to tell us</p>
<p data-start="455.9"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> us what</p>
<p data-start="457.0"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> Because I think there's people</p>
<p data-start="470.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> don't think it went all the way. Do you want to actually tell us more to this fiction to give us a sense of why you're the candidate?</p>
<p data-start="472.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Do you</p>
<p data-start="477.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I mean, so on Friday, I got a call that the candidate that did exist in Calgary Confederation was going to be leaving that post and that that was going to be happening pretty soon. And then I was asked, can</p>
<p data-start="489.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> can I put your stuff forward to be a candidate for Calgary Confederation? And I talked to my wife about it and thought, yeah, I mean, look, let's even step back from there. I think like most Canadians, I've been pretty</p>
<p data-start="502.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> pissed</p>
<p data-start="503.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> pissed off about everything Donald Trump's been doing, what's been going on in the United States, the Americanization of our politics, all of that. And in January, it kind of came to a head, like we've got this lunatic down south calling us the 51st state. We've got these tariffs looming. We've got trouble going on with Russia. Like the world is just such a crazy, dangerous place. And it just felt like something had to give, right? And who knew that all we really needed was a central banker. But that, you know, Mark Carney really changed the game in the conversation. And so it started thinking in</p>
<p data-start="534.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> in probably February, March, like, well, is there other ways I can be helpful? So when the call came, I</p>
<p data-start="540.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I took the call. I thought that's interesting. Talked to my wife and it's been kind of whirlwind since Friday, if I'm going to be totally honest.</p>
<p data-start="548.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> It's one of those things where it feels at times</p>
<p data-start="550.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> times like it's moving way too fast and other times where it feels like it's moving way too slow because it's like making a major purchase. It's so easy to commit and then the paperwork, all of the things you have to do in order to make it real take days. and you've got to interview with people and you've got to wait for them and they're going to go on the timeline of ottawa and ottawa doesn't really it's</p>
<p data-start="569.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's not that they don't care but you're one of 340 some writings and they're just doing their thing and take</p>
<p data-start="574.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> some time and then on monday night get the call like yeah you are you know claimed as candidate and so then</p>
<p data-start="582.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're off we go that's what happened cleaned up all of my files at work yesterday carter</p>
<p data-start="586.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter jesus christ i didn't realize this is gonna be fucking sponsored content i didn't know either i mean holy fuck me it's the longest i've ever talked</p>
<p data-start="590.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> didn't know either i mean holy fuck me it's</p>

<p data-start="610.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> did you want to open-ended questions questions the The more we</p>
<p data-start="623.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> is an experiment I want to try. I think that's a great, great hypothesis. I</p>
<p data-start="623.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> an experiment</p>
<p data-start="629.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> I think he should be coming here every week for a shit-kicking. For a shit</p>
<p data-start="632.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> shit-kicking.</p>
<p data-start="632.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> -kicking. Keep me humble. Yeah.</p>

<p data-start="640.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Great.</p>
<p data-start="640.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Great.</p>
<p data-start="640.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Great.</p>
<p data-start="640.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Great. I see what Trump is doing, and I alone can stand against him.</p>
<p data-start="640.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Great. I see</p>
<p data-start="640.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> see</p>
<p data-start="640.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> see</p>
<p data-start="644.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Listen, asshole. Here's what I'm saying. It's worth</p>
<p data-start="645.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> asshole. Here's what I'm saying. It's worth</p>
<p data-start="647.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> worth</p>
<p data-start="647.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> worth fighting</p>
<p data-start="647.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> fighting</p>
<p data-start="648.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> fighting for.</p>
<p data-start="650.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> shit, day two of a candidate and you're calling people assholes?</p>
<p data-start="650.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> shit, day two of a candidate</p>
<p data-start="655.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> The people will understand. No, I don't think they will.</p>
<p data-start="656.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> No, I don't think they will. I think they will. I don't think they're very generous</p>
<p data-start="660.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> generous</p>
<p data-start="660.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> generous with context.</p>
<p data-start="662.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> He calls all white men asshole. By the way, a constituent.</p>
<p data-start="662.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> calls</p>
<p data-start="667.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> You called a constituent an asshole.</p>
<p data-start="670.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> This is really</p>
<p data-start="670.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is really coming in handy that we live so close to one another now. Hey, we're all located in one federal riding. This</p>
<p data-start="673.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> we're all located in one</p>
<p data-start="676.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> This is feeling like our entire friendship has been a mistake. Maybe I'll reverse on some of this stuff here.</p>
<p data-start="676.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is feeling</p>
<p data-start="683.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, he does get final cut of the end. I do</p>
<p data-start="685.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> I do get final cut. Yeah, like it's been my executive producer, right? It's a very Blake Lively situation. In</p>
<p data-start="688.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Blake Lively situation.</p>
<p data-start="692.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Hey, man, Blake catching strays, that's more complicated. Why are you defending Blake</p>
<p data-start="697.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> are you defending Blake Lively? There's no Blake Lively constituency within Calgary Confederation.</p>
<p data-start="703.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm Blake. I'm on Team Blake.</p>
<p data-start="705.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. I,</p>
<p data-start="706.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> I,</p>
<p data-start="706.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> I,</p>
<p data-start="706.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> I, too, am on Team Blake. I'm hardcore Baldoni all the way. So, appease me, Corey, as a constituent. What do you got for me? My</p>
<p data-start="706.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> I, too, am on Team Blake.</p>
<p data-start="707.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="710.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> So,</p>
<p data-start="710.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> So, appease</p>
<p data-start="712.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> What do you got for me? My</p>
<p data-start="713.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> My</p>
<p data-start="713.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> My</p>
<p data-start="714.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> biggest issue with this election is Justin Baldoni. What do you got?</p>
<p data-start="720.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> is a huge mistake.</p>
<p data-start="720.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> huge mistake.</p>
<p data-start="721.0"><strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="722.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> Not for me. I'm having a great fucking time.</p>
<p data-start="725.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> time.</p>
<p data-start="727.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know what? Sometimes you just nod and say thank you very much and move on. I just, you know. Carter, his lack of</p>
<p data-start="732.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, his lack of response is actually convincing more people that this is indeed real. Yeah, that's right. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="736.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's right. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="737.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="737.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="737.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="737.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="737.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> where are you at with this?</p>
<p data-start="740.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Oh, my God. We can take this multiple ways. Do you want to reflect on what Corey said? Do you want to discuss the future business plans of the podcast and open the books on the pod? We could do whatever, really. Oh, good. There's many directions we could take this.</p>
<p data-start="740.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> God.</p>
<p data-start="752.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="752.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm quite certain that he's not going to be able to accept media payments from the Strategist Media Corporation. So this goes from being a three-way split to a two-way split.</p>
<p data-start="760.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> split. I am</p>
<p data-start="761.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I am pretty excited to record every day this</p>
<p data-start="763.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> excited to record every day this month, every</p>
<p data-start="766.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> every day, you know, let's, let's curse the politics, this fucker, let's go, let's, let's, let's monetize, monetize, right? Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="774.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, just listen,</p>
<p data-start="774.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> just listen, this, this was, this has been a whirlwind for all of us. So, you know, this, you know, we weren't going to be involved in Calgary Confederation's campaign up until, up until 24 hours ago, really. And now it's been, you</p>
<p data-start="789.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, making sure that we've got all the little things done. Literature, signs, you know, buttons, T-shirts, door knocking crews, signatures. All</p>
<p data-start="798.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> door knocking crews, signatures. All</p>
<p data-start="800.5"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> All</p>
<p data-start="800.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> All of</p>
<p data-start="801.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> of this is coming through. And the volunteer team that's rallying around this is significant. We even had people.</p>
<p data-start="807.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is going to shock regular listeners of the podcast. We had people from the podcast actually go and sign Corey's nomination papers, which feels like, frankly, you're letting the whole fucking podcast down. You know who hasn't signed his nomination papers? Me and Zane. We have not signed, and we will not sign. That's true.</p>
<p data-start="826.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> That's true.</p>
<p data-start="826.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> Because this is not real.</p>
<p data-start="829.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> I let people know. This is not real. And to prove it, Corey will say something blasphemous right now.</p>
<p data-start="829.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="829.5"><strong>SPEAKER_03:</strong> I let people know. This</p>
<p data-start="840.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> great. Carter, how do you think we're doing convincing people that Corey's actually indeed the candidate?</p>
<p data-start="841.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> how do you think we're doing convincing</p>
<p data-start="845.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, I think you're convincing me I'm not</p>
<p data-start="847.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> not the</p>
<p data-start="847.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> the candidate</p>
<p data-start="847.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> candidate</p>
<p data-start="847.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> candidate</p>
<p data-start="847.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> candidate</p>
<p data-start="847.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> candidate at</p>
<p data-start="847.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> at this point.</p>
<p data-start="848.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> point. You</p>
<p data-start="848.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="848.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="849.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> may not be for much longer. That's just what I'm saying. Just print the new guy sign. Just new guy for Calgary Confederation. You had worse twice. I</p>
<p data-start="857.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> I literally sent</p>
<p data-start="858.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> literally sent</p>
<p data-start="859.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> sent</p>
<p data-start="859.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> sent</p>
<p data-start="859.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> sent a note to the campaign today. Don't worry about us. We'll be well behaved. And here we are. Here</p>
<p data-start="864.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Here we are. Here</p>
<p data-start="865.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> we are.</p>
<p data-start="865.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Here we are recording. Carter, you, like myself, and Corey, you too, probably got a lot of people saying that this is not real. including media, questioning the veracity. One of the reasons is you launched on April 1st</p>
<p data-start="878.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> with the domain, which I believe is now live, april1.ca.</p>
<p data-start="882.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, april1.ca will bring you to... To be clear, not April 1st. We don't own April 1st. We do own april1.ca. The number one. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="890.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, so if it confuses people, for Corey's campaign, you go to april1.ca, not april1.ca. And if you're confused by that, as a fallback, we also own</p>
<p data-start="890.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, so if it confuses people, for</p>
<p data-start="900.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> april2.ca, which will also take you somewhere but</p>
<p data-start="905.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> don't go to aprilfirst.ca yeah</p>
<p data-start="907.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah don't go to april do you want to defend</p>
<p data-start="908.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> do you want to defend purchasing the url the cra is politically motivated any thoughts</p>
<p data-start="909.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> purchasing</p>
<p data-start="919.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> on the canada revenue agency that</p>
<p data-start="922.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> you might have i</p>
<p data-start="925.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> use a glass of water</p>
<p data-start="929.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> carter i i've had enough i don't know if there's anything else you want to talk about No,</p>
<p data-start="932.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, listen, this is great. It's as I'm doing all the work I did yesterday. So thank you for that, Zane. Very grateful. I have more work to do today that is probably not going to go to naught because we're going to get Corey kicked out of the candidacy before we even get started. So this has been</p>
<p data-start="951.5"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> this has been</p>
<p data-start="952.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> a pretty great day for all of us.</p>
<p data-start="956.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="956.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="957.2"><strong>Zain:</strong> You're feeling good, Corey? You</p>
<p data-start="960.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Listen, honest to God, it's going to be a good campaign. It's going to be big.</p>
<p data-start="963.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> to be big.</p>
<p data-start="964.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> it's going to be a great campaign. How did the Jesperson interview go?</p>
<p data-start="964.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's going to</p>
<p data-start="967.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, it's good. I took very few shots at you along the way. Not zero, but a couple. Let</p>
<p data-start="971.3"><strong>Zain:</strong> Let me read you a quote. Let me find a quote. I'm just going to locate it here because I wrote it down because I thought it was excellent. Here we go. Where is the quote? You'll find it on my phone, Stephen Carter. It's about you. I'm glad</p>
<p data-start="985.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's about you. I'm glad you did Jesperson. That made me happy.</p>
<p data-start="990.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Doing middling podcasts is what we're all about here at The Strategist. So Jesus Christ,</p>
<p data-start="995.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> Christ, Carter,</p>
<p data-start="995.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Carter,</p>
<p data-start="996.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, come</p>
<p data-start="996.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> come on. You're associated with</p>
<p data-start="998.0"><strong>Zain:</strong> You're associated with the campaign. You can't be fucking talking like that. So, Carter, you missed the interview. I found the quote, OK? Yeah, I did not</p>
<p data-start="1003.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> did not listen to the interview. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="1005.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> Yeah, here it is. This is a quote by Stephen. I'm sorry, but I'm just going to play the two of you. This is a quote about Stephen Carter by one Corey Hogan. OK, this is a liberal candidate in Calgary Confederation,</p>
<p data-start="1013.0"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> a liberal</p>
<p data-start="1015.1"><strong>Zain:</strong> which</p>
<p data-start="1015.3"><strong>SPEAKER_05:</strong> which is a real thing he's doing.</p>
<p data-start="1016.7"><strong>Zain:</strong> OK, this is great. Quote, he will be around to a degree that makes sense for me and Stephen. Steven.</p>
<p data-start="1022.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> The question was, how much will Steven Carter be around the campaign? And the answer was he will be around to a degree that makes sense for me and Steven. Ready</p>

<p data-start="1142.4"><strong>Zain:</strong> Carter, Corey, how big of a, let's just call it what it is, liability was Stephen Carter during your vetting process?</p>
<p data-start="1153.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> right. So I won't</p>
<p data-start="1155.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> won't go deep, deep in the weeds, but they do. So when you're becoming a candidate, they vet you, right? You've got to provide financial information. They've got to look over things like your credit history, make sure you don't have a criminal record, disclose anything like that. And then they ask you a bunch of conversations. There's an interview. interview my interview was about 75 minutes long nice fellow colin lalonde was his name and uh colin is asking me a bunch of questions and</p>
<p data-start="1164.8"><strong>Zain:</strong> sure you don't have</p>
<p data-start="1179.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> i would say the bulk is about my punditry right that's that's where i think insofar as anybody is gonna have concerns about my vetting it's what have you said in the past and colin says to me you know i haven't listened to the strategist it's pretty clear that he thinks it's three guys in a basement talking to an audience of their parents uh because you know that's how it is but he says but i listened to the first five minutes of your most recent episode and uh your co-host steven carter uh he called all of the voters stupid and i kind of chuckled and said yeah it sounds like steven you know that that definitely tracks i'll bet you he did say something like that which is you know not</p>
<p data-start="1199.5"><strong>Zain:</strong> because you</p>
<p data-start="1200.9"><strong>Zain:</strong> that's how it is but</p>
<p data-start="1219.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> not really i think uh what steven believes in his soul but maybe he has extreme manifestations no</p>
<p data-start="1224.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> manifestations no i was i was at an an advanced poll yesterday here in vancouver and i can assure you my</p>
<p data-start="1229.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> i</p>

<p data-start="1307.6"><strong>Zain:</strong> do you have anything sincere to say to to the to the people listening um because this is the indeed the uh sponsored content portion of the show we actually starting a new segment called sponsored content for candidates uh which is anytime we have one of the three of us running for public office we give you the the airwaves of the strategist podcast uh for a full 90 seconds to make a play and carter this applies to you too if you ever run for public office we will give you this portion at the end of this show it's just kind of like the public service that we're that we're able to do yeah yeah</p>
<p data-start="1329.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> carter this applies to you too if you</p>

<p data-start="1345.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Ah, yeah. Look, I think that this is an important time for the country. It's not one person holding up the weight of the world. It's the fact that a lot of us need to make sacrifices and try to do what's right for all of us. And so I'd encourage anybody who thinks strongly about this election like I do to come on out and volunteer, vote, donate, tell your friends, get involved in any other way you can in your community, put together groups of people. If you're in Confederation, I'll probably come talk to them. and you can get a hold of us all by going to um april1</p>
