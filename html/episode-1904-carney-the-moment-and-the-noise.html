  <div class="said">speaking speaking of hard-ons um big dick energy from mark carney steven carter um it is It is being called the greatest speech of all time. It is being called a legacy-making speech. It is being called nothing but positive. Stephen Carter, I want to get down to the brass tacks of a strategist and analyze. Was Mark Carney&#x27;s 17 Minutes in Heaven on the Davos stage as good as it is being written about in the papers and in the columns across the world? Stephen Carter, top line, give it to me straight. Most</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="248">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">4:08</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">of the time what happens is that we get too excited about something, we blow it up out of proportion, and then it becomes forgotten in a few weeks or a few months. Or we find out after time, like for example, the knockout punch of Mulroney in his debate with John Turner, it kind of developed over the course of days, right? It took some time for it to develop. So there&#x27;s two types of communications. One that is we blow it up out of proportion, and the other is it takes a few days to come around. And the truth of the matter is this has been blown up out of proportion, but it also seems to be working. Like people three days later are still remembering and talking about the Davos speech. This is something that I think that world leaders are going to be reflecting on. And it wasn&#x27;t just a speech for Canadians. It was a speech for his peers. And as such, as a speech for his peers, it had it spoke to a to both the target audience of his peers, as well as those of us who just, you know, are his underlings who just, you know, we just vote for the man. That&#x27;s all we do. But my goodness, what a speech. What an absolute fucking command performance, Stu. Like it was just it</div>

<div class="turn" data-start="328">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
    <span class="ts">5:28</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">was it was a day to be proud to be Canadian. And normally we like to take the piss from people, but I was super pleased with that. I just was super impressed by the speech.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="340">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:40</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Shannon Carter&#x27;s gushing like a motherfucker, which is what he does like clockwork every five years. So I have not heard Stephen Carter this positive since the Jeb Bush presidency or near the tail end of the Jeb Bush presidency, which was a great four years. I like Jeb Shannon, are you on board the Carnot Express in congratulating Mark Carney to the same level? And then let&#x27;s get into the whys, because I&#x27;m curious about your W-H-Y whys in a second.</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="369">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">6:09</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">Yes, because Canadians have been in the spotlight of, you know, the big bad orange man within the eye of Sauron many, many times. And yet, for whatever reason, I think we have felt like we have not been supported on the international stage by that. Whether that was Keir Starmer&#x27;s extremely tepid responses to kind of standing up for us, whether that&#x27;s been the EU kind of really trying to mollify Trump. And we spent 2025 feeling like nobody was really paying any attention to the fact that, you know, the world&#x27;s most advanced military in the history of the planet was running around talking about annexing us. So this got us the global attention that I think we as Canadians felt like we deserved and that we had been waiting for. And that&#x27;s the domestic piece of it, is that Canadians have been essentially waiting for an articulation of our importance on the international stage. It also feeds straight into Carney&#x27;s electoral coalition. Boomers remember the concept of middle powers. Boomers remember the Pearsonian foreign policy, the last time that we were proud of our foreign policy and that it was something that was maybe while not vote determining, it was certainly nation defining. And so there&#x27;s that piece. uh and i i also think that we are in a moment and and carney is the kind of politician that you know he could fall into some of the pitfalls of of looking like kind of a regular ass politician right he&#x27;s a banker for heaven&#x27;s sakes uh but for him to go up and engage in plain talk and in authenticity and in straight speech uh there&#x27;s there&#x27;s persuasion in that uh that i I think we&#x27;ve also been waiting for. We&#x27;ve been in this moment where, you know, maybe Canadians are starting to wonder, is he wobbly? His elbows are down. But there was a persuasion of, no, actually, he&#x27;s with us. He&#x27;s just with us on a larger stage and a bigger plane than some of the domestic preoccupations in</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
    <span class="ts">8:30</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">terms of our desire to see our sovereignty reflected, our self-determination articulated so yeah it was exactly what we needed in this moment big eggplant uh energy yeah</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="525">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">8:45</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">big eggplant energy i i i i agree completely um he should know about that uh stephen carter yes here&#x27;s the thing about okay i want to talk about the substance of it and i&#x27;m actually going to not let you guys go where everyone else goes in terms of let&#x27;s just Let&#x27;s just put some stuff on the table. The tone, the length, the words, the prose, all of that. Excellent. In a second here, I want you to go deeper in terms of what Stephen Carter, the political strategist, saw that made this thing very effective. And I&#x27;ll come to you, Shannon, in a second on that same question. However, before we do that, Carter, there is something, I don&#x27;t know if ironic is the right word, but there&#x27;s something rich in the fact that a seminal, if not legacy-making, if not historic speech by a Canadian prime minister is given at Davos when, let&#x27;s just say one year to the day, we were fighting about the WEF and global elites and Pierre Pauliev saying that one of the principal things that the Pauliev government would never allow allow to happen is to have him or any of his ministers go to that that fuck show known as davos and carter one year later here we are so opine on that for a moment before i ask you back to the substance of the speech and and give me your with maybe without using the word trump give me your analysis of of the journey there uh and the political cost of that one pierre poliev certainly didn&#x27;t seem like he was paying at the time but</div>
