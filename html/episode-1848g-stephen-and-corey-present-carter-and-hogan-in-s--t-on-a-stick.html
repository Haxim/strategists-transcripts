  <div class="said">no the statement doesn&#x27;t go nearly far enough first of all i think you need to have you need to make sure that you are painting a villain whoever the villain is going to be there are two people in any good story there is a protagonist and an antagonist if you want to be the protagonist you must define who who the antagonist is that is the very i mean simple literature reading your kids a story at night there&#x27;s a good guy and there&#x27;s a bad is it yeah right you&#x27;re going to tell a story to your kids in the car to make the the long trip exciting they&#x27;re the good guys there&#x27;s a bad guy good guy who triumphs over bad guy so danielle did not set that up she needed to have a bad guy or at least the potential bad guy. And she didn&#x27;t do that. And the second piece is she really didn&#x27;t tell as much of a story at all, right? Remembering that this is one of our constant criticisms of Rachel Notley. We learn by stories, right? The story that is being told now by Nahid Nenshi isn&#x27;t that good a story, but it&#x27;s still much more of a story than Danielle Smith told us. Danielle Smith should have told us the story of an AHS that&#x27;s out of control, an AHS that was being run by people who didn&#x27;t have the competence or the character to make sure that this type of stuff didn&#x27;t happen.</div>

You don&#x27;t want to make statements that you&#x27;re then going to have to walk back, right? right you&#x27;re trying to make it durable because you know what they always say is like it&#x27;s the cover-up that kills but like in this case the broader point is like if you say something and then tomorrow you have to say the opposite because you were just loose with your words it starts to look like a cover-up even if it was just an accidental fuck-up so when i say it&#x27;s the lawyers run by communicators that&#x27;s when language gets super tight when it gets super specific you can&#x27;t say that you can&#x27;t say that you don&#x27;t know that for sure you absolutely must stick to this line very carefully here and um and and so i&#x27;ve</div>

And actually I&#x27;ll say another challenge people have with, with allegations of scandal like this is the longer your, your explanation, the more you come off, like you&#x27;ve lost your mind, right? That you&#x27;re just piecing together random things and like, you&#x27;re picking up this piece of the scandal and that piece of the scandal. And, and, and what Jared points out, I think rightly is like when you can put succinctly and everyone like just sort of gets it like, oh, that&#x27;s it. Like that&#x27;s the scandal.</div>

And of course, the weakness of that is now the carbon tax is gone. But this scandal never goes away. This scandal is there for the remaining two and a half years of Danielle Smith&#x27;s tenure.
