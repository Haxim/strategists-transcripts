I mentioned that, of course, we are a national podcast, but we&#x27;ve got a lot of listeners in Alberta and we&#x27;ve got a lot of people in the two major cities of this province</div>

And he says smart money is on NAC. Interesting. He also adds that if Cartmel loses, it is considered the biggest political failure in Edmonton history. Not because Cartmel had like a 30-point lead, but because the guy&#x27;s going to spend more than a million bucks</div>

We&#x27;re three days out. I was at the CBC debate yesterday with some people and it ended and I turned to everyone around me. I&#x27;m like, what&#x27;s the ballot box question?</div>

I&#x27;m not even just saying most people who listen to this podcast because there&#x27;s a lot from out of this province who are now going to be tuned into our municipal scene. But I&#x27;m saying most people in our city have no fucking clue what&#x27;s going on. So you got Gondek, who&#x27;s the current mayor, right? You got Farkas, who came in second last time as the conservative choice. This is the former counselor who&#x27;s now running as a, let&#x27;s put a pin on this, but a progressive</div>

You mentioned Brian Thiessen. This is the Calgary party. This is Carter&#x27;s party. Brian, a well-respected labor lawyer or employment lawyer, I should say, in the Calgary space, former police commission chair. chair and then jeff davison this is running as an independent ward former ward six counselor ran for mayor last time as you alluded to um and of course is also leading a little bit more conservative in that in that regard you&#x27;ve got other folks running but that&#x27;s the that&#x27;s the batch is it not yeah</div>

Like, not only did they run against each other four years ago, they all started on council at the same time. So, the 2017 election, which I know well, you know well, right?

So the argument there is that it was a monoculture thing. We were living in a very strange time, no doubt, an extremely trying time, but there was almost a bit of a monoculture. Everyone was at home plugged into the same Internet box to receive the same amount of communications. we also had a very clear ballot box question that was framed by by gondek and by extension carter who was running gondek&#x27;s campaign at that time which was taking on jason kenny</div>

  <div class="said">This is a very different time. Extremely fractured, extremely distracting, the down south element of it. And what&#x27;s fascinating to me is that I think more people today on raw numbers are engaged in politics as a cultural observational sport. Fewer people are engaged in politics as a raw, let me put my vote somewhere sport. And I think they&#x27;re engaged in culture because politics is culture based on what&#x27;s happening down south, what&#x27;s down south with us on a national level, with what Smith is doing on a daily basis. So I think there&#x27;s a lot of wisdom there on 2021 being a simpler time, even though this is a rerun of some of the same candidates with a few more characters this time around.</div>

But there could be some true undecideds in that mix, as you mentioned, with even the hyper engaged. But I think the question that is framing up is a negative partisan question, which is who can stop evil from happening or who could stop bad stuff from happening? Not evil might be too deep of a word or too charged of a word. Whatever that might mean for you. And for the left or for the center in the left, as sharp has become more viable, I think that question snaps into focus. And then for the right, as Gondek and a new progressive-like version of Farkas flirt with one and two in the polls, the coalescing around sharp might occur. So this is – I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a perfect question. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a universal question. It&#x27;s not about infills. It&#x27;s not about housing. It&#x27;s not about safety. safety it&#x27;s about vibes and and and where you kind of stand in that sense now is that what the gen pop is thinking i</div>

But before that, let&#x27;s talk about process, because you&#x27;ve jumped into process, and I think it&#x27;s very important, because there&#x27;s been an absence of a few things this election. And I think the environment is certainly different. You can comment, but let me give you the top line sort of things that have changed. Media, different. Yeah,</div>

  <div class="said">media. Yeah, media, different, eroding and fractured. Okay, we can discuss that. Organic is different because it&#x27;s no longer, as we&#x27;ve mentioned multiple times on this podcast, most platforms for modern social media are now algorithmic rather than graph-based. which means that you&#x27;re not just seeing what your friends are putting online. Anyone can go viral with anything all the time, but there&#x27;s no guarantee that your followers are even seeing what you&#x27;re putting out there. This is the extremely simplified up and down of organic. Paid, I&#x27;ve heard money is extremely hard to come by.</div>

But in terms of the art, the creativity, the placement, the timing, the virality, or even the try to punch through, the attack ads, the stunts, all that sort of stuff that comes with it, I think we&#x27;re taking a step back. Where I think we might have taken a step forward is if you were on the email list of these folks, on the owned side of things, the email list, I think campaigns are doing quite a good job talking to their supporters. Now, I have no sense. This is what Henderson yesterday said about the Edmonton campaign. I&#x27;ll say about the Calgary campaign. i have no sense how big these dashboards are i have no sense how big these email lists are i have no sense of how uh any of this information if you sign up to the calgary party is getting shared beyond it but i&#x27;ll tell you they&#x27;re doing sophisticated stuff i&#x27;d say and i&#x27;m on most of these lists across the board yeah i think owned is taking a step forward or it&#x27;s like you know on par with what you&#x27;d expect but i&#x27;d say on the organic and paid um it is not existing in that in that same way. The other thing I&#x27;m fascinated about is polling.</div>

  <div class="said">many ways. I think that name recognition piece was a really, really, really big uphill battle. I do think people at the debates, but it&#x27;s insiders watching the debates. So usually the debates afterwards, I chat with a lot of people, hear what they&#x27;re thinking, what they&#x27;re saying. The chamber one, people were like, Thiessen won that 100%. He also, that was the first time he went really hot on tying Sharp to Smith. And again, the teacher strike timing. Last night, I feel like people felt like Davison, and Davison was entertaining, right? Like people thought that Davison, in terms of like a winner, I think he&#x27;s then, the conversations in my circles are like, we really like him. He would be great. But does he have a chance? Which gets back to ballot box question. if ballot box question is who is best suited to take on sonia sharp um</div>

I think a big thing of where they got a bunch of traditional media and they got a lot of eyeballs was the sign stuff. And I remember grilling Carter on that in the summer because I was just entertained because I saw the first sign and knew that Carter was behind that. Carter</div>

And I think the initial polling showed Albertans didn&#x27;t want parties. I think it&#x27;s changed slightly. But then we&#x27;re also in a time frame where like with the teacher strike, Daniel Smith is not like doing super well in Calgary right now.

You know, I think for for Thiessen, the fact is, I think the best mayor question would have been very helpful to them. But as soon as people turn into pundits, and what I mean by that is they turn into people like you and I who talk about things like viability. As soon as voters turn into pundits, that&#x27;s trouble when you&#x27;re not one of the people that&#x27;s showing viability through metrics like polling or momentum or other sort of congealed sort of metrics like that.

And I don&#x27;t have a clear answer in the sense. I have a clear answer. I don&#x27;t have a confident answer that&#x27;ll lead to an outcome that is that that that answers the question that in the sense and if this Is and I use you and I as proxies because I don&#x27;t mean exactly you and I but people like you and I if we&#x27;re still Struggling to your earlier point then what hope does that have to send any formal informal network based signal? To to those around us around what to do how it&#x27;s shaping up what&#x27;s going on and I think one core ingredient missing in both cities in this election is that, and less so in Edmonton, because I think folks are starting to understand the task. It&#x27;s a two-horse race for the most part, and that we&#x27;ve got to stop Cartmel if you&#x27;re anywhere between, let&#x27;s just say on the left and some folks on the center. That task is less clear here. That path is less clear here. I think Farkas, to your earlier description of who he&#x27;s become and who he wants to be, makes that task a bit harder in terms of what folks are doing i think gondek with her history and and and perhaps a little bit of disappointment for some people makes that task harder and then thesen with all his promise right</div>

But there is – the Thiessen party thing is – and my perceived thing is it&#x27;s a bit of a weight he&#x27;s carrying right now. It might have been an asset. you carter may argue on the back end that it wouldn&#x27;t have gotten him anywhere near where even the eight ten twelve percent he ends up with if there wasn&#x27;t a party infrastructure he could make that argument i don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;d buy it but it seems like thesen and the party seem to be a bit of an anchor right now</div>

  <div class="said">it is interesting to me that like if farkas is now considered one of the left or can have elements of left to him in terms of his base, that Gundick and Farkas didn&#x27;t go after each other much earlier in order to like, totally make the case that, you know, this is your person to be the standard bearer, if it comes down to us versus a conservative. In this case, this is a scenario that in the simplest of terms, if you believe what Farkas stands for, it&#x27;s two left wing candidates versus a right one at the top. And the vote split goes the other way here. It doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t have this is not this classic Alberta to right wing candidates, although the second one exists in Davison, his viability seems less. This could be a very fascinating to center to left wing center left candidates. And we can talk about Gondek&#x27;s history. There&#x27;ll be many people who argue with us around neither of these candidates being progressive because</div>

I was so focused on the mayor&#x27;s race. And of course, this was like every other race. We hit all of council, whatever. And as I look up on the screen on that night in 2017, I&#x27;m like, oh, thank God. And then she won. We get to celebrate. Oh, what happened to any of the councils? Every single incumbent that ran won. on</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah, I think in terms of incumbents, and I have them written down here, I think Chabot and McLean, the easy conservative wards where they always elect a conservative. Terry Wong in Seven is interesting. Maybe I&#x27;m biased here because I live in Seven and I&#x27;m in a Ward Seven bubble.</div>

I actually don&#x27;t think that matters that much because you have, you need to count to eight, right? Like you need, you need the eight. So, so where, where, who, who are the other, who are the new faces around the table? Right. Who are the new seven people and what are they like and, and what do they believe in and are they part of a party? Are they not part of a party?</div>

  <div class="said">Yeah. It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s going to be fascinating to see. who has the best governance or easiest governance pathway, who has the worst governance pathway, what some of these new faces look like, what those previews of the future look like. Is there a case where the Calgary party produces one or two folks without a mayor&#x27;s chair? Is there any... I mean, here&#x27;s the thing. The future of the parties, I mean, we can spend hours discussing, but let&#x27;s be clear. They have to disband. And if they want to start up again, that&#x27;s going to be a new thing. But the question is, they may not even be part of the next election. So this could be like literally a one and done where that Calgary party name, brand, website, logo, the flag that they&#x27;ve wrapped themselves around is so temporary that it may never see the light of day again. And same for the Edmonton sort of version of these brands. And same for Communities First. This</div>

  <div class="said">is not a thing that we&#x27;re going to associate. I mean, people are not associating candidates with brands as aggressively other than just to be like, you&#x27;re part of a party and I don&#x27;t like that. But they&#x27;re not associating themselves with these brands while voting for them. I think the likelihood of them doing so is significantly less even when those parties leave and be like, I remember that was our community&#x27;s first candidate that&#x27;s doing that. And that&#x27;s the reason why they&#x27;re doing X, Y, and Z. I want to wrap up here with any final thoughts you may have. We&#x27;ve talked almost exclusively about the mayor&#x27;s race. We talked a bit about council. We talked about the ballot box question, the polling, the process, some scenarios we might see on Monday night. I&#x27;m not going to ask you for a prediction because it does genuinely seem close. But if you want to give one, you can. But any final thoughts, Annalise, as we wrap up</div>

That&#x27;s not good. And then I think whoever, to your point at the beginning about like how big their mandate is going to be, whoever&#x27;s in the mayor&#x27;s chair is not going to have a huge mandate. They&#x27;re going to have like, there&#x27;s a lot of big things that need to happen in the next four years. And they&#x27;re going to have a team that may or may not, you know, be, be with them.
