And so he last time won by 20 points, and that was close ish. But the only close elections we&#x27;ve had in the last 30 years have been in 1995, which was a real nail-biter, and 2004 which was</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
    <span class="ts">5:55</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">so so the simplest question is to me at least the most obvious question and and maybe not not so simple to answer is okay why do we have a close race this time you&#x27;re you this is not part of your culture this is this is not a why is it close is it is it because people who weren&#x27;t supposed to be good are good is the people who are supposed to be bad or are underperformed like give me give me like a sense of the beats and maybe let&#x27;s start naming names in a sense at least on the mayoral and then we can get to you know what the ballot box question is what&#x27;s happening here but why do you think it&#x27;s it&#x27;s close this time it&#x27;s interesting it&#x27;s sleepy sleepy but it&#x27;s close it&#x27;s</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="389">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
    <span class="ts">6:29</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">it&#x27;s sleepy but it&#x27;s close and there was a lot of um through to the proof to the federal election and in april there was a lot of questions about what the field was even going to be um you know a lot of people thought that so he wouldn&#x27;t would run again and then maybe he wouldn&#x27;t run again and i mean tim cartnell who is the Well, the kid who&#x27;s been in this for the longest announced in November. Yeah. So everybody knew that whoever was going to be running was going to be running against him. But he – and then Soggy definitively dropped out when he ran from the Fed. Yeah. And that left a big hole</div>
</div>
<div class="turn" data-start="437">
  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
    <span class="ts">7:17</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">And people, I think, who were previously not prepared – I don&#x27;t think Andrew Knack was planning on running for mayor until he understood that Soapy was going to be out of the way. Yep. I don&#x27;t think Michael Walters was planning on running for mayor until he felt like he saw a pretty nice spot in the election that someone needed to fill. And so the field has come together really um uh even even i think uh reen jaffer like he&#x27;s not gonna he&#x27;s not gonna win yeah you know there i heard rumors about it for months and months and months and then it sort of he eventually kind of showed up uh everyone&#x27;s been pretty casual about when they decided to get into this race and um and so you haven&#x27;t had that the normal that kind of concentrated back and forth where you know candidates announced sort of you know and like you know one candidate announces well end of may one candidate announces at the uh the beginning of june and one candidate announces in the middle of june and then they kind of go at each other for for for 90 90 days 120 days until election day and it&#x27;s like there&#x27;s there&#x27;s just been there&#x27;s been just not much of a narrative here uh and most of the news stories and this you know like the biggest news story probably about any of the candidates was when Tim Cartmell missed a vote on infill, which is an influential issue, at least on this council. So, you know, like, there just hasn&#x27;t been a lot to report on with this. Also, every election, our media environment becomes more fragmented. like there you know</div>

  <div class="who">
    <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
    <span class="ts">9:05</span>
  </div>
  <div class="said">you might get two two stories a week really in the in like the paper of record around here about what&#x27;s going on in the election and and uh more now but like throughout the uh throughout the summer there was just no coverage of anything so people just didn&#x27;t really tune in until until very late and i think i think they are tuning in this week um which is i think good Good for some campaigns and not good for others, but it&#x27;s going to be a nail-biter. I think whoever wins is going to win with a three point lead and less than 35% of the vote.</div>

  <div class="said">I want to take advantage of your campaign practitioner experience alongside the fact this is a very tight election, but I want to do that in a second. I want to do that near the end of this thing where we can kind of talk about what sort of effort is needed, what the final days and the short strokes of a campaign. specifically municipal, specifically Edmonton municipal look like? There&#x27;s no one that I know that will know that better than you. But before we go there, talk to me about a few things that I&#x27;ve been curious about on the mayoral side, and then we&#x27;ll get to council as well, as I mentioned. So Sohi says, no, I&#x27;m out, right? He says, I&#x27;m picking up the federal seat. And while he says that, he&#x27;s like, to be clear, I&#x27;m not going to run for mayor. Okay.</div>

And of course, there&#x27;s no official one but what was your intel telling you was it was there a lot of people thinking of running or did knack by default fill that role was there enthusiasm to kind of fill that sort of progressive hole so to speak i want to kind of understand how knack came about the genesis story of knack as like the guy to kind of represent and and how were people slow or fast to embrace that give me that sort of broader story on the progressive side because i&#x27;m curious and i&#x27;ve I&#x27;ve got a similar Cartmel question for you when he announced much earlier on in November.</div>

I think he felt like he had had a pretty good council career and that he would split a vote. there was there&#x27;s probably not much of a uh a point of running against sitting mayor hamerjeet so he uh whether no matter how strong hamerjeet so he uh was people will tell you that he wouldn&#x27;t have won re-election i&#x27;m not i&#x27;m not so sure about that um but you think so he would have had</div>

And he has built up a level of political capital with a lot of very normal people that you cannot replicate in an election cycle, right? He has just been a good dude to so many people for so long that he just comes with 100,000 votes in his pocket or 50 000 votes in his pocket or whatever it is. Just by appearing on the ballot. Yeah, people just like him. And I think there&#x27;s a bit of a narrative that this council or Amarjeet Sohi has not had a great turn. I think that&#x27;s kind of inside baseball for people like you and I to hear about. But I think if you own a landscaping company in Ellerslie, you</div>

Seems like a quasi-meme candidate, but is getting double digits, low double digits in some of these polls and is starting to, you know, who knows where his vote cratered to or where his vote exists? There&#x27;s an interesting sort of question I have for you there. But your insight regarding, A, the class, right? So let me just walk folks through, right? You got Andrew Dacko you&#x27;ve mentioned. He&#x27;s the incumbent councillors since 2013. Cartmel, also an incumbent incumbent counselor. He&#x27;s also representing a political party, which we&#x27;ll get to in a second from 2017. And then you said formers. That&#x27;s right. Former counselor,</div>

That&#x27;s your list, folks. To no one said, it&#x27;s a buttoned up business time, former chamber chair stepping up. I don&#x27;t have a name I&#x27;m just kind of making that sort of general composite profile. None of those people said it&#x27;s time for me to kind of do it. So I think that&#x27;s a very unique insight. But I also think the other one is that no one wants to be mayor. And I feel like that&#x27;s similar to what&#x27;s happening in Calgary here too. Carter kind of put it in a different way. She&#x27;s like, no one is running to win. And if no one is seeming like running to win, I wonder if that&#x27;s why we also have a sleepy election. Not just because the field was gelled late or just because, you know, people were deciding to see what Sohi did or because like name recognition is so hard to get between media. All of those things are true. But my theory is also in addition, just to get you to consider this, is that people want you to want them in a sense, right? Like people want you to show that you care for them. And if you have a race where a lot of people are</div>

And I think he has leveraged that as he got a little bit of money and scaled that to turn into a bit of a machine. Whereas I think, quite frankly, a campaign with as much cash as the Carmel campaign has had to pretty much buy everything that it&#x27;s done.</div>

And I think that he&#x27;s, you know, like he&#x27;s made some fairly significant mistakes and, and he is, you know, like, I think it was just positioning using that great.

Number one, you know, back in 2017, when I was running the Nenshi campaign, you, you, you paid me a visit in the campaign office and we were chatting for a while. And my, my eye was focused obviously on the mayoral and, and, and, and that race, which opened up at the end, but was a squeaker. In fact, we were down in some public polls for a a while and then i paid attention on election night be like oh yeah what the fuck happened to council i should take a look like people fucking hated council and then she was wearing a lot of that like oh my god i bet all the people i know on council and every single one of the incumbents chris got re-elected yeah</div>

I don&#x27;t want to spend time on individual folks because I think the Merrills was interesting to me, but give me a flavor. What do you think happens to council? How your read is in the sense how Edmontonians vote for these things? Do you feel like there&#x27;s going to be big change on council? Do you feel like incumbents are going to be unseated? Is this that election? What would dictate that in your mind? Just give me a sense on council right now.</div>
