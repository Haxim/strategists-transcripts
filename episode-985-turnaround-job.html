        <div class="desc">
          <p>Tonight, the gang look at the public-facing elements of the Jean Charest campaign - the rallies, media relations, candidate handling, message, social media and campaign leadership - and talk through what changes should be considered to turn around a campaign that - at least to the public - looks to be floundering. Plus: Corey shows off prodigious knowledge of mid 1990s Simpsons trivia and Stephen laments that he's not celebrating Anzac Day in style.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are asked to walk through how they would overhaul the public-facing parts of Jean Charest's leadership campaign before the gang turns their attention to increasing temperatures in the UCP leadership review. How should Charest overhaul his approach to events, media and message? Is there anything normal about political staff publicly attacking members of their own caucus? And why would The Strategists record on such a big day for Australian football? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

It may have an expectation game problem. I want to create some new rules for the Jean Charest campaign. And so what we&#39;re doing tonight on Sunday night is the two of you are going to be constructing a memo for the entire Jean Charest operation across the country. The two of you have been hired for this next 30 or 40 minutes to construct this memo on six key topics for Jean Charest. Six? Six topics. You&#39;re going to give me a line or two on each round, what the new rules are for the Jean Charest campaign. So this gets funneled out to all of the organizers, fanned out to everyone across the country. What</div>

In fact, he&#39;s gone, I don&#39;t even know why, to the same location as Pierre Polyev the day after and has produced one one-hundredth of the crowd. And I think that&#39;s a slight exaggeration, but not exactly. So, Corey, start with us. If you&#39;re putting the first sort of thoughts on the board, on the whiteboard tonight, under the section of rallies, what are the new rules for the campaign as it relates to campaign rallies that you want to start?

Like go after some of these things, show some passion, string a few tweets together that actually tell a story that support your idea that insanity isn&#39;t the way to go. And you don&#39;t have to do it in a fashion that, that chases engagement. You can simply chase, uh, logic and rationale, right? Because rational thought is what you&#39;re actually aiming for. So why not tear apart some of the illogical elements that are coming out of Pierre? Why not show some passion? Why not at least pull the stick out of your bag and show that you can hit someone about the head of it? Because you ain&#39;t got nothing to lose. He&#39;s not going to be sticking around in the party if Pierre Polyev wins. So why not take a fucking round out of him and see if it actually works? And social media is the place to get it, to do it, because it will, to Corey&#39;s point, it will generate tons of earned media. yeah cory</div>

But just let it hang out there. Let it hang out there and have normal people who look in, see Polyev says something, Sharae replies directly underneath it, and a million lunatics pile on from Polyev&#39;s side.
