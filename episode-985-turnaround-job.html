            <span class="text">we are resetting it. Guys, the Jean Charest campaign is in trouble. We may not actually know if it&#39;s in trouble on the inside, on memberships, on what they&#39;re selling, but it clearly, Stephen Carter, has an optics problem. It has a message problem. It may have an expectation game problem. I want to create some new rules for the Jean Charest campaign. And so what we&#39;re doing tonight on Sunday night is the two of you are going to be constructing a memo for the entire Jean Charest operation across the country. The two of you have been hired for this next 30 or 40 minutes to construct this memo on six key topics for Jean Charest. Six? Six topics. You&#39;re going to give me a line or two on each round, what the new rules are for the Jean Charest campaign. So this gets funneled out to all of the organizers, fanned out to everyone across the country. What</span>

            <span class="text">This is what I want to hit on. So rallies, media relations, handlers slash aides, message, social media, and campaign leadership. But then I&#39;ll give you guys a chance to say, is there additional items that you want to create new rules about? But at least for those six things, I want to see if the two of you can can come up with some new rules so that the Jean Charest campaign, regardless of how it&#39;s doing under the hood, doesn&#39;t</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">which I guess makes my car better. So, Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you. I want to talk about rallies. Jean Charest is getting the shit beat out of him in the public for his anemic rallies. In fact, he&#39;s gone, I don&#39;t even know why, to the same location as Pierre Polyev the day after and has produced one one-hundredth of the crowd. And I think that&#39;s a slight exaggeration, but not exactly. So, Corey, start with us. If you&#39;re putting the first sort of thoughts on the board, on the whiteboard tonight, under the section of rallies, what are the new rules for the campaign as it relates to campaign rallies that you want to start? And then, Carter, I&#39;ll let you mold some of that wet clay Corey puts out there. Well, my first one flows</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">flows out of your intro here, where you said we don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening underneath the hood we just know it&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s giving off a stink this campaign is giving off a stink there is turd vibes yeah big</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">turd vibes right and um the problem with that is no matter how good of a sleeper car it is if it looks that rough from the outside over time people will turn against it and they won&#39;t buy this is a this is a labored metaphor already but the point is that perception of failure will become real if they don&#39;t manage to get a handle on those things so talking rallies specifically here and again you teed it up by saying he&#39;s making these easy and unflattering comparisons possible by going to the same venue and having fewer people they&#39;ve got to just they&#39;ve got to stop playing games that they can&#39;t win so if you&#39;re going to do rallies the rallies have to be in very small rooms they&#39;ve got to be pitched not about big crowds but about intimacy it&#39;s got to to become an apples to oranges comparison not a not an apples to apples comparison which is what he&#39;s stuck in right now that&#39;s that&#39;s rule number one um 1a of rallies always is you want a room slightly too small for the event and so there&#39;s you know you should never be going somewhere where you&#39;re going to underwhelm in it period even if pohiev wasn&#39;t in the campaign you would not want to do that carter</span>

Rallies are usually something you do once in a while to literally rally the troops, right? When you&#39;re doing them every night, you&#39;re not actually doing the work of selling the memberships.

He&#39;s got all of that, but he&#39;s getting killed on on photographs, whether it&#39;s the hostage video that he used to launch himself or the I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m all alone on this bench picture that you&#39;re talking about right now.

You know, it kind of mood fits right they find the photograph that mood fits these aren&#39;t mood fit photographs these are photographs that are being taken in real time to match with the actual you know interviews and it&#39;s all people are seeing people are seeing charrette literally look like a loser literally</span>

We talk about the stink of his campaign. So the photos that correspond with these stories, they&#39;re going to have some stink. That&#39;s just how it&#39;s going to be because that&#39;s how you put a nice little bundle together if you&#39;re putting a story together in the media. You want to show Sheree alone on a couch, not with the conservative membership yet. He&#39;s not getting the crowds that Polyev is getting. That makes sense. That&#39;s photography that seems sensible. But, you know, we&#39;re talking about media relations. You have social media as a separate thing. But in some ways, I think this is part of their problem.

There&#39;s a lot of people who&#39;ve been protesting every weekend. Pierre Pauliev drawing those people who are already going to those things out to a rally. This is not a surprise. They&#39;ve been going to rallies for a year and a half, but those people are isolated. Those</span>

I mean, this is a big country. And if you take an extreme position, extremists are going to show up in droves, because there&#39;s only so many avenues for them to do so. And Pierre Polyev is playing with fire right now. We&#39;re not playing with fire. We&#39;re fighting for government. We&#39;re fighting for the soul of this country.</span>

The rule for Sharae tonight to send out to his troops on social media might be a rule about here&#39;s what we do going forward. It might be a rule to justify our anemic social media presence. To me, it kind of ties back to rallies. Pierre-Paul LeRoy is killing it on rallies. So to Carter&#39;s point, do you just can social media? Do you not do it? Do you downplay it? Do you de-emphasize it? what&#39;s your rule or message to the troops tonight uh when you&#39;re constructing this for social media cory so</span>

Could be paid because a lot of social media these days is boosted, even partially. So you put something out and you put at least a few dollars behind it.

Like go after some of these things, show some passion, string a few tweets together that actually tell a story that support your idea that insanity isn&#39;t the way to go. And you don&#39;t have to do it in a fashion that, that chases engagement. You can simply chase, uh, logic and rationale, right? Because rational thought is what you&#39;re actually aiming for. So why not tear apart some of the illogical elements that are coming out of Pierre? Why not show some passion? Why not at least pull the stick out of your bag and show that you can hit someone about the head of it? Because you ain&#39;t got nothing to lose. He&#39;s not going to be sticking around in the party if Pierre Polyev wins. So why not take a fucking round out of him and see if it actually works? And social media is the place to get it, to do it, because it will, to Corey&#39;s point, it will generate tons of earned media. yeah cory</span>

This is the first time they&#39;ve been on the field. You know, let&#39;s let&#39;s sit back to this metaphor here. Yeah, if you&#39;re sitting on one bench and you&#39;re shouting at the players on the other bench, that&#39;s not the same as being on the field. And that&#39;s what they used to do since 92, since Atwater, since Carville, to use your examples.

I find this story just constantly fascinating from the democratic freedom speech angle that we&#39;ve been hitting on it.

We&#39;ve done the discussion about whether or not we think civil war is likely or probable in the United States. The answer is we think it is.

And 99% of the time, Twitter&#39;s like, hey, that&#39;s fine. And I just don&#39;t think that it&#39;s fine. I think that we are watching the world spin towards something that is going to be more and more problematic.

If it was going to happen, they have to have that conversation. They may also be kind of tempted to take that money, which is still above their stock price.

If it starts becoming a race between Patrick Brown and Pierre Pagliaver, Jean Charest kind of falls back into third, at least in terms of how we start talking about it, that the Brown momentum keeps growing.
