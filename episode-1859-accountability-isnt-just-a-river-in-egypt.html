Even in these meetings, would you classify them as being meetings of depth and kind of substance, or were they directly to the ask i&#39;m kind of curious like if if one type of meeting despite the fail of the campaign one type of meeting unearthed a different type of result sort of thing um because i find that fascinating just as well</span>
