          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about controversies in Stikine in the BC election, political nomination contests and the strategic value of recent moves by Alberta's UCP government and membership. Should Nathan Cullen have apologized? Where do "star candidates" come from? And why is Stephen always so excited for the start of Overrated/Underrated? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Now, it turns out that our good friend Zain Velji both is not good enough and also under contract with CTV to provide election coverage for them that night, and we&#39;re looking for a third wheel that can help provide simple-minded bridging between the genius of Carter and I.

I think we&#39;re at the last two Sundays of the world. So I&#39;m so glad that we find ourselves in this moment where we have so much going on in the American political system. Yet we will talk about almost none of it because we&#39;ll move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Hot Zoom Mic. Guys, I want to talk about what&#39;s happening in BC. We spent a lot of time last week trying to dissect the leaders debate in BC. We were talking about what could perhaps offset this election for John Horgan, who seems to be headed for a promising victory, more than likely majority territory. Well, we have something this week. I don&#39;t know if it offsets it, but I want to talk to you guys about it. And it&#39;s a notable candidate in BC, Nathan Cullen, former NDP MP, former NDP leadership candidate for the federal NDP, now running as a candidate for the provincial NDP in BC. Well, he was caught on a hot mic talking about a BC liberal candidate, about not being well liked in his community, making fun of his nickname. Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you first, and talk to me about this story. Because when we usually, and we rarely have these pre-strategist podcast chats, but you said you wanted to talk about this, or at least floated it. Talk to me about this story and kind of what you make of it broadly. And then I want to dig into some ramifications, not just for this election, but broadly in our politics regarding situations like this.</div>

How about we go this way? let&#39;s talk about the specific of this Nathan Cullen situation and the ramifications of this election. And then I&#39;ll expand out to two topics that I think are interesting. The nomination process, which you brought up, but then this broader notion, which you also brought up, you know, tongue in cheek of, of cancelling candidates, which we&#39;ve seen much more in our politics. And I think that culture on that, especially in the political arena has changed. But Corey, over to you. The question I have for you is, you know, A, what do you make of this incident as this isolated incident with Nathan Cullen? And B, let&#39;s get into the politics of BC. Do you think this does anything for the BC liberals or provides them any sort of opportunity considering how far down they are?</div>

And I think that one of the things I&#39;ll say right off the bat is it probably wouldn&#39;t be seen as much of a scandal at all were it not for the stacking of how Nathan Cullen got his nomination. Because it does, I mean, let&#39;s be frank, it looks a little dodgy. The BCNDP, like the rules, hate the rules, have rules that a equity-seeking group, I believe is how they put it, gets a nomination when a male MLA decides not to seek re-election. And so the</div>

            <div class="said">it does leave a bit of a cloud that perhaps the BC NDP is not as committed to equity and representation by Indigenous groups as, you know, the high-minded, you know, mandates that they create provide. So when you have that as background, and then you have what looks like candidates by Nathan Cullen being rather dismissive of the BC Liberals Indigenous candidate, that&#39;s where the scandal is. It&#39;s just this notion that the BC NDP is somewhat dismissive of Indigenous peoples. The reality is what – at least I will say as much as I can glean from the story, having read about eight different versions of it because I didn&#39;t really get it. Like is Kinkles a slur? I don&#39;t understand. Like that was my first reaction when</div>

I thought, okay, well, what am I not understanding about this story? It just sounds like one candidate being dismissive of another candidate. But what it comes down to, in my opinion, Zane, is simply he&#39;s being dismissive of an Indigenous person when the party has effectively been dismissive of Indigenous peoples. So that&#39;s the stacking and how two non-scandals can become a scandal. And it&#39;s an interesting cautionary tale for how narratives are created.</div>

So this particular case wasn&#39;t necessarily a vetting error. But what does it perhaps elucidate for our listeners? What does a nomination process, if you can even call it that, for a star candidate looks like, for the parachuted candidate looks like, because we&#39;ve talked extensively on this podcast about nomination processes, green light committees, but this is like the short circuit or the shortened pathway. What sort of things do you have to look out for? And what sort of things do you have to mitigate against when introducing a star candidate into a nomination process? Well,</div>

They probably say some stuff, but they don&#39;t have a big enough profile to really make any sort of splash or harm it. But this is a little bit different. Corey, same question to you.

But candidates are not the same as governors, and I don&#39;t mean governors like heads of states.

            <div class="said">We call them star candidates. That&#39;s a broad topic. It just means a very desirable candidate. But they often have roles where they can&#39;t be a public candidate for a year. They can&#39;t fundraise. They can&#39;t sell memberships. Doing so would often require them to step down from their role if it&#39;s like a very senior role at a corporation or in a public body or whatnot. And so they don&#39;t really have a clean shot at a nomination. So parties tend to go through these very disingenuous steps like we have seen here, right? Either, yeah, we talked to 15 people. Nobody wanted it. We had to go to the white man. Sure, I doubt it. I mean, maybe after some persuasion that was the case, or maybe that was a very cherry-picked list. But I seriously doubt that somebody said, NDP nomination, NDP held seat. Yeah, I don&#39;t want that across the board. I&#39;m sure there was a more, shall we say, persuasive conversation that occurred.</div>

And so I guess, I think the real unfortunate thing is, is the kind of the absolutist high minded language, if political parties were just a little more honest and said, yeah, we&#39;re going to appoint occasionally. And I have seen some political parties say, the leader can appoint up to 10 star candidates in their constitution. I think the Alberta party of all parties had that here in alberta uh but you know like if we could just be real about there&#39;s a reason why you might want to hold some writings for some people to be star candidates uh and not over promise and create all of these statements that you can&#39;t live up to i think we would be in a better world carter</div>

            <div class="said">Carter, I wasn&#39;t going to go here, but I might as well. Riddle me this for a second. We rarely kind of give strategic advice to individuals that are not existing politicians or political parties as an academic exercise. What if someone&#39;s listening right now and is thinking of running in a nomination, party agnostic? And let&#39;s just suppose they&#39;re not a star candidate or a parachuted candidate. What are some of the things they need to know? Because it seems like even from what we&#39;re saying that depending on the writing, like disappointment is part of the equation. It&#39;s something you need to have as a scenario that ends up happening. You knock on doors, sell memberships. A year later, you just get punted out with just straight up disappointment. So tell me if there&#39;s any merit going in this direction. But I thought I&#39;d open that up and see if you have any thoughts with your experience and with Corey&#39;s experience being very senior in political parties. and probably having to maybe in some cases deliver bad news to that person that was door knocking for a full fucking year and then was told that, oh, by the way, we already have a star person that we want to put in. So any comments to people or any past experiences I&#39;d just be really curious to hear about?</div>

            <div class="said">And it may sound a little bit trite, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that difficult to be the star. For example, if you&#39;ve been door knocking for a year, if you&#39;re able to actually bring memberships to the table, If you&#39;re actually able to host a leader&#39;s event where you do a fundraiser for the leader, if you&#39;re able to be a political operative where you say, I am part of this political process for the leader and for this team, guess what? You&#39;re a star. Being a star does not mean that you&#39;ve worked, you know, that you&#39;re Bill Morneau and you&#39;ve worked in industry and you&#39;re a millionaire.

Then you become the mayor. Then you become, you know, an MLA or a cabinet minister. Each step along the way brings you more star credibility.

            <div class="said">is something else here that I found interesting, which was comments made by political figures, and how those are tested in the political zeitgeist these days. You know, half a decade ago, Carter, you and I were actively talking about this concept in Alberta called Bozo eruptions. These tweets, these comments made primarily in a past life that got someone one canceled or punted out of a nomination process or out of their outright, you know, general election. And we&#39;ve seen that be a successful strategy in some elections. Carter, you were the beneficiary of a 2012 election here in Alberta where that, I shouldn&#39;t say was the sole reason, but let&#39;s say changed the narrative and helped you guys win that election. You know, in 2019 here in Alberta, it was a large part of the NDP strategy. And so while what Nathan Cullen did was not that. Perhaps what Marcia Lenn, the star liberal candidate, is doing in Toronto Centre in the by-election, some of her past comments have come out of supporting a 9-11 truth or film. So this is not a racist comment. This is not something that she said, you know, that was sexist or demeaning. But, you know, the movement is out to try to cancel her and to try to, like, minimize her. So I wanted to get your general thoughts on where you kind of think political political cancel culture has gone over the last little while? Has it changed from where it was a decade ago? Carter, I know you&#39;d mentioned very recently that one day, you know, these social media, you know, posts that people make will no longer be a fireable offense. Are we getting there? Are we inching towards there? Have we retreated? I&#39;m just kind of curious, maybe using the Cullen and the Lenz story to kind of lead us into that conversation a bit more.</div>

A tweet in anger at someone I think is going to be less controversial.

            <div class="said">Corey, Carter mentioned a few interesting things here, you know, one of which was this concept of clumping. We&#39;ve clumped all sins as being relatively equal in terms of this political cancel culture, right? Like whatever you did, it&#39;s this, you got to get canceled. And And the second part I&#39;d want to introduce is the fatigue of the public, right? We&#39;ve also seen in certain cases, and I think the 2019 provincial election here in Alberta was a good example, the first three or four candidates that the UCP, you know, had remarks or social media comments on, Jason, can he let go? There on after, he didn&#39;t. It just seemed like he made a political calculus that it doesn&#39;t matter, regardless of what the sin was or the gravity of the sin. so any comments from you as to where we kind of sit with our current political culture on this topic yeah</div>

And not that&#39;s not a good thing. That&#39;s, that&#39;s not something that I applaud here. We really do need to find nuance again, you know, the record loses context over time. But some things, you know, the statute of limitations should be longer on certain comments, certain actions absolutely should be considered for a longer period of time.

I mean, I think the elephant in the room in this situation is Donald Trump and what he&#39;s done to our political Overton window of acceptable discourse, comments, etc. But perhaps let&#39;s circle back to what we talked about But initially, if you&#39;re setting up the structure for a 2020 Greenlight Committee, what are some of the base rules or comments that you would consider differently than you did than perhaps when you were running a Greenlight Committee in 2012, eight, nine years ago? What has changed for you that – what&#39;s that bar look like that&#39;s different both from commentary and past behavior, but either from vetting? Maybe finish us off with – and I know I&#39;m putting you on the spot, so I do apologize. But any general thoughts you have as to what a 2020 modernized green light committee looks like would be really fascinating for me to hear. Well,</div>

Then it still exists out there today. And Corey&#39;s point about something that is said today versus something that was said in the past, there should be a distinction from something you said five years ago and something you said yesterday.

But, of course, this person said something that was wrong. We&#39;re all saying something that is wrong, and especially given that the goggles with which we look at this change from time to time.

And that inconsistency is appropriate, because we&#39;re all different human beings, and we all have different situations and circumstances. But I think political parties are just going to say, it&#39;s a lot to ask of our volunteers on a regional basis or even to centralize. We&#39;re just gonna have to set some guidelines around this.

I can&#39;t tell you the number of products that I saw come through development and across my desk when I ran communications for the province. Well, still, you know, under Kenney, talking about the actions that the government of Alberta was taking and had taken on this front, because it&#39;s always been understood that this is a growing requirement in the capital markets and beyond.

There&#39;s all kinds of history of policy being proposed and approved by political parties that is then ignored by the governments that represent those political parties. So I don&#39;t think that this is in any way, shape, or form binding on Jason Kenney. I do think that his ideology leans towards privatization, even if it remains with public administration. My own personal feeling is that public versus private is the wrong argument to be having.</div>

It is by far the largest part of government. I think the government of Alberta is spending about $25 billion of a $55 billion budget this year on health care. And that&#39;s just health care. We call that health care. But there&#39;s so much underneath it. And I am quite opposed to the idea of of two-tier health care and just just uh in general allowing uh the wealthy to get better health care than than uh the non-wealthy but uh the reality is when you when you unpack health care a little bit there are things that you absolutely do not want a profit motive in for sure right it would be crazy diagnostics you don&#39;t want people running you through the door as fast as possible you know uh certain types of care that are ongoing and sustaining you don&#39;t want somebody saying i&#39;m just checking this box and you&#39;re you&#39;re now done and i&#39;m moving on to the next client but there are things in health care that are defined action defined outcome things like taking an x-ray and seeing you have a broken bone and</div>

Trump&#39;s advisors have come out earlier this week, in fact, I believe earlier this weekend, saying that he&#39;s going to tone it down at the next debate, ultimately telegraphing to the media that he&#39;s going to tone it down. You&#39;re going to see a different version of the president. As a political strategy, what are you on an over-under of seven? As a political strategy for Trump, do you feel like this is a winner or not so much?</div>

            <div class="said">then you just look like a fool right and if uh if it is it would have looked that way without the comments ahead of time why not just deal with those expectations where people think trump is going to come in one way and when he acts more reasonable then everybody can write their breathless pieces about this new donald trump who doesn&#39;t act like a total total lunatic caveman here, which is what happens every time this guy shows even the slightest amount of decorum. I don&#39;t know why they would suggest it because all they&#39;re doing is moving their own expectations in a way that if he fails to meet them, we&#39;ll just reinforce narratives instead of defeat narratives.

Last week, we were jostling slightly at Premier Horgan&#39;s comments on Racer Mark saying that he didn&#39;t see color. What score do you give him on a 1-10 for how he&#39;s dealt with that in terms of post-debate? He came up right away saying, that&#39;s not what I meant, that&#39;s not what I heard, seems like it&#39;s a non-issue, but I&#39;m kind of curious what grade or what score you give him um for for spinning and handling that going forward well</div>

Are you in or are you out? on the Trudeau strategy slash policy saying he&#39;s going to target higher immigration despite pandemic travel curbs. So it&#39;s come out saying that the Liberals are targeting to bring in 351,000 new permanent residents in 2021, the most in a century despite COVID. From a political standpoint, what do you think of this? Are you in or out based on all the uncertainty and the border closures, et cetera, that we face?</div>

            <div class="said">I am absolutely in. This is the greatest opportunities Canada&#39;s had to steal a generation of global talent, I think, in my lifetime with America acting the way it is with so many countries across the world, shutting borders, not allowing people to have that experience, not allowing people to come in and join their societies. Let&#39;s do it, man. We&#39;ve got a point system in this country where we give points based on education, your ability to integrate all of that. And I guarantee you those points will be higher than we have seen in years past as we bring in all of the best and the brightest from across the world. Carter,</div>
