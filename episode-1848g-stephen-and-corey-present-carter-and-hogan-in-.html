  <meta name="description" content="Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the allegations of major scandal at Alberta Health Services. What&#39;s to be made of Smith&#39;s statement on the matter? What&#39;s to be made of the NDP response? Can Carter avoid &#34;false, baseless and defamatory&#34; commentary?

<p data-start="129.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> say two gets uh threegin</p>
<p data-start="132.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> threegin going to let's see where are nine down ten Maybe just Alberta in general. You want to talk about Alberta? I</p>
<p data-start="142.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know. What's going on?</p>
<p data-start="144.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> few things in Alberta. You're not even in Alberta, right? I'm</p>
<p data-start="146.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> right? I'm not even in Alberta. I'm in British Columbia right now. Sitting in another hotel room, doing</p>
<p data-start="149.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Sitting</p>
<p data-start="151.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> doing video for</p>
<p data-start="152.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> for the masses with no light.</p>
<p data-start="155.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, we can see that. Yeah. We can half see that.</p>
<p data-start="156.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. We</p>
<p data-start="158.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Well, I feel bad.</p>
<p data-start="160.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. So a few things have been going on in Alberta. But I think the one that we need to anchor this conversation around, because we've talked</p>
<p data-start="166.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> talked a lot about Danielle Smith and her approach to U.S. politics. Maybe we'll get there.</p>
<p data-start="171.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Maybe we won't. Maybe we will. Maybe</p>
<p data-start="172.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> will. Maybe we won't. We're not making any promises to these people.</p>
<p data-start="174.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> not making any promises</p>
<p data-start="176.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Absolutely not. These people</p>
<p data-start="177.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> not. These people don't pay us. Fuck all.</p>
<p data-start="181.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Promises are for people who give us $6 a month. That's exactly right. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="183.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's exactly right.</p>
<p data-start="184.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="186.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> want to skip past that right now, though, and go to what is, I think, maybe one of the bigger stories in Alberta politics, at least because of its potential. You know, we live in a world where people tell us, you know, we're going to do this to throw around rhetoric like this could bring down a government, you know, the divine analogy. This is a government in Saskatchewan where they basically all went to jail. Like these things get thrown around. And most of the time you just kind of roll your eyes and, you know, do one of those jerk off motions if you're Steven. I hate.</p>
<p data-start="213.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I hate. I hate.</p>
<p data-start="213.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> hate. I</p>
<p data-start="214.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> I</p>
<p data-start="216.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I hate. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="216.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="216.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I hate the the</p>
<p data-start="217.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I hate the the everybody calling for everybody's resignation all the time. Yeah, I know.</p>
<p data-start="221.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> time. Yeah, I know. Makes me crazy.</p>
<p data-start="221.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Makes me crazy. You</p>
<p data-start="222.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> You hate it. I hate it. You hate the heated rhetoric of like this. This is it. This is like this is the end of the government.</p>
<p data-start="223.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> hate</p>
<p data-start="226.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> it. This is like this is the end of the government. They are completely without without any morality.</p>
<p data-start="229.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> completely without</p>
<p data-start="233.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I hate that. Because</p>
<p data-start="234.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because usually it's not the end of the government. No. Right. But why don't we get to the actual issue here or at least throw it on the table? Why don't why</p>
<p data-start="239.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> why don't I do this? Hang on. Hey,</p>
<p data-start="241.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Hey,</p>
<p data-start="241.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Corey,</p>
<p data-start="242.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> will you set that up for us?</p>
<p data-start="244.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's</p>
<p data-start="244.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's his angelism.</p>
<p data-start="245.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, look, I mean, the basic allegation, the summary of it is this. It is that the government of Alberta has been directing money. Towards people who have been doing favors for the government of Alberta. I think I can summarize it as simple as that. And the value of me a favor, buddy,</p>
<p data-start="261.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> value of me a favor, buddy, and make sure we don't get sued. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="263.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> sure we don't get sued. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="265.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, that's a good idea. So,</p>
<p data-start="265.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's a good idea. So, yeah,</p>
<p data-start="267.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah, that's</p>
<p data-start="267.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's</p>
<p data-start="268.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's the allegation. Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p data-start="270.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> And this allegation is in many ways unspooled in a letter from former CEO of Alberta Health Services. Who is a former colleague of mine. Right. Worked with her at the government of Alberta.</p>
<p data-start="284.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> And many former colleagues of mine. Are involved in this story in some way, shape or form. So, I don't know if I want to get into like the specific details here. Right.</p>
<p data-start="292.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> But. That's good. We're not detail people.</p>
<p data-start="295.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, it's actually great cover. It's great cover for not knowing any of the details.</p>
<p data-start="295.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="295.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="295.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, it's actually great</p>
<p data-start="298.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> not knowing any of the details. The detail guys. No. That's right. No. This</p>
<p data-start="301.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's right.</p>
<p data-start="303.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is the strategists.</p>
<p data-start="305.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> It's about half a billion dollars, though. It's suggested in contracts for private surgeries. Right. Being directed towards people who have shown favor to the government. And in fact. It is a business leader who is</p>
<p data-start="320.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> is tied to the Turkish Tylenol mini scandal here in Alberta. That's at the center of it. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="325.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. I mean, maybe. Not a mini scandal. A legitimate scandal. Seventy five million dollars for a product that was really never received and never used.</p>
<p data-start="333.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, look, we can get into the definition of scandal. I mean, I think it's a bit of a bit of an outrage that, you know, the cost per dose was so expensive. And we ordered more doses than we could possibly need as a province. And we ordered it in a way that it wouldn't come. Until after we needed it. All of that, I believe. I mean, we actually covered that in real time. We did. This wasn't even like after the fact saying how crazy this was. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="344.1"><strong>Unknown:</strong> province.</p>
<p data-start="351.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> We did. This</p>
<p data-start="355.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. We</p>
<p data-start="355.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> We said it at the time.</p>
<p data-start="357.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> But there was never the suggestion at the time that money was like flowing in ways that were improper. I guess that's what I'm trying to say when I say mini scandal.</p>
<p data-start="366.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, there's no time.</p>
<p data-start="368.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="370.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Now there's a suggestion, or at least there's the insinuation out there that that money is flowing in ways. That are improper because this, you know, the heart of it is this skybox where, you know, you can watch hockey games from that the people are invited to and all that. I don't really want to get into like the very specific things, mostly because the premier has already threatened to sue people. Yeah. You were alluding to that.</p>
<p data-start="393.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. You were</p>
<p data-start="394.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Premier Smith, if you're listening, our good friend, Kerry Tate is who you're supposed to sue. Not Corey and I. Corey and I are approaching this, in fact, as though Premier Smith is innocent. Mostly to avoid litigation. Well,</p>
<p data-start="405.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Mostly to avoid litigation.</p>
<p data-start="406.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, look, I actually think that's a pretty good frame because like we only know what we know. We only see what's in the media here. But the long story short is all of these allegations are floating around. Other conversations around the side as to what this might potentially mean. But after many days of silence where even the usually reliable boosters,</p>
<p data-start="425.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> boosters,</p>
<p data-start="427.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> boosters, shall we say, at Post Media were giving the gears to the premier and saying, what is this? What does this mean? And you're right. Kerry Tate broke the story in the Globe and Mail. Credit where credit's due. But the premier released a statement on Twitter on X on Saturday.</p>
<p data-start="444.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> And it was an interesting statement. I mean, I've I've</p>
<p data-start="447.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> I've not read statements like this in a while.</p>
<p data-start="451.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> How can I say this? Like we</p>
<p data-start="453.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> we were talking a little bit about this before here.</p>
<p data-start="455.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Again,</p>
<p data-start="457.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> we're working from the frame. Premier innocent does</p>
<p data-start="460.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> does not actually inspire a lot of confidence that that is the case. Right. Like some of the word choices are crazy. And so this is sort of what I'm Corey.</p>
<p data-start="470.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Don't</p>
<p data-start="470.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Don't get us sued.</p>
<p data-start="471.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know. I know. I'm trying to walk a line. Walk the line,</p>
<p data-start="473.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> line. Walk the line, brother. Walk the line. But I got</p>
<p data-start="476.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> got to say, like, teach you how to do it. You know, so the line, the line in it. Maybe I'll maybe I'll just very quickly. You know, it's not long enough that I can't read it. So let me read it. I'll skip over some. Show</p>
<p data-start="476.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> to say, like, teach you</p>
<p data-start="486.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> me read it. I'll skip</p>
<p data-start="488.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Show us your reading proficiency. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="489.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I have read various media stories containing allegations regarding the procurement and contracting processes of AHS. That's all. Alberta Health Services. They are troubling allegations and they should be reviewed as quickly as possible. To that end, I will be writing the Auditor General, Doug Wiley, to ask for an expedited review and his</p>
<p data-start="506.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> findings on the issue. I have also directed my officials to ensure that any request for information from Mr. Wiley or his office is dealt with on a fully transparent and expedited basis. We need to get to the bottom of this issue quickly to identify any potential wrongdoing, correct it, address it appropriately. OK, so far, so good. Right. Here's where it starts to get a little bit stranger. Right. I have also asked that AHS's internal reviews be completed as quickly as possible and delivered directly to me so we can study the results and make improvements or adjustments to these processes. Until these findings are delivered, AHS has paused</p>
<p data-start="538.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> paused the contracting of surgical facilities under review.</p>
<p data-start="542.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> And here's where it gets strangest still. As premier, I was not involved in any wrongdoing. Any insinuation to the contrary is false, baseless and defamatory. It then goes on to say, basically, hey, I like I like. Trying to change AHS and deliver quality, timely health care. That's my goal. I'm not going to bother going into that last paragraph. That's, in my opinion, boilerplate. But two things which I kind of paused on. But let's let's really call them out. Yeah. One is this is really serious. So I've asked for the review to come directly to me. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="568.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> But let's let's really call</p>
<p data-start="573.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> So I've</p>
<p data-start="575.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Right.</p>
<p data-start="575.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. Got to see it first.</p>
<p data-start="577.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Got to see this review. Got to see this review. Send it to me. Send me</p>
<p data-start="578.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> to see this review. Got</p>
<p data-start="580.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> this review. Send</p>
<p data-start="581.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Send me an index so I can see where my name is mentioned. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="584.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, exactly. And the</p>
<p data-start="586.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> the other is, as premier, I was not involved in any wrongdoing. You know, it doesn't say there was no wrongdoing. It doesn't say even I was unaware of any wrongdoing. I was not involved in any wrongdoing.</p>
<p data-start="593.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> It doesn't</p>
<p data-start="599.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> And then any insinuation. I mean, this is like, especially for a public figure, knowing where the bar is on this. Oh, man.</p>
<p data-start="605.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, man. Yeah. Any insinuation</p>
<p data-start="606.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Any insinuation is false,</p>
<p data-start="608.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> false, baseless and defamatory. How is</p>
<p data-start="610.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> How is she going to sue? I mean, thank</p>
<p data-start="613.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> thank God we're taking the position. That she's innocent because she's going to sue everybody if if if she's worried about the defamatory statements that have been made so far, because this is a this is one of those scandals that, you</p>
<p data-start="627.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, money is not going in the direction that it's supposed to go and being directed to spend money by the government of Alberta to AHS. I</p>
<p data-start="636.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, well, and</p>
<p data-start="636.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> and the suggestion is that her chief of staff at the time was at the heart of it. Right. Which which not had Nancy and the Alberta. When they were going against this, you know, railing against this said effectively either</p>
<p data-start="641.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="650.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> either she</p>
<p data-start="651.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> she knew and that's a very bad thing or she didn't. And that's a certain level of incompetence. I'm paraphrasing Nancy at this point. Right. Yeah. But, you know, the</p>
<p data-start="659.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> the insinuation thing is pretty wild, too. Like, that's an interesting bar. That's an interesting interpretation. But OK, so that's all on the table now. Right.</p>
<p data-start="666.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Let's talk strategy. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="668.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, strategy. OK.</p>
<p data-start="669.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> OK.</p>
<p data-start="670.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> First thing. I have my thoughts. I want to get yours first.</p>
<p data-start="673.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> First. How does a statement like this. This get written.</p>
<p data-start="676.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, my God. You go and I'll go. I had. You go and then I go. I</p>
<p data-start="677.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> You go and I'll go. I had. You go and then I go. I had so many scandals. I</p>
<p data-start="681.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I had so many.</p>
<p data-start="681.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> so many. You were at least a few scandals. Well, we</p>
<p data-start="685.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, we know in fairness, I was not the biggest ones.</p>
<p data-start="690.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean, if you recall, we had the no meat committee. Do</p>
<p data-start="693.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Do you remember? Do you remember the no meat committee? The no meat committee for those just joining us was</p>
<p data-start="693.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> remember? Do you remember the no meat committee? The no meat</p>
<p data-start="694.7"><strong>Unknown:</strong> meat</p>
<p data-start="696.6"><strong>Unknown:</strong> us</p>
<p data-start="696.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> us was</p>
<p data-start="697.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> was in 2011, 2010. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="700.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. When</p>
<p data-start="700.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="700.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> When a committee for the elections. I believe was supposed to meet every month and every every MLA would get a thousand dollars stipend for attending those meetings. Unfortunately, the meetings never occurred.</p>
<p data-start="714.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Fortunately, the</p>
<p data-start="715.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Fortunately,</p>
<p data-start="715.7"><strong>Unknown:</strong> Fortunately,</p>
<p data-start="716.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the money did. And</p>
<p data-start="717.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> And</p>
<p data-start="717.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> And everybody got paid. Everybody</p>
<p data-start="717.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> And everybody got</p>
<p data-start="718.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Everybody got paid, baby.</p>
<p data-start="722.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> maybe not the scandal. It sounds like because everybody got the same number of committee appointments. Right. Right. So people were paid based on committee assignments. But the reality was it was everybody just got paid. It was</p>
<p data-start="730.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> everybody just got paid. It was just a top up on pay.</p>
<p data-start="731.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> a top</p>
<p data-start="731.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> top</p>
<p data-start="733.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> None. None. None. None. None. None. None. Nonetheless, we did have to write a similar type of statement that said, you know, we</p>
<p data-start="735.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Nonetheless, we</p>
<p data-start="739.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> we and we had to give all the money back. We said we're going to give back all the money. And that was, you know, that was our way out of it. But the point is, everybody's hands on deck when you're writing that statement. You're writing that statement with the input of lawyers. You're writing that statement with the input of of the government. You're making sure that everybody's covered off so that you're not sounding like you have committed a fraud. Because</p>
<p data-start="766.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> you sound like you've committed a fraud, I'll tell you something. The next call is to the police.</p>
<p data-start="771.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Yeah. And the police come in and they knock on your door. We didn't commit a fraud.</p>
<p data-start="771.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="775.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> We just took some money that we weren't entitled to. That was important. Maybe the phrasing on that was a little off. The phrasing.</p>
<p data-start="781.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> little off. The phrasing. That was not. That was not great. But I, you</p>
<p data-start="783.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="783.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="784.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="784.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know, I think you know what I mean.</p>
<p data-start="785.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean.</p>
<p data-start="785.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> I do know what you mean. And it was interesting because on that no meet committee, MLAs from all parties were caught up in it. Like, Raj Sherman and David Swan were both on it. For the Liberals, they both wrote checks back as a result. But, you know, like, realistically, it was just part of their MLA salary. Like, it was just structured in such a way that committee meetings were a separate line item. But but</p>
<p data-start="806.0"><strong>Unknown:</strong> it was a big thing. It was a huge thing in Alberta. It became a</p>
<p data-start="807.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> thing in Alberta. It became a scandal. It really is the moment where Alison Redford went from will she get 87 out of 87 seats to will she win this election, which, I mean, you both you and I remember very well.</p>
<p data-start="819.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> We were running different campaigns. It was</p>
<p data-start="819.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> campaigns. It was polling so badly that when we presented the polling findings to caucuses, we were told it was a push poll.</p>
<p data-start="828.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Caucus is, you know, kings of denial, in</p>
<p data-start="830.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> in my experience.</p>
<p data-start="830.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> in my experience. Well, it was</p>
<p data-start="831.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, it was an IVR. So I think they meant IVR and they just thought it was a push button. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="835.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. And</p>
<p data-start="836.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> And they don't know what a push poll is. I</p>
<p data-start="837.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, that's really possible. I mean, your profession is</p>
<p data-start="838.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's really possible. I mean, your profession is politics. Why would you know that?</p>
<p data-start="842.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. Can we can you say something really interesting? Because you talked about like lawyers and communicators in the room. Can I say, in my experience, in government and in politics, which is, you know, it's you know, not insignificant, you know, I've been here for a few of those statements myself. There is a difference between a statement written by communicators run by lawyers and a statement written by lawyers run by communicators. But also, if</p>
<p data-start="863.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="863.9"><strong>Unknown:</strong> and</p>
<p data-start="863.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> and a</p>
<p data-start="864.0"><strong>Unknown:</strong> a</p>
<p data-start="870.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> if it's not that serious, it tends to be the communicators take first pen. And when it's deathly serious, the lawyers take the first pen. So this</p>
<p data-start="877.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> this feels to me like a lawyer's run by communicator statement. Absolutely. Not communicators run by lawyers. The lawyer wrote this first. The lawyer wrote this first and made</p>
<p data-start="880.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Absolutely. Not communicators run by lawyers. The lawyer wrote this first. The lawyer wrote this first and made sure that the death, you know, that the deniability was in there. We wouldn't have put that in.</p>
<p data-start="883.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> made sure that</p>
<p data-start="890.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> We wouldn't have put that in because it implies a certain amount of guilt, a certain deposit. I mean, especially when you parse the statement and you kind of go, hang on for a second here. It doesn't say she didn't know. It doesn't say like we wouldn't have put it in.</p>
<p data-start="893.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> deposit. I mean,</p>
<p data-start="902.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We would have allowed</p>
<p data-start="903.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> allowed people</p>
<p data-start="904.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> people to to reach the conclusion by</p>
<p data-start="906.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> by writing something else. Right. One of the things that's missing is we don't have a scapegoat. You</p>
<p data-start="912.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know, a good political communicator would be pointing a finger somewhere else so fast your fucking head would spin.</p>
<p data-start="918.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="919.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, I</p>
<p data-start="920.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> I think I think it would be pretty easy to say. We all know AHS has been pretty chaotic and we all know that there's been troubles along there. But a lawyer is going to say, you</p>
<p data-start="928.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> you have your fucking mind. You can't you can't</p>
<p data-start="928.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> have your fucking</p>
<p data-start="929.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> you can't point the finger at the AHS and its problems. We're</p>
<p data-start="931.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> at</p>
<p data-start="933.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> problems. We're already in a situation where people are sending letters through lawyers like this was a leak of a letter that Athena sent.</p>
<p data-start="940.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Basically, with 44 pages. Alleging these things. Right. Oh, absolutely. You know, as part of a dispute over her being terminated by AHS. Well,</p>
<p data-start="947.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, and that's just it, too. Like, why Terminator? Like why?</p>
<p data-start="952.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Why are you taking these types of actions in order to like if you're trying to protect yourself, you're doing the opposite of protecting yourself. I</p>
<p data-start="957.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> the opposite</p>
<p data-start="959.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, this is the other challenge with it all. And we we really breezed past it. But apparently some of this was known a little bit earlier. These concerns were brought by the CEO of Alberta Health. Athena. Metzalopoulos.</p>
<p data-start="973.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> To the board. The board was poised to vote on it. The board was let go. She was let go. I mean, there</p>
<p data-start="980.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> there are I'll just say from inside government, sometimes these things happen because you're like, oh, my Lord, this person's off their rocker. Now, that's not been my experience with Athena, just to be clear. But like sometimes them doing these things is the thing that makes you say, OK, they got to go. Right. Right. Right.</p>
<p data-start="997.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1001.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> it's a little weird. Well,</p>
<p data-start="1002.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well,</p>
<p data-start="1002.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> you</p>
<p data-start="1002.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you ever go fishing with dynamite?</p>
<p data-start="1005.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, no, no, no. I mean, does anyone do that? It's pretty crazy thing to do. It</p>
<p data-start="1010.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> It is a pretty crazy thing to do. But this is the political equivalent of going fishing with dynamite. Everybody</p>
<p data-start="1016.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Everybody who's touching this that's not guilty is getting hit with the dynamite.</p>
<p data-start="1021.0"><strong>Unknown:</strong> Yeah, right.</p>
<p data-start="1021.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> right. Everybody else is is trying to like they</p>
<p data-start="1025.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> they didn't come up with any scapegoats. They didn't push any any. Like this just doesn't make any. any sense from a political point of view i'm completely flummoxed by it i'm also completely flummoxed by the apparent lack of ethics um which uh has has to govern and govern you know government requires ethics and uh you know the old wild rose used to rail against it right yeah and</p>
<p data-start="1050.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah and</p>
<p data-start="1050.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> and the wild rose crazies are now in charge and now they think they get to rob the piggy bank can</p>
<p data-start="1056.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> can i just say like can i just paint a picture of this not being the government's malfeasance can i just can we throw that out there just so i can oh get it on the record sure</p>
<p data-start="1064.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> sure what</p>
<p data-start="1065.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> what and when we're doing it is the color of the sky pink all</p>
<p data-start="1065.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> and when</p>
<p data-start="1070.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> right so obviously there were procurement challenges maybe they were isolated to one person in terms of uh the the the board and the ceo maybe the government had soured on the ceo maybe things were awkward maybe at that point the ceo starts trying to to create almost a reason like look at this this happens</p>
<p data-start="1089.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> happens in jobs i'm certainly not saying it happened here okay just want to be crystal clear on this uh but then they say oh she's got to go and so uh many people will know that andre trombley is the deputy minister of alberta health is the administrator of alberta health services having replaced the board and the interim ceo of alberta health services he's right do</p>
<p data-start="1090.7"><strong>Unknown:</strong> i'm certainly not</p>
<p data-start="1110.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> do you think he gets all three checks that's it's like</p>
<p data-start="1112.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's it's like pokemon he's gonna catch them all right uh i know andre pretty well i've known i worked with him for a long time um a pretty competent guy i just have to say but you could easily imagine where they say oh geez well she's got to go so uh we will just replace her and actually andre we wouldn't mind you being the administrator too now that's where it's a bit of a jump like why but the minute you do that half half the board of ahs is deputy ministers like colleagues of andrew yeah andre so at that point do you not just say well that's an awkward situation so we'd have to let half the board go anyways so why don't we just make andre in charge you know charitable</p>
<p data-start="1144.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah andre</p>
<p data-start="1153.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> charitable read but</p>
<p data-start="1155.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> but that's my charitable read right now yeah so</p>
<p data-start="1156.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah so</p>
<p data-start="1156.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> so if that's what happened and that's how we ended up here is that so crazy yes</p>
<p data-start="1160.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> yes it is crazy it</p>
<p data-start="1162.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> it is it is nuts it is not the way that this the the things that's weird for</p>
<p data-start="1165.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's weird for sure because</p>
<p data-start="1166.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> sure because you</p>
<p data-start="1168.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know souring</p>
<p data-start="1169.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> souring on the ceo is one thing souring on the board is another thing yeah i've</p>
<p data-start="1172.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah i've</p>
<p data-start="1173.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> i've seen both of those things happen And, you know what, ginning up a reason to hold on to your job is a skill I never acquired.</p>
<p data-start="1175.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> And,</p>
<p data-start="1176.1"><strong>Unknown:</strong> And,</p>
<p data-start="1184.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, that's a real failing of yours. Yeah, it's a failing of mine</p>
<p data-start="1185.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yours. Yeah, it's a failing of mine particularly.</p>
<p data-start="1187.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> But,</p>
<p data-start="1188.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, I mean, this</p>
<p data-start="1191.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> doesn't strike me as something that's ginned up to hold on to a job. This strikes me as something that is legitimate and real. And when you put everything else into that filter, then the legitimacy and the realness of this takes apart, takes away from the capacity to say, you know, this is something that could have happened through non.</p>
<p data-start="1211.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> non.</p>
<p data-start="1213.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, so let's just clean up what you said. Like when you say legitimate and real, we don't know what it is. But like we're saying there's smoke. It's strange. It's certainly not proper in terms of process and procedure, even if it's not illegal. That's what you mean at this case, right? Because we don't know. We don't know enough to make the broader claim, the</p>
<p data-start="1230.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> the litigious claim. I see red and blue lights. I see red and blue lights in the future here. Don't</p>
<p data-start="1230.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> the litigious claim. I</p>
<p data-start="1236.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Don't you?</p>
<p data-start="1236.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> No. Jesus Christ. Just stop. Just stop. You</p>
<p data-start="1238.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just</p>
<p data-start="1238.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just stop.</p>
<p data-start="1240.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="1240.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="1240.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> You don't see</p>
<p data-start="1240.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> see that?</p>
<p data-start="1240.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> see that?</p>
<p data-start="1242.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Like in all seriousness. We just don't know. No, I don't. You're so afraid of getting sued. I've been sued. It's not that hard. It's</p>
<p data-start="1243.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> all seriousness. We just don't know. No, I don't. You're</p>
<p data-start="1248.4"><strong>Unknown:</strong> sued.</p>
<p data-start="1248.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> sued. It's</p>
<p data-start="1248.8"><strong>Unknown:</strong> It's</p>
<p data-start="1250.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's not that hard.</p>
<p data-start="1252.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're not doing that.</p>
<p data-start="1255.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay, so back to the situation. Like we're going to continue with our frame of like, what should the government have done? So we talked a little bit about it. We deconstructed. We talked about statement written by communicators run by lawyers versus statement written by lawyers run by communicators. Anything else you want to say on that before you want to say what this should have been?</p>
<p data-start="1273.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, I think the</p>
<p data-start="1275.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> the question is really predicated on whether or not the premier feels she's innocent, which</p>
<p data-start="1280.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> which we have stipulated as part of this program. You know, for the purposes of this program, she's completely innocent. In which case, she needs to do more than just a simple tweet demanding that a report be laid upon her desk and that the Auditor General get involved. If there is</p>
<p data-start="1297.8"><strong>Unknown:</strong> If there</p>
<p data-start="1300.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> is no merit to the complaint, then there's no problem calling the police. Right? Why wouldn't you call the police? Call the fire down on your own hole. Right? Like, let's go. Let's make sure that this thing is absolutely 100% clear. And it's not like they can be expectant. It's not like they can be expected to actually finish the investigation before your next election anyways. There's only two and a half years.</p>
<p data-start="1324.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm anticipating that it's going to take at least, what, three, four years to get through this based on the current speed and progress of the RCMP on other investigations that are political in nature. This feels like it's, you know, if the premier honestly didn't know what's going on, then she should be absolutely furious that one of her staff put</p>
<p data-start="1345.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> put her in a position. Where she could go down for it.</p>
<p data-start="1349.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, again, allegedly. A</p>
<p data-start="1349.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> again, allegedly. A</p>
<p data-start="1351.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> A staffer's job is to protect the principal.</p>
<p data-start="1354.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> And this is the exact opposite of protecting the principal.</p>
<p data-start="1355.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> the exact</p>
<p data-start="1358.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Allegedly.</p>
<p data-start="1360.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Allegedly.</p>
<p data-start="1361.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> So.</p>
<p data-start="1362.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Allegedly.</p>
<p data-start="1364.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, I think that you've unspooled a lot that's true there. Right? I'm not so convinced I would call in the RCMP. I'm not really sure I want to create the precedent that whenever I'm accused of something, I'm calling in the RCMP. You've</p>
<p data-start="1376.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> RCMP. You've been accused of. You've been accused of things for the last 18 months. For the last two years, you've been accused of things. This is not new to be accused of things. Being accused of something that has this type of connotation is new. Is</p>
<p data-start="1376.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> been accused</p>
<p data-start="1387.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> new. Is</p>
<p data-start="1388.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Is new.</p>
<p data-start="1390.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> It is beyond the pale. A half billion dollars worth of expenditures. One fifth of which, or 75 million of which, every</p>
<p data-start="1390.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> beyond</p>
<p data-start="1400.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> every Albertan knows was lunacy.</p>
<p data-start="1405.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is. Well, let's.</p>
<p data-start="1407.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is. This is the Tylenol. The children's Tylenol. It was absolute lunacy. Right. And now you put it all together and you tied it together with the red string. And it's not really that much red string.</p>
<p data-start="1416.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> string.</p>
<p data-start="1417.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, can I say this is actually what I think is one of the challenges that Danielle Smith has is let's just say if let's just say something happened. It doesn't even need to be like the biggest things that are claimed. Right. With her staff and all of that.</p>
<p data-start="1430.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> If this becomes a thing, if there are red and blue lights at any point, even if she was 100 miles away from this particular situation. The challenge she has between the hockey tickets and the Turkish Tylenol is that people are just going to they're going to do the red string thing and they're going to say, well, like, look at all of these connections here. Like, it's just it's way, you know, it is character. It is known associates. Right. Like, I mean, it's like one of those things in like a police procedural. This is a known associate of Danielle Smith. I</p>
<p data-start="1458.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I said to a friend of mine today that everybody's going to get painted with the same brush, even if all they did was take a ticket to the to the box.</p>
<p data-start="1466.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. They're going to be treated to whatever is found to be the worst sin committed by the cohort.</p>
<p data-start="1471.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. I mean, that's the risk. Yeah. Whatever</p>
<p data-start="1473.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Whatever the cohort has done to this stage, everybody who's going to be guilty of the same sin because they were playing for the same team.</p>
<p data-start="1478.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> they were</p>
<p data-start="1480.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, Danielle Smith is very much in the splash zone. I guess we would both agree. Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1484.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. So</p>
<p data-start="1486.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> So the challenge that is, let's go back to this statement here and some of the conversation that was had. How do you get out of the splash zone in that situation? I don't think this statement does that.</p>
<p data-start="1497.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, the statement doesn't go nearly far enough. First of all, I think you need to have you need to make sure that you're painting a villain.</p>
<p data-start="1504.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Whoever the villain is going to be. There are two people in any good story. There is a protagonist and an antagonist. If you want to be the protagonist, you must define who the antagonist is. That is the very I mean, simple literature, reading your kids a story at night. There's a good guy and there's a bad. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1521.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1521.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. You're going to tell a story to your kids in the car to make the long trip exciting. They're the good guys. There's a bad guy. Good guy. Oh, triumphs over bad guy. So</p>
<p data-start="1531.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> So Danielle did not set that up. She needed to have a bad guy or at least a potential bad guy.</p>
<p data-start="1537.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> And she didn't do that.</p>
<p data-start="1539.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And the the this the second piece is she really didn't tell us much of a story at all.</p>
<p data-start="1545.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Remembering that we this one of our constant criticisms of Rachel Notley. We learn by stories. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1552.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. The story that is being told now by Nahid Nenshi. Right. Isn't that good a story, but it's still much more of a story than Danielle Smith told us. Danielle Smith should have told us the story of a AHS that's out of control, an AHS that was in in being run by people</p>
<p data-start="1571.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> people who didn't have the competence or the character to make sure that this type of stuff didn't happen.</p>
<p data-start="1577.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And,</p>
<p data-start="1578.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, this is clearly</p>
<p data-start="1580.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> clearly an AHS problem.</p>
<p data-start="1582.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> But I think that one of the reasons she didn't tell us this, Corey. Corey, can I whisper it to you?</p>
<p data-start="1591.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, no, no, no. Listen, it's</p>
<p data-start="1594.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> If you whisper something,</p>
<p data-start="1594.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> If you whisper something, you</p>
<p data-start="1595.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> you can't get sued for it. Right. Can I make a broader point? Sure. About this? Please. Can I make it broad? Please.</p>
<p data-start="1599.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> About this? Please.</p>
<p data-start="1600.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Can</p>
<p data-start="1602.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> When you are constructing a statement like this, one of the challenges you you have is you worry about where it might go and you don't want to put yourself into a corner. You don't want to make statements. You don't want to make statements that you're then going to have to walk back. Right. You're trying to make it durable because, you know, what they always say is like it's the cover up that kills. But like in this case, the broader point is like if you say something and then tomorrow you have to say the opposite because you were just loose with your words, it starts to look like a cover up, even if it was just an accidental fuck up. So when I say it's the lawyers run by communicators, that's when language gets super tight. When it gets super specific, you can't say that. You can't say that. You don't know that for sure. You absolutely must stick to this line very carefully. Here and and so I've</p>
<p data-start="1649.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> I've been on the inside there. You've been on the inside there. What often happens is you sit and you don't know where the next hits coming from. You don't want the next shoe to drop is you don't know what information might be out there that you don't know. Or sometimes you either is information out there that you do know and you don't know if anybody else knows it. And it creates very, very interesting, very narrow communications. For the purposes</p>
<p data-start="1669.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> For the purposes of this podcast, we were assuming she was innocent.</p>
<p data-start="1673.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> I still am. You know, like I think,</p>
<p data-start="1675.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think,</p>
<p data-start="1675.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> think, but if she's innocent, then she's not worried about the information that she doesn't know because</p>
<p data-start="1680.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> because she knows that she</p>
<p data-start="1680.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> because she knows that she knows that she hasn't done any. There's no wrongdoing on her behalf.</p>
<p data-start="1686.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> No, no, no, no, no. I disagree with that because I think even if you're sitting there knowing you did nothing like listen to the police came to my house today and said, we want to talk to you about a bank heist that happened in downtown Calgary. Where were you at this time? Okay, thank you very much. I'm going to go on my way. And then it started to be reported out. They're like, oh, there's a bank heist. And it looks like Stephen Carter might be involved. And Corey Hogan's a known associate of Stephen Carter, right? Yeah. I'm putting out a statement. I'm going to be like, I wasn't involved at all.</p>
<p data-start="1715.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Am I putting out a statement that says, and Stephen's innocent too?</p>
<p data-start="1718.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, no,</p>
<p data-start="1719.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> no, no, no, no. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1721.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="1721.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. But</p>
<p data-start="1721.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> But just for the record, I'd have lawyered up really quickly instead.</p>
<p data-start="1722.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> for the record,</p>
<p data-start="1725.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'd be dollar bill stern, baby.</p>
<p data-start="1728.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Lawyer. Because I don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1729.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1729.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Lawyer.</p>
<p data-start="1731.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Because I don't know. Because you don't know. So if you're Danielle Smith.</p>
<p data-start="1731.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Because you don't know.</p>
<p data-start="1733.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> if you're Danielle Smith.</p>
<p data-start="1734.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Lawyer.</p>
<p data-start="1736.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> You only know what you know.</p>
<p data-start="1737.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1738.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> But here's the thing. You don't know what</p>
<p data-start="1738.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> here's the thing. You don't know what other people are doing. If</p>
<p data-start="1739.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> If you don't know what other people are doing and you think that they've been doing something wrong, that's</p>
<p data-start="1744.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> that's where you're fucked.</p>
<p data-start="1746.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> That's where you're fucked.</p>
<p data-start="1748.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's where I'm fucked in this story too then. Because like, you clearly robbed that bank.</p>
<p data-start="1752.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I obviously would rob a bank. I'm a bank robber.</p>
<p data-start="1755.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Because my face is so, you</p>
<p data-start="1755.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Because</p>
<p data-start="1758.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> know. So generic white guy. Generic white guy. It'd be like, could you imagine trying to pick me out of a lineup? They'd have like five. Five of us. And we'd all look the exact same.</p>
<p data-start="1758.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> So generic</p>
<p data-start="1758.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> generic white guy. Generic white guy. It'd</p>
<p data-start="1766.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Dominic Cummings would go down for your crime. Dominic</p>
<p data-start="1768.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Dominic Cummings. Mike Bullard. Oh, he's dead.</p>
<p data-start="1769.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Mike Bullard.</p>
<p data-start="1772.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, it's perfect Patsy then. Patsy! Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1774.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Patsy! Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1775.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1775.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Aaron O'Toole. Aaron</p>
<p data-start="1776.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Aaron O'Toole goes down for this. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1778.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. I mean, there's thousands. Absolutely. Thousands of us.</p>
<p data-start="1781.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> us.</p>
<p data-start="1781.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> us.</p>
<p data-start="1782.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> But, you know, so like you do get in a place. But like, let's go back to this statement and dissect it. This to me shows it's a premier's office that doesn't feel fully in control of the issue. Doesn't have a full sense of what the facts are. Doesn't know what's going to get out there next. Yeah. That is how it's written right now. Of course. I agree. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1797.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> course. I</p>
<p data-start="1799.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Which</p>
<p data-start="1799.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Which then, you</p>
<p data-start="1801.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, so allowing</p>
<p data-start="1802.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> allowing that statement to go out when you don't know. When you don't know what the next thing is. That's a problem.</p>
<p data-start="1808.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Like, you can't. Like, she's made it worse before making it better.</p>
<p data-start="1813.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Well, and here's the other challenge she has. Because we've talked about just the words here. But this is the only thing she said on this. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1819.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. That's</p>
<p data-start="1819.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's the other challenge. My understanding is she is slash wasn't panicked. She's now in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p data-start="1826.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="1826.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> She has made many statements about the U.S. tariff situation, both before and after. If you go on her feed, you'll see all of those have pictures and they're designed to look big on the feed. And this one's designed to look small on the feed. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1836.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> the feed.</p>
<p data-start="1841.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> And it's starting to feel a bit absurd. It's starting to feel a bit absurd that a half a billion dollar allegation has only been addressed in this particular fashion. Doesn't it?</p>
<p data-start="1849.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> Doesn't it? Oh,</p>
<p data-start="1850.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, absolutely. I mean, that's a lot of money. Like.</p>
<p data-start="1853.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Like.</p>
<p data-start="1853.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I mean, that's one of those numbers that's so big people have trouble processing the.</p>
<p data-start="1858.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, yeah. The size of the challenge here.</p>
<p data-start="1858.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1862.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Well, let's just say for shits and giggles, you</p>
<p data-start="1864.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you and I were involved in a fraud that had about 500 billion or 500 million dollars. Sure.</p>
<p data-start="1868.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Sure. Absolutely. Just, you know, allegedly.</p>
<p data-start="1871.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Allegedly. First of all, we would be we'd be small minnows.</p>
<p data-start="1874.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Yeah. We</p>
<p data-start="1874.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. We</p>
<p data-start="1875.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We wouldn't be doing the whole thing. We're just going to get a small. What</p>
<p data-start="1878.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> What are we going to get? Two percent. We're just going to</p>
<p data-start="1879.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're just going to wet our beak. Yeah. Two percent each. Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1882.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Ten million dollars each. Ten</p>
<p data-start="1882.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Ten</p>
<p data-start="1886.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> million bucks. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1888.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. We're</p>
<p data-start="1888.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> We're not. We're not. We're not people who we're not overly greedy. Two</p>
<p data-start="1892.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Two percent feels good to us. Yeah. Take two points on the back end.</p>
<p data-start="1894.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Take two</p>
<p data-start="1896.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Sure. Oh, my God. That's pretty modest. And that's ten million dollars. Right. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1901.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. This is exactly when it gets to numbers this big.</p>
<p data-start="1905.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> And what do you think the profit line would have looked like on that seventy five million dollar Tylenol deal?</p>
<p data-start="1911.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Well, let's not even bring that. Let's not even bring that one in. Right. We just don't know enough about it. But like the point is now. I'm just saying, what does</p>
<p data-start="1915.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> is now. I'm just saying, what does the profit line look like on that? Like,</p>
<p data-start="1916.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> the profit line look</p>
<p data-start="1918.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Like, what is the incentive? It's got to be a hundred percent margin.</p>
<p data-start="1918.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> what is the</p>
<p data-start="1919.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> incentive? It's got to be a hundred percent margin. At</p>
<p data-start="1920.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> At least a hundred percent. It has to be a hundred</p>
<p data-start="1921.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> percent. It has to be a hundred percent margin. At least a hundred</p>
<p data-start="1923.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> At least a hundred percent margin.</p>
<p data-start="1925.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Given that the government was over a barrel. Yeah. Wanted these things in a hurry. Was willing to take these extraordinary steps. Has to be. Has</p>
<p data-start="1931.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Has</p>
<p data-start="1931.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Has to</p>
<p data-start="1932.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> to be.</p>
<p data-start="1932.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> And also just looking at margins. Like pharmaceutical margins can be like 90 percent in some cases. Exactly.</p>
<p data-start="1937.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Exactly. Not usually</p>
<p data-start="1937.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Exactly. Not usually for a commodity like Tylenol. But this</p>
<p data-start="1939.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> this is just it. How hard is it to make?</p>
<p data-start="1940.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> just</p>
<p data-start="1942.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know.</p>
<p data-start="1943.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> What is it? Acidamidafin or whatever. What's in Tylenol?</p>
<p data-start="1945.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Tylenol? That's Tylenol. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="1947.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. I mean, how hard is it to make? It's nothing. It's nothing. This is a known compound that everybody's been making. And you just have to like, holy shit, 75 million of it.</p>
<p data-start="1960.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> I can't imagine how much real Tylenol you'd be able to buy for that.</p>
<p data-start="1965.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just insanity.</p>
<p data-start="1965.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> insanity.</p>
<p data-start="1966.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> A lot.</p>
<p data-start="1967.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just insanity. Okay.</p>
<p data-start="1969.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay. My point is just simply this.</p>
<p data-start="1969.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. My point</p>
<p data-start="1971.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. That when you start to deal with numbers. That are that large, the</p>
<p data-start="1971.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. That</p>
<p data-start="1974.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> the amount of incentive to</p>
<p data-start="1976.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> to actually margin to</p>
<p data-start="1976.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> actually margin to</p>
<p data-start="1978.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> start</p>
<p data-start="1978.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> start to behave or misbehave becomes insane is</p>
<p data-start="1982.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> is insane, which</p>
<p data-start="1982.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> insane,</p>
<p data-start="1983.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> which</p>
<p data-start="1983.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> which is why for contract, the bigger the contract, the more safeguards you put on it. Right. Right.</p>
<p data-start="1988.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Absolutely. So that is why you don't have people being</p>
<p data-start="1990.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> is why you don't have people being directed from the premier's office to</p>
<p data-start="1993.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> to hand out on</p>
<p data-start="1994.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> on</p>
<p data-start="1994.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> on</p>
<p data-start="1994.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> on half a billion dollar contracts. Yeah. I mean, if if that were to happen, but like we again, we don't know. I just want to be really clear on that. Right. Like there are a bunch of things. There are a bunch of things that are stated.</p>
<p data-start="1996.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I mean, if</p>
<p data-start="2001.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> are a</p>
<p data-start="2004.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Nobody knows. But now the premier's office is going to have to deal with this. At the very least, there's going to be an auditor general report.</p>
<p data-start="2009.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know what, Corey?</p>
<p data-start="2010.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> At that point.</p>
<p data-start="2012.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> think we've made a real mistake here.</p>
<p data-start="2014.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> What's the doing this podcast? I think we should</p>
<p data-start="2017.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think we should have assumed that she was guilty.</p>
<p data-start="2020.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> We would have been a little more careful.</p>
<p data-start="2022.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> We might have been a little bit more careful with our words.</p>
<p data-start="2025.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> But by presuming she was innocent, now we put ourselves in a real pickle. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2029.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, we have. We've actually caused more problems that way. It's a great point. OK, we touched on it briefly. The Nenshi response, which is almost like the</p>
<p data-start="2036.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> The Nenshi response,</p>
<p data-start="2039.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> the Nenshi response came before the,</p>
<p data-start="2041.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> the, you</p>
<p data-start="2042.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know,</p>
<p data-start="2042.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2042.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2042.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2043.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> know,</p>
<p data-start="2043.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> know, the premier's rejoinder, I guess we'll call it. But</p>
<p data-start="2046.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> thing with the Nenshi response is the man has never found a way to say two</p>
<p data-start="2051.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> two words when 200 will suffice.</p>
<p data-start="2057.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> It lacks a soundbite, doesn't it? Like it feels like it was said that the definition. The definition of a really, of a real scandal is one that can be written in a single tweet.</p>
<p data-start="2057.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> It lacks a soundbite, doesn't it? Like it</p>
<p data-start="2060.0"><strong>Unknown:</strong> it</p>
<p data-start="2060.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> it feels like it was said</p>
<p data-start="2060.7"><strong>Unknown:</strong> said</p>
<p data-start="2067.7"><strong>Unknown:</strong> Yeah. And</p>
<p data-start="2067.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> And then he wrote the single tweet about</p>
<p data-start="2069.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> about this, about this particular scandal.</p>
<p data-start="2072.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I don't have it in front of me. I don't want to misquote him. But</p>
<p data-start="2077.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> it was a banger of a tweet.</p>
<p data-start="2080.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> And I thought to myself, you know what?</p>
<p data-start="2083.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> know who should have written that tweet?</p>
<p data-start="2085.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Nahid Nenshi should have written that tweet. He would have. Yeah. He would have had the ability to define. This entire thing. I got a note from Christina Gray today, which makes no sense to me at all. This is a leader all the way issue.</p>
<p data-start="2100.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I got a quote. I got an email from Christina Gray. There was paragraphs long explaining</p>
<p data-start="2104.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> explaining this whole thing to me. If you take paragraphs to explain this, you are losing this war.</p>
<p data-start="2105.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> this whole</p>
<p data-start="2112.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Like Wesley's tweet, which I just pulled up here is allegedly, you know, so this is him stating like, this is how you would summarize it in one tweet. Right. This would be the scandal, right? Jesus. We should have started with this. Can I say, can we, we should have started with this. Do you want to start again?</p>
<p data-start="2125.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> start again?</p>
<p data-start="2127.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Let's just start again. Hang</p>
<p data-start="2128.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> start again. Hang on.</p>
<p data-start="2130.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Episode.</p>
<p data-start="2130.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Episode.</p>
<p data-start="2132.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is episode. Welcome to Episode Strategist, episode 1848G. I'm Stephen Carter. And with me, as always, Corey Hogan.</p>
<p data-start="2133.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Welcome to</p>

<p data-start="2139.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm</p>
<p data-start="2144.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Why</p>
<p data-start="2144.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Why don't we open up with that Jared Wesley tweet?</p>
<p data-start="2144.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Why don't we open up with</p>
<p data-start="2146.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Allegedly, Smith's staff pressured healthcare officials to approve over half a billion dollars in private healthcare contracts to a businessman who bought them seats in NHL luxury boxes in return for the favor. Then Smith fired a CEO who tried to investigate.</p>
<p data-start="2162.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Pretty good. Way better summary than we did. Got to say. I'll tell you. Jared, much better. If</p>
<p data-start="2167.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> If it's only they bought him seats for the playoffs.</p>
<p data-start="2171.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> you think that's all it is?</p>
<p data-start="2171.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> that's all it</p>
<p data-start="2173.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, again,</p>
<p data-start="2174.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> again, Carter, so careful. Tread careful here. Like, we just don't know. But even that, like, Like, those things are worth thousands of dollars, seats like that. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2180.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> like, Like, those things</p>
<p data-start="2184.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, they are.</p>
<p data-start="2185.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Remember</p>
<p data-start="2186.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Remember the profit margin.</p>
<p data-start="2186.8"><strong>Unknown:</strong> the profit margin.</p>
<p data-start="2188.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> So those are the allegations. And so this is the challenges that we're now facing here. Right?</p>
<p data-start="2193.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> So here we are.</p>
<p data-start="2195.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right? We're now talking about Nenshi. Nenshi's response wasn't pithy.</p>
<p data-start="2200.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> It was, however, I think, a pretty good prosecutorial laying out of the case. I actually thought he was pretty good. I think</p>
<p data-start="2205.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> I actually thought he was pretty good. I think if we had 12 jurors in a box who</p>
<p data-start="2209.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> who had to pay attention.</p>
<p data-start="2212.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right? At the risk of the judge throwing them out and into jail for contempt.</p>
<p data-start="2218.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. I think</p>
<p data-start="2218.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Okay. I think those 12 people would have paid attention. All</p>
<p data-start="2220.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> All right.</p>
<p data-start="2221.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Tell me I'm wrong. You're not wrong. Tell me I'm wrong. And your point about, like, the emails and all of this, it's true. And actually, I'll say another challenge people have with allegations of scandal like this is the longer your explanation, the more you come off like you've lost your mind. Exactly. Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? Right? You're mixing together random things and, like, you're picking up this piece of the scandal and that piece of the scandal. And what Jared points out, I think, rightly, is, like, when you can put succinctly and everyone, like, just sort of gets it, like, oh, that's it. Like, that's the scandal.</p>
<p data-start="2241.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> and, like,</p>
<p data-start="2256.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's the real power. And the power of</p>
<p data-start="2257.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> And the power of this needs to be, this needs to be the defining factor. Right? We need to learn from Pierre Polyev on this. Right? Pierre Polyev has said this is where, you know, the carbon tax, the carbon tax, the carbon tax, and it's all been the carbon tax. And, of course, the weakness of that is now the carbon tax is gone. But this scandal never goes away. This scandal is there for the remaining two and a half years of Danielle Smith's tenure. And if you do this right, if you set this up properly, and you start just simply saying a half a billion dollars for a few hockey tickets and Lord knows what else.</p>
<p data-start="2293.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right?</p>
<p data-start="2294.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> They got a half a billion dollars in the contracts, Corey, for a few hockey tickets and Lord knows what else.</p>
<p data-start="2301.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> See what I did there?</p>
<p data-start="2302.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I do. And, you know, in many ways, I think that Smith's tweet about defamatory allegations was aimed at an audience of one. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2310.9"><strong>Unknown:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2310.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. And</p>
<p data-start="2311.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> And it wasn't you. I think it was Nahed Nenshi. I think that she was trying to imply that she would sue Nahed for his statement. Oh, that would be spectacular.</p>
<p data-start="2317.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> be spectacular.</p>
<p data-start="2317.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> spectacular.</p>
<p data-start="2318.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, it would be wild.</p>
<p data-start="2320.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know what this scandal, this quote unquote, this alleged scandal needs, though? What?</p>
<p data-start="2323.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> What?</p>
<p data-start="2324.8"><strong>Unknown:</strong> Nickname.</p>
<p data-start="2326.2"><strong>Unknown:</strong> Right? Oh,</p>
<p data-start="2326.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, it needs a gate. I</p>
<p data-start="2327.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't hate the gates, though. I</p>
<p data-start="2328.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> gates, though. I don't hate the gates. I don't, you know, it doesn't need to be a gate. It could be something like Smithbacks instead of kickbacks. That's not a good one. It's not a good</p>
<p data-start="2334.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> good one.</p>
<p data-start="2335.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> one.</p>
<p data-start="2335.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="2335.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> You</p>
<p data-start="2335.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> You know what? This is where we really need Zane.</p>
<p data-start="2339.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> He</p>
<p data-start="2339.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> He can</p>
<p data-start="2339.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> can be pithy.</p>
<p data-start="2340.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> He can be.</p>
<p data-start="2342.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Can he?</p>
<p data-start="2343.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> That's not been my experience. No, actually, you know what? Now that</p>
<p data-start="2344.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, actually, you know what? Now that I'm thinking about it.</p>
<p data-start="2346.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2347.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> This is one of the joys of doing the Carter and Hogan episodes.</p>
<p data-start="2350.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right? Like, look at this sucker.</p>
<p data-start="2352.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> 39 minutes in.</p>
<p data-start="2354.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> 39. One</p>
<p data-start="2354.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> One take.</p>
<p data-start="2356.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. So, so much. So much rich content here. Oh, God.</p>
<p data-start="2360.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> So</p>
<p data-start="2361.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> So where do the NDP go from here? They</p>
<p data-start="2363.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> They need.</p>
<p data-start="2363.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> need.</p>
<p data-start="2363.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> need. What do they do now? They</p>
<p data-start="2363.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> they do now? They need to start over. They need to define this again and make this a Nahed Nenshi exclusive and just go at it every single day. And then when they get into the legislature, they got to go at it every single day. There is nothing else but this. There is no concern. Like today, there was a an open house talking about the. The, you know, the the the coal mining on the eastern slopes. Interesting. Fantastic. Another situation. I would totally behind it. In fact, I'm</p>
<p data-start="2393.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> the eastern slopes.</p>
<p data-start="2400.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm behind it. I don't think that there should be coal mining on the eastern slopes of the of the Canadian Rockies does not fucking matter. Only thing that matters is Danielle Smith and her government gave a half a billion dollars worth of work to a company that in exchange, it appears. Appears or the</p>
<p data-start="2403.2"><strong>Unknown:</strong> eastern slopes</p>
<p data-start="2420.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> same company that gave them hockey</p>
<p data-start="2420.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> same company</p>
<p data-start="2422.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> hockey tickets. You</p>
<p data-start="2423.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know, the NDP knows what else.</p>
<p data-start="2423.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, the NDP knows what else.</p>
<p data-start="2424.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> else.</p>
<p data-start="2425.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> else.</p>
<p data-start="2425.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Figure out a phrasing that gives you that legal shield and you use that exact same phrasing every single</p>
<p data-start="2429.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> single like</p>
<p data-start="2430.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> single like</p>
<p data-start="2431.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> like you don't need to struggle the way Stephen and I are to talk about being allegations. Just find the way to say it and say it. I think</p>
<p data-start="2431.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> like</p>
<p data-start="2436.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> I think I said it better earlier.</p>
<p data-start="2438.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I, you know, you</p>
<p data-start="2439.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> you know, but</p>
<p data-start="2439.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> but then I saw the look on your face. You went a little green.</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I was like,</p>
<p data-start="2443.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, I was like, well, maybe I'm a little close to getting. Well, you know,</p>
<p data-start="2445.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, you know, this is a podcast. We're going to have to run by lawyers, but it's not like the lawyers are going to write the podcast. So, you know, we're still in that ground. We're OK. No, we're not going to run this by lawyers. Who should</p>
<p data-start="2451.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> know, we're still in that ground. We're</p>
<p data-start="2455.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> lawyers. Who should call Jonathan</p>
<p data-start="2457.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Jonathan Dennis?</p>
<p data-start="2458.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I hear he's got some free time. He's got some free</p>
<p data-start="2460.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> He's got some free time and he's still still</p>
<p data-start="2462.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> still a lawyer.</p>
<p data-start="2464.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> QC Casey, I guess. Casey now. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2465.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Casey now. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2467.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I had</p>
<p data-start="2467.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> I had difficulty with that switch. Yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2469.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I know. Because you want to say and the Sunshine Gang. Yeah, you hear it.</p>
<p data-start="2472.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, you</p>
<p data-start="2473.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Exactly. It makes it. It's hilarious.</p>
<p data-start="2475.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. We're</p>
<p data-start="2476.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> We're of a certain age when we come up. With Casey and the Sunshine.</p>
<p data-start="2480.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> How many how many people in our podcast listening? I</p>
<p data-start="2481.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> people in</p>
<p data-start="2482.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, actually, probably a lot of them. Yeah. You know, that's just life. Hey, so, OK. We should promote the discord, though.</p>
<p data-start="2483.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> mean, actually, probably a</p>
<p data-start="2484.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. You know,</p>
<p data-start="2487.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> We should promote the discord, though. We should promote, you know, being a patron.</p>
<p data-start="2491.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Six dollars. Get the discord. Have we done a job? It is</p>
<p data-start="2494.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> a job? It is lit. You guys got to be on that. You</p>
<p data-start="2496.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> got to be on</p>
<p data-start="2497.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> You got to be on the discord. You got to find your way to the discord.</p>
<p data-start="2500.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> We're breaking stuff there all the time. OK. So we got the Nancy response.</p>
<p data-start="2506.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> The NDP response. We're going to. We've got Smith in a bit of trouble. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2509.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="2510.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="2510.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Right.</p>
<p data-start="2511.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> How about the media? What do you do with if this if you're the media? Now, where do you go? First of all, let us give</p>
<p data-start="2515.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> First of all, let us give props to Carrie Tate for breaking the story once</p>
<p data-start="2520.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> once again for getting</p>
<p data-start="2520.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> once</p>
<p data-start="2521.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> for getting the information. We</p>
<p data-start="2521.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> information. We did that, but we can do it. We're</p>
<p data-start="2523.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> it. We're doing it again. We're giving props because props are free. And that's the type of stuff that we give away. You</p>
<p data-start="2528.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know what? Free shit. Unlike the discord. Just six dollars. Props are free. Props are free.</p>
<p data-start="2531.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Just six</p>
<p data-start="2532.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> Props are free. Props are free.</p>
<p data-start="2536.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> problem is, how do they? How much more can they continue to invest in it? It's the Globe and Mail. If this was post media, this thing would be over already.</p>
<p data-start="2546.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's the Globe and Mail. So I suspect that we're going to see an awful lot more chasing by Carrie Tate and her colleagues. And they're going to go after this like shit on a stick. No, they're going to go after this. Is that a saying</p>
<p data-start="2557.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> this. Is that a saying that anyone has ever used? Can you?</p>
<p data-start="2559.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> used? Can you? I'm lost on my sayings. I</p>
<p data-start="2563.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> I don't know what idiom to use.</p>
<p data-start="2565.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Anyway. Here's the thing. Shit on a stick. I think they're going to continue to do it. And they're going to continue to push. And they're going to find more stuff. Because I think, you</p>
<p data-start="2565.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Anyway. Here's the thing.</p>
<p data-start="2567.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Shit on a stick. I</p>
<p data-start="2577.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> you know, Carrie Tate has been the one who's been the closest to this UCP government and seeing how they actually are working. And it's no surprise to me that she's the one who's broken the story.</p>
<p data-start="2588.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. You talked about one more thing I wanted to try to get in there, which is this is not the only thing that the UCP is dealing with right now. Right? And so the coal mining issue. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2598.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Is also getting pretty big. MLA is having to cancel coffees with constituents and whatnot because there's so many angry constituents out there. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2605.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Who</p>
<p data-start="2605.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> Who do not want to see. It's</p>
<p data-start="2606.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's a seven. Eastern slopes. It's</p>
<p data-start="2607.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> seven. Eastern slopes. It's a seven to three issue.</p>
<p data-start="2609.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Right.</p>
<p data-start="2610.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> Right. Like it is a big fucking issue. And Danielle has tried to hide it. Maybe tried too hard to hide it because she unleashed this AHS thing. But this is the</p>
<p data-start="2621.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> the coal mine stuff is huge. If</p>
<p data-start="2624.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> If they go ahead with this, they're going to have. Um,</p>
<p data-start="2624.6"><strong>Unknown:</strong> If they go</p>
<p data-start="2629.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> they're going to have a lot of angry constituents and I don't know that the NDP can win in every place that's going to be angry, but I suspect that they can win in some.</p>
<p data-start="2639.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> And, uh, I don't know if you followed the last election, Corey, uh,</p>
<p data-start="2639.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> And, uh, I</p>
<p data-start="2643.1"><strong>Carter:</strong> uh, but it was, it was pretty close, pretty</p>
<p data-start="2645.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> pretty close. It's pretty close.</p>
<p data-start="2646.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> pretty close.</p>
<p data-start="2647.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> Few hundred more votes here, a few hundred more votes there. Suddenly, uh, Rachel Notley is not practicing law. I'm just saying.</p>
<p data-start="2650.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> uh,</p>
<p data-start="2654.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, it's interesting to me because you wouldn't normally think that the. The writings on the Rockies with the exception of, of Banff, Kenmore or Banff, Cochran, whatever it's called now. Right. Um, isn't</p>
<p data-start="2666.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> isn't play, but this,</p>
<p data-start="2669.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> this, this could at least, uh, mess things up for the UCP and in some challenging</p>
<p data-start="2673.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> challenging ways, right. Where they're playing some defense and, and certainly it's one of those issues that while it's intensely felt in the communities that are affected, it's also felt in the cities. Like you don't have to work real hard to walk</p>
<p data-start="2685.9"><strong>Corey:</strong> walk around Calgary and see signs. Where people are mad about this. I mean, one of the reasons people like to live here for those of you not here is the proximity to the Rocky mountains and the, and you know, the landscapes and the outdoor living never</p>
<p data-start="2697.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> never been my thing. No,</p>
<p data-start="2699.4"><strong>Carter:</strong> No, I'm not really sure why I'm here, but</p>
<p data-start="2699.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> really sure why I'm here, but</p>
<p data-start="2701.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> but</p>
<p data-start="2701.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> but maybe</p>
<p data-start="2701.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> maybe that's why Zane can't record.</p>
<p data-start="2703.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Maybe he's lost in the Rockies.</p>
<p data-start="2706.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> Maybe he would</p>
<p data-start="2706.5"><strong>Carter:</strong> he would be, he would be having a hard time finding his way out. You</p>
<p data-start="2706.8"><strong>Corey:</strong> be, he</p>
<p data-start="2709.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> You know what? It's both not at all likely, but very likely if he tried. Yeah, exactly. I heard one time</p>
<p data-start="2713.8"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah, exactly. I heard one time he went to Kenmore. I was worried for him.</p>
<p data-start="2717.3"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, yeah,</p>
<p data-start="2718.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> yeah, Kenmore is like a city, but even then I am worried. They still call</p>
<p data-start="2722.0"><strong>Carter:</strong> They still call it the town of Kenmore, hey?</p>
<p data-start="2724.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Do they? What a fraud. They're trying, but it's a city now. What a fraud. It's</p>
<p data-start="2726.6"><strong>Carter:</strong> but it's a city now. What a fraud. It's a city for sure.</p>
<p data-start="2729.0"><strong>Corey:</strong> It's a city for sure? Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2729.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p data-start="2731.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. So we didn't say anything substantive about coal mining, but. It's</p>
<p data-start="2734.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> It's bad.</p>
<p data-start="2738.2"><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. There</p>
<p data-start="2738.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> There you go.</p>
<p data-start="2739.1"><strong>Corey:</strong> Strong ending.</p>
<p data-start="2740.9"><strong>Carter:</strong> Oh, is this the end?</p>
<p data-start="2742.7"><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, do you have anything else to say?</p>
<p data-start="2747.3"><strong>Carter:</strong> I thought you looked good tonight.</p>
<p data-start="2749.2"><strong>Carter:</strong> Thank you.</p>
<p data-start="2749.4"><strong>Corey:</strong> you. Thank you.</p>
<p data-start="2753.5"><strong>Corey:</strong> I'm not returning that compliment, just. I'm</p>
<p data-start="2755.7"><strong>Carter:</strong> I'm wearing my sweater.</p>
<p data-start="2758.6"><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, is that what that is?</p>
<p data-start="2769.8"><strong>Unknown:</strong> His mom is proud. The currency, he's really loud. He's hot.</p>
<p data-start="2782.4"><strong>Unknown:</strong> He's hot. And</p>
<p data-start="2794.9"><strong>Unknown:</strong> they're here for you. To give you the takes and you're here for them too.</p>
