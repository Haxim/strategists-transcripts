        <p>After a long wait, the Alberta Sovereignty Act is finally out. Is it as destabilizing as feared? Worse? Better? Different worse? Stephen and Corey use Zain's absence to discuss this plus what the LG might be asked to consider.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan deconstruct the bill-destined-to-become the Alberta Sovereignty Act - what it means for Alberta, for Canada, for parliamentary democracy and how everybody might respond. What does the Bill do to Canada-Alberta relations? How are the federal government and the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta supposed to respond? And is there any more chilling hypothetical phrase than "You are doing something not considered by the current constitutional order and I require you to get a mandate from the people?" The gang (minus Zain) discusses.</em></p></blockquote>

But the government itself, the cabinet ministers and the bureaucracy are supposed to be governed by what comes out of the legislature. The legislature passes the laws. Those bills that become law are all passed through the multiple reading process in the legislature, debates, multiple stages where opposition has the opportunity to filibuster, to have their voices heard, where friendly amendments can be made, legislation gets stronger. But ultimately, the legislation is then passed by the legislature. And then within those pieces of legislation, the government is able to put in certain regulations, but they can&#39;t just ignore, they cannot change laws</div>

This is not a power that the federal government has used in almost 100 years. The last Last time they used it, I believe, was in Alberta. There&#39;s also a similar power of reservation where they can kind of hold it and they can say, well, actually, we&#39;re going to talk about that piece of legislation, not the provincial lieutenant governor.</div>
