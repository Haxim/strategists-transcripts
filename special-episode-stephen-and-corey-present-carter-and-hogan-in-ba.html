            <span class="text">But we should say right off the bat, the reason why it&#39;s the only the two of us here on the main, we&#39;ve never had this on the main feed, is because actually it was a very sad event that happened in Zane&#39;s family. His father, Nisar Velji, died last week. And so Zane is taking, understandably, a beat before he joins us again here.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, listen, I always think Quebec elections are interesting. They&#39;re my favorite elections to watch absent my own provinces, because of course you&#39;re always invested in your own provinces. But I love Quebec elections. I really do. Because they follow a different beat than elections in the rest of Canada, usually. And there&#39;s a few things about Quebec elections that are second to none. The aesthetics of Quebec elections are amazing. The</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The design work is incredible. The ads are legitimately good advertisements. And I think part of that comes from Quebec having more of a cultural scene. And you imagine when you&#39;re buying an ad on any of the Quebec television stations. There&#39;s going to have to be creative shops in Quebec that are producing that. That&#39;s not so much true here in Alberta, for example. You&#39;re probably going a bit further afield. Anglo Canadians, we tend to rely a lot on the product that comes out of the United States. Really top shelf stuff, really amusing ads, both in the lead up and during the election. And also their election signs are different. Their whole aesthetic, their whole vibe is pretty cool.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">I also think it&#39;s more professional. I think that we rely a lot on amateurs in Western Canada, especially, even in Ontario. But in Quebec, there&#39;s a history of professional political representatives, and they do better work. They understand</span>

So interesting enough that that&#39;s an argument and a conversation. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s super shocking to people outside of Quebec, that that would be part of the conversation.
