          <p>Corey and Stephen run from one issue to the next in an episode that desperately misses Zain.</p><blockquote><p><em>It's September and the gang return to their twice-weekly schedule but one of us can't be here so the Patreon series-within-a-series "Carter and Hogan" hits the main feed. The titular characters try to hold the fort down in Zain's absence. The fort blows away.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>TOPICS: Quebec at the polls, Smith near the big job, Kenney in the closing days, LG on the hot-seat, Alberta Day forever in our hearts and on our minds.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">The design work is incredible. The ads are legitimately good advertisements. And I think part of that comes from Quebec having more of a cultural scene. And you imagine when you&#39;re buying an ad on any of the Quebec television stations. There&#39;s going to have to be creative shops in Quebec that are producing that. That&#39;s not so much true here in Alberta, for example. You&#39;re probably going a bit further afield. Anglo Canadians, we tend to rely a lot on the product that comes out of the United States. Really top shelf stuff, really amusing ads, both in the lead up and during the election. And also their election signs are different. Their whole aesthetic, their whole vibe is pretty cool.</div>
