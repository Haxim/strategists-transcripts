        <p>Every year after Valentine's Day the gang get together for the traditional "Love/Bug" segment. This year, of course, is no different.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter, in a post-Valentine's Day tradition, talk about the positions they love and the positions that bug them - from Zuckerberg's takedown of the Apple Vision Pro to the new name for the Canada Carbon Rebate and everything (some things) in between. How can the Alberta Government justify withholding the results of the Alberta Pension Plan survey? Will the new carbon tax refund increase support for the climate incentive plan of action? And what will we do when the Zuckerberg AI achieves consciousness? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

His words, not necessarily mine, but also mine. And at the same time, using a very methodical way to kind of break it down and try to go after the Apple Vision Pro, the newest product that Apple has released. Carter, was this a love or was this a bug for you? The Mark Zuckerberg three-ish minute takedown of Apple.</div>

          <div class="said">Right. You have to keep in mind, this was more expensive than previous headsets from Meta. And as they&#39;ve been jamming more technology into it, the price has been going up. And of course, there was like the Oculus, you&#39;ll recall, right? That was kind of one of the more proto ones. That was about a thousand bucks. And people were like, insane, really expensive. But now they seem almost reasonably priced because there&#39;s this anchor out there, which is Apple&#39;s VR headset. So now you&#39;re like, oh, I don&#39;t want to buy the expensive one. I&#39;ll buy that. But then you&#39;re still talking about spending like $650 on this fucking thing, right? Yeah.

A news article came out earlier this week saying, yep, that is indeed it. We are rebranding it. In some ways, they&#39;ve kind of, like, accepted that kind of carbon is part of it, that, you know, they&#39;ve tried to move away from that language for a long time. We&#39;ve had things like revenue neutral show up. But, okay, it was called the Climate Action Incentive Payment. Did anyone ever know that? it&#39;s now called no i just wrote it down</div>

I don&#39;t understand in some ways if this is ultimately the solution because this is not just about rebranding something that people call something else. This is about trying to, in the broadest sense, or the bigger sense, to be more accurate, trying to potentially save a signature policy, maybe. So, Corey, is it a love or is it a bug that the Climate Action Incentive is now the Canada Carbon Rebate?</div>

It&#39;s going to be at the clinic, right? If you compare that to a primary care network, what the fuck is a primary care network? People barely know what primary care is, but they know what family care is. They know where a clinic is. They know what, you know, what&#39;s a network. but so telling people exactly what something is is probably your best bet in political communications and you&#39;re almost never going to get it when you&#39;re dealing with uh bureaucracy they&#39;re going to try and find an acronym right</div>

Which is that the people have a right to know and the government has a duty to inform. And underlining that mantra is the things government does need to be clear and understandable to people. And if you have money just kind of floating in and you think it&#39;s from the federal government, billions of dollars here kind of just being allocated through. That&#39;s really bad. That damages public policy, as we saw, because nobody could fucking understand what the hell this money was that was coming in. Nobody really appreciated it. I mean, it&#39;s so funny, but in a way, the carbon tax may die in Canada because the big five banks couldn&#39;t be fucked. Isn&#39;t that a funny thing to think about? Right,</div>

Love or bug in terms of this sort of slim moniker that I guess the conservatives are propping and owning. And, Corey, if ArriveCon.ca is not taking it, it certainly should be at this moment.

          <div class="said">there&#39;s something i like to say to people especially like new managers right that which must be done eventually must be done immediately and this is advice i think that the federal government should take more often because they are so stubborn and so resistant to fail and even when they know where things are going they will drag it out rag the puck live that that false hope, be in total denial of it, and they just bleed along the way to the inevitable conclusion. And I think about the foreign interference inquiry as a really perfect example. This one is rapidly becoming one for me too. You have this slow moving crisis, and you&#39;re probably better off having a fast crisis that we&#39;ve all forgotten about in six months because we have the brains of goldfish. And they just, they have to stop bleeding so on things like this. On this issue, if Justin Trudeau believes I really need him, he&#39;s really great for reasons we don&#39;t understand. Maybe he&#39;s the conciliary that makes, maybe he&#39;s the straw that stirs the drinks, eh? And he makes everything great in government. I don&#39;t think so. But if Justin Trudeau decides he&#39;s the guy and he needs him, that&#39;s fine. But the overall advice stands. If you only get to pick so many dumb things to keep doing, stop doing so many dumb things. things clean your government up.</div>
