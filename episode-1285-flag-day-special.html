Toronto Raptors basketball team. You know that. Went with a good friend of the show, Andrew Fung, by which I mean he never listens to the show. He listens every time. Well, we, you know, if it was on the public broadcaster, they&#39;d force him to listen. But the fact is, if Fung doesn&#39;t get paid, he doesn&#39;t listen, okay? OK, that&#39;s just where he&#39;s at these days. OK, that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

His words, not necessarily mine, but also mine. And at the same time, using a very methodical way to kind of break it down and try to go after the Apple Vision Pro, the newest product that Apple has released. Carter, was this a love or was this a bug for you? The Mark Zuckerberg three-ish minute takedown of Apple.</span>

But nonetheless, I mean, using AI in that kind of a circumstance was spectacular. And then the script that they wrote for the AI, I thought was really well put together. It was a good takedown. It was It was damning with faint praise. It was comparisons on pricing. And it was comparing to their mid-level product, not their high-level product, which I thought was also very interesting. I really did love it. I really did.</span>

I&#39;m assuming folks that haven&#39;t seen this maybe have hit pause, watched that video, so I won&#39;t go into too much detail. But Carter&#39;s right. This was a head-to-head comparison being like, I&#39;ve tried it out. I love a lot of Apple stuff. This I don&#39;t love. In fact, I think ours is better, like, and tries to give, like, this sort of, it was unprovoked. No one was asking Zuckerberg, be like, dude, you know, what do you say?

And this has, like this has hit tech mainstream, right? The conversation. And I bet you it is frustrating for them because in many ways, Meta is ahead of the game on a lot of these things. And the idea that you&#39;re going to spend $3,000 on the Apple product, which is got some cool tricks for sure but is not a fundamental leap beyond the technology you can get for a fifth of the price that meta provides i&#39;m you know that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting and so for me you know there&#39;s like kind of like cost benefit of an action like this and i think the cost was incredibly low if even negative you had the ceo just sit down and take this thing apart part like what would that cost in terms of time and energy and effort almost nothing and it becomes a big conversation and it&#39;s your way to elbow in to</span>

And of course, it&#39;s not like you just take a flyer, just throw it out, you know, just shoot from the hip.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Actually, this is a great point. In a funny way, what Apple has done by having this insanely expensive product has made meta&#39;s product look reasonably priced. Because I&#39;ll tell you, the conversation in tech circles a year ago was like, who&#39;s going to buy a $650 headset?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Right. You have to keep in mind, this was more expensive than previous headsets from Meta. And as they&#39;ve been jamming more technology into it, the price has been going up. And of course, there was like the Oculus, you&#39;ll recall, right? That was kind of one of the more proto ones. That was about a thousand bucks. And people were like, insane, really expensive. But now they seem almost reasonably priced because there&#39;s this anchor out there, which is Apple&#39;s VR headset. So now you&#39;re like, oh, I don&#39;t want to buy the expensive one. I&#39;ll buy that. But then you&#39;re still talking about spending like $650 on this fucking thing, right? Yeah. That&#39;s a lot</span>

Stephen Carter. Let me start with you on this one, Carter. Okay. We have a rebrand, and I want to see if you love this rebrand or if it bugs you, because Carter, it is a rebrand of something that will never not be called the carbon tax rebate, because the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the climate action incentive payment has now been rebranded as the Canada carbon rebate. This is, of course, a rebrand by the liberal government, federally. A news article came out earlier this week saying, yep, that is indeed it. We are rebranding it. In some ways, they&#39;ve kind of, like, accepted that kind of carbon is part of it, that, you know, they&#39;ve tried to move away from that language for a long time. We&#39;ve had things like revenue neutral show up. But, okay, it was called the Climate Action Incentive Payment. Did anyone ever know that? it&#39;s now called no i just wrote it down</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">cannot associate have not associated this refund with their um carbon tax payments and they think that they&#39;re getting hosed so you know you should never have called it something that people didn&#39;t recognize we were we talked about it in the past people would get this this rebate and not know what the fuck it was for thanks government i&#39;ve got the money now i don&#39;t care what it was for You do care what it was for because you want to be able to show Canadians that you&#39;re putting money back in their pocket and it&#39;s more than the actual cost of the carbon tax in most cases.

            <span class="text">Corey, in some ways, it&#39;s like an admission. In other ways, it&#39;s trying to save the tax. It&#39;s both got no teeth, but also a lot of pressure. I don&#39;t understand in some ways if this is ultimately the solution because this is not just about rebranding something that people call something else. This is about trying to, in the broadest sense, or the bigger sense, to be more accurate, trying to potentially save a signature policy, maybe. So, Corey, is it a love or is it a bug that the Climate Action Incentive is now the Canada Carbon Rebate?</span>

I want to get back to why I think it&#39;s workmanlike. but also you can&#39;t get past the point that steven said which is like where where was this years ago right like if you hand something in a week late it better be good you hand something in four years late you it better be fucking awesome right and so the expectations for this name were pretty high like we all knew there was going to be a rebrand and i think that some</span>

            <span class="text">people got and it showed up in their bank accounts in a lot of different ways and they said i don&#39;t know what the fuck this is so you need the word carbon carbon being in there hits where colloquially it&#39;s discussed right yeah you need the word canada you can&#39;t just say carbon rebate because you need to know the money is coming from the federal government so you have the word canada in there well isn&#39;t that wonderful and you have rebate and there&#39;s only so many words you can pick here in terms you know if you don&#39;t want to say canada</span>

            <span class="text">well i was just thinking you know we we named the family care clinics and we were looking four months for a better name uh than family care clinics. And we couldn&#39;t come up with anything, because we went through the name and said, okay, what&#39;s it about? It&#39;s about family. What are we giving? Care. Where is it going to be? It&#39;s going to be at the clinic, right? If you compare that to a primary care network, what the fuck is a primary care network? People barely know what primary care is, but they know what family care is. They know where a clinic is. They know what, you know, what&#39;s a network. but so telling people exactly what something is is probably your best bet in political communications and you&#39;re almost never going to get it when you&#39;re dealing with uh bureaucracy they&#39;re going to try and find an acronym right</span>

            <span class="text">i think also this is one of the funny things like this is something i remember even from my time in government right because we had a carbon levy and it was a carbon levy or it was a carbon price but it was never a carbon tax and nobody wanted to say tax but but everybody called it the tax. And so you feel like you&#39;re communicating with one hand behind your back because you&#39;re talking about like the carbon levy and people, a certain percent of people, a significant percent are like, what?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But you know, that is kind of a, that&#39;s a reality. And it&#39;s a little bit complicated for people.

I can&#39;t tell you the number of times I&#39;ve had conversations with people about brands, either brands I&#39;ve created or brands other people have created that people stand up as really impressive brands, you know, positioning statements, all of this, where some voice will say something to the effect of, oh, that&#39;s kind of obvious, isn&#39;t it?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">good, right? Like that, the amount of work that goes into making communications feel obvious, I cannot overstate. Because if you don&#39;t do that work, and you don&#39;t think about it, and if it doesn&#39;t naturally flow, and if it doesn&#39;t naturally roll off the tongue, and it doesn&#39;t seem like something something you can immediately remember with some sort of mnemonic power, then</span>

            <span class="text">then you end up with climate action incentive payment. Again, a thing I only remember because I fucking wrote down. And in fact, I had to increase the size of the font so that I could read it in a comprehensible way because the words just stilt when I look at them, right? And so a certain obviousness is actually super powerful in communications. And I think too many people look for clever or amazing or unique you know</span>

Which is that the people have a right to know and the government has a duty to inform. And underlining that mantra is the things government does need to be clear and understandable to people. And if you have money just kind of floating in and you think it&#39;s from the federal government, billions of dollars here kind of just being allocated through. That&#39;s really bad. That damages public policy, as we saw, because nobody could fucking understand what the hell this money was that was coming in. Nobody really appreciated it. I mean, it&#39;s so funny, but in a way, the carbon tax may die in Canada because the big five banks couldn&#39;t be fucked. Isn&#39;t that a funny thing to think about? Right,</span>

It&#39;s not resolved. It&#39;s still going to show up as can-fed for a lot of people. So that&#39;s really interesting.</span>

The current version of the scandal, it&#39;s not Arrive Can Gate. It&#39;s Arrive Con, Carter. Do you like it? It&#39;s a bad name. Love or bug in terms of this sort of slim moniker that I guess the conservatives are propping and owning. And, Corey, if ArriveCon.ca is not taking it, it certainly should be at this moment.

And so you don&#39;t want that. You don&#39;t want that. I guarantee you, Albertans, you do not want that as citizens. You want your public servants to be able to give advice to elected officials that allows them to make decisions without fear of embarrassment. Okay?</span>

The OIPC, which is the Privacy Commissioner, has clarified over the years. There was a really clear clarification of it in 2008. somebody sent me on twitter that effectively says this is not that it is not advice to officials when we talk about like if you sent a survey to four people in your department saying we want to hear what you say that would be considered for protected but you just opening the floodgates for everybody that&#39;s not everybody in alberta giving advice to officials that&#39;s statistical data you fucking release it that&#39;s the responsibility and by the way i would bet a lot lot of money that at the end of this process the privacy commissioner is going to say you have to release this but the system is so slow the government is just playing with it you</span>

And that is that if we cut one of our cabinet ministers, we are in some fashion conceding failure, right? We are conceding the opposition&#39;s message. But they have forgotten gotten that the other side of that particular coin is you&#39;re showing leadership right</span>

That&#39;s the deputy minister that reports to them. and you coordinate activity and it&#39;s a bit of a different relationship and there is really a giant risk in knowing too much or thinking you know too much about a particular file like you you almost want that chairperson to be like okay what do i not know explain this to me i need to decide these matters it&#39;s not a perfect metaphor because of course the decider but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a little bit different than uh than you know having a deep knowledge can really lead you astray in government i guess is the point i&#39;m trying to make why don&#39;t they cut him loose at this point because the signal you would be sending to environmentalists i have to imagine their calculation is they&#39;re like oh my god we would have holy hell from environmentalists if we cut him you know he&#39;s the only environmentalist</span>

            <span class="text">there&#39;s something i like to say to people especially like new managers right that which must be done eventually must be done immediately and this is advice i think that the federal government should take more often because they are so stubborn and so resistant to fail and even when they know where things are going they will drag it out rag the puck live that that false hope, be in total denial of it, and they just bleed along the way to the inevitable conclusion. And I think about the foreign interference inquiry as a really perfect example. This one is rapidly becoming one for me too. You have this slow moving crisis, and you&#39;re probably better off having a fast crisis that we&#39;ve all forgotten about in six months because we have the brains of goldfish. And they just, they have to stop bleeding so on things like this. On this issue, if Justin Trudeau believes I really need him, he&#39;s really great for reasons we don&#39;t understand. Maybe he&#39;s the conciliary that makes, maybe he&#39;s the straw that stirs the drinks, eh? And he makes everything great in government. I don&#39;t think so. But if Justin Trudeau decides he&#39;s the guy and he needs him, that&#39;s fine. But the overall advice stands. If you only get to pick so many dumb things to keep doing, stop doing so many dumb things. things clean your government up.</span>
