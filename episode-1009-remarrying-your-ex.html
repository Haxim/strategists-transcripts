Stephen Carter, give us a bit of a drumroll. Do you want to guess who it is? It&#39;s Daniel Smith. Oh, we have a real drum.</span>

            <span class="text">On two occasions over the past year, Alberta Premier Daniel Smith included links to a newsletter to a blog that a Canadian Jewish human rights organization says is a known source of anti-Semitic tropes and racist conspiracy theories. Her sharing of the blog&#39;s content was first reported by independent journalist Justin Ling, who&#39;s done a tremendous amount of work digging through Danielle Smith&#39;s locals account with videos, texts, comments that have been posted. Guys, this is less about the Velji rule, despite the fact that the Velji rule may see a bit of a cameo appearance. What the hell is going on, Carter, with Danielle Smith&#39;s apology tour? And I&#39;m talking about this seriously now, because there is a good chance she&#39;ll have to apologize for this, just like she had to apologize for the vaccinated. And I&#39;m going to to put apology in air quotes, just so those who can&#39;t see me apologize. Just like she had to apologize for the unvaccinated being the most discriminated group that she&#39;s seen in her lifetime. Just like she had to apologize for her commenting that Ukraine should remain neutral. We might be on the verge of another quote unquote apology. What the fuck is going on, Carter? Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it turns out that no one did any opposition research during the leadership. And all of these crazy things that Danielle has been saying. And keep in mind that Danielle has been taking the position of the minority for as long as Danielle&#39;s been in politics. It started off with the property rights issues, the electricity issues. She was a champion of those issues when those</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">those things weren&#39;t even issues. The Southern Alberta, the government&#39;s going to take our land thing was a Danielle Smith Smith special. And she, she&#39;s been doing these types of things forever and, um, they&#39;re catching up with her. Uh, and keep in mind that when we beat her in 2012, it was in no small part because she wouldn&#39;t make her other candidates apologize for,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for, you know, saying that, um, you know, people in the Northeast are, are better led by, by white people or, and, and for not saying that, uh, you You know, gays and lesbians would burn in hell in a lake of fire.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">She allowed those things to go on forever. It worked out to about eight days before she took any action. And maybe she&#39;s just learning that a quick apology is much better than allowing these things to go on. But, wow, she&#39;s been apologizing for most of her political career. And it&#39;s just wild to me that the people who ran against her for the leadership didn&#39;t make her apologize earlier.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, last time we talked about this, she had given one apology. Now she&#39;s on the verge of potentially three quote unquote apologies, if not more. There&#39;s a running joke on Twitter around the over under apologies, which I will ask you at the end. Thank you, Dan Arnold. But Corey,</span>

So that&#39;s the way that Danielle needs to approach this. She needs to get out in front of it. She needs to make sure that everything that she&#39;s ever said or done is known.
