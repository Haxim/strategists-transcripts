          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">holiday spectacular is coming up very shortly of course we will have our standard holiday spectacular uh segments including the ever popular uh eulogies of the year because what&#39;s a holiday day without eulogizing something. But Corey, I want to talk about the holiday season more broadly. I want to talk about the holiday season as it relates to two things. Parties, outings, Christmas events that political parties hold, and also the year-end interview. These rituals that we see in politics that we&#39;re now seeing play out this year as well. The sit-down, the year-end interview, all orders of governments, every single leader, they clamor, they sit down, they have a deep dive discussion. Corey, talk</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">talk to me about the year-end interview. In your mind, what is the purpose of this long-held tradition? And in your mind, does it still hold?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so it is a long-held tradition. It&#39;s this idea that at the end of the year, you get retrospective about the year. It&#39;s like a Counting Crows song, but we all have to live it in politics every 12 months. And one of the challenges I&#39;ve always had with it is, almost by definition it&#39;s not going to break news yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s summarizing news it&#39;s recapping news it&#39;s like the aggregator of media events and as a result i think it&#39;s like uh you know value is pretty pretty low and um rather than casting backwards i think nowadays a lot more about it is uh casting forward what&#39;s going to happen in the next year you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what&#39;s the reason to believe that maybe this year will be better than the last and um what you often find is uh just this this rose-tinted version of it that, again, serves no value. In many ways, it becomes almost like the slowest of slow pitches, the softest of softballs that allow politicians to tell whatever story they want. And I just, I do not understand why media outlets continue to give people these year-end interviews, year-forward, you know, perspectives, because they offer nothing except the opportunity to provide soundbites. You know, there&#39;s no news content in them, for the most part. Carter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, talk to me about that, because Corey&#39;s perspective is one that I share in many ways in terms of what its strategic value is to the end voter, to the viewing audience. I kind of see the value for a politician. It&#39;s a microphone. And if I&#39;m going to be given opportunities to give two to three minute answer, not to say some of some interviewers do more of an accountability interview, right? To be fair, Corey, there are some that look at it as an accountability. But Carter, talk to me about your frame of the year-end interview, because we&#39;re seeing as political watchers, you&#39;re seeing a shit ton of them right now. I just saw the preview of the Rosie Barton and Justin Trudeau one. We&#39;re seeing a shit ton of these across multiple political outlets, across multiple orders of government. Talk to me about the year-end interview from your strategist, Lance Carter. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that it&#39;s taking the wrong turn. I think that Corey&#39;s right insofar as, you know, why do even people even want to do these things? And I think that it&#39;s taking the wrong turn because the politicians have decided that this is when they&#39;re going to do these year-end interviews. And I&#39;m not sure if it is because there&#39;s less impact at Christmas time in the new year when people just really aren&#39;t paying attention so they can do their year-end interview and not worry about gotcha questions and things like that. And there&#39;s really nothing happening. So the chance of screwing up is dramatically reduced. But I mean, so I can see the politicians like you, Zane. I can see the politicians why they do it. I struggle with why the media want to do it. I&#39;m assuming it has has to do with, you know, filling</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">Hold on to that thought for a second, Carter. I want to come back to that. But Corey, talk to me about accountability for a second. I just threw it out there as some interviewers are a little bit more accountability focused. They&#39;ll give you your 15 minutes. They&#39;ll give it to you on a prime spot of a national program should they be able to hold that. But they might ask you some hard-hitting questions. It&#39;s not the mistletoe softball that we&#39;ve seen in the years years past. Talk to me about the accountability element.</span>

            <span class="text">know, it&#39;s so funny, because insofar as it offers accountability, it&#39;s to people who try to avoid the media, because otherwise, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s actually a ton of accountability. But when you think about, for example, Pierre Polyev, doing the cycles and, you know, holding news conferences, people are like, oh, now&#39;s a chance to ask him about the by-election and the Alberta Sovereignty Act and, and things that I think in more normal times, you&#39;d have access to anyhow. Anyhow, but I also do believe that this accountability is overblown. None of these people are holding them to the fire and saying, that&#39;s great. You want to talk about this? I&#39;m spending this entire half hour on</span>

Like it&#39;s one question, one follow up, maybe another supplemental beyond that. But it&#39;s really very surface level. Like, ultimately, Zane, I guess I&#39;m pretty skeptical that you find any accountability in just one question and one follow up. If they&#39;ve got soundbites, they&#39;ve got their soundbites and they move on. I just don&#39;t, I don&#39;t personally feel they dig deep enough for it to be like, it&#39;s not Frost Nixon, let&#39;s put it that way. And so really, most of it is about just one more day up in the canyons, one more night in Hollywood, they&#39;re just, they&#39;re just doing their show, they&#39;re doing their normal thing. And, you know, I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of nutritional value in that.</span>

He&#39;s not doing so well with women. His kind of traction has kind of maybe been limited since the leadership race. If you were advising him, this is a guy who&#39;s avoided the traditional media, and you believe that the accountability interview is not necessarily going to dig deep enough or have the runway or the depth enough, would you say, fuck it, go do a year-end accountability interview?

Well, the anchor at CTV is super smart and stuff, but she doesn&#39;t follow the story every day right she&#39;s she&#39;s the anchor she&#39;s not the person who&#39;s you know watching every debate at city council or watching every debate in the house of commons most often these interviews are conducted by people who are given scripts uh by the regular reporters and then they&#39;re interpreting them themselves it&#39;s like when cory and i talk and we try to explain to you afterwards what we actually meant and you&#39;re trying to figure it out and then being able to regurgitate that on on all the CBC shows you do.</span>

            <span class="text">if pierre wants to remake himself he has that opportunity right now on on these kind of issues and so i&#39;d get him in front of the camera i think that one of the reasons that people do these interviews the media or not the media but the the the politicians do these interviews is that they are incredibly low risk um a summary interview of things that you have happened in the past um man you&#39;re not going to get much easier than that in terms of media and i just want to take a second uh because some people may be asking why we&#39;re recommending softening by putting pierre&#39;s partner in the interview that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s for everybody right that&#39;s for everybody, like it&#39;s not just Pierre Polyev, it&#39;s a question for everybody. Do we want this to be a personal interview about the person, about the ideas in the person, or do we want this to be a substantive interview? And I think that a personal interview with someone like Pierre would go a very, very long ways in softening some of the critiques and criticism that he&#39;s faced over the last little a while.</span>

One that maybe, as I&#39;ve used the term, breaks the mold, but one that kind of hits the home run. Maybe one that you haven&#39;t seen before. One that takes advantage of, I&#39;m going to use this word, malleability of the situation. That, you know, know, they&#39;re asking you questions, it&#39;s year-end, you know, the downside is that there may not be many eyeballs on it, so to speak. The upside is you got to have free reign.

And, you know, there&#39;s something about a year-end interview, you know, the winner makes you laugh a little slower, makes you talk a little lower kind of stuff, where you can get away uh with being a little bit more loose a little bit more personal it doesn&#39;t actually need to be all about substance be an crack a joke have your partner there with you um there is something to that and i there&#39;s probably an opportunity also</span>

Who and why, in your mind? You could choose anyone past or present, any order of government, doesn&#39;t have to be a sitting politician. Frankly, it doesn&#39;t even have to be someone who&#39;s in elected office, they could have just sought elected office.

            <span class="text">you know, the year-end interview, as I see it, it&#39;s almost the dance between the person doing the interview and the person being interviewed, right? And that charisma aspect, you can almost see it more so in terms of how it&#39;s received by the interview, usually a hardened, you know, longtime political reporter or national news anchor. And to see how that plays off of that that person, you kind of act as a proxy of the viewing audience of the journalist or the reporter. I&#39;m really curious. Corey, same question to you. Give me your thoughts on this. Who and why? But can you react to the, could the Mulroney type of charisma work in a 2022 world, the political world? If Mulroney was thrown in today into our politics with his type of leadership, could it, I</span>

I just don&#39;t know that it has the same resonance. But, you know, you&#39;re not going to remember the last thing they said as they were leaving. The days go by so fast, but you will remember that feeling that they left you with. So if you can, if you can sort of seize that moment and make it more personal, there&#39;s no harm. And in fact, I think there&#39;s a lot of good, like the actual policy specifics will be lost. But if people a year from now sort of remember feeling not too bad about the the guy in a year-end interview that&#39;s pretty good so it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely doable you&#39;ve just got to um you&#39;ve got to hit the moment and and i think we&#39;ve seen a lot of attempts of people manufacturing that kind of you know like i immediately think of stephen harper trying to be normal human being who loves netflix right yeah like that you got to be careful about that too but if you can hit it uh particularly if the challenge you have is that you seem unpersonable unlikable or at least a large chunk of canadians feel that way might not be required by the way for you to win the election but you certainly want to take it off the table if you can cory</span>

Tie the year-end interview and the amount of content that politicians should ideally strategically produce, should spend on solidifying and crafting their legacy, should spend either advertising dollars or PR time or media time to push narratives into the holidays. Because do you believe that the holiday season, the Christmas holiday season, the one we&#39;re into, is also a strategic moment? Or does that only apply if there&#39;s an election coming up? So talk to me about when these... Do you feel like we&#39;re entering a moment of crystallization? And does that change the political calculus for any leader of any order of government in terms of how much weight, time, effort, energy, money they spend into solidifying their messages as all of us start gathering?</span>

            <span class="text">thanks Canadian Thanksgiving, I think is the most important holiday for politics, you know, obviously in Canada. And the reason for that is that we tend to have our, our municipal elections tend to be somewhere in the, in the October range. And so, you know, and a lot of elections have landed in October, October seems to be, I think it&#39;s our, our most popular month for elections.</span>

I don&#39;t think that people are going home and going to be talking about, and an interesting test of this is the take back Alberta advertising that&#39;s happening here in Alberta. They, of course, we changed the law so that there&#39;s limited amount of money that can be spent on political advertising starting in January, but</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, what is your take on spending time, energy, resources on solidifying narratives heading into a natural gathering point where people will share and express their views with family around the dinner table, perhaps bring in friends, you know, conversations will eventually lead to politics. This has been the working theory, at least for some in politics. Does Christmas provide that same opportunity? And this is kind of my segue into those Christmas parties and holiday parties that political parties throw, but also those gathering spots. What do you think of the value of political parties and political leaders spending that time, energy to solidify narratives at this junction?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I do believe in the value of these moments. They&#39;re fewer and further between. I think Thanksgiving is probably the strongest one. Easter&#39;s not a bad one. The thing about Christmas is it&#39;s very busy. It&#39;s very chaotic. And we all have something to talk about because we all got presents that morning right and so it doesn&#39;t have i think the same uh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh thirst for conversation that thanksgiving does right thanksgiving is really it&#39;s a holiday about getting together and talking to people and so we get together and we talk about the things we talk about with our friends which is politics which is religion which is all the things we&#39;re not supposed to talk about that&#39;s why we fight with our uncle that&#39;s why we fight with our aunt that&#39;s why you know you get siblings ganging up against other sibling that kind of stuff and so thanksgiving is is for sure i agree with steve and it&#39;s at the top of that list because there&#39;s just it&#39;s such like a it&#39;s a unique one right you don&#39;t have anything else going on it&#39;s a holiday that&#39;s just about talking christmas has too many distractions in terms of your broader question about this season and whether this is a good time to plant messaging i think generally speaking yes</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yes and no No. Yes, because it is an opportunity to gather. And if people are gathering at political events, like if they self-select into political events, they&#39;re probably a political audience. You can probably provide them the messaging you want to. I think it&#39;s a great, great opportunity to get together people on your side, you know, to give the troops a shot in the arm and to give them the messaging going forward. but know in the sense that uh we&#39;re distracted the same point as before we we have too many things going on our attention is carried in too many different ways we are thinking about maybe we&#39;re thinking about family vacation we&#39;re doing over the christmas break maybe we&#39;re thinking about the christmas presents we&#39;ve still got to buy maybe we&#39;re thinking about uh you know um the the new year&#39;s party that is coming right after that like it&#39;s a very jammed period and because it&#39;s jammed there&#39;s a lot of draws on your attention and when i even broaden it further from events and i start thinking about advertising i take back alberta a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a it&#39;s a very expensive time to advertise because every you know every consumer based product in the world is trying to get you to buy them at the moment so generally speaking if you&#39;re advertising in kind of the issue space you&#39;re probably not spending much if anything in december you know you&#39;re turning those dials right down and you&#39;re doing your heavy flighting you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know later or earlier probably both and um because there is so much advertising again attentions get distracted and it&#39;s a crowded time and so i i think it&#39;s it&#39;s generally overrated and as i talk this out its real value is probably in bolstering your side not in persuading the persuadables because the the people who don&#39;t live and breathe politics they&#39;re living and breathing their real life in the biggest way in the month of December.

It&#39;s one of your many sort of networks. That&#39;s the surface level. As a strategist and as a political operator, how do you view these political events? Is it just as simple as just what I said, that this is just a way for people to fill up their gas tank, see one another, or is there a deeper strategic value to it?

This was released just today that says Trudeau enjoying a year-end bump of sorts, while Pierre Polyev remains deeply unpopular with women. This emerging divide, as Angus Reid Institute says, as is undeniable, unmistakable. Polyev&#39;s favorability is nearly twice as high among men. He&#39;s at 44% versus 23% for Trudeau. Probably doesn&#39;t surprise us, given the images we saw of his rallies and his voter base, and frankly, who conservatives in the last decade plus have been appealing to. But also, the inverse, though not as pronounced as true, where he is significantly significantly poorer amongst women. Like, his unfavorables with women is really, really low at 23%. So, Corey, he struggles to find a foothold. Trudeau, seeming to have a bit of a bump, Jagmeet Singh performing as Jagmeet Singh usually does in that, you know, overall relatively favorable, but, you know, guys, we don&#39;t think he&#39;s viable sort of territory.

We have not seen a lot of him. The videos are now fewer and far between. The absence of the Mississauga Lakeshore by-election is noticeable because because of the L that he took. We mentioned last Patreon episode about the strategy to not show up, and both of you kind of talked about why he did it, but also why it may not have been the right move to do it.</span>

            <span class="text">there is no way a trust me ad is ever going to work with a female population. Because every man in their entire lives that said to them the words, you can trust me, was immediately not trustworthy. And Pierre Polyev does not have that. And so he&#39;s looking for someone to vouch for him, essentially. That&#39;s why when we were talking earlier about bringing his spouse in, who is Anita Polyev, that</span>

You know, when you look at the pictures of them online at the wedding, of their, you know, the christening of their first child or their first child coming, you know, being at an event when Pierre&#39;s being sworn in, all of those things are the things that are missing. And when he does his rants, his rants may work for a certain audience, but they&#39;re obviously not working for women. So if he wants to work with women and be successful with women, he needs to change the way he&#39;s doing it. And the way that I think he needs to do it right off the top is to bring in a Neda Polyev with him on everything. And whether that&#39;s possible or or not, feasible or not. That&#39;s not my problem, but I think that that&#39;s the first step in humanization.</span>

Carter says humanize is at the top of his strategic framework. There could be an argument. I&#39;m not putting words in your mouth. You could disagree. There could be an argument that says, top of the list for Pierre Polyev, two words, Fuck it. Who cares? This is expected. This is not the base that got me to win. This is not the group that I want to find. I&#39;m going to find more of the folks that voted for me, get them angrier, get them louder, be the crisis level leader that has gotten me to this point, and just mobilize them. Now, that could be part of the strategy. But I want to kind of throw it out there for you, in the sense of if you were deriving that 2023 plan, what would be on the top of your list?</span>

Didn&#39;t say it was unprecedented. The reality is the conservatives have trailed with women a lot over the last decade. And the reality is we&#39;ve seen numbers not really move much before elections. And so let&#39;s just start there. And let&#39;s say that we haven&#39;t really seen too, too much here.

Those were right. You&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re wrong, which became Nahid Nengi&#39;s problem as days went on, in my opinion. But this is almost my point, right? It does not necessarily require require you to change who you are. It requires you to repackage the value of that in the context. And so let&#39;s be really clear here. Pierre Polyev is not going to say, hi, I&#39;m Pierre Polyev and I am an arrogant prick. Vote for me. Nobody is suggesting that strategy. Although now I kind of am</span>

What you know is that people are certainly receptive to that point of view. But it doesn&#39;t fundamentally change that you&#39;ve got to get their attention on it. You&#39;ve got to lock them on Pierre Polyev. People think they have opinions about him. They will say that they know who he is. but we also know that people said that about Aaron O&#39;Toole and then they changed opinion of Aaron O&#39;Toole as the election started now it slid back for sure elections matter I think that&#39;s something Stephen would say that&#39;s certainly something I would say but um you</span>

            <span class="text">It&#39;s the ownership of the healthcare file as compared to the ownership or the lack of ownership on cost of living inflation, which many people would say, and any, you know, person who&#39;s truthful about the situation or in good faith would say, Pierre Polyev has owned since the beginning, right? He&#39;s one of the first to talk about inflation. So healthcare, not COVID-style healthcare, but healthcare as the funding, the emergency room, the wait times, the struggles all of us are seeing, the provincial funding, it&#39;s rising to the top. It&#39;s the number one or number two issue, regardless of which political party you support in this country. And one would argue that that is keeping Justin Trudeau at least afloat. And that issue priority is keeping Justin Trudeau at least afloat to where he is. My question to you, Carter,</span>

What are some of the things you think about? If you agree with my thesis that that is what&#39;s keeping Trudeau at least viable, or if not giving him a bump, how would you set up the strategy to to keep volleying healthcare as an active, important issue for the next couple of years?

Because this idea that you&#39;re going to own healthcare from today to that election is impossible to visualize. It just doesn&#39;t exist in a single timeline that you can own that one issue for that long a period of time. You&#39;re just giving your opposition too many chances to come in and redefine the issue for you. So</span>

COP 15, Montreal, last second fill-in for China. 200 countries around the world, including Canada, have come to an agreement to have eight years to set aside almost one-third of their land in marine territories for conservation, conservation, a landmark agreement for biodiversity. On a scale of one to 10, in terms of how much energy and how loud the liberals should get on this, where would you put it? One is not so loud. Don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s not a major win.
