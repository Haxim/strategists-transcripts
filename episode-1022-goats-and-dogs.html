          <p>It's the holidays! But not the Holiday Spectacular, that's Thursday. Enjoy our rundown of the value of year-end political rituals plus find the Zodiac-style message Corey hid in the episode.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss year-end interviews and how politicians use the holidays to convene and convince. Do year-end interviews serve a purpose in 2022? Does Pierre Poilievre have a problem with female voters? And has anybody ever done worse at Christmas than Joe Clark? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

But Corey, I want to talk about the holiday season more broadly. I want to talk about the holiday season as it relates to two things. Parties, outings, Christmas events that political parties hold, and also the year-end interview. These rituals that we see in politics that we&#39;re now seeing play out this year as well. The sit-down, the year-end interview, all orders of governments, every single leader, they clamor, they sit down, they have a deep dive discussion. Corey, talk</div>

            <div class="said">what&#39;s the reason to believe that maybe this year will be better than the last and um what you often find is uh just this this rose-tinted version of it that, again, serves no value. In many ways, it becomes almost like the slowest of slow pitches, the softest of softballs that allow politicians to tell whatever story they want. And I just, I do not understand why media outlets continue to give people these year-end interviews, year-forward, you know, perspectives, because they offer nothing except the opportunity to provide soundbites. You know, there&#39;s no news content in them, for the most part. Carter,</div>

            <div class="said">Carter, talk to me about that, because Corey&#39;s perspective is one that I share in many ways in terms of what its strategic value is to the end voter, to the viewing audience. I kind of see the value for a politician. It&#39;s a microphone. And if I&#39;m going to be given opportunities to give two to three minute answer, not to say some of some interviewers do more of an accountability interview, right? To be fair, Corey, there are some that look at it as an accountability. But Carter, talk to me about your frame of the year-end interview, because we&#39;re seeing as political watchers, you&#39;re seeing a shit ton of them right now. I just saw the preview of the Rosie Barton and Justin Trudeau one. We&#39;re seeing a shit ton of these across multiple political outlets, across multiple orders of government. Talk to me about the year-end interview from your strategist, Lance Carter. Well,</div>

            <div class="said">I think that it&#39;s taking the wrong turn. I think that Corey&#39;s right insofar as, you know, why do even people even want to do these things? And I think that it&#39;s taking the wrong turn because the politicians have decided that this is when they&#39;re going to do these year-end interviews. And I&#39;m not sure if it is because there&#39;s less impact at Christmas time in the new year when people just really aren&#39;t paying attention so they can do their year-end interview and not worry about gotcha questions and things like that. And there&#39;s really nothing happening. So the chance of screwing up is dramatically reduced. But I mean, so I can see the politicians like you, Zane. I can see the politicians why they do it. I struggle with why the media want to do it. I&#39;m assuming it has has to do with, you know, filling</div>

            <div class="said">Hold on to that thought for a second, Carter. I want to come back to that. But Corey, talk to me about accountability for a second. I just threw it out there as some interviewers are a little bit more accountability focused. They&#39;ll give you your 15 minutes. They&#39;ll give it to you on a prime spot of a national program should they be able to hold that. But they might ask you some hard-hitting questions. It&#39;s not the mistletoe softball that we&#39;ve seen in the years years past. Talk to me about the accountability element.</div>

But when you think about, for example, Pierre Polyev, doing the cycles and, you know, holding news conferences, people are like, oh, now&#39;s a chance to ask him about the by-election and the Alberta Sovereignty Act and, and things that I think in more normal times, you&#39;d have access to anyhow. Anyhow, but I also do believe that this accountability is overblown. None of these people are holding them to the fire and saying, that&#39;s great. You want to talk about this?

Like it&#39;s one question, one follow up, maybe another supplemental beyond that. But it&#39;s really very surface level. Like, ultimately, Zane, I guess I&#39;m pretty skeptical that you find any accountability in just one question and one follow up. If they&#39;ve got soundbites, they&#39;ve got their soundbites and they move on. I just don&#39;t, I don&#39;t personally feel they dig deep enough for it to be like, it&#39;s not Frost Nixon, let&#39;s put it that way. And so really, most of it is about just one more day up in the canyons, one more night in Hollywood, they&#39;re just, they&#39;re just doing their show, they&#39;re doing their normal thing.

If you were advising him, this is a guy who&#39;s avoided the traditional media, and you believe that the accountability interview is not necessarily going to dig deep enough or have the runway or the depth enough, would you say, fuck it, go do a year-end accountability interview?

And I think that a personal interview with someone like Pierre would go a very, very long ways in softening some of the critiques and criticism that he&#39;s faced over the last little a while.</div>

Who and why, in your mind? You could choose anyone past or present, any order of government, doesn&#39;t have to be a sitting politician. Frankly, it doesn&#39;t even have to be someone who&#39;s in elected office, they could have just sought elected office.

And that charisma aspect, you can almost see it more so in terms of how it&#39;s received by the interview, usually a hardened, you know, longtime political reporter or national news anchor. And to see how that plays off of that that person, you kind of act as a proxy of the viewing audience of the journalist or the reporter. I&#39;m really curious. Corey, same question to you. Give me your thoughts on this. Who and why? But can you react to the, could the Mulroney type of charisma work in a 2022 world, the political world?

The days go by so fast, but you will remember that feeling that they left you with. So if you can, if you can sort of seize that moment and make it more personal, there&#39;s no harm. And in fact, I think there&#39;s a lot of good, like the actual policy specifics will be lost. But if people a year from now sort of remember feeling not too bad about the the guy in a year-end interview that&#39;s pretty good so it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely doable you&#39;ve just got to um you&#39;ve got to hit the moment and and i think we&#39;ve seen a lot of attempts of people manufacturing that kind of you know like i immediately think of stephen harper trying to be normal human being who loves netflix right yeah like that you got to be careful about that too but if you can hit it uh particularly if the challenge you have is that you seem unpersonable unlikable or at least a large chunk of canadians feel that way might not be required by the way for you to win the election but you certainly want to take it off the table if you can cory</div>

This has been the working theory, at least for some in politics. Does Christmas provide that same opportunity? And this is kind of my segue into those Christmas parties and holiday parties that political parties throw, but also those gathering spots. What do you think of the value of political parties and political leaders spending that time, energy to solidify narratives at this junction?</div>

            <div class="said">yes and no No. Yes, because it is an opportunity to gather. And if people are gathering at political events, like if they self-select into political events, they&#39;re probably a political audience. You can probably provide them the messaging you want to. I think it&#39;s a great, great opportunity to get together people on your side, you know, to give the troops a shot in the arm and to give them the messaging going forward. but know in the sense that uh we&#39;re distracted the same point as before we we have too many things going on our attention is carried in too many different ways we are thinking about maybe we&#39;re thinking about family vacation we&#39;re doing over the christmas break maybe we&#39;re thinking about the christmas presents we&#39;ve still got to buy maybe we&#39;re thinking about uh you know um the the new year&#39;s party that is coming right after that like it&#39;s a very jammed period and because it&#39;s jammed there&#39;s a lot of draws on your attention and when i even broaden it further from events and i start thinking about advertising i take back alberta a</div>

            <div class="said">about him in the year-end interview. I want to talk about how he&#39;s doing in the Angus Reid polling, Corey. This is the polling you mentioned earlier. This was released just today that says Trudeau enjoying a year-end bump of sorts, while Pierre Polyev remains deeply unpopular with women. This emerging divide, as Angus Reid Institute says, as is undeniable, unmistakable. Polyev&#39;s favorability is nearly twice as high among men. He&#39;s at 44% versus 23% for Trudeau. Probably doesn&#39;t surprise us, given the images we saw of his rallies and his voter base, and frankly, who conservatives in the last decade plus have been appealing to. But also, the inverse, though not as pronounced as true, where he is significantly significantly poorer amongst women. Like, his unfavorables with women is really, really low at 23%. So, Corey, he struggles to find a foothold. Trudeau, seeming to have a bit of a bump, Jagmeet Singh performing as Jagmeet Singh usually does in that, you know, overall relatively favorable, but, you know, guys, we don&#39;t think he&#39;s viable sort of territory.

I probably should have done this segment first and that segment second, but I had no idea it was going there, right? But let&#39;s just use that as fodder. Zoom out on the Polyev story here. We have not seen a lot of him. The videos are now fewer and far between. The absence of the Mississauga Lakeshore by-election is noticeable because because of the L that he took. We mentioned last Patreon episode about the strategy to not show up, and both of you kind of talked about why he did it, but also why it may not have been the right move to do it.</div>

You know, when you look at the pictures of them online at the wedding, of their, you know, the christening of their first child or their first child coming, you know, being at an event when Pierre&#39;s being sworn in, all of those things are the things that are missing. And when he does his rants, his rants may work for a certain audience, but they&#39;re obviously not working for women. So if he wants to work with women and be successful with women, he needs to change the way he&#39;s doing it. And the way that I think he needs to do it right off the top is to bring in a Neda Polyev with him on everything. And whether that&#39;s possible or or not, feasible or not. That&#39;s not my problem, but I think that that&#39;s the first step in humanization.</div>

Carter says humanize is at the top of his strategic framework. There could be an argument. I&#39;m not putting words in your mouth. You could disagree. There could be an argument that says, top of the list for Pierre Polyev, two words, Fuck it. Who cares? This is expected. This is not the base that got me to win. This is not the group that I want to find. I&#39;m going to find more of the folks that voted for me, get them angrier, get them louder, be the crisis level leader that has gotten me to this point, and just mobilize them. Now, that could be part of the strategy. But I want to kind of throw it out there for you, in the sense of if you were deriving that 2023 plan, what would be on the top of your list?</div>

He&#39;s one of the first to talk about inflation. So healthcare, not COVID-style healthcare, but healthcare as the funding, the emergency room, the wait times, the struggles all of us are seeing, the provincial funding, it&#39;s rising to the top.

It just doesn&#39;t exist in a single timeline that you can own that one issue for that long a period of time.
