Last four episodes, I&#39;ve been like, it&#39;s the middle of summer. I need to understand how the calendar works. course. It is summer and politics is heating up. Yes, that is the worst pun ever.

            <span class="text">yeah. Really nice. But there&#39;s a lot to talk about. You know, there&#39;s it seems like at this point we&#39;re teasing things out, but there&#39;s still a lot of activity behind the scenes. And I want to get into some of the topics that we haven&#39;t been able to cover in previous episodes. So let&#39;s kick it off with our first segment called It&#39;s Just an Honor to be Nominated. I want to talk about our nominations that are happening in the federal parties right now. I want to talk about pathways to victory And to help us do that, we have a guest. We have a guest on the show, Alice Funke, who is the publisher of Pundit Guides to Politics. Alice, how are you doing?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">i want to talk to us about about something that we haven&#39;t been able to get to on on this podcast which is the nominations for the federal parties as they stand right now alice with your work on pundits guide you&#39;ve been tracking the nominations as they come in for each of the parties provincially but also on aggregate so maybe give us a lay of the land as to where the nominations stand right now and then we can get it into a discussion of where we think they are</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">um a number of them, a large number of them in Alberta, whereas you guys are probably aware they froze their nominations before the provincial election.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Conservatives seem to have been holding back a few seats. I&#39;m wondering if we We could expect a few star candidate announcements. The Liberals seem to be done their target seats. And like I said, the NDP&#39;s major gap is in Alberta. And I would not be surprised if they were not holding back a few star announcements themselves. See,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_03</span>
            <span class="text">See, that&#39;s interesting. You&#39;re almost walking into what my next question is. And I see smirks on the faces of Stephen and Corey here. Here, let&#39;s talk about the nominations as it relates to the percentages and the star candidates. Guys, do you think this is possible right now that the conservatives are, are they holding out for star candidates or do they have star candidates? And I think those are two very different things.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m becoming pretty convinced they have star candidates. Their announcement a day has been pretty impressive. I&#39;m wondering what 78 days of Netflix tax announcements look like, but I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think we&#39;re going to find out. But one or two of those days will probably be the announcements of some candidates with some real chops. I think they know it&#39;s a weakness, and I think they&#39;re going to fill it. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think we&#39;ve been talking about how they&#39;ve lost a large percentage of their front bench. And Harper doesn&#39;t want to replace with a lot of the people who are running for the sixth time. It&#39;s time to put in some new blood and show a little bit of a new team. But one or two star announcements would be as many as I would expect. I certainly wouldn&#39;t expect anything more than that. Alice,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_03</span>
            <span class="text">Alice, what&#39;s your assessment on this? Do you think they have got stars in the pipeline waiting to be announced as candidates? Or is this, lack of a better term, a pipe dream for the Conservatives?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Well, they&#39;ve been trying to recruit a number of the B.C. Liberal MLAs. Some have command, some have not.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">But the latest wild rumor in B.C. two days ago was that Nina Gruel was going to be DQ&#39;d in favor of Kevin Falcon. and after some mad reporting uh it turned out that that was that rumor was not true on the other hand i didn&#39;t see her in any of the photos from the pm&#39;s rally in richmond so then that kept the conspiracy theories going for a while but does look like doug horn is going to run in james moore&#39;s old seat um of course they&#39;ve got diane watts uh in south surrey white rock who is a big get for them um</span>

            <span class="text">getting a star candidate out early enough so that they&#39;re in place and working on the ground and identifying the votes versus making a big splash during the period or closer to the period? Corey, what&#39;s your take on that?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, the reason they&#39;re a star candidate is everybody knows them. That&#39;s the nature of a star candidate. It&#39;s not about getting them out ahead. It&#39;s actually getting their teams out and making sure their organization is functioning at a high level. As this campaign rolls on, You can&#39;t put a campaign team together in 20 days. So often what you&#39;ll see is a situation where there&#39;s a wake. You know, somebody is just doing a stalking horse or somebody otherwise putting an organization together. Because the other thing about star candidates is they&#39;re often in roles where they can&#39;t leave a year before. Political parties go through this like the seasons. It goes back and forth. After every single election, the political party who lost says, we&#39;re going to nominate earlier. earlier and then as the election gets closer they say well hold on maybe we want to hold a few of these back for star candidates there is no one right answer zane i guess is is the lame response i have but um</span>

Some of them are easy to measure, money. Some of them are not, enthusiasm. But that&#39;s all very positive for the New Democrats. And I think it speaks to what we&#39;ve been seeing for the past six months, certainly since the Alberta election, which is there&#39;s a real spring in the New Democrats&#39; step right now.

And we&#39;re moving towards an American system where candidates choose parties. And And right now, we&#39;re in a weird middle ground where candidates choose parties who also choose candidates, and it&#39;s not really working for anybody. How that gets settled in the next couple of years, if it gets settled, it will be one of the big questions, I think, to watch, you know, giving in coming decades seems like a long horizon. But really, it&#39;s going to take several more elections before there&#39;s any kind of conclusion on that. Corey,</span>

You&#39;re saying candidates are choosing parties. You know, there&#39;s going to be hurt feelings, whether that&#39;s, you know, you having your name on the nomination ballot or not. But what is the pathway going forward to taking that energy of about 1,500 people showing up in Edmonton Center to vote for Gil McGowan and then leveraging that onto the the playing field so</span>
