I want to talk about our nominations that are happening in the federal parties right now. I want to talk about pathways to victory And to help us do that, we have a guest.

            <div class="said">Well, the reason they&#39;re a star candidate is everybody knows them. That&#39;s the nature of a star candidate. It&#39;s not about getting them out ahead. It&#39;s actually getting their teams out and making sure their organization is functioning at a high level. As this campaign rolls on, You can&#39;t put a campaign team together in 20 days. So often what you&#39;ll see is a situation where there&#39;s a wake. You know, somebody is just doing a stalking horse or somebody otherwise putting an organization together. Because the other thing about star candidates is they&#39;re often in roles where they can&#39;t leave a year before. Political parties go through this like the seasons. It goes back and forth. After every single election, the political party who lost says, we&#39;re going to nominate earlier. earlier and then as the election gets closer they say well hold on maybe we want to hold a few of these back for star candidates there is no one right answer zane i guess is is the lame response i have but um</div>
