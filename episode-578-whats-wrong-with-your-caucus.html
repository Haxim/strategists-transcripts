We talked about it last episode in terms of what the meaning of a convention is and what you&#39;re looking to get out of it. Carter, you, and I&#39;m quoting you, paraphrasing you, ultimately said it&#39;s the bringing together of family. Corey, let&#39;s start with the Liberals. let&#39;s start here first you were there as an observer was this a bringing together of the family and did the family grow a little bit well the family grew</span>

            <span class="text">of that was because there There was business to be done. And the main thrust of this convention, the only real focus of this convention was the new constitution that the liberals were bringing in. Now, what people care about outside of the party is this notion of abolishing membership. You now just register as a liberal. It&#39;s like being a registered Democrat in the States is an easy example. You get to participate in the so-called primaries we have, which are the voting for the candidates, for the leader, all of that. That&#39;s what people outside of the party cared about. What</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">people inside the party cared about was it also eliminated all of the provincial associations. So the Liberal Party, not to bore everyone to death, have what&#39;s called PTAs or did until this weekend, Provincial Territorial Associations. And they&#39;re kind of remnants. They&#39;re like your appendix. You know, you know, it was there for some purpose historically, but you don&#39;t know why it&#39;s still there. And if you get rid of it, you&#39;re probably going to be able to continue walking. Right. Right. And we actually do know why we had PTAs. And in fact, in some cases, we still had what are termed blended associations. The reason why the liberals have PTAs is that it used to be that the Liberal Party was like the New Democrats. A liberal was a liberal was a liberal. If you were a BC liberal, if you were an Alberta liberal, if you were an Ontario liberal, you bought one membership and you participated in the organization. That was that.</span>

You had communications chairs for a decade who were chairs of committees of one. Get the fuck out of here. I mean it was so pointless and thank God it&#39;s gone. But there was some concern. There was some concern that maybe by abolishing this aristocracy that the Liberal Party had created for themselves, maybe it would be less democratic because that aristocracy is what kept the leader in check.

Nice. But also, this was an optics situation, right? You want something over the weekend. You&#39;re competing with another convention. You, while building your patio, what did you think of this as the liberals and how they played it on the optics perspective? Because this is what Justin Trudeau has excelled at.

It used to be the caucus gave them their job, but now they&#39;re elected by the membership at large. And that is tough, right? It has been the case with a couple of leaders I&#39;ve worked with that the minute they took that job, the majority of the caucus had supported somebody else. Yeah.</span>
