And on the second part of the question, where there&#39;s $450,000 of equity taken out of the house, I probably would have gone on the offensive there too. and i would have said yeah okay and what did she use it for and when they said i don&#39;t know i would have said okay next question right i</span>

He had a great housing week, great video. He&#39;s owning the issue. No one else is speaking in clearer terms. The government&#39;s programs are technocratic.

You know, the provincial premiers pick a fight with Justin Trudeau. Municipal mayors pick a fight with their provincial premiers. All of that is done in some cases because the, you know, Trudeau is controlling resources or finances that the provincial government wants. And other times just because it is in the political interest of the party to move forward. We don&#39;t get to choose. We don&#39;t get to choose what the general public thinks is important in any given time. So if we chose to fight someone else, if we chose to pick on Justin Trudeau, or</span>

And sometimes we&#39;ve been successful in starting the parade, but most times, most times we fail in starting the parade because people don&#39;t care about the things that we care about.

Of course, for those not familiar, there was a story that was published about Jonathan Dennis, the former justice minister&#39;s wedding. The size of that wedding was larger than COVID restrictions would allow at that point. He felt like someone was leaking to the press and he wanted to figure out who was leaking, and thereby he hired a political fixer to trace the phone records of this journalist. Carter, did I get that story right? I know you&#39;ve paid attention to this one. Did I get the facts, at least of the first chapter, I should say, of this story right?

Comms, you&#39;re a finance person. We rarely talk about what I&#39;d call the dark arts positions. And Corey, this kind of leads into your, Dave, too, thank you for smoking, the merchants of death sort of political positions, right we hear them carter you mentioned a few of them spin doctor what the hell&#39;s a spin doctor is that real oppo research is that is that really like a specialized role like or is that someone just that&#39;s good at google like i want to dispel some of this stuff for folks right fixer political fixer i you know we&#39;ve heard the term but i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever met one and if i have they haven&#39;t certainly called themselves that so let&#39;s can we talk about some of these dark arts sort of roles and politics that people either assign or apply. Is there any others you want to throw onto the table, Carter, that you&#39;ve heard and maybe want to help dispel the myth of or talk about if they&#39;re real or not and what exactly their function is and how we&#39;ve seen them take part in the political process?</span>

I think that that&#39;s not a spinner. I think that that&#39;s just a hack. It doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing. Um, spin is, is fundamentally based in fact, in the way that we view the facts. Um, so the spinners we&#39;ve certainly seen, we&#39;ve also seen a lot of kind of dark arts on the social media side. Uh, we&#39;ve talked about bots and trolls, uh, on this before, and, and you can buy bots, you can buy trolls. Uh, there&#39;s, there&#39;s ways of setting up your own internal, uh, troll factory Or bot factory as well. All of those types of things have been done to promote or to tear down other candidates. So social media is certainly a place. And I think that the other place where we actually see a lot of dark arts is something like what we&#39;re seeing with the Jason Kenney leadership right now, where there is mining of memberships, mining</span>

And then going to the other person and saying, tell me what the hell is happening. And then looking at whatever maybe email trails might exist or whatnot, and trying to piece this together in a way that it&#39;s both coherent to you, and that you have the pieces you need to then manage the issue. Because sometimes management of the issue is also pointing to other, sometimes blurs into spin doctor, right? And it&#39;s, yes, you&#39;re looking at the issue here, but turn that issue around, and it looks very different. And so you, quote unquote, spin the issue. So, you</span>

I to share about, you know, politicians, you don&#39;t have to name them, or candidates you&#39;ve worked with, where ethical lines like this are being asked to be crossed, etc. And you see that you&#39;re like, no, I&#39;m not going to do this, to Corey&#39;s point, like, I&#39;m not the guy you go to for something like this. I&#39;m kind of curious to round out our conversation based on that, where politicians who, you know, often are in this power dynamic, where they get whatever they want, usually, in certain scenarios, ask for certain results and may have to take certain means. means i want to kind of get your commentary on what you think happened here and whether it&#39;s related to a power dynamic and a mindset perhaps more broadly yeah</span>

As much as you&#39;re a campaign strategist, you&#39;re an observer server of campaigns trying to dissect what is happening with their strategy. The charitable interpretation to Corey&#39;s point here is that he&#39;s got two audiences. So those are two messages.</span>

So you&#39;re like kneecapping rather than adding to your coalition. So to that point, Carter, do you see something like as someone who spots these things and tries to trace the through line? What do you see as a charade strategy here? The</span>

And every chance they get, they always tweet out, you know, we have more than doubled the Quebec membership since we have undertaken this campaign. They are clearly articulating that strategy. His communication strategy appears to lurch from bad moment to bad moment. He does not have a communication strategy. He does not have a video strategy. He does not have a social media strategy. Whoever&#39;s in charge of comms needs to have their wrists slapped. They do not know what they are doing. And it is undermining the tactical strategy of the or the operational strategy of just getting in there and actually selling memberships and making sure that they can win in key parts of the country.</span>
