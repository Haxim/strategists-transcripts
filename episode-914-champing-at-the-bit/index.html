        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the federal NDP's long-term care policy release, the creation of new political parties and the Republicans eating their own in Wyoming. Do Canadians care about public vs. private delivery? Has negative partisanship completely consumed American politics? And why does Stephen have so little regard for everybody's time that he'd bother to talk about the Alberta Party? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, our first segment, long-term gain. Guys, I want to talk about Jagmeet Singh. That&#39;s a phrase I&#39;ve never said before. No. I want to talk about Jagmeet Singh. I want to talk about his election promise on long-term care. And I want to use that as a gateway to talking about election promises, how they&#39;re constructed, when we should construct them. Is there a is there a best practice in this domain, especially in a minority government, especially when there&#39;s a political dynamic surrounding Jagmeet Singh related to does he feel like the liberals are going to be potentially trampling on, you know, traditional NDP ground as it relates to policy? So, Carter, let me start with you and with a very simple question. Why do you think Jagmeet Singh came out with a long-term care policy X months, and I say X because we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the spring or the fall or even beyond that, before an election?</div>

You&#39;re in a position where they&#39;ve asked you to give them a hand. They&#39;re now perhaps more debt-free. They know that this liberal machine has a very progressive tinge and leaning. What are you advising them regarding policy and timing of policy? Also regarding the fact that they currently sit with some semblance of a balance of power?

And so I think that&#39;s a relatively sound policy, although I, as always, with a with a situation where you start pushing yourself to kind of the political extremes, you do risk losing voters along the way, too.

Is there anything else you try to do? Do you try to double down and make this an issue over and over, get it into earned media?

Jesse Ventura, he wasn&#39;t in either political party, and he just sort of comes in, he catches a wave, and there you go.</div>

As much as we&#39;ve been ribbing it, I think that&#39;s fair. They haven&#39;t met their potential in that way for nearly a decade. OK, do you feel like political leaders for a party like that can be made and incubated and won over a long haul? Or do you feel like they have to find their, quote unquote, star candidate or star leader who wants to take this on?

She, of course, voted to impeach Donald Trump for the for the second time for inciting violence at the Capitol. She has now been censured by the Wyoming Republican Party. They overwhelmingly voted to censure her on Saturday in her role to to cast her vote. vote. Only eight of the 74-member state GOP Central Committee stood to oppose the censure in a vote that didn&#39;t proceed on a formal count. Corey, where do you kind of see this particular thread going? Because I think we, maybe I shouldn&#39;t say we, I find it interesting that one of the stalwarts of republicanism coming from a republican dynasty, the Cheney family dynasty, dynasty is facing such severe rhetoric and now, I don&#39;t know if you call a censure by your state GOP party a repercussion, but is facing some real blowback for her position.

They&#39;re saying that they&#39;re contractually not able to release those. Other parts of the world have-ish certain parts being redacted, but the political damage here that you feel like might be up for grabs for the Trudeau government on a scale of 1 to 10, what do you think?</div>

One of the, I shouldn&#39;t say more prominent, but more voluminous attacks against the Trudeau government right now has been our our lack of domestic production of the vaccine. It&#39;s been waged by O&#39;Toole. It&#39;s been waged with a slightly less sharp elbow by Jagmeet Singh and the NDP. But it&#39;s catching steam, this argument that Canada doesn&#39;t domestically produce, which is why we&#39;re at the whims of the EU and why we&#39;re at the whims of global manufacturing. The potency of that political attack on a scale of 1 to 10, what do you think?</div>

I think O&#39;Toole is, of course, hampered by the fact that it was Harper that kind of allowed it to disappear under his watch. And if I were Singh, I&#39;d be saying, you know, obviously the conservatives are going to get rid of it. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t want the conservatives, but the liberals will never bring it back.</div>
