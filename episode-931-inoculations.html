Let&#39;s start with Variety&#39;s headline that the BBC sets up a complaint line for too much coverage of the Duke&#39;s death. That&#39;s right. The BBC has set up a dedicated complaints page for viewers fed up by the blanket coverage of the death of Prince Philip. Hold</span>

            <span class="text">Read the statement. You&#39;re so upsetting. Read the statement. On the BBC&#39;s Complains page, which invites disgruntled viewers to submit their email address to register a complaint. So not just register a complaint, but a data harvesting strategy to register a complaint. Stephen Carter, your thoughts outside of outside of clearly the shock and now the black that I see you&#39;re wearing mourning the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.</span>

And obviously, but I&#39;m not shocked by the BBC getting email addresses. That&#39;s something that I think is going to become more of the practice. I mean, I can make a joke about it and turning it into money. Or I can point out that I think that, you know, complaints are just flying</span>

            <span class="text">flying in fast and furious on the Internet. And forcing people to do certain little data pieces, I think, will constrain the numbers and force people to maybe stand by their words or be maybe a little bit less vitriolic when they&#39;re posting or leaving their comments.</span>

            <span class="text">but that was the point oh man carter okay our next headline comes to us from the canadian press liberal mp got stark naked during house House of Commons video conference. Do I need to add the substantiating lines? I&#39;ll just add it for those that might have missed this. A Liberal MP was caught wearing his birthday suit in the virtual House of Commons. William Amos, who has represented the Quebec riding of Pontiac since 2015, appeared on the screens versus fellow members of Parliament completely naked. On Wednesday, a screenshot that was obtained by the Canadian press shows him standing behind a desk between the Quebec and Canadian flags. Corey, there&#39;s many angles to this story. There&#39;s obviously the initial jerk reaction. Every word I say could be seen in that light. I said knee-jerk reaction, just so people are clear, was about the picture. Now we&#39;re kind of getting into the second part of the story, which is there&#39;s now a call to have a, I believe it&#39;s like some sort of review by Pablo Rodriguez&#39;s house leader saying, you know, who on the conservative side leaked this picture to the Canadian press, etc. et cetera. When you initially saw it, and when you kind of heard about it in the hours and the days later, what are your thoughts about this particular story?</span>

They&#39;re planning some new substantial and significant restrictions in that province. Corey, I want to ask the same question I asked to Carter, directing it towards you. How big of a deal is this, this AstraZeneca situation? Carter added the J&amp;J situation to to substantiate that point.

            <span class="text">So, Corey, let&#39;s spend one more round on this before we move on. Because part of this is the blood clot part of it. The other part of it, though, is that this kind of affirms the narrative for people that there is a gradient amongst the vaccines. They see the 90-some percent for the Moderna and the Pfizer. They see the, I don&#39;t know what it was, 60, 70-some percent around the AstraZeneca, right? Like I said, largely largely misinterpreted stats, but this just verifies that if I&#39;m being given, and we sit here in Alberta, we&#39;re, you know, making an appointment at a pharmacy, if you&#39;re in the 2B or 2C category, pretty easy. You could just choose not to get this one, right? And I think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here in many places where, you know, people aren&#39;t being wrapped around on the line. They&#39;re saying, well, if this is doing AstraZeneca, I&#39;m just going to go wait another three days and get my Pfizer shot. Like, that just makes more sense. And I feel like that&#39;s part of the the narrative issue here so maybe if we&#39;d like double click on our province in particular would there be advice that you&#39;d have given the particular um maybe behaviors that people are are making around this vaccine blood clots being one factor but not the only factor uh that they&#39;re perhaps considering well</span>

So, you know, a savings account, which is limited in terms of what you can ultimately do with it. Under O&#39;Toole&#39;s plan, Canadians would pay a carbon levy initially amounted to $20 per ton of greenhouse gas emissions every time they buy hydrocarbon-based fuels such as gasoline. But instead of channeling that money into direct direct rebates, as is the case currently. The Conservatives would divert it into, quote, a personal low-carbon savings account. Consumers could then draw those accounts for things that help them live a, quote-unquote, greener life, Stephen. The document says that could include buying a bike or a bicycle or a transit pass, sorry, or saving up to putting that money towards a new energy-efficient furnace or an electric vehicle. All right, guys, that was a mouthful, but I believe important context. Corey, let me start with you on this. When you heard Aaron O&#39;Toole release this plan, we&#39;ll get into the politics in a second. What were your first thoughts when you saw him stand at that podium or when you read this thereafter and read the details of this plan? Your initial sort of take when you consume this, knowing the political dynamic of, I&#39;m now going to, you know, our party needs to change, I&#39;m going to put together a serious plan that the Conservatives can be proud of, that Canadians can be proud of.

Like if you&#39;re taking my money but just giving it back to me in a rebate, economists can answer that question much more artfully than me. But the simple answer is you still have an incentive to produce carbon because I&#39;m giving you the money either way. But if you cut your carbon, it goes back. The conservative one doesn&#39;t have that. It&#39;s like out of – I think somebody online described it out of one pocket into another pocket. But it&#39;s your money and then you get your money back. So where&#39;s your incentive to cut, right?</span>

Serious people are looking at it and doing an evaluation and coming up with serious conclusions about how it will impact the environment and those types of things. But, of course, I&#39;m not here to do the environmental analysis. I&#39;m here to do the political analysis.

Oh, so the money back that came back from the liberals, I don&#39;t get to keep that money? No, you&#39;re not going to get a check.

I know you sold a bunch of stock in me two weeks ago, and I know Corey bought up a lot of the rest. I&#39;m going to check in with him if he still wants to keep it this week. But, you know, you sold a bunch of stock in me, but help me out here. You know, I should have come to you earlier. What am I doing? How am I selling this?

What are you adding to help them sell this thing? We&#39;ve talked about a few, let&#39;s call them quote-unquote assets that this plan has, right? There&#39;s this account that&#39;s personalized. We&#39;ve had a discussion on that a bit. There&#39;s this fact that the government isn&#39;t keeping your money. That&#39;s perhaps a selling feature in some ways. And Carter just talked about the behavioral change element here, right? This is actually to drive behavioral change. What other selling features or what other positioning suggestions or recommendations are you giving Aaron O&#39;Toole?</span>

Money in, money out, what changes? is the conservatives trust you to take climate action that&#39;s right for you, creates a pot of money that you can then spend on the things that are right for you and your family. In opposition of this liberal plan where they choose their their wacky green priorities, whatever they see fit.</span>

And I was going to ask the two of you what the liberals should say. But before I do that, Let me read you what the environment minister, Jonathan Wilkinson, has said thus far, the track that he is on, so you get a sense of where the liberal attack on this climate plan is. So he&#39;s referred to this plan as unserious, repeatedly referring to it as a carbon tax and comparing it to PetroPoints, a renewable loyalty point system. system. And then he said, quote, if you think about it, you now have to create these separate accounts for every Canadian. You have to track their use of gasoline, natural gas, and propane and find a way to flow back into these accounts the money associated with the price of pollution. This is unserious. We&#39;ve been for a long time wanting a serious conversation on this, and this doesn&#39;t get us there.</span>

It&#39;s no plan at all, quote unquote. This is from the New Democrats. Instead of trusting families to make choices that work for them, the conservatives want to sign you up for a savings account you can&#39;t even use on emergencies or essentials. That was the extension by the NDP. It&#39;s so funny. That almost looks like a conservative line in like years that would be like written by the conservatives being like, you know, the NDP and the liberals don&#39;t trust you with your own money. own money. But leave it to us to let you make your own choices. I don&#39;t know what sort of parallel universe we&#39;re living in. But Corey, I&#39;ll let you react to what I primarily want is a Carter question, which is, is unserious and Petro points? We&#39;ve been looking for a serious conversation, and this doesn&#39;t get us there. The attack line that you want on day one, if you&#39;re the liberals, or are you looking for something else?

And I think that&#39;s a concern. I do think it is totally baffling to me how this would actually be operationalized, how they&#39;re going to charge you for carbon, but you&#39;re going to get that money back. And do you need to keep receipts? And like, how bloody complicated is this thing going to get? But, you know, the reason I was smirking is there&#39;s some there&#39;s an irony here.

Because of course, conservatives are upset about there being a carbon tax and it allows him to paint himself more as a moderate.

In fact, you were perhaps the largest shareholder in Aaron O&#39;Toole, all things considered. You know, and if this was a sports podcast, we&#39;d say you are the king of O&#39;Toole Island. Are you selling any of that stock? If I gave you an option today, right now, to dispense with some of your stock, are you selling or are you still – are you holding or are you buying more O&#39;Toole stock?</span>

But he also did resolve, quote-unquote resolve, nothing is resolved, but he solved a bit of a problem they had. And if this gets down to the liberals saying the details of the conservative climate policy are not good enough, that&#39;s a win for Aaron O&#39;Toole, because it says, you know, the words that are in there are the conservatives have a climate policy, right?

A new report revealed that the Liberals hired consultants and their government spending on consultants increased by $6 billion. The question I have for you, overrated or underrated consultants for government work?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It is. In this case, it was actually I was going to specify for you, but it&#39;s explained in the broadest terms. We&#39;re looking at legal services, procurement services, marketing and communications, all of it kind of rolled into one, which business management and management consultant services. It&#39;s a big bill because it&#39;s a big bucket in that way.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think it&#39;s funny because while many people will point it and say, it&#39;s also very expensive to run government. And sometimes it makes sense to use consultants for these specialized services. I&#39;ll pick on law for a minute here. You will hire lawyers in government, and they will have to deal with things that government does on a regular, ongoing basis. But all of a sudden, an issue comes up, and it&#39;s an area of law that you do not have expertise in. It can be absurdly expensive to use the government lawyers, because if you lose, it can cost you tens</span>

            <span class="text">tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars. You might be much better off going and paying for that high-priced law firm that has some expertise in it, right? So it&#39;s tough to say. Just hearing the number, I&#39;m sure it will give Canadians sticker shock. But I think consultants are fine, and there&#39;s a place for them. And unless we want governments to be so staffed that they kind of carry every expertise they may conceivably need, regardless of whether they have enough full-time work to fill somebody&#39;s day, you&#39;re going to use consultants. consultants</span>
