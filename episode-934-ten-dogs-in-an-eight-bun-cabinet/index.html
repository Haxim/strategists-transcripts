Amos explained at the briefing that it was part of a, quote, progressive return to his duties that had begun on June 21st. Quote, I want to be clear that while these two incidents have resulted in great embarrassment, they don&#39;t define me. These were not circumstances of ill intent or unethical gain or moral wrongdoing. He apologized once again for the two incidents, citing that he was just too busy and it was hyperactive in his multitasking, which caused the nude Zoom incidents. incidents uh carter i know you&#39;re a man of many tasks you do multiple things at once and you know occasionally you&#39;re on your phone but then back on your computer you know you&#39;re watching tv and then you like obviously piss in a can in between uh so so tell me tell</div>

Mail, Green Party temporarily lays off staff in leader Annamie Paul&#39;s office. Let me read a bit of this, and let&#39;s get into that and the fact that recently she was muted in her meeting by her executive when she was trying to fight these staff layoffs. But the Green Party significantly diminished leader Annamie Paul&#39;s support team on Wednesday, so a couple days, actually yesterday, temporarily laying off key staff members just weeks before she faces a possible ouster. This is, of course, a July 20th vote of non-confidence for her tenure, which will be held by the executive. Two staff members in Ms. Paul&#39;s office received layoff notices on Wednesday, sources tell the Globe and Mail. They were let go as part of a broader set of layoffs the party is carrying out despite objections from the leader, sources say. say, Corey,</div>

I&#39;ve talked about this before. This seems to me that this is outside of the core of what the Green Party should be standing for. And it should be one of those places where we can say, you know what, we have a disagreement on that issue, but that&#39;s not central to our party. Because every party has people who have disagreements around issues. Every party doesn&#39;t agree or see eye to eye on everything. And this party is behaving the way I&#39;ve never seen a party behave before. And to cut off the leader like this, one has to ask, what is at the core of it? Because it&#39;s not the issue. It&#39;s not just the issue. There&#39;s something beyond that. And I can&#39;t help but wonder if it has something to do with sexism and or racism, because this is not the way that any other party has treated any other leader in my political history.

And at that point, she should walk away and talk to people that got her her to the Green Party leadership and say, do we need a new Green Party? Because the Green Party that she&#39;s leading right now has the infrastructure, but it does not, it will not have any momentum. It&#39;s going to die a horrible death here. And, you know, maybe the best thing for her to do is to resign as leader immediately following the election and then run as leader again and put in a national council that actually makes sense.

Talk to me as someone who I know personally who&#39;s spent a lot of your quite literally free time trying to find candidates, you know, predominantly women to run for office at all orders of government. What is something like this, this story, getting the airtime and the oxygen due to people who are maybe kicking tires, sitting on the sidelines, saying maybe I should publicly serve, and they see something like this happening to a leader in broad daylight, so to speak? week. What do you think this kind of does to perhaps the cohort or the pipeline of candidates? And tell me if you feel like I&#39;m getting overly sentimental or overly blowing it up too much of folks that may not see themselves in political life, but see Annamie Paul and others like her and say, oh, maybe this is for me, and then see something like the past week with the Green Party as a result.

We haven&#39;t done an Alberta segment in a while. Taking the train to nowhere, of course, a literal and metaphor for two things. Number one, the Green Line LRT approved here in Alberta. Stephen Carter, you&#39;ll walk us through what that means and the politics of it as the prime minister was here visiting the premier and the mayor of Calgary. And then, of course, Jason Kenney having a quote unquote cabinet shuffle. Maybe the quote should be around shuffle. because it was more a cabinet growth than it was a shuffle, adding ministers, but removing one and packing, ensuring she packs her bags to a train of nowhere. Lila here, who had three portfolios in her ministry, now with zero. That seems to be the headline from that shuffle. Maybe you guys can tell me otherwise in terms of both the strategy and what the headline from that shuffle looks like and what Kenny&#39;s trying to get out of it. But Carter, let&#39;s start here with the green line. The prime minister was in town earlier this week, meeting with the premier, meeting with the mayor, his meeting with the premier, you know, unsurprisingly, you know, a little tense, slightly frosty, like not, you know, entirely not cordial. But, you know, it was it was two guys who don&#39;t like each other hanging out for 45 minutes. He then meets with Mayor Nenshi for a love in and then they head over to announce the green line that this new funding and just before they&#39;re about to announce it, this This is where I need you to come in because I&#39;m actually confused and I have lost track of the bouncing ball here. The province, which is not at this press conference with the prime minister and the mayor, issues a press release two minutes before they&#39;re about to go on stage saying the Green Line is approved. So first, Carter, can you demystify for me just and for our listeners what happened? Because there is some strategy here, but I don&#39;t even know where to start to ask the strategy questions. So maybe for our non-Alberta listeners and maybe for some of our Alberta listeners. But let&#39;s be clear for me. Can you lay out the terrain for what&#39;s happening here? Sure.</div>

They didn&#39;t want to have a bunch of MLAs and ministers walking around not having answers on the green line, so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s part of their decision-making on when they timed it.

          <div class="said">So, yeah, it&#39;s an official title, Corey. So listen, Jason Kenney doing a cabinet quote unquote shuffle. You know, you guys can explain what the quote means, so to speak, because it seems like more a cabinet growth than a shuffle. But there was a shuffle in a sense. So Jason LeJuan, the MLA of Calgary Foothills, has moved from associate minister of addictions and mental health to become the new minister of community and social services. Rick McIver, who was holding multiple ministries after the municipal affairs minister was let go and consolidated into his previous ministry. So he had the dual role of transportation and municipal affairs. He lets go of transportation, keeps municipal affairs. Rajan Sani, who was the minister of community and social services, now takes on transportation. interpretation. And Mohamed Yassin, also from Calgary, like Minister Sani, leaves his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration to become the Associate Minister of Immigration and Multiculturalism. There&#39;s also some additions in cabinet, primarily in the form of associate ministerships. And remind me of that. I want to talk about the importance of associate ministers, quote unquote, as well, and why some of these aren&#39;t full-out ministers, so to speak. So Mike Ellis of Calgary West becomes the Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. Nate Horner from Drumheller-Stettler becomes the Associate Minister of Rural Economic Development. Whitney Izzik, I believe I&#39;m pronouncing that last name correctly, becomes the Associate Minister of the Status of Women, reporting directly to the Minister of Culture, who I&#39;ll get to in a second, who is Ron Orr. He becomes the Minister of Culture from Lacombe-Pinocco. Also notably, the guy who in a Facebook post said that Kenny was raised by God to be the leader of Alberta. Well, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get to that. We also have Tanya Furr, who is from Calgary Pagan, is Associate Minister of Red Tape Production, and out of cabinet, gone, two individuals, Grant Hunter, who was the aforementioned Associate Minister of Red Tape Production, and Leela Ahir, who held multiple portfolios, culture, multiculturalism, and status of women, now having none of those three, completely out. And, of course, notably, she was one of the MLAs, one of the ministers at the time, who criticized Kenney, publicly called him out to apologize after he and other senior cabinet ministers were caught breaking the government&#39;s COVID-19 restrictions at the Sky Palace. She also criticized Kenney&#39;s tone-deaf response on the Sir John A. MacDonald statue controversy as well. Corey,</div>

And it brought in a number of associate ministers, basically enlargening the cabinet. And interesting that they&#39;re all associate ministers, too. There&#39;s kind of this two-tier cabinet that&#39;s been created as a result, right? I&#39;ve never seen such a mix of minister and associate minister. minister and um and then it also it generally didn&#39;t change other things so you you brought people in you haven&#39;t antagonized any of your existing ministers by and large because you&#39;ve kept them in the positions with the exception of the person who spoke against you yeah and</div>

          <div class="said">he has to win at some point and at some point you have to hit rock bottom so that you can start to reconstruct what it is i don&#39;t think that these decisions are going to be able to be seen through i think that when the finance minister mused about cutting nurses salaries it didn&#39;t go great for the government that day um and i don&#39;t think that it&#39;s going to go great for the government if they continue their fight with doctors their fight with nurses their fight with the pandemic uh their fight with curriculum their fight with teachers their fight with parents. They can&#39;t fight every front, and they have to retreat at some point. And that&#39;s what the caucus shuffle should have been, in my mind, is a retreat from incredibly unpopular positions, and then the crafting of new positions that will enable them to win in 2023, because it&#39;s going to take some time to build back from a personal popularity of 22%.</div>

And what Jason Kenney did here was he made it so it was much more likely that he would survive to get to that election he has to win in the future. And I look, I&#39;m not somebody who believes like he was an imminent threat of leadership. But I think he, he probably sized things up and said, you know what, I&#39;ve got a problem here. And I&#39;ve got to resolve this problem before it gets entirely out of control on me. And so I am going to find some ways to manage my caucus situation.

Second problem is if you&#39;re going to change course, what? what? You&#39;re going to be less likely to fight with the nurses. You&#39;re going to be less tough on wages. You&#39;re going to be more willing to concede to the doctors what they want. You&#39;re going to be more willing to concede to the teachers what they want. What is that going to do for the very base that we&#39;ve just talked about potentially being a risk to you? So from both a policy point of view and the way you operate and the way you treat people point of view, those kinds of shuffles would probably have been very damaging to Jason Kenney. And do</div>

I&#39;m going to listen. I&#39;m hearing you. I&#39;m reflecting your needs. And because of that, they&#39;re saddled with four years of difficult decisions. That&#39;s what needs to happen. Shuffles must happen for a government to be successful.</div>

And they actually forced him to apologize. And I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t like that very much. And so there&#39;s also that, right?

Because it&#39;s like any organization, politics, and we&#39;ve said this before, it&#39;s just like, it&#39;s a workplace in many ways, too. And people do watch how you treat people on their way out. And they think, well, how would I want to be treated? And is that fair? And is that right?

So the other thing, this is unsolicited advice to leaders here, but that which must be done immediately or eventually must be done immediately. If this is just not working out with a minister you get rid of the minister before it becomes a a bigger problem and it also becomes a question on your judgment and how you manage your manage your cabinet cory</div>

They take us for granted. I thought that was basically pitch perfect as far as like an opposition message against it, because you talked about jobs, you talked about health care, you talked about education, and as a Southern, not, I mean, Lethbridge isn&#39;t rural, but as a Southern Alberta MLA, also getting to throw in the dig of being taken for granted, like it just, it It checked</div>
