And that didn&#39;t happen, not because American tanks were there, not because American munitions were making their way into the country, but because the Ukrainian people said, absolutely fucking not. And they stood up and they put on a resistance and they pushed Russia back. Right? right so let&#39;s not forget let&#39;s never forget that the fundamental ingredient of their resistance is their own will to resist and i see no reason to believe that that&#39;s gone away in any meaningful sense right so that&#39;s that&#39;s number one the other thing that gives me kind of hope is that the nature of warfare has</span>
