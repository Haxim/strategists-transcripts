These are all war metaphors for a reason, right? One of the main considerations in any war is logistics and how are you going to make sure your troops have what they need when they need it. truly surprising somebody gives you a massive advantage. They&#39;re not going to have those things. And they&#39;re not even going to have kind of the human capital ready to go because you&#39;ve got to train up volunteers. You&#39;ve probably got new systems. You&#39;ve got distributions that you&#39;ve got to figure out. There are always challenges that need to be moved through here.</span>

They were ready. They were ready. So, I mean, I don&#39;t know if this was just that, you know, the UK conservatives are a dumpster fire, you&#39;ve got to stay in a state of perpetual readiness, because you never know when this party is going to collapse and you&#39;re going to have to go. or if maybe they did see some signs and maybe we&#39;ll understand through reporting in days to come here but like printed signs like printed what looked like full bleed production print signs that said change on day one of their they</span>

Is it the fact that, you know, modern day campaigning no longer has an element of catching anyone off guard in a four-year continuous campaign cycle, that that&#39;s not possible? Is it the fact that getting over government—I&#39;m just throwing a few propositions at you, you guys take this wherever—is it that getting over government-itis actually takes a lot more time and energy to fully convert your mind and your body and your sense of campaigning from government to—what do you think it is? Because as much as, like, we want to poke at Sunak and and say that Labour was ready, Conservatives were ready. They were ready in 2021. O&#39;Toole had, let&#39;s remind ourselves, a policy platform book, fully done, baked, cover shot, and ready to go with digital and online.</span>

Now, I&#39;m not going to, you know, guess what happens at the end of this campaign, though the spread is significantly different in the UK than it was in 2021. But Corey, your thoughts here?

Because Corey presents a very cogent, logical case around why why you do any of this.

            <span class="text">I think, I think it&#39;s actually a great idea to get out of debating when you have to actually campaign. You know, one of the reasons that, that the conservatives traditionally do not not debate is that there&#39;s more valuable campaign activities available to them at that time um one could argue in june or so there&#39;s just not that yeah there&#39;s well that&#39;s and it&#39;s a big lie but it&#39;s one of the things that they say um but</span>

            <span class="text">think it would also provide us an interesting data point in like can is there any chance of trudeau turning this around right because they are telling themselves a story like once we get to an election once people see this guy well then we&#39;re going to be able to turn it around but i don&#39;t see any evidence of that right now and</span>
