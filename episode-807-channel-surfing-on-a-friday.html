I remember back in 2012, if I&#39;m not mistaken, it was Mitt Romney put up a little bit of a stage in a football theater. Now, it wasn&#39;t the whole thing or the football stadium. The whole thing wasn&#39;t about sitting in the bleachers, but he just had six or seven rows and he got panned for just selecting the location. this is significantly worse but but your general thoughts on what you saw last night or didn&#39;t see well</div>

And you just have the camera panning towards these Republican, whether they be congressmen or senators who also made the trip and just the sheer horror on their face. But the reason I think this was such a big fail was this concept that you&#39;d mentioned up front, which was expectations. And expectations for this were set by Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who went online, said this is the rally of like the century. A million people had registered. I want to talk about how the million people registered. So you have this guy who&#39;s the campaign manager talking Talking about a million people registering, boosting expectations up until mere hours before this thing is about to get going, is still tooting that horn, saying it&#39;s going to be this this epic thing that&#39;s going to be executed.

And then people would be saying, wow, Trump managed to exceed his expectations. he got over 6 000 people when he was expecting 5 000 and by the way if you actually end up with that hundred thousand number or whatnot they were expecting this looks like the biggest event since the beatles and um that would have been one hell of a launch in but all he managed to do was raise expectations to the point where like</div>

I want to maybe take this as an opportunity to take a step back and talk about the skill set required for campaign management in some ways, because what&#39;s interesting about Parscale that many people, especially inside the Republican Party, were celebrating was that he was the digital organizer, the digital lead for Trump in the last election. And of course, the myth around Trump and the story, however much you want to believe it, was that digital is what won the day in 2016. So having him run the entire campaign seems good on the surface, but probably comes with some deficits. Corey, can you maybe perhaps talk to us about some of the other skill sets required on a campaign, even though we&#39;re in this COVID era where digital and virtual are much more important? Talk to us about some of the other skill sets that maybe someone like Parscale or someone else who kind of comes from the digital world may not have.</div>

            <div class="said">my favorite one. I want to talk about Aaron O&#39;Toole. Of course, coming off the heels of his poor French debates, coming off the heels of an English debate, where we have titled about him as being viable, saying that in second place, there is a chance that Aaron O&#39;Toole could be the next leader. So let&#39;s talk about him. And then he, on Friday night, wages an allegation against the McKay campaign. He says that in a late night news release Friday that he has filed a former complaint with three police agencies seeking investigation into Peter McKay&#39;s campaign, suggesting that there is a data breach. And then he names a organizer for the McKay campaign, Jamie Lahl from Alberta here, suggesting that there&#39;s a data breach and this individual had kind of stolen data from the campaign. Corey, you know, before we get into the strategy and if there is any, what do you kind of make of this from O&#39;Toole in this moment in time of the race?</div>

            <div class="said">it&#39;s fascinating. You know, I was just saying last week, it&#39;s very hard to move people&#39;s first choice support once they&#39;ve already bought a membership for them. And I&#39;ll just reiterate, just because they bought the membership from the campaign doesn&#39;t mean they bought the membership for the campaign. All to say, it&#39;s tough to move votes once those membership purchases are locked. This is the kind of thing that can lose votes. This is the kind of thing where people can look at Peter McKay and say, oh, my goodness, this is just shady. I can&#39;t have anything to do with it. Alternatively, if it turns out these are entirely unfounded allegations, These are the kind of things that can make people run screaming from Aaron O&#39;Toole because it starts to sound very tinfoil hat-ish if it turns out that there&#39;s just absolutely nothing to it and no reason to believe it. Now, I know nothing of the substance of these allegations. None of us do because all the campaign has put out has been that one-page press release. But, I mean, now we&#39;re at a moment where I think everybody is looking around and saying, what the hell is happening? Carter, let&#39;s talk to me about the strategy</div>

Like when you look at GDP per capita, it&#39;s just so significantly above most of our neighbors. And so when you think about something like equalization, it&#39;s right there in the name.

And those hard times have not been helped by the policies that are in place and have been enshrined that deal with the transfer of money between the federal government and the provinces, because they were really never designed for a thing like this.

I want to end this particular segment with the communication strategy of how this report was released, which I find quite humorous. It was, of course, authored by the panel members, Donna Kennedy-Glanz being one of the chief writers and kind of being the de facto spokesperson when it was released. But then you had Drew Barnes, who&#39;s an MLA, also part of this report, coming out and almost disagreeing with the executive summary, so to speak, and saying, this needs to go further. This needs to go even further than what this report says. How do you kind of, just from maybe my amusement sense, but what do you kind of make of how this was released?</div>

People very carefully chose words, and the minute either party says something beyond the words, that informs you. I don&#39;t think there was a broad consensus there, and it may have been everybody versus Drew Barnes.
