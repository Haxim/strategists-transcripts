            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">on there that was actually probably i just want to say beautifully constructed on my part for those who know you know um so donald trump is holding his rally some may call it a white nationalist rally in tulsa oklahoma he promised of course a million people that wanted to go uh he then said uh this was two cameras a couple of days before that there was 19 000 people allowed in the arena another 15 or 20 000 people outside uh but that you know still the 995 000 other people just would not be able to come in and he apologized to them in advance turns out cory as you said 6200 people in a 19 000 seat arena um first of all before we we get started on what the hell stagecraft is because we should discuss that uh general thoughts on what happened well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there there&#39;s so many competing theories out there but i mean fundamentally what happened was they raised expectations sky high and they they they fucking failed and i think this is probably where you&#39;re going to go with stagecraft but i&#39;m just going to say it right now</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when one of the like the rule of political advance is that uh you get a room that&#39;s half the size of what you think you need, because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because empty rooms look bad. You know, you jam 100 people into a 50 person space, you jam 200 people into 100 person space, and so on and so forth going up 6200 people in a 19,000 person space. And in fact, having an overflow space that you have people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people taking pictures of you taking down because there&#39;s so few people there. That&#39;s about as tragic as it gets when it comes to tour and when it comes to advance. And oh boy, I can only imagine what the conversation was on Air Force One on the flight back. Corey,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, is this the biggest political stagecraft sort of fail you&#39;ve seen, period?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;d have to rack my brain and think of a worse one, but it&#39;s up there for sure. Just cavernous. Cavernous room, high stakes, big stage.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">In fact, when you sort of consider that this was supposed to be Trump&#39;s big relaunch in, I mean, I would really have to scour the history books to see what was worse than this. But given expectations, moment, all of that, it&#39;s pretty bad.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, you know, Corey was talking about some of the basic rules of political stagecraft. I remember back in 2012, if I&#39;m not mistaken, it was Mitt Romney put up a little bit of a stage in a football theater. Now, it wasn&#39;t the whole thing or the football stadium. The whole thing wasn&#39;t about sitting in the bleachers, but he just had six or seven rows and he got panned for just selecting the location. this is significantly worse but but your general thoughts on what you saw last night or didn&#39;t see well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i mean the stagecraft was terrible i mean you you the over promise or under promise over deliver mantra is central to advance um that is the advance mantra and for those who don&#39;t know what advance is advance are the group of people that then</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">then kind of manage the event logistics i think the other thing that was remarkable is that six of the advanced team for trump on this campaign actually came down with COVID-19. I mean, it just could not have gone worse. I mean, they literally were catching the pandemic by producing this event. I&#39;m glad it failed. I mean, I&#39;m glad it failed for two reasons. Number one, egg on the face of Donald Trump just makes me happy. And number two, we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we will see less spread of COVID-19 as a result of this debacle</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">debacle than we we would have seen if the 42,000 person space outside in the 19,000 person arena had actually been filled. I mean, 60,000 plus, uh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Donald Trump, um, and Mike Pence would have been tragic. That&#39;s the other thing too. We always like to blame this on the Trump organization. This is the full Republican party. Everybody comes together for the Republican, uh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">uh, presidential campaigns. Everybody&#39;s supposed to be there. And they either walked away from him and allowed him them to flail, or they&#39;re as incompetent as the Trump organizers themselves.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">You know, Corey, one of the most, I guess, symbolically poetic parts of last night&#39;s rally was cameras panning across this arena, and all you&#39;d see is blue seats, and you&#39;d see more blue than red. And you just have the camera panning towards these Republican, whether they be congressmen or senators who also made the trip and just the sheer horror on their face. But the reason I think this was such a big fail was this concept that you&#39;d mentioned up front, which was expectations. And expectations for this were set by Trump campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who went online, said this is the rally of like the century. A million people had registered. I want to talk about how the million people registered. So you have this guy who&#39;s the campaign manager talking Talking about a million people registering, boosting expectations up until mere hours before this thing is about to get going, is still tooting that horn, saying it&#39;s going to be this this epic thing that&#39;s going to be executed. I mean, can you put yourself in his head? What do you think he was thinking?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think he was. There is no good reason for this. If you&#39;re going to have something like that, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">would still be better if he said, hey, you know, with everything going on, with COVID, with all of this talk in the media, basically all of the excuses they&#39;re now making after the fact, if they had provided them beforehand and said, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, we&#39;re not really thinking the top bleachers will be filled. We&#39;re thinking maybe 5,000 people, which, by the way, is still a huge rally. Look at how sad Biden&#39;s rallies are. You could have done that. And then people would be saying, wow, Trump managed to exceed his expectations. he got over 6 000 people when he was expecting 5 000 and by the way if you actually end up with that hundred thousand number or whatnot they were expecting this looks like the biggest event since the beatles and um that would have been one hell of a launch in but all he managed to do was raise expectations to the point where like</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

I think Carter, it was you first saying Parscale does not have the skill set to be running this campaign. I want to maybe take this as an opportunity to take a step back and talk about the skill set required for campaign management in some ways, because what&#39;s interesting about Parscale that many people, especially inside the Republican Party, were celebrating was that he was the digital organizer, the digital lead for Trump in the last election. And of course, the myth around Trump and the story, however much you want to believe it, was that digital is what won the day in 2016. So having him run the entire campaign seems good on the surface, but probably comes with some deficits. Corey, can you maybe perhaps talk to us about some of the other skill sets required on a campaign, even though we&#39;re in this COVID era where digital and virtual are much more important? Talk to us about some of the other skill sets that maybe someone like Parscale or someone else who kind of comes from the digital world may not have.</span>

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a campaign chair, you&#39;re a Paul Manafort, perhaps not in prison, but you were playing a Paul Manafort style character and you&#39;re helping Trump kind of get through this. What advice are you giving him right now in terms of the sustainability of his campaign? Does Brad Parscale need to go? Does the head need to roll to begin with? What do you need to do right now?</span>

            <span class="text">my favorite one. I want to talk about Aaron O&#39;Toole. Of course, coming off the heels of his poor French debates, coming off the heels of an English debate, where we have titled about him as being viable, saying that in second place, there is a chance that Aaron O&#39;Toole could be the next leader. So let&#39;s talk about him. And then he, on Friday night, wages an allegation against the McKay campaign. He says that in a late night news release Friday that he has filed a former complaint with three police agencies seeking investigation into Peter McKay&#39;s campaign, suggesting that there is a data breach. And then he names a organizer for the McKay campaign, Jamie Lahl from Alberta here, suggesting that there&#39;s a data breach and this individual had kind of stolen data from the campaign. Corey, you know, before we get into the strategy and if there is any, what do you kind of make of this from O&#39;Toole in this moment in time of the race?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s fascinating. You know, I was just saying last week, it&#39;s very hard to move people&#39;s first choice support once they&#39;ve already bought a membership for them. And I&#39;ll just reiterate, just because they bought the membership from the campaign doesn&#39;t mean they bought the membership for the campaign. All to say, it&#39;s tough to move votes once those membership purchases are locked. This is the kind of thing that can lose votes. This is the kind of thing where people can look at Peter McKay and say, oh, my goodness, this is just shady. I can&#39;t have anything to do with it. Alternatively, if it turns out these are entirely unfounded allegations, These are the kind of things that can make people run screaming from Aaron O&#39;Toole because it starts to sound very tinfoil hat-ish if it turns out that there&#39;s just absolutely nothing to it and no reason to believe it. Now, I know nothing of the substance of these allegations. None of us do because all the campaign has put out has been that one-page press release. But, I mean, now we&#39;re at a moment where I think everybody is looking around and saying, what the hell is happening? Carter, let&#39;s talk to me about the strategy</span>

We don&#39;t exactly know what the O&#39;Toole organizers are thinking, but they know they&#39;re probably in second place. They know they&#39;re not outright leading this thing. There must be some strategy at play here. Can you kind of suggest, at least in your mind, what you think is going on?</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, Carter makes an interesting point here, which is we&#39;ve seen here in Alberta that these investigations can take a very long time. There&#39;s a good likelihood that this does not get proven right or wrong before this leadership race takes place. So does that not challenge your sentiment that like if if O&#39;Toole puts this out, he you know, and if it&#39;s if it&#39;s false or if it&#39;s misleading, that there&#39;s a political price to pay because it&#39;ll it&#39;ll be baked before then.

Like when you look at GDP per capita, it&#39;s just so significantly above most of our neighbors. And so when you think about something like equalization, it&#39;s right there in the name. It&#39;s about equalizing the standard of living across the country. How do you give more equalization</span>

It is prima facie stupid, right? But that all said, there&#39;s no doubt that Alberta has gone through some hard times lately. And those hard times have not been helped by the policies that are in place and have been enshrined that deal with the transfer of money between the federal government and the provinces, because they were really never designed for a thing like this. When you look at equalization, there&#39;s all sorts of, like,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, we started this, this podcast, this episode in particular around communication strategy with stagecraft. I want to end this particular segment with the communication strategy of how this report was released, which I find quite humorous. It was, of course, authored by the panel members, Donna Kennedy-Glanz being one of the chief writers and kind of being the de facto spokesperson when it was released. But then you had Drew Barnes, who&#39;s an MLA, also part of this report, coming out and almost disagreeing with the executive summary, so to speak, and saying, this needs to go further. This needs to go even further than what this report says. How do you kind of, just from maybe my amusement sense, but what do you kind of make of how this was released?</span>

People very carefully chose words, and the minute either party says something beyond the words, that informs you. I don&#39;t think there was a broad consensus there, and it may have been everybody versus Drew Barnes. That certainly wouldn&#39;t shock me, but my suspicion is that it shows that behind the scenes, there was a more aggressive force there. And I think that I want to mention something in</span>
