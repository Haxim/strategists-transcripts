This is a very interesting topic that has come up, I should say, pun intended, online over the course of the last couple of days. Bill C-10 was designed to update the Broadcasting Act to include online streaming services, which would allow Canada&#39;s broadcast regulator, the Canadian Radio Television Communications Commission, the CRTC, to seek financial contributions from online broadcasters such as Netflix, Spotify, Crave, and Disney+. The bill would give the CRTC the power to regulate these online streaming services, mandate contribution payments, and order discovery requirements and introduce fines for noncompliance. But the Liberal government is being accused of its effort to regulate social media content, which conservatives are saying amount to censorship of political speech as well. O&#39;Toole made a comment this past Thursday saying that he finds this to be regulating social media and being a mark against free speech. speech, and after the government amended its final version of C-10 in the late stages of a committee review.

On top of that, there&#39;s a lot of other things tapped into this particular bill, making sure that taxes get paid and other good things from Internet providers. And I think that people should be responsible for what shows up on their platforms a little bit more. And by the way, this isn&#39;t making everybody who posts everything responsible. This feels to me like it is a compromise to start, and I suspect it may get compromised a little bit more as it moves through the process. But frankly, I&#39;m for this, and I think that we&#39;ve waited too long and incurred far too many negatives. There is no question that the rise of social media, the rise of the Internet has done damage to our intellectual discourse and the news that is gathered and disseminated throughout the society.

And the amendments to C-10 in its final stages of the committee review included social media and user-generated content as part of its bill. Where do you kind of stand on this, Corey? Corey, do you feel like this is a real conversation we&#39;re having? Or are the conservatives kind of playing politics and perhaps bastardizing this a bit from your perspective?</div>

You know, Carter, this being treated similarly but different in the United States, you know, perhaps one of the few things in the U.S. right now that seems to be having at least some momentum of bipartisan support around antitrust legislation, a lot of this stuff in the U.S. being embodied within that casing. Do you feel like the free speech angle is the right criticism angle for the conservatives? And maybe my broader point here is, do you feel like free speech, to borrow Corey&#39;s term, is a political argument that can catch virality, that can actually mobilize and engage enough people? Or is there a different angle if you were conservatives and you wanted to attack this bill you would go after? So</div>

So now the right of speech is not the right to broadcast. But when we come back to the Internet, we go back and treat it just the same way as we treated the printing press. Anybody can have it. Anybody can have it and anybody can say anything that they wish to say on it. And I think it&#39;s created a mistake in the system where I think the right way to approach it was the right to broadcast should not necessarily be given to us. The right to speech is not inhibited just because you&#39;re not allowed to broadcast it on a podcast, right? We can&#39;t say anything that pops into our heads on this podcast for fear of some sort of legal chill that might land on us. For example, we can&#39;t just every week bring up WestJet.</div>

I mean, there&#39;s been so many times throughout history, I&#39;d suggest most of the world, there was at least some time where not everybody could buy a printing press. They&#39;ve often been regulated. Even in the United Kingdom, they were regulated for a long period of time. There was the licensing of the Press Act in the late 17th century. So, like, you&#39;re just wrong. but this in many ways makes the conversation more nuanced and more interesting and more textured and this is the conversation i think people need to have rather than making grand assertions they believe are true like you could always buy a printing press let&#39;s talk about how these technologies have often led to challenges and how people have often moved through those challenges because the question of like just entire falsehoods being fabricated that goes back to the printing press and there were things that people had to do and there was a and it&#39;s part Part of why I&#39;ve generally speaking been like, well, we&#39;ll figure it out, because we&#39;ve always figured it out with these past technologies, sort of, right?

Also worth mentioning, the highest active case rate in Canada, with more than 480 active cases per 100,000 people. Starting Friday, the province will implement targeted measures for hotspots across the province where we have at least 350 active cases per 100,000 folks. The list of targeted communities include Edmonton, Calgary, Fort McMurray, Red Deer, Grand Prairie, Airdrie, Lethbridge, and Strathcona County. So a lot of what you&#39;d call urban Alberta, if I can put it in that very simplistic classification. Corey, let&#39;s start with you. A premier who today comes out with these new quote-unquote measures, many would call them light or cosmetic or not necessarily massive upgrades, but on the heels of comments yesterday where he said, you know, why introduce new rules and new measures when we know people aren&#39;t going to follow them? Explain to me what you&#39;re thinking or what you think Premier Kenney was thinking And perhaps what led to today in terms of what was rolled out?</div>

But Banff is represented by Miranda Rosen, one of the COVID-18, who said, you know, come on, Premier, let&#39;s let us all back to doing whatever the hell we want to do. And as a result, they instituted this floor, right, where you have to have at least 250 cases in the active region, regardless of what the rates are, regardless of how it actually is functioning. So basically what that does is any small center, you can&#39;t actually get to, you can&#39;t get above the threshold because you&#39;ve only got X numbers of thousands of people.

So the active cases, the threshold is 350 active cases per 100,000 to be included in these targeted zones, or at least 250 active cases.

            <div class="said">Carter, you talked about Jason Kenney getting hit from both sides. Let&#39;s talk about one of those sides right now with a campaign called KennyMustGo.com. It&#39;s an open letter that one can send as a general member of the UCP or a CA, Constituency Association board member. The form letter includes comments, which by the way, we don&#39;t know who the sponsors are of this letter. But we know that the other than to know that they, you know, presumably seem like conservative UCP members. I&#39;m quoting from the letter now. You have not upheld the core grassroots principles of the party, particularly by repeatedly violating our statement of principles and attacking free enterprise, personal responsibility, freedom of worship, freedom of assembly, and the free use of property. You have not controlled government spending or protected Albertan families from excessive government intrusions. That&#39;s just a quote from it. Getting hit by the right of his party, getting hit by presumably that rural group that COVID-18 group. How serious do you take this if you&#39;re Jason Kenney right now? And then let me expand it. How seriously do you take this if you&#39;re at the Premier&#39;s office right now? This particular campaign, and then let&#39;s expand this because it&#39;s been a week or so since we&#39;ve discussed Kenney leadership overall. And now, I shouldn&#39;t say the floodgates, but the conversations are certainly more normalized, certainly more socialized, that Kenney&#39;s leadership is under threat. It used to be that little sort of murmur in the political class. We now see blog posts talking about who could replace Jason Kenney. We now see this campaign. We now see op-eds being written about Jason Kenney having to go. So let&#39;s talk about those two things. First, Carter, the wheels on a campaign like this, and then let&#39;s expand the scope about our assessment, strategic assessment on Kenney&#39;s leadership. So maybe start with the former, and then let&#39;s jump into the second part thereafter. The</div>

I continue to believe we are still at this stage where it&#39;s, I like the guy, but the people around him aren&#39;t serving him well. He&#39;s losing focus and he needs more people to be, he needs to be hearing more voices. The things you hear at the start of a rebellion, right? We are not at the point where people are actively organizing must-go on websites like this in a serious fashion. Because whoever did this is so afraid of being caught, they&#39;ve done everything they can to cover their tracks. And that is not talking about a rebellion that&#39;s a serious threat. Well,</div>

They put it when when they did it, so that they could force the party not to unelect Jason Kenney as their leader because, you know, it would be so close to an election. I suspect that that was done because there was real pressure then. That was back then. This is now. Shit&#39;s getting real, guys. Those first quarter results, those were not great. Great.

Let&#39;s talk about Joe Biden, guys, and his first 100 days, because while it may not have been what many expected, it seems to be a 100 days that many people are quite pleasantly surprised by. Strong approval ratings for Biden. And when I say strong, I mean, stable, unlike Trump or even Obama, who came into office with higher approval ratings and in the first 100 days saw double digit, you know, drops. Biden&#39;s held pretty steady, about a number above 50. He&#39;s put some bold, progressive, even transition like policies and principles in place, including the massive recovery bill. And on Wednesday, he gave his first address to a joint session of Congress on the eve of his 100th day. His 65-minute speech brought the importance of his first 99 days, summed up by the three Bs, big in ambition, boring, and bipartisan. He talked about things that are classic Joe in the sense of cooperation, bipartisanship. It wasn&#39;t a rhetorical barn burner like we&#39;re used to with an Obama speech. It was what we saw with Joe as vice president or Joe at the convention or on election night. But it was also big in ambition, which I think many people are cluing in on. And many people are calling it the response to the 30 or 40 years of plus of Reaganism that the United States has felt where Reagan stood up to Congress, talked about slashing taxes and welfare. welfare and almost now this Biden era of slamming the door shut on that and this more progressive approach on more taxes on the wealthy, more taxes on corporations, social spending, and really a punctuation to progressives winning the battle of ideas. That&#39;s just my summary. I want to hear yours, both from the speech and the first 100 days. And Corey, I want to start with you. We teased out on Sunday&#39;s episode a bit on the first 100 days, but tell me a little bit more about what What you heard in the speech as that capstone and any further comments you&#39;d have generally about Joe Biden before we jump a little bit and double click into the speech?</div>

The COVID situation is the crisis that you need to make the change that you desire. And he is taking advantage of it in a massive way that that, frankly, other governments could write. I mean, when you&#39;re when you&#39;re looking at this in textbooks in 20 years from now, that should be the headline in the textbook is how do you take the crisis and turn it into the change you want? FDR did it with the Depression and World War Two. And now you&#39;re seeing Biden do it with the COVID situation. And you can also see Reagan and the way that Reagan redefined American politics with the Cold War and the end of the Cold War. He defined himself by taking advantage of that particular crisis and that opportunity. These are textbook examples of how you take the situation and you allow that situation to define what your legacy will be. I would argue that Biden&#39;s got more of a legacy in 100 days than Donald Trump had in four years.</div>

This is in the news. This is a great opportunity to talk about X. But that&#39;s true writ large as well. This is in the news. This is what people are worried about.

And this to me is just simply reinforced the idea that you need to have the best possible transition team. You need to have an experienced staff when you walk through the door and you can achieve great things in the first hundred days. And I think that that is something that Joe Biden Biden is shown by hiring, you know, Ronald Klain as his chief of staff and saying, you know, I&#39;m going to hire an experienced group of people and we&#39;re going to make shit get done. And he did. He got his cabinet for the most part. I think he lost one. He pushed through his legislation and he&#39;s the one who&#39;s got an 85 percent approval on his first state, you know, his first speech to the United Congress. He did OK.</div>

It says at the bottom, and we&#39;re going to do this by charging a fee, $90 for a year for a car to go through the park, $15 per visit. it uh you know just just casually dropping in that all of a sudden there&#39;s going to be money that you&#39;re going to have to spend to go into this this provincial park which i have to stress calgarians treat like our backyard and so you know zane you mentioned like you</div>

            <div class="said">boy, I don&#39;t know. I mean, like I said on Twitter, and I&#39;ll say again, I feel like I&#39;m going to see a lot more angry lawn signs in my neighborhood soon. Like, I don&#39;t think people are going to like this very much. I also don&#39;t understand why the provincial government continues to just sort of smash their head against the wall of this file. Like on the parks, they just take nothing but abuse, whether whether it be coal, whether it be privatization of parks. And now I think with this particular fee, they&#39;ve got yet additional challenges on this front here. It&#39;s a fascinating one. And yeah, people are pretty keyed up. People are pretty mad. Carter, are you in or out?</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;ll tell you what. If you came to me and said, you know what, we have to pay a $90 fee to access every Alberta park in Alberta, But it&#39;s a $90 fee, the same way that I have to pay $140 to pay to access the Banff, the national park system. I&#39;d say, you know what? That&#39;s a fair deal. That&#39;s a good price for me. But when they start carving out areas of the actual parks, they can go fuck themselves because they&#39;ve carved out McLean Creek. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean anything to anybody. What&#39;s McLean Creek? It&#39;s a nice area. It&#39;s the place that people go off roading. It&#39;s the area in the provincial park that we&#39;ve fucking destroyed using our motorized vehicles. And that&#39;s the part you don&#39;t have to pay a fee to go into. Like, fuck you, Jason Kenney. Fuck you, Jason Nixon. This is wrong. This is not the way it&#39;s supposed to happen. And I am beyond furious about it. Because if you want to protect our parkland, then protect our parkland. But this isn&#39;t even parkland. You know how I know it&#39;s not Parkland? Because they&#39;re going to log the place that I go fucking bike riding. Fuck you, Jason Kenney. I&#39;m not paying 90 bucks to avoid getting hit with a fucking logging truck, you prick.</div>

Secondly, why is it that they find these British Muslim actors and then they ask every single one of them to play the exact same role like it&#39;s some sort of 2002 stereotypical comedy movie where we&#39;re all playing terrorists? Have we not evolved beyond that? Every single role for a Muslim person on that show is a terrorist. So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is fuck you, Jason Kenney. Fuck</div>
