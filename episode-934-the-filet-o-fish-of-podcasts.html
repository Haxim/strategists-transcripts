That is correct, Carter. Louisiana state representative said Tuesday public schools and universities should be required to teach the good of slavery when discussing race as part of a bill he proposed to ban divisive concepts from the classroom. Stephen Carter, I know you&#39;ve been traditionally on the right side of history. This one&#39;s a little bit harder to get on the right side of.

At least now they&#39;re in the light of day and we can point to them and say, what a bunch of shitheads.

Well, Joe Rogan, the largest podcast on Spotify, they, of course, paid this dude $100 million to be exclusive to their platform.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to our next headline. This one comes to us from iPolitics. Conservatives grill Gilbo about regulating social media. This is a very interesting topic that has come up, I should say, pun intended, online over the course of the last couple of days. Bill C-10 was designed to update the Broadcasting Act to include online streaming services, which would allow Canada&#39;s broadcast regulator, the Canadian Radio Television Communications Commission, the CRTC, to seek financial contributions from online broadcasters such as Netflix, Spotify, Crave, and Disney+. The bill would give the CRTC the power to regulate these online streaming services, mandate contribution payments, and order discovery requirements and introduce fines for noncompliance. But the Liberal government is being accused of its effort to regulate social media content, which conservatives are saying amount to censorship of political speech as well. O&#39;Toole made a comment this past Thursday saying that he finds this to be regulating social media and being a mark against free speech. speech, and after the government amended its final version of C-10 in the late stages of a committee review. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you very quickly.</span>

On top of that, there&#39;s a lot of other things tapped into this particular bill, making sure that taxes get paid and other good things from Internet providers. And I think that people should be responsible for what shows up on their platforms a little bit more. And by the way, this isn&#39;t making everybody who posts everything responsible. This feels to me like it is a compromise to start, and I suspect it may get compromised a little bit more as it moves through the process. But frankly, I&#39;m for this, and I think that we&#39;ve waited too long and incurred far too many negatives. There is no question that the rise of social media, the rise of the Internet has done damage to our intellectual discourse and the news that is gathered and disseminated throughout the society. And it has created havoc for us and our democratic institutions. So putting some walls around that is probably a good thing.

Should the social media platforms be treated as simply a platform, which has been their long-standing case, or a publisher? And the amendments to C-10 in its final stages of the committee review included social media and user-generated content as part of its bill. Where do you kind of stand on this, Corey? Corey, do you feel like this is a real conversation we&#39;re having? Or are the conservatives kind of playing politics and perhaps bastardizing this a bit from your perspective?</span>

            <span class="text">think both. On net, it sure doesn&#39;t feel like social media has been very good for us. The way things propagate in social media, there&#39;s a fundamental flaw within social media when it comes to political discourse. course. And it&#39;s a flaw that can be easily exploited by anybody who&#39;s interested in being even a little bit unscrupulous. And that fundamental flaw is this, the truth will only be as interesting as the truth will be. A lie can be anything. And when you think about virality, and you think about viral posts, a post that is just the truth might not be that interesting, might not be that outrageous, might not actually provoke you to share. But maybe you just modified a little bit. And it gets shared</span>

And I think that there&#39;s an interesting example even this week with social media posts that were going out about Joe Biden somehow violating the Constitution because he hadn&#39;t done a State of the Union by February 20th. Things the Constitution doesn&#39;t talk about. February 20th. Requirement to actually give a State of the Union address. Like, all of it was pure fiction.

It could conceivably post or apply to original posts or individual posts. One of the challenges with this bill is, you know, Carter, you said it won&#39;t make everybody responsible. Well, the government has said that. But maybe it will, because it will depend on how the CRTC decides to apply rules. And that&#39;s TBD. Are we going to have CanCon requirements for various posts? Are we going to have anti-obscenity requirements for some of these posts? Again, Again, it seems like the answer is no, but that becomes a regulatory power that the CRTC then is able to apply.

You know, Carter, this being treated similarly but different in the United States, you know, perhaps one of the few things in the U.S. right now that seems to be having at least some momentum of bipartisan support around antitrust legislation, a lot of this stuff in the U.S. being embodied within that casing. Do you feel like the free speech angle is the right criticism angle for the conservatives? And maybe my broader point here is, do you feel like free speech, to borrow Corey&#39;s term, is a political argument that can catch virality, that can actually mobilize and engage enough people? Or is there a different angle if you were conservatives and you wanted to attack this bill you would go after? So</span>

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s go back and let&#39;s go back historically and look at free speech, because freedom of speech does not equal right to broadcast. Right. So that that&#39;s a very different thing. Back in, you know, like, so we invent the printing press, and then we allow anybody to buy the printing press. Right. So anybody can have a printing press, anybody can print their own newspapers,</span>

So now the right of speech is not the right to broadcast. But when we come back to the Internet, we go back and treat it just the same way as we treated the printing press. Anybody can have it. Anybody can have it and anybody can say anything that they wish to say on it. And I think it&#39;s created a mistake in the system where I think the right way to approach it was the right to broadcast should not necessarily be given to us. The right to speech is not inhibited just because you&#39;re not allowed to broadcast it on a podcast, right? We can&#39;t say anything that pops into our heads on this podcast for fear of some sort of legal chill that might land on us. For example, we can&#39;t just every week bring up WestJet.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think Carter is making a distinction without a difference. Free speech is not the right to broadcast. Okay, that&#39;s fine. But how about freedom of the press, which is another right that we have, like, you&#39;re creating a weird parsing. And the other thing is, you&#39;re just wrong. I mean, there&#39;s been so many times throughout history, I&#39;d suggest most of the world, there was at least some time where not everybody could buy a printing press. They&#39;ve often been regulated. Even in the United Kingdom, they were regulated for a long period of time. There was the licensing of the Press Act in the late 17th century. So, like, you&#39;re just wrong. but this in many ways makes the conversation more nuanced and more interesting and more textured and this is the conversation i think people need to have rather than making grand assertions they believe are true like you could always buy a printing press let&#39;s talk about how these technologies have often led to challenges and how people have often moved through those challenges because the question of like just entire falsehoods being fabricated that goes back to the printing press and there were things that people had to do and there was a and it&#39;s part Part of why I&#39;ve generally speaking been like, well, we&#39;ll figure it out, because we&#39;ve always figured it out with these past technologies, sort of, right?

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any appetite for that. So this seems like it&#39;s an attempt at a solution that works within the legal framework of being the country next door to the country where all of these bloody things are. But, you know, you&#39;ve got to be really careful, obviously, with things like this. The unintended consequences for any piece of legislation can be significant.

            <span class="text">As the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic set new records on Thursday, which is tonight, the day we&#39;re recording, Alberta&#39;s Premier Jason Kenney announced targeted public health measures intended to slow the spread of the disease. The province reported 2,048 new cases Thursday, the highest single-day total since the pandemic began in March of 2020. Also worth mentioning, the highest active case rate in Canada, with more than 480 active cases per 100,000 people. Starting Friday, the province will implement targeted measures for hotspots across the province where we have at least 350 active cases per 100,000 folks. The list of targeted communities include Edmonton, Calgary, Fort McMurray, Red Deer, Grand Prairie, Airdrie, Lethbridge, and Strathcona County. So a lot of what you&#39;d call urban Alberta, if I can put it in that very simplistic classification. Corey, let&#39;s start with you. A premier who today comes out with these new quote-unquote measures, many would call them light or cosmetic or not necessarily massive upgrades, but on the heels of comments yesterday where he said, you know, why introduce new rules and new measures when we know people aren&#39;t going to follow them? Explain to me what you&#39;re thinking or what you think Premier Kenney was thinking And perhaps what led to today in terms of what was rolled out?</span>

So, you know, we&#39;re in a real mess here. And it&#39;s not just the COVID numbers. It&#39;s that the communication has become so bloody confused. The tensions within the governing party are so prominent that it is really emboldening people to just say, I don&#39;t give a shit about these COVID regulations anymore. And the regulations that were brought in were a fascinating mix of seemed very light, but also seemed like they would be very antagonizing towards, let&#39;s call, you know, the COVID-18, what we called them, like the 18 people in his caucus who lined up against him on various COVID measures here.

It&#39;s 2,000 as a raw number may not seem high, but it&#39;s bad here as it relates to how things things are going. Help me with your strategic sort of brain, perhaps tease out what Jason Kenny was trying to do today. Was this a simple, let me try to keep the rural folks happy so they don&#39;t try to fucking give me another sharp elbow? Was there more to this calculation than that? Do you agree with Corey&#39;s hypothesis that win the day and then you&#39;ll fuck over future Kenny? Is that what you think is going on?

            <span class="text">He was absolutely trying not to anger the rural caucus. Now, let&#39;s just give one example. Banff&#39;s on fire. Banff is so bad that they are sending additional vaccines to Banff because it is one of the worst areas in Alberta. Correct.</span>

            <span class="text">Right. So they&#39;re sending the vaccines out there. It&#39;s kind of like stat. We got to get these things out there. Them and Fort McMurray are the two areas is that are absolutely on fire. But Banff is represented by Miranda Rosen, one of the COVID-18, who said, you know, come on, Premier, let&#39;s let us all back to doing whatever the hell we want to do. And as a result, they instituted this floor, right, where you have to have at least 250 cases in the active region, regardless of what the rates are, regardless of how it actually is functioning. So basically what that does is any small center, you can&#39;t actually get to, you can&#39;t get above the threshold because you&#39;ve only got X numbers of thousands of people. So there&#39;s what, 4,000 people in Banff? So they&#39;re underneath the threshold of 250 floors. Let me ask you the explicit question, political math?</span>

The Kenny Must Go campaign, one of several that are now starting to go from socialized to vocalized in our public sort of political zeitgeist. Just to kind of fill in some context before I go to you, Corey. So the active cases, the threshold is 350 active cases per 100,000 to be included in these targeted zones, or at least 250 active cases. So that&#39;s the political math that we&#39;re talking about here, Which is many of these small towns can&#39;t meet that minimum sort of threshold, that floor, thereby they&#39;re not in the targeted hotspot zones that we&#39;ve mentioned, which is that playing politics with the math.

            <span class="text">Carter, you talked about Jason Kenney getting hit from both sides. Let&#39;s talk about one of those sides right now with a campaign called KennyMustGo.com. It&#39;s an open letter that one can send as a general member of the UCP or a CA, Constituency Association board member. The form letter includes comments, which by the way, we don&#39;t know who the sponsors are of this letter. But we know that the other than to know that they, you know, presumably seem like conservative UCP members. I&#39;m quoting from the letter now. You have not upheld the core grassroots principles of the party, particularly by repeatedly violating our statement of principles and attacking free enterprise, personal responsibility, freedom of worship, freedom of assembly, and the free use of property. You have not controlled government spending or protected Albertan families from excessive government intrusions. That&#39;s just a quote from it. Getting hit by the right of his party, getting hit by presumably that rural group that COVID-18 group. How serious do you take this if you&#39;re Jason Kenney right now? And then let me expand it. How seriously do you take this if you&#39;re at the Premier&#39;s office right now? This particular campaign, and then let&#39;s expand this because it&#39;s been a week or so since we&#39;ve discussed Kenney leadership overall. And now, I shouldn&#39;t say the floodgates, but the conversations are certainly more normalized, certainly more socialized, that Kenney&#39;s leadership is under threat. It used to be that little sort of murmur in the political class. We now see blog posts talking about who could replace Jason Kenney. We now see this campaign. We now see op-eds being written about Jason Kenney having to go. So let&#39;s talk about those two things. First, Carter, the wheels on a campaign like this, and then let&#39;s expand the scope about our assessment, strategic assessment on Kenney&#39;s leadership. So maybe start with the former, and then let&#39;s jump into the second part thereafter. The</span>

But there&#39;s just not a ton of evidence right now that that&#39;s actually a critical mass in the party. I continue to believe we are still at this stage where it&#39;s, I like the guy, but the people around him aren&#39;t serving him well. He&#39;s losing focus and he needs more people to be, he needs to be hearing more voices. The things you hear at the start of a rebellion, right? We are not at the point where people are actively organizing must-go on websites like this in a serious fashion. Because whoever did this is so afraid of being caught, they&#39;ve done everything they can to cover their tracks. And that is not talking about a rebellion that&#39;s a serious threat. Well,</span>

They didn&#39;t schedule the leadership review just for shits and giggles. They put it when when they did it, so that they could force the party not to unelect Jason Kenney as their leader because, you know, it would be so close to an election. I suspect that that was done because there was real pressure then. That was back then. This is now. Shit&#39;s getting real, guys. Those first quarter results, those were not great. Great.

Let me be more specific, or perhaps the souring of some relationships. Is it having everyone still within the UCP? Is it allowing some to just splinter off and say, fuck it, like, let these people go? What do you kind of think the best outcome for him might be in this situation?</span>

British Columbia has somehow found a way to reduce their overall caseload and not go over 1,000 new cases every day. That&#39;s pretty great. I think that we should emulate them.</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;re going to leave that segment there, leaving us from the greatest summer ever into our next segment, greatest spring ever. Let&#39;s talk about Joe Biden, guys, and his first 100 days, because while it may not have been what many expected, it seems to be a 100 days that many people are quite pleasantly surprised by. Strong approval ratings for Biden. And when I say strong, I mean, stable, unlike Trump or even Obama, who came into office with higher approval ratings and in the first 100 days saw double digit, you know, drops. Biden&#39;s held pretty steady, about a number above 50. He&#39;s put some bold, progressive, even transition like policies and principles in place, including the massive recovery bill. And on Wednesday, he gave his first address to a joint session of Congress on the eve of his 100th day. His 65-minute speech brought the importance of his first 99 days, summed up by the three Bs, big in ambition, boring, and bipartisan. He talked about things that are classic Joe in the sense of cooperation, bipartisanship. It wasn&#39;t a rhetorical barn burner like we&#39;re used to with an Obama speech. It was what we saw with Joe as vice president or Joe at the convention or on election night. But it was also big in ambition, which I think many people are cluing in on. And many people are calling it the response to the 30 or 40 years of plus of Reaganism that the United States has felt where Reagan stood up to Congress, talked about slashing taxes and welfare. welfare and almost now this Biden era of slamming the door shut on that and this more progressive approach on more taxes on the wealthy, more taxes on corporations, social spending, and really a punctuation to progressives winning the battle of ideas. That&#39;s just my summary. I want to hear yours, both from the speech and the first 100 days. And Corey, I want to start with you. We teased out on Sunday&#39;s episode a bit on the first 100 days, but tell me a little bit more about what What you heard in the speech as that capstone and any further comments you&#39;d have generally about Joe Biden before we jump a little bit and double click into the speech?</span>

Well, you know, Biden doesn&#39;t have an opportunity for an election. He&#39;s facing a a stacked court.

And you can take the second half of that statement from everything from from the diverse makeup of the country to the popularity of progressive ideals to the reinforcements that have to live with him in the Democratic Party, alone as the Social Democrats.

            <span class="text">He&#39;s doing both, Zane. He is responding to the COVID situation and allowing that to frame his government. The COVID situation is the crisis that you need to make the change that you desire. And he is taking advantage of it in a massive way that that, frankly, other governments could write. I mean, when you&#39;re when you&#39;re looking at this in textbooks in 20 years from now, that should be the headline in the textbook is how do you take the crisis and turn it into the change you want? FDR did it with the Depression and World War Two. And now you&#39;re seeing Biden do it with the COVID situation. And you can also see Reagan and the way that Reagan redefined American politics with the Cold War and the end of the Cold War. He defined himself by taking advantage of that particular crisis and that opportunity. These are textbook examples of how you take the situation and you allow that situation to define what your legacy will be. I would argue that Biden&#39;s got more of a legacy in 100 days than Donald Trump had in four years.</span>

            <span class="text">think a good politician, to Carter&#39;s point, does both, right? Right. You you are you can be too rigid and you can try to blindly put forward on your plans, even though the environment has changed. We&#39;ve seen that a lot here in this country.

Who cares if the whole world has changed? On the other hand, you can just ride the wave too much and you&#39;re not actually telling a story. You&#39;re just responding perpetually. But a good politician knows how to respond in a way that tells their story. They take advantage of the various hooks that are out there. In a communication sense, we often talk about media hooks. This is in the news. This is a great opportunity to talk about X. But that&#39;s true writ large as well. This is in the news. This is what people are worried about. This is a great opportunity to push X and get X through Congress. And that seems to be the approach that Joe Biden has taken. And so what</span>

He&#39;s thinking about what America needs. I don&#39;t know. Maybe we got to elect really old people more often because he seems to give no fucks. and he&#39;s he&#39;s just sort of driving this this agenda forward uh palmel now let&#39;s not give him the victory yet like a lot of these things are still in bill&#39;s stage he&#39;s had a couple of clear wins but it&#39;s also possible that everything he&#39;s proposed in the last bit fails to go anywhere for various reasons well</span>

And this to me is just simply reinforced the idea that you need to have the best possible transition team. You need to have an experienced staff when you walk through the door and you can achieve great things in the first hundred days. And I think that that is something that Joe Biden Biden is shown by hiring, you know, Ronald Klain as his chief of staff and saying, you know, I&#39;m going to hire an experienced group of people and we&#39;re going to make shit get done. And he did. He got his cabinet for the most part. I think he lost one. He pushed through his legislation and he&#39;s the one who&#39;s got an 85 percent approval on his first state, you know, his first speech to the United Congress. He did OK.</span>

            <span class="text">The province of Alberta has a provincial park system, as all provinces do. do and we&#39;ve got a a big collection of parks called kananaska&#39;s country that&#39;s just west of the city of calgary it it butts right up against uh banff national park and it tends to be uh you know kind of the it&#39;s the it&#39;s one step closer and it is it&#39;s full of all sorts of great things you&#39;ve got mountains you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got uh hikes you&#39;ve got anything you could imagine there it&#39;s it&#39;s one of these real gems of alberta and when it was set up many decades ago at this time The idea is it was almost like it was the people&#39;s park relative to the national park next door. And so now the government of Alberta has released in what was, I think, like an all-timer press release. It was very funny about</span>

            <span class="text">about all of this money they&#39;re going to invest in Kananaskis country. It goes on for like a page and a half and then talk about burying the lead. It says at the bottom, and we&#39;re going to do this by charging a fee, $90 for a year for a car to go through the park, $15 per visit. it uh you know just just casually dropping in that all of a sudden there&#39;s going to be money that you&#39;re going to have to spend to go into this this provincial park which i have to stress calgarians treat like our backyard and so you know zane you mentioned like you</span>

Like, I don&#39;t think people are going to like this very much. I also don&#39;t understand why the provincial government continues to just sort of smash their head against the wall of this file. Like on the parks, they just take nothing but abuse, whether whether it be coal, whether it be privatization of parks. And now I think with this particular fee, they&#39;ve got yet additional challenges on this front here. It&#39;s a fascinating one. And yeah, people are pretty keyed up. People are pretty mad. Carter, are you in or out?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ll tell you what. If you came to me and said, you know what, we have to pay a $90 fee to access every Alberta park in Alberta, But it&#39;s a $90 fee, the same way that I have to pay $140 to pay to access the Banff, the national park system. I&#39;d say, you know what? That&#39;s a fair deal. That&#39;s a good price for me. But when they start carving out areas of the actual parks, they can go fuck themselves because they&#39;ve carved out McLean Creek. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean anything to anybody. What&#39;s McLean Creek? It&#39;s a nice area. It&#39;s the place that people go off roading. It&#39;s the area in the provincial park that we&#39;ve fucking destroyed using our motorized vehicles. And that&#39;s the part you don&#39;t have to pay a fee to go into. Like, fuck you, Jason Kenney. Fuck you, Jason Nixon. This is wrong. This is not the way it&#39;s supposed to happen. And I am beyond furious about it. Because if you want to protect our parkland, then protect our parkland. But this isn&#39;t even parkland. You know how I know it&#39;s not Parkland? Because they&#39;re going to log the place that I go fucking bike riding. Fuck you, Jason Kenney. I&#39;m not paying 90 bucks to avoid getting hit with a fucking logging truck, you prick.</span>

Have we not evolved beyond that? Every single role for a Muslim person on that show is a terrorist. So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is fuck you, Jason Kenney. Fuck</span>
