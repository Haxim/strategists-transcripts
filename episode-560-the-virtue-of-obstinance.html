            <span class="text">that was a good day one day that was a good day now they had been off the air for nine months but still we had an episode that&#39;s number two Dude, the cereal. That&#39;s true. We were desperately trying to get there, and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and the climb becomes steeper after today. Let&#39;s get into this, because it&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve recorded. We&#39;ve got a lot to talk about. Our first segment, take that shovel and dig some more. Guys, I want to talk about what I think is a very interesting subject that is permeating through politics provincially, federally, and even in the United States right now, which is the whole notion of politicians entrenching themselves in their current positions. They have made a move. It has brought on some controversy and some opposition, a lot of it ideological opposition, a lot of it potentially rational and logical opposition. Yet these individuals and characters and politicians have stood their ground on certain instances. So I want to start the conversation off with what&#39;s happening here locally, which is Bill 6, which is legislation that&#39;s trying to be passed. And I&#39;m not sure where it is yet today, Corey. Just got passed. Just got passed, okay, provincially. But Corey, do you want to give people who maybe not be from Alberta or maybe don&#39;t live on a farm in Alberta? Some idea of</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Bill 6 is. Well, I think any description of Bill 6 is going to, you know, put your thumb on the scale. It&#39;s very interesting. This is legislation that the provincial New Democrats have brought in to essentially give labor protections to farm workers where they were previously exempt. So this is WCB, OHS.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Seems pretty reasonable, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? It&#39;s the last industry in Alberta, and Alberta is the last province in Canada. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is not groundbreaking legislation that is new or different than anywhere else in Canada.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, but what has happened is the farmers have gotten totally up in arms about this. Farmers and ranchers, there</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is definitely legitimate criticism that can be leveled at the New Democrats for how they rolled it out. No.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Look, when you&#39;ve got the premier saying there was a mistake and our communications wasn&#39;t great, and when you&#39;ve got the government websites posting things that are inaccurate about the bill, Yeah, those are problems, and I don&#39;t think you can pretend those aren&#39;t problems.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But those inaccuracies are the first set of backing away.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there was a set</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">backing away. Okay, let&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey give us a little bit more context as to what this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is. Yeah, so there&#39;s been protests at the legislature, 1,000, 1,500 people essentially chanting that they want this bill, known as Bill 6, which is the farm workers&#39; protection, to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">to go away, to be gone. The premier has said that won&#39;t be the case, as Stephen was just saying. and we&#39;ve passed it now, and we&#39;ll clean it all up in regulation. So it has</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">has not stopped the firestorm. There&#39;s a lot of angry people, and it&#39;s been a pretty big hit to the NDP. And it&#39;s been really interesting. I won&#39;t get into it right now, but it&#39;s been really interesting to see how Albertans themselves have turned so aggressively against the bill wholesale.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so that&#39;s one instance. Let&#39;s talk about another one right now, because I want to get the instances on the table, and then let&#39;s talk about this whole theme of standing your ground in politics. The second one is Trudeau&#39;s tax plan. $1.5 billion potential hole in it, yet he&#39;s standing by it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Is that a pretty fair synopsis of the situation, Stephen? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it is. I mean, I think, you know, anytime you plan, you propose a tax plan or something along those lines, you&#39;re kind</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">kind of guessing at numbers when you&#39;re running a platform.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Some guesses are stronger than others. And I think it&#39;s fair to say that this was a weak guess. It was a favorable guess that made their revenue projections look stronger than it was. But essentially, the middle class tax cut costs more than the increase in taxes for the 1%. Let&#39;s just call it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it the 1%. I&#39;m not sure that it was 1%. But that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that increase in taxes doesn&#39;t pay for the cut.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Is anybody surprised? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that if there is surprise, it&#39;s because this platform was costed. Kevin Page, the former PBO, Parliamentary Budget Officer, sort of said it all looks good. It&#39;s a pretty big hole. Well, but that sort of reminds you of the limitation of opposition. You do not have a Department of Finance. You don&#39;t have all these economic models. And you don&#39;t have the data, frankly, as</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as much as StatsCan releases this, that, and the other thing. You just don&#39;t have enough economic data to go on to figure out what&#39;s going to happen there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And yet, to your point, Zane, there is no change of plan. It&#39;s like, oh, oops, I guess we move on. Right.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right. Yeah. Right. Stand your ground. Face the criticism. Move on. So first one, Bill Six, Rachel Notley. Second one, Justin Trudeau on this. Let&#39;s talk about the third one, which I think is the most intriguing to me, is the lunatic from down south, Donald Trump. Now, this guy seems to be the king of the double down, triple down and increase the intensity and degree of what he&#39;s saying. But effectively, almost the same strategy. If someone has criticized him on anything, whether it be his most recent comments about not letting Muslims in, whether they be citizens, visitors, whatever, he&#39;s doubled and tripled down on the same notion, standing his ground. Corey, you were going to add something. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, let&#39;s just throw Godwin&#39;s Law on the table right now, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s the big lie. You say something enough and you just refuse to accept any of the truth and you go on. He is, of these three, by far the most extreme example. And the big difference is Premier Notley said could have done some stuff differently. Prime Minister Trudeau has said, oops. Trudeau, or not Trudeau, Trump has said, what are you talking about? This is great.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">This is great. He is actually – you can watch a video of him today with Political saying, I&#39;m a great friend of the Muslims. I am – Muslims love me. Yeah, the Muslims love me. So for anyone</span>

But look, she got handed a bad situation, a situation that blew up in her absence. I will note with this government, the things that I think they should be more concerned about, they do very well because I think they think them through carefully. They&#39;ve obviously got very smart people in the premier&#39;s office working through the permutations. The things that should be slam dunks, those have not always gone off as smoothly. And I think if there&#39;s a lesson here for the NDP, it&#39;s that everything should be considered a threat and everything has to be put through the lens of somebody who&#39;s aggressively against it. Now, where she ended up picking it up, she did fine. She did exactly what she had to do. The communications was a concession that was a non-concession. She didn&#39;t say the bill was bad. She essentially, in her own gentle way, reprimanded her ministers. So move on. Okay,</span>

And Donald Trump has gotten to the point where he – you remember, maybe you saw, but he was doing this thing where he was essentially mocking the disability of a reporter. Oh, I saw that, yeah.

But how do we take the lessons of something that&#39;s happening in the United States, Donald Trump, Ben Carson, this, I can even call it radicalization of the GOP themselves, and politicians there? What are the lessons that we take here, especially when we&#39;re seeing similar strategies, political strategies being applied locally, provincially, federally, not to the same degree, but they are happening. People are entrenching and that&#39;s becoming more and more commonplace in politics. What&#39;s the lesson we take away?</span>
