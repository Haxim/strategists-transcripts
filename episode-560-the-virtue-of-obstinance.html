        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the political phenomenon that is holding your ground in the face of contrary facts or public opposition. Have Premier Notley and Prime Minister Trudeau acted with willful disdain? Is Donald Trump the ghost of politics future? And is Brad Wall in Paris the saddest French expressionist film ever? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Our first segment, take that shovel and dig some more. Guys, I want to talk about what I think is a very interesting subject that is permeating through politics provincially, federally, and even in the United States right now, which is the whole notion of politicians entrenching themselves in their current positions. They have made a move. It has brought on some controversy and some opposition, a lot of it ideological opposition, a lot of it potentially rational and logical opposition. Yet these individuals and characters and politicians have stood their ground on certain instances. So I want to start the conversation off with what&#39;s happening here locally, which is Bill 6, which is legislation that&#39;s trying to be passed. And I&#39;m not sure where it is yet today, Corey. Just got passed. Just got passed, okay, provincially. But Corey, do you want to give people who maybe not be from Alberta or maybe don&#39;t live on a farm in Alberta? Some idea of</div>

          <div class="said">Bill 6 is. Well, I think any description of Bill 6 is going to, you know, put your thumb on the scale. It&#39;s very interesting. This is legislation that the provincial New Democrats have brought in to essentially give labor protections to farm workers where they were previously exempt. So this is WCB, OHS.</div>

But look, she got handed a bad situation, a situation that blew up in her absence. I will note with this government, the things that I think they should be more concerned about, they do very well because I think they think them through carefully. They&#39;ve obviously got very smart people in the premier&#39;s office working through the permutations. The things that should be slam dunks, those have not always gone off as smoothly. And I think if there&#39;s a lesson here for the NDP, it&#39;s that everything should be considered a threat and everything has to be put through the lens of somebody who&#39;s aggressively against it. Now, where she ended up picking it up, she did fine. She did exactly what she had to do. The communications was a concession that was a non-concession. She didn&#39;t say the bill was bad.
