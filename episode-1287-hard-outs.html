Speaking of giving life, Corey, Danielle Smith is giving life to something that we have not heard of before. She had a televised address earlier this week. She paid for this spot roughly about 10 minutes or so on CTV and Global. It was also covered by by CBC. I know this because I was on an hour long panel in which they kind of played clips of her speech. An interesting address, Corey, in advance of budget. She talked about a few key things. I call this segment the look in the mirror segment, referencing the 2015 Jim Prentice phrase that that ultimately was the beginning of the end. Of course, we didn&#39;t know that at the moment, but it clearly painted that picture. Corey, there was a lot to talk about. out. She said she&#39;s delaying the tax cut that was promised in the election. She talked about the end of oil. Of course, those are my words, not her words, but talking about the transition that&#39;s necessary, talking about how we have to get off the energy roller coaster, and then talking about how she wants to massively balloon the Heritage Savings Fund to the tune of $400 billion by 2050, 50 if i&#39;m not mistaken i&#39;m just looking for that number in front of me you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">uh it&#39;s it&#39;s proven to be elusive um you know i i struggled with the name checks right danielle smith name checked uh premieres ernest manning uh peter laheed and ralph klein only one of those three premiers actually put together a savings program right uh the savings program that was created under premier laheed was what generated the then 16 billion dollar heritage savings trust fund and that was immediately undone by ralph klein when he got to the spend phase of his of his premiership where he just started to grab all the oil and gas revenues reduce taxes give us the fixed or you know the flat tax and uh really kind of changed the overall revenue structure so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so putting ralph klein in the same breath as premier laheed makes no sense at all And where the fuck did Ernest Manning come from? Since when are we blowing up that guy? It doesn&#39;t feel like that&#39;s the, why don&#39;t I throw in Eberhardt at the same time? Like, honest to God, why are we blowing up some of these old, you know, that was not a premier that we look back at with any real high degree of happiness. But I think that Corey&#39;s right. I mean, the idea that we&#39;re going to spend less 20 years into the future, 25 years into the future, right? right? 25 years of capping spending below inflation and population growth. What&#39;s it going to look like 25 years from now, right? Just 1%. And it just compounds every year, right? 1% spending cut every year. It&#39;s just going to compound. We&#39;re going to have terrible services. Sure, we&#39;ll have 250 billion in the bank, maybe even 400 billion in the bank. But the service cut to get there is the exact wrong thing. What we should do, of course we won&#39;t, But what we should be doing is talking about what are the taxes that we should be spending to have the level of service, to support the level of services that we demand, because we demand good services in Alberta. This is not a population that wants sub-tier, sub-par services along the lines of what Danielle Smith is promising.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, your thoughts here? And also to Carter&#39;s point, this population, this mythology of who Albertans are, I think has an added layer. You know, it&#39;s not just that we&#39;re not fiscally conservative, as proven by our track record in many ways, but many Albertans have not been Albertans before. And like, you know, they&#39;re new Albertans. They&#39;ve come here. They haven&#39;t had preconceived notions of fiscal conservatism or even the deep cuts of Ernest Manning, let alone, you know, other other premiers mentioned on that list. Corey, your take on Carter&#39;s response here. And then I want to challenge you guys a bit around the strategy here that Smith is trying to take on.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think another thing I want to throw on the table is it was only, I think, in October or November, Daniel Smith was talking about the population of Alberta growing to 10 million in 2015. We&#39;re at about 4.8 million right now. So we&#39;re talking about a doubling of the population.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so with that kind of explosive population growth and actively, intentionally, as policy of government saying we&#39;re not going to fully cover population growth and inflation, like</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like I really want to underline, we&#39;re already in some pretty dire straits on some pretty dire investment metrics for education. And we are saying we&#39;re going to go lower. And that&#39;s wild. And I also think ultimately, and it&#39;s a really narrow view of investment, right? right? The idea that we&#39;re going to save $400 billion and that investment is what matters, but we&#39;re going to fail to invest in our children.</span>

We&#39;re going to just fail to invest in roads and schools and hospitals. That is so troubling to me because at the end of the day, look, I would be thrilled if we had a massive heritage fund and that we actually saved our non-renewable resource revenue but i&#39;m not going to do it at the expense of my children yeah and that&#39;s what they&#39;re asking me to do right now 25 years from now my kids will have you know they will have gone through all of the major milestones the government generally helps you with except the ones at the very end in</span>

You&#39;re going to be in a class of 40 people. You&#39;re going to have to wait 10 months for any kind of minor surgery. But your kids, your kids are going to have it pretty good. Their taxes are going to be pretty low. Like that sucks. That&#39;s not what anybody wants for themselves and their children. So yeah, I&#39;m a little annoyed by it. And I think that what&#39;s interesting now is there&#39;ll be a wrestling over that frame. And</span>

When you go to the doctor, and you&#39;re referred to a specialist, and that takes you 24 months, those things are going to hit people&#39;s lives a lot harder and a lot faster than this notion that we&#39;re going to have a big bank account in the future.

You know, to replace volatile oil and gas revenues with volatile oil and gas revenues strikes me as a recipe for disaster. I mean, it&#39;s what we&#39;ve been trying to to do uh for the last 50 years um we&#39;ve only you know the only there was only one premier that was successful at it and that was law heat no other premier has been successful at saving the excess oil and gas revenue um the second thing is you</span>

It feels like I&#39;m going to be the premier who creates this massive thing that will be called the Daniel Smith Fund forever or something like that. We have here and now problems.

The calculus and the strategy for other Alberta premiers has been, how do we create and sustain this, you know, what Ralph Klein dubbed the Alberta advantage? And it is an advantage. It is an advantage to pay fewer taxes. It is an advantage to have a big bank account that you can rely on or these resource revenues that you can count on every single year and it keeps all of our taxes low. That is an advantage that does build our economy. We would like to be able to project that forward forever. but the truth of the matter is that when we&#39;re in a boom we piss away the money and when we&#39;re not in a boom we um the</span>

And we have seen kind of underneath the waves here, even the investments that the government has made in education have been pretty torqued towards private education options, right? And we just have to be really mindful that the top line is not even telling us the whole horror show. And the top line ain&#39;t great, right? The top line ain&#39;t great, but beneath it is even worse. So I think public education is the place that I have the most anxiety. There is kind of</span>

With Ramadan just around the corner, a national Muslim organization and several local congregations are warning MPs that they&#39;re not welcome in mosques until they call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, demonstrate restoration of the UN&#39;s aid funding, and condemn Israel for their war crimes. As a political strategy and kind of what this kind of means from a broader sort of landscape, as someone who&#39;s kind of seen how multicultural politics works, politics within within religious spaces works, overrated or underrated this particular move by this, and this is only a small faction, but this local congregation and this national Muslim organization?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Because the Hague is actually engaged in this matter right now. We, of course, saw the court challenge that was brought forward by South Africa. We saw them say Israel needs to take steps to make sure war crimes aren&#39;t happening, but to actually accuse the nation itself of war crimes, like not individuals who have committed war crimes. There is a difference here, right? Right.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Maybe Israel has committed war crimes. That&#39;s a big charge that needs to be proven in court. Certainly, that is not something a politician is going to say on the spot. And so by adding that to the list, you&#39;ve basically been like, well, I I&#39;m not going to be able to do the whole list. So why am I going to bother with the first thing on the list? Yeah, that&#39;s why I think it was an over. I</span>

But Carter, can I stick on this topic for a second before I move to the next one? And, you know, what I found interesting about this story, even removing the broader sort of, you know, which cultural community or religious community has called for this, is for the longest time, racialized groups, religious groups have felt like having any politician show up to their space. And I can speak this firsthand experience. It&#39;s like an honor, huge honor. And what I liked about this, even though it may have been a strategic overswing and may actually be limiting, is that there is a sense of like, no, fuck you. Like we, we actually have the power in this situation. And I think that&#39;s a really interesting, I shouldn&#39;t say development in our democracy, which makes it sound like a new or novel thing, but it is nice to see more in group groups be like, yeah, you know what? Like we, we like having you here, but we don&#39;t need to have you here because if you&#39;re going to treat us like a voting block, fuck it, we&#39;re a voting block. And there&#39;s all these people available to you in that sense. I think there was something really interesting happening here in the, in the undercurrents of like democratic power uh in that sense there</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s this particular group right like other groups have have said yeah we don&#39;t need you at all right and each religious organization each religious group uh brings their own approach to it and uh newcomers have been more open to it because they they you know they access to politicians politicians is unique and it&#39;s powerful and it&#39;s good. Um, when you, there&#39;s other groups that have that take it for granted almost, uh, you know, we can get access whenever we need to. And that shows a certain degree of privilege, I suppose. Um, and I, I think it is probably good that this group feels that they are privileged enough now that they can, uh, they can use their power to, to cut off politicians. I think that that&#39;s probably not a bad thing.</span>

I don&#39;t know if they would. I think they would probably think it was a different number, but results matter and the result hurts.

And so basically, despite establishment saying, don&#39;t do this and saying things like, it&#39;ll make us look bad right which is not that&#39;s not the problem here folks that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of a downstream consequence um but despite that it&#39;s still past this ballot measure and that that kind of hurts too which means there&#39;s a lot more people who are holding these views kind of ready</span>

There&#39;s no way that we&#39;re going to be able to have a binding plebiscite override that. That&#39;s one way to look at it.

You know, this is, you know, we are seeing a backsliding in terms of what a progressive society looks like. And it&#39;s a backslide that&#39;s happening around the world. Is it a normal backslide? Yeah, I think you do to go forward and then you go backwards. The world is a pendulum and we&#39;re on a really shitty side of the pendulum right now. Now, hopefully it starts to swing back to, you know, what we would have considered in the early 2010s, our norm, right? But right now the norm is on the other side of the pendulum.</span>
