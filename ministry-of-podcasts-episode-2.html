        <p style="text-align: left;">Be it resolved that the Minister of Podcasts, Stephen Carter, together with the Chair of Oral Questions, Zain Velji, do convene this sitting of The Ministry of Podcasts.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Be it further resolved that the House shall hear testimony from the newly sworn Member of Parliament and Parliamentary Secretary, Corey Hogan, on matters pertaining to:</p><p style="text-align: left;">The eternal balance between message discipline and authentic self,<br />The trials of assembling IKEA furniture between Question Periods,<br />The lonely burden of representation,<br />And the etiquette of grocery shopping in a baseball cap.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Therefore be it finally resolved that this episode, having no formal agenda but much informal candour, stands as both a record of proceedings and a cautionary tale for any who would confuse a parliamentary headset with a proper microphone.</p>
