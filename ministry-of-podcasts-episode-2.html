But I think it is one of those things where you start to wonder, okay, well, what is like additive being yourself? And what is diminishing being yourself? Like, what are the parts that are actually going to help this conversation along? Because like, look, I didn&#39;t come here to be funny on television. I came here to get stuff done.

And for me, it was like, was it informative? And that was always kind of the difference between the three of us when we were approaching a show. And when a show was like all three of those, then like we were all happy. But generally speaking, most shows can&#39;t be all three of those, right?</span>

And I know it sounds dumb, but you&#39;re also pretty mindful a lot of the time that you are, you&#39;re their representative. And there&#39;s a lot of people are like, you&#39;re not representing me well, if you&#39;re not like wearing something nicer, right? right? Like, is this how</span>
