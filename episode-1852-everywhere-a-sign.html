Indeed, that is what it is. Prime Minister Carney made for his cabinet. I then want to talk about, gents, the choices he made to message that cabinet and that initial sort of round of press coverage that he did, because I think there&#39;s some strategist questions in there. And then let&#39;s spend the final third of the show talking about the choices in front of him for what he does next. And I really want to focus on the unique sort of angle and the unique sort of things we could bring to the table, talking about message, brand, how we should position day one, et cetera. He&#39;s launched six weeks ago. Does he need to launch again? Or two months ago? Does he need to do another launch card? Stuff like that, that I want to talk about in the third segment. But let&#39;s talk about choices round one. Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. Some surprising choices. Smaller cabinet was projected. It is smaller, but it&#39;s not tiny. a different cabinet was projected it is different ish but it&#39;s of the same players no outside players and some key omissions so to speak what did you make of the first choice that mark carney had in front of him which was his cabinet i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">guess i was surprised by how conservative it was like small c conservative not radical in any way shape or form the probably the most noteworthy thing was the size which but for a little blip somewhere in the aughts is the smallest cabinet since the 80s i believe that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">maybe even the 70s and it does talk about a different type of leadership and a different type of governance presumably the cabinet ministers when there&#39;s fewer of them will have more power i think that that&#39;s a good thing i&#39;ve certainly been critical of people who&#39;ve gone the other way and made everybody a fucking critic or a cabinet minister so i have no real qualms with this i think it&#39;s fine but the idea that you would just go and pick from your existing caucus mostly your existing cabinet and almost exclusively people who supported you in the leadership tells me in some ways this was this was the most traditional cabinet making we&#39;ve seen in a long time like didn&#39;t seem that fussed with gender equity although most of the powerful ministers are women didn&#39;t seem that fussed with um you know with uh regional balance and um i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get into that because alberta of course got a got a big goose on the board there.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that way, I think it was quite a traditional cabinet, right? In fact, it&#39;s a cabinet that looks a lot more like cabinets in the 60s and 70s than it does in the aughts and teens.</span>

            <span class="text">mean aside from the obvious exclusion of cory hogan um i&#39;m disappointed by this cabinet to be honest uh i am disappointed by the cabinet i&#39;m disappointed that george jahal wasn&#39;t in the cabinet i&#39;m disappointed that there wasn&#39;t a bunch of new blood brought into the cabinet i think that that had more to do with the rush of becoming a cabinet and naming a cabinet as soon as possible uh that That, to me, was the driving consideration of the cabinet was how do we get the cabinet ministers in as quickly as possible and not how do we get the best possible cabinet for the election? So I&#39;m disappointed. I think the regional balance, forget about regional balance. Let&#39;s talk instead about making sure that we have regional competitiveness. You know, there&#39;s a very real chance that you don&#39;t have any liberal seats from Alberta in the next election. I&#39;d be wanting to shore that up.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">uh and i&#39;m i&#39;m just disappointed because i think that the the answer was let&#39;s put this in as quickly as possible that means that we don&#39;t have a lot of time for vetting so we&#39;re going to go with the people who are already on the vetted list yeah</span>

            <span class="text">that was certainly the sense i got too right like they i suspect they just even based on the reporting and some of the musings that were out there that maybe at least for a hot minute they considered doing something different with the cabinet maybe even pulling people in from outside of the cabinet certainly</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we saw some some reporting on that, but then ultimately decided, you know, it&#39;s not really going to work for us and probably came down for logistical concerns as these things often do, to be frank. But that&#39;s kind of the heart of my, this is a very conservative cabinet point, right? They said that might be a little difficult. So let&#39;s do the thing that&#39;s not particularly difficult. And I don&#39;t know. I mean, that tells us something about Mark Carney. It shouldn&#39;t be surprising. He&#39;s a former central banker. But if you&#39;re a liberal thinking he&#39;s going to throw out like absolutely everything that&#39;s ever been done and do an entirely new type of politics i suspect you&#39;re going to be disappointed his new will likely be what politics looked like 40 years ago and maybe that will be refreshing to us after the last couple of decades of you know soundbite politics but it&#39;s not going to be revolutionary cory</span>

And so maybe there was a group of Trudeau loyalists who thought that would just be absolutely a no-go for them maybe there was a challenge with vetting either time or they found something that warranted further conversation i&#39;m not saying there was in fact i doubt it in terms of like the vetting likes further thing but that&#39;s always a possibility with these things you got to think about uh andrew leslie for example everyone thought he&#39;d be in cabinet we</span>

We&#39;d want you to kind of self-report this, whatever it may be, right? Maybe there were some hiccups there. And, you know, maybe it was just decided that it just wasn&#39;t worth the pain in terms of dealing with those considerations. That&#39;s my guess, right?

We&#39;ve got some important things it&#39;s all orientation today tomorrow is when we get down to the real agenda like you have that option right but he said no i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m gonna repeal the carbon tax today he&#39;s now going to europe he was marching in a saint patrick&#39;s day parade he&#39;s gonna do a few things that showcase him in different ways using the power of his office and then he&#39;s fucking out like of course like nothing i&#39;ve seen so far makes me think he actually is interested in governing governing governing right like it is and you both would think it&#39;s</span>

Like, there was no bleeding of nervousness there. He looked like a guy who&#39;d had the job forever, right? And I think that that&#39;s an incredible superpower he&#39;s got.

The group that would do that, the group that could do that, at least in theory, they are actually so on the mat. They are just so wrecked right now. Nobody has any interest of talking about the NDP.

You know, not to belabor the point, because I think we&#39;re past on this particular Carney strategy, but I do find there&#39;s two aspects of it to what I presented here, right? There&#39;s the multi-partisan aspect Going after people from different political stripes, which I think we&#39;ve talked about. But the former, I think, is also as interesting, right?</span>

            <span class="text">right? And when you&#39;re going with a cabinet that can be argued as being traditionalist or a throwback, do you think there&#39;s political value in finding people, regardless of actually their jersey color now, that have committed to public service, bringing them back, plucking them back in in this very acute moment of crisis? Does that translate for you, either as an air war message or as something interesting or useful? Like, left and right is one thing, front and back is one thing, and this is going back to go forward. Maybe I&#39;m thinking too much about this, but there is something to be said here. here. Corey, you go first, and then Carter, who you seem to be confused, maybe because the oxygen level in your basement suite is rapidly running out. But yes,</span>

What does a brand look like? What does all these sort of things look like? Do you borrow it from the previous one? How are you thinking about these things?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">go ahead. Go ahead, talk about it. Because I think that, well, Canadians are pretty keyed in on politics right now. I don&#39;t think they were sleepwalking through the liberal race. I do think that there is a whole group of people who are not going to pay attention until there&#39;s an election. The number of conversations I&#39;ve had with people in my life, smart people, not idiots, who have said, so when do you think the election is going to be?</span>

And so you&#39;ve got to accept the moment for what it is. You&#39;ve got to accept the electorate for who they are. And they&#39;re going to turn their eyes to all of the main candidates as soon as the election starts and say, oh, I guess I better pick somebody. So you&#39;ve got to use that moment. I don&#39;t think the launch needs to look like it&#39;s the first time anybody&#39;s thought about an election. I think you can use the power of the pulpit to go out and say, I&#39;ve just told the governor general we need an election. We all know it&#39;s coming. We all know this moment&#39;s too serious to wait a couple of weeks to see if parliament can work or not. I want to make a new parliament work. I need a mandate to go fight mano a mano with Donald Trump, whatever it is. right and so the launch can look less</span>
