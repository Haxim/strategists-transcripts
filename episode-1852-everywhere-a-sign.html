Indeed, that is what it is. Prime Minister Carney made for his cabinet. I then want to talk about, gents, the choices he made to message that cabinet and that initial sort of round of press coverage that he did, because I think there&#39;s some strategist questions in there. And then let&#39;s spend the final third of the show talking about the choices in front of him for what he does next. And I really want to focus on the unique sort of angle and the unique sort of things we could bring to the table, talking about message, brand, how we should position day one, et cetera. He&#39;s launched six weeks ago. Does he need to launch again? Or two months ago? Does he need to do another launch card? Stuff like that, that I want to talk about in the third segment. But let&#39;s talk about choices round one. Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. Some surprising choices. Smaller cabinet was projected. It is smaller, but it&#39;s not tiny. a different cabinet was projected it is different ish but it&#39;s of the same players no outside players and some key omissions so to speak what did you make of the first choice that mark carney had in front of him which was his cabinet i</div>

So I&#39;m disappointed. I think the regional balance, forget about regional balance. Let&#39;s talk instead about making sure that we have regional competitiveness. You know, there&#39;s a very real chance that you don&#39;t have any liberal seats from Alberta in the next election. I&#39;d be wanting to shore that up.</div>

But that&#39;s kind of the heart of my, this is a very conservative cabinet point, right? They said that might be a little difficult. So let&#39;s do the thing that&#39;s not particularly difficult. And I don&#39;t know. I mean, that tells us something about Mark Carney. It shouldn&#39;t be surprising. He&#39;s a former central banker. But if you&#39;re a liberal thinking he&#39;s going to throw out like absolutely everything that&#39;s ever been done and do an entirely new type of politics i suspect you&#39;re going to be disappointed his new will likely be what politics looked like 40 years ago and maybe that will be refreshing to us after the last couple of decades of you know soundbite politics but it&#39;s not going to be revolutionary cory</div>

And when you&#39;re going with a cabinet that can be argued as being traditionalist or a throwback, do you think there&#39;s political value in finding people, regardless of actually their jersey color now, that have committed to public service, bringing them back, plucking them back in in this very acute moment of crisis? Does that translate for you, either as an air war message or as something interesting or useful? Like, left and right is one thing, front and back is one thing, and this is going back to go forward. Maybe I&#39;m thinking too much about this, but there is something to be said here. here.

And they&#39;re going to turn their eyes to all of the main candidates as soon as the election starts and say, oh, I guess I better pick somebody. So you&#39;ve got to use that moment. I don&#39;t think the launch needs to look like it&#39;s the first time anybody&#39;s thought about an election. I think you can use the power of the pulpit to go out and say, I&#39;ve just told the governor general we need an election. We all know it&#39;s coming. We all know this moment&#39;s too serious to wait a couple of weeks to see if parliament can work or not. I want to make a new parliament work.
