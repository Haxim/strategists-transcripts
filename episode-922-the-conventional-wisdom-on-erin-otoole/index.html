Should Erin O'Toole be concerned about the level of caucus unrest he faces? Can his strategy take him to 24 Sussex? And most importantly, will Corey please buy Stephen a new microphone?

And it&#39;s kind of come to a head, to be honest, over the last 10 days, when we&#39;re starting to see media columns by opinion columnists, when we&#39;re starting to see reporting with, quote unquote, key insiders within the conservative circles, grow frustrated about Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership. You know, they&#39;ve, as</div>

          <div class="said">as a party, not necessarily made the gains that many have expected during this pandemic period, especially when Trudeau was being slogged for a slow vaccine rollout. Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership numbers still remain, you know, lesser than Trudeau&#39;s. His inability to pick a lane, so to speak, has been a part of the discontent. Many conservatives saying he&#39;s being too centrist. Others say he&#39;s abandoning the right. So a myriad of issues, and we can get into a lot of them. But I think it sets the table for what we&#39;re going to see in the next week or so, which is a conservative policy convention. And that policy convention is now seemingly, at least according to some of the media reporting, being dominated at least by the metric of convention attendees and delegate slots by conservatives, social conservatives more specifically, far right, pro-life groups, anti-abortion groups coming together, taking a large swath of these delegate seats. So before we get into the leadership struggle that is Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership, what it means, should he pick a lane, is this all overblown, and then get into the strategic advice and kind of comparators of what you&#39;ve seen in the past, Stephen Carter, I want to start with this policy convention, because I think we&#39;ve mentioned it very briefly on the show. I asked both of you, if you guys recall, policy conventions, overrated and underrated. I think both of you said overrated. At the same time, they could be narrative defining. And with the metric of or kind of with the makeup of this policy convention being virtual, not necessarily having the read on the room as you would as a leader giving a speech. Stephen Carter, we&#39;re hearing the reports of the social conservative movement snagging some or grabbing a lot of these delegates slots.</div>

And it has the chance to really cut you off at your knees with your strategy, which seems to be moved towards the center, right? And so we may be looking at this in two weeks and saying that was no big deal at all. We may be saying everything&#39;s different for Aaron O&#39;Toole after the convention. It&#39;s possible. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s probable that we are going to say everything&#39;s different for Aaron O&#39;Toole. I think ultimately the most likely outcome is a moderately embarrassing event that he can move past because that seems to be what conditions are there right now. Stephen&#39;s done an okay job of summing them up, and he&#39;s right about the fact that a Zoom meeting probably fails to provide a lot of those avenues to whip the party faithful that an in-person meeting has.</div>

You have many people hungry, thirsty for what&#39;s our brand positioning? What do we stand for, Mr. O&#39;Toole? Like, who are we? So you have those two things kind of hanging in the balance.

Which is, well, yeah, but it&#39;s not a real one of these. And I think that the ability of Aaron O&#39;Toole to downplay what occurred uh is significantly better in a situation where it&#39;s not the norm right you just say well look this is not a normal convention of ours it didn&#39;t have the normal ability for us to get together obviously we saw that there were some risks with having whatever he wants to say he&#39;s got a lot of things he can say that he wouldn&#39;t necessarily be able to say if this was we&#39;re going to meet in ottawa and we&#39;re going to do all of the shit we always do when these things come up so that&#39;s an advantage for him as well carter</div>

It becomes very, very easy for a CA to be taken over by a relatively small group of people. This is not unusual in something that&#39;s just the politics either.

But people who have an axe to grind, people who have a particular point of view about something they care deeply about, they will join political parties at a higher propensity in order to have something to say about those issues. So it&#39;s incumbent upon the MPs to try and manage who&#39;s a member of their constituency association, who are buying memberships. I&#39;m not going to sell to this group, but more along the lines of I&#39;m going to sell more more memberships in general in my constituency, and that will water out the impact of a specific group because now you&#39;ve got more people around.</div>

We&#39;re going to look up vaccines. Corey, you know, let&#39;s shift away from the policy convention. You guys gave some good strategic insights and advice regarding how to think about that if you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole. But let&#39;s talk about his leadership overall. And I want to start here, which is, I mentioned very briefly off the top of this segment that This was something I&#39;ve wanted to talk about for a while, but it seemed like almost in domino effect, columns, articles, think pieces about O&#39;Toole&#39;s leadership popped up over the course of the last, I&#39;d say, seven to eight days. Andrew Coyne, Chantal Hébert, like, you know, prominent national columnists, a post-media piece that we can discuss that went deep to talk to insiders. What does the fact that you saw in the matter of six days, so many pieces, multiple, I think it&#39;s fair to say multiple pieces written about this subject mean? Do you feel like this is a sign that people are leaking, that there&#39;s outright discontent? You know, I don&#39;t want you to speculate as much as like read the tea leaves in terms of what could be happening from a political standpoint with your experience.</div>

          <div class="said">chatter out there. Maybe work your context, maybe see what&#39;s going on right now with Aaron O&#39;Toole. All that said, it is also possible that there is another group of people out there, people in the conservative caucus in particular, who are not so enthused or maybe using those opportunities that are presented by number one and number two, the fact there&#39;s a policy convention and the fact that people are writing about it, to go make sure their opinions are heard too. So they&#39;re also working their context the other way. They&#39;re saying, hey, you see this story about O&#39;Toole by Hebert. Well, let me tell you another angle about this. And so you do see that this can create a bit of a vicious cycle for a leader. But one thing I really want to stress is that while it&#39;s never a good thing when these things are going on, basically every successful leader that we have seen in Canadian politics has gone through a wave of these kinds of stories.

There is growing frustration in the Conservative Party because he is trying to change the Conservative Party. We&#39;ve talked about the fact they were too conservative. We talked about the fact this held their party back. Well, guess what? There are a lot of Conservative MPs in the Conservative Party and his party desperately needs to move to the centre.</div>

And there&#39;s a bit of a, you know, I, I bought this, I bought this product and this product is nothing like it looks like on the box that&#39;s happening right now too. And that is a problem of his own creation. Was it necessary? Maybe, but you&#39;re going to have to deal with that for a long time. When you kind of do the bait and switch like that, if you are, for example, somebody who says they will never merge the PCs with, you know, with the Reform Party, and then you do, right?

I not only want to talk about the unevenness in his approach, but also the evolution versus revolution trigger happiness that&#39;s been deployed by Aaron O&#39;Toole in certain cases, just trying to say this is what it is now, not having any sort of bridge or come on board period. I want to discuss that. But Carter, I want to actually get your take on this media side of things. Do you agree with Corey&#39;s analysis, the two prongs that he put out there that, you know, that, of course, this is a lead up to a policy convention. So there is a natural sort of home, that part. And then in addition to the fact that, you know, there is perhaps an opportunity to talk about these issues more broadly, when you see one columnist or outlet talk about it kind of snowballs in that sense. Do you largely agree with that? And I&#39;ll add a second part to it for you, which is how concerned are you, Timo Thule, if you&#39;re Timo Thule, that this stuff is playing out in the media right now?</div>

But there&#39;s one more, which is almost every single piece we&#39;re seeing right now about O&#39;Toole references polling. And one of them I thought was quite interesting, which said that every national poll published since February 1st has conservative support hovering around 30%, four points down from when they finished last time. Also, in addition to that, Aaron O&#39;Toole is the least favorable of the federal leaders. If you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole, Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you again, if that&#39;s okay. If you&#39;re Team O&#39;Toole, I asked you about, you know, should you be concerned that there&#39;s gossip in the media about your leadership?</div>

          <div class="said">Let&#39;s talk about the quantifiable numbers. Should you be concerned at these numbers? Because it&#39;s not just qualitative, it&#39;s quantitative. We can put in Barry Bonds asterisks on that, too. Should you be concerned about the fact that there&#39;s numbers out there which are being constantly referenced and reinforced in this media product?

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, polls, I think polls lead. I don&#39;t think necessarily polls follow sometimes. And so if O&#39;Toole is going to lose the next election, O&#39;Toole will lose the next election. So the polls that tell us that are, in fact, the outcome that is generated, especially when you start getting into these, you know, the 338s and everybody who&#39;s predicting which seats are going to swing which way. I mean, that becomes kind of like, oh, well, why am I even bothering? You know, 338 says it&#39;s all over, you know, so you get into this really negative cycle. And so if O&#39;Toole is seen to be losing, if O&#39;Toole is seen to be weaker than Shear, then</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">then it is just a very bad situation for O&#39;Toole. So, yes, the polls absolutely are part of the narrative. The polls are the cue to the media that they should start picking on him and ganging up on him. And the polls are the cue to the social conservatives as well, because he needs us now. He needs us. He has to listen to us. If he doesn&#39;t listen to us, then we can really bring him down. And there&#39;s a reason for this, I think.</div>

          <div class="said">Oh, way overblown. There&#39;s a couple of things I want to say about polls that I think people need to keep in mind as foundations for the conversation to come. One is the Conservatives for the past couple of years have tended to outperform their average of polls. If you look at the polling leading up to the last election, yeah, it went back and forth. You had some late polls saying the Conservatives were going to lead in the national vote. You had some saying the Liberals. More said the Liberals than Conservatives. And none of them for like going back at least a week showed the Conservatives winning by as much as they did of the popular vote. So let&#39;s just sort of bake in that there may be an underappreciation there. And the second thing is, top-line polls are useless in this country. They are very misleading. And if you are the Conservatives and you are bleeding support in Alberta, and you are picking up support in the 905 because you are becoming more moderate, to give you an example here, you</div>

So I&#39;ve mentioned in episodes past, I think it seems like he wanted to just hit that gas at the last moment and just start going towards this when he thought it was too late for his party to break with him. Well, maybe that was mistimed. Maybe that was never a great strategy. Maybe it was something that just seemed like a good idea. But when I talk about the execution and when I talk about that gas, he&#39;s had to feather the brakes a few times. So, yeah, he&#39;s kicked out Derek Sloan. Yeah, he&#39;s made statements about I&#39;m a moderate on these 12 different elements. But then he will stand by candidates at other moments, MPs at other moments when they make statements. We talked about Gallant the other day, right? Right. Yeah. This is this is just kind of the reality he finds himself in. And now, of course, he&#39;s got this policy convention where his party could, again, look a little bit more right wing than he&#39;s comfortable with looking. By the way, there is a universe where they come out of this way more moderate as a result of the policy convention. And it&#39;s actually a step along this whole journey that he&#39;s taking here. But, you know, he&#39;s just diving right in. Carter, you&#39;re you know, the say fuck it and win approach. Not only, I think, is that a strong candidate for episode title?</div>

Christy Clark, when she was elected leader of the BC Libs, became premier, there was just a huge swath of her party that would never get behind her, were convinced she was going to lose to Dix. She did not lose to Dix. But there was a lot of chatter, and there was this 801 Club, people who were going to be turning against her and getting that leadership review one minute after the polls closed in British Columbia.

Think about all of those Tories who were lining up against his Brexit plans, and he said, fuck it, I&#39;m going to win, and he drove through an election, and he recreated his party. It is possible. I think Johnson is likely an inspiration to what&#39;s going on here. I suspect strongly that Christie Clark is an inspiration. I suspect that the American political system is an inspiration.

If you recall his leadership, very much about trying to pivot away from the folks that got him into that chair in 2015. Carter, you know, when we talk about what Corey has here, which is, you know, some of the fundamental challenges on his execution. execution um what do you kind of feel like Aaron O&#39;Toole needs to do around his brand promise because many people are advocating that the dude pick a lane like who are you are you going to be a bit of true blue here and then like the moderate version here uh you&#39;ve advocated that he can go straight down become the moderate version of O&#39;Toole that he is what&#39;s the risk if he does that and what&#39;s the risk in your mind like I know you&#39;ve got this very bullish attitude of saying just fuck it leave these people aside but there&#39;s political risk here we don&#39;t really know how big this coalition to the right is. Talk to me about, in a reasonable sense or practical sense, how you would do this by minimizing the risk and perhaps by minimizing the growth of this right-wing faction of his party more and more so that he&#39;s not chopping off a significant portion of his party when he just says, fuck it, I&#39;m going to do it.</div>

I usually like to leave you guys when we close the segment off with a more specific question, but I&#39;m going to perhaps ask the most general question I have thus far, the most high-level question. And Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. What does leadership look like for Aaron O&#39;Toole after this? And I don&#39;t mean his leadership, but what does he do to demonstrate leadership? Because there&#39;s a few lanes he can pick in the sense of, OK, moderate or not. Let&#39;s say he&#39;s picked moderate. Aggressive or not. Both of you are saying aggressive. aggressive there&#39;s also a third choice that he has to make which is statesman like or you know like pugilist fighter uh and and we&#39;re not really clear on either of those two so in your mind what is the the the triangulation of the Aaron O&#39;Toole leadership look like to you we&#39;ve already kind of selected a few things off of the choose your own menu of what it looks like what are a few other factors you&#39;d like to see now knowing the first couple of things run an aggressive moderate moderate strategy. Carter, what else do you want to see from this guy? Or what else do you think he needs to do, maybe more particularly, to be able to have a path to victory in that column of a Khrushchev or an Obama or a Trudeau and not that former column of some of the failed liberal leaders that Corey mentioned earlier?</div>
