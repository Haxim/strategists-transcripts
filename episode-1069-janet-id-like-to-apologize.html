            <span class="text">future problems that was done before actually um more often than not you had an initial cabinet list prior to the election um based on where you you thought your seat projections were. You probably would have to, you know, switch it around based on who actually won and who actually lost. But you&#39;re not waiting for the election to do that. You&#39;ve got a list in advance so that you&#39;re hitting the ground running, especially if you want to have an early swearing in. The swearing in really dictates everything. If you want to have a very quick turnaround, then you&#39;ve really got to hit the ground running.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So the swearing in is when the government, so the old government still exists, right? Like Daniel Smith from before is still the premier, the cabinet ministers from before are still the cabinet ministers. Until such time as the new government is sworn in, they retain the government, right? The government continues past</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">out of sequence right so we didn&#39;t do everybody all at once we did allison first and then we brought the cabinet in a couple days later um which is not unheard of at all where the premier takes their position and then from that uh because then they&#39;ve got essentially the old cabinet still working for them until the uh the swearing-in happens so you it&#39;s not like people think it is it&#39;s not the american system where everything kind of well even the american system nothing disappears you know the president&#39;s the president until 12 noon and then at 1201 they swear in we don&#39;t quite do it that way with that that kind of pomp and circumstance. But the swearing in is the official change of government.</span>

It&#39;s not quite the same thing. It&#39;s not going the same way. You&#39;ll have You have your friends reaching out to you and saying like, hey, how are you doing? Hey, you&#39;ve ran a good campaign, all of the things that friends do. And you get fucking sick of it as well. Because everybody calls and you have to say the same thing. And you almost end up like you&#39;re doing a media circuit with your friends, just giving the same lines, right? Time and time again, until finally you snap on one friend and you say something darkly cynical or something like that. Like</span>

And you don&#39;t get to do it for four years. And you want to.

            <span class="text">you&#39;re losing Calgary North by 113 votes or Calgary Northwest by 149 votes, these are small gaps that I can tell you, having lost elections by 200 votes, the number of things you think of afterwards that you could have done to find those votes is a staggeringly large number. Yeah, it&#39;s agony. And when you&#39;re doing a provincial campaign, and it&#39;s like, if only we had 10,000 more votes in these areas that we knew were going to be tough, right?</span>

I mean, when we talked in the podcast before, we talked about making sure that you were doubling down your resources on the ones that you absolutely needed to have. And that&#39;s what needed to happen with Lethbridge East, Moranville, Strathcona, Sherwood Park and the five in Calgary, Bow, Cross, East, North and West. I&#39;m refusing to buy into this narrative that this is a significant victory for the UCP. It just isn&#39;t. It just isn&#39;t. it&#39;s 7,500 votes and it goes the other way it&#39;s 1,800 votes 1,900 votes and it&#39;s a 4,443 so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">here&#39;s the reality here carter&#39;s 7500 to our 45 42 projection that&#39;s the 45 42 just for the ndp to get a majority they needed 2600 additional votes spread across six seats or they needed to flip 1300 votes like this is really really close to your point if you do that same math the other way the difference was roughly equivalent for the ucp all of a sudden winning with 53 seats and so i guess the point i want to make is we were talking to people throughout the campaigns campaigns and uh the central campaign of the ucp they were saying we think 50 seats is our floor obviously they&#39;re currently sitting below 50 seats below what they thought their floor was you talk to people in the ndp and they said we think we got it we think we&#39;re 46 47 seats right and um and we ended up somewhere almost in between those perfectly at the end of the day but one of the reasons why i think well steven and i were like i don&#39;t know maybe the ndp do have it is that when you talk to the local UCP campaigns, they were feeling that sweat. It was kind of like sweat observable from orbit. Like there were a lot of anxiety texts that we were getting from people. And so it seems certainly plausible that the NDP were gonna win this thing. And you just gotta kind of pick a spot at the end of the day. But yeah, I mean, the difference between the UCP getting 52 seats and the NDP getting a majority government,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, in Calgary, Bow we talked about. We talked about Beau a lot because the quote unquote star candidate for the NDP had been dropped into Beau. And I think that if you told the strategist this is a star candidate, the strategist would have gone, I ain&#39;t a star candidate. That&#39;s a drag on the ticket.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But, you know, here we are. Right. This is the difference between being able to understand, you know, I am I am absolutely flummoxed that five seats were lost in Calgary that we thought should have gone to the NDP. But, you know, Esmahan, who ran those two campaigns, managed to pull out the smallest of victories in Glenmore and Acadia, which is, I think, just a testament to how hard she worked and the effort and skill that she brought to the table.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, look, I think I also thought that Glenmore and Acadia would be bellwethers. And in my own little spreadsheets, I was thinking they were seats in 43, 44, 44, 45, depending on the day, in terms of what was likely to be part of an NDP government. And so I will say I also was pretty confident that if those two seats went to the NDP, that the NDP were going to get government because I frankly thought they fell before many of the seats that Stephen&#39;s just mentioned. I also thought they fell before Lethbridge East. I thought they fell before some of the ridings around Edmonton, and they didn&#39;t. They fell before. And campaigns matter, and the reality is Esmahan ran two very good campaigns down in South Calgary, and all credit to her. And also, we make these projections, but we forget about the human element, I think, an awful lot, and how, you know, this is truly 87 campaigns. pains and yeah we can get pretty close and if we&#39;re going to be charitable to ourselves the idea that calgary north is going to fall before glenmore that&#39;s not crazy that&#39;s a hundred votes wrong yeah right like that&#39;s not a crazy thing less</span>

Well, where I am not in entire disagreement with you, Stephen, is that we have a number of situations where people take polls and then they apply a model on top of them and they treat the model with the same, as though it has the same scientific rigor as the poll that it was based Exactly. Right. And I think that is a challenge. And I think that&#39;s something we do need to look at pretty carefully here, especially if we&#39;re going to have races as bloody close as we had in Alberta.

We just talked about an election that was so close. 2,600 votes additional could have changed the outcome to an NDP victory. And if that NDP victory materialized out of advance votes that showed up three hours late after the tabulator machines were malfunctioning and nobody was talking about it, the tinfoil hat brigade would have been out in full fucking force talking about this election that the NDP stole. Look at the overall popular vote. They lost by eight points. there&#39;s no way they could have gotten all the seats they were losing until these advance votes came in all of these things would have been part of the discourse today and it would have been bonkers we would have had our own january 6th because elections alberta doesn&#39;t know how to communicate and there&#39;s an adage in crisis communications you&#39;ll both be very familiar with it is you open the front door or people start looking in the windows and they they misinterpret what they see when they look in the windows and they fill in their own uh you know Carter talked about, I can&#39;t remember, but post hoc confabulation is the one I&#39;ll throw at you, which something happens, and then you attribute a narrative to it.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i mean from a communications point of view the other major error they made in addition to not having somebody who could be a point of contact and share this information and be able to say things like we&#39;ll give you another update in half an hour or 20 minutes or whatever it is give them a steady stream feed the media on a regular diet here which would also have allowed them to feed their election programming which was part of why it was driving them so nuts they should have managed expectations a lot better if you can&#39;t don&#39;t tell people the results are going to be there and like immediately after the polls close if it&#39;s going to be two hours until you have half of them which is we didn&#39;t even have half at the two hour mark i don&#39;t believe and</span>

The important thing to keep in mind, see how I flagged that key message coming ahead here? I</span>

            <span class="text">important thing to keep in mind is that the physical ballots are maintained and there is a hand count that is ultimately accomplished there. And so things like that would have, I think, put people&#39;s minds at ease and allowed the process to unfold in a way that would have been a lot healthier than what we ended up getting. And again, it&#39;s not a big deal today, out of dumb luck, out of 2,600 votes not being there that might have been there if</span>

I&#39;m not even sure they could have given how close this thing wound up at the end, because it again, I reiterate, it was an unbelievably close election. and uh you</span>

            <span class="text">yeah no No, I actually think that&#39;s a great point. And I have to confess, I was sort of thinking it even well on a panel for one of the outlets that was calling it. I was fairly confident that UCP had won it at that point. It seemed like such a narrow path for the NDP based on the vote that was there.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">these races are really close in some cases. And well, well, I&#39;m 95% sure where this is going to turn out. Like, I actually, I&#39;ll confess, I don&#39;t know what the probability and like the confidence is that they require before they call an election, but it did sort of feel like not impossible that this is a 2000 style situation in the United States where somebody&#39;s walking back their call. Definitely felt that was a possibility. Didn&#39;t think it was a probability. Definitely thought it was a possibility. Carter,</span>

Where do you think you are? Which ridings should we be watching? Which ridings are competitive? Which ridings are not competitive? And they gather up the information to start to be able to make their models that will make the call. call and uh because each poll so we get you know let&#39;s what is there 12 14 15 polls per riding depending on which one maybe as high as 20 and these polls come in and they&#39;re coming in any non-geographic representation this is not random and this not random you know representation fucks with the outcome because now you&#39;re getting you</span>

And frankly, anytime you see the NDP winning one of those is like, wow, they&#39;re really outperforming as a general rule, right? Meanwhile, some of the last polls that come in on the other end, quite often are from areas that have big polling centers covering a lot of people, people who vote late. So those things are open late. And so this goes goes to that adage we were talking about just a couple of episodes ago it used to be said that liberals vote late they&#39;re not actually being</span>

And this is not about counting preferential votes or single transferable vote or anything like that. This is a pile of your stuff over there and a pile of my stuff over here, and we&#39;re going to count it. I&#39;d be really surprised if the machines changed even one. The only question would be is, you know, you put this ballot over here as an unreadable ballot. When I look at it as the scrutiny, I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s unreadable. I think that there was a clear indication that this is for this particular candidate.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">interpreting the ballot we talk about over counts or under counts so an over count would be you counted as this is a vote i actually don&#39;t think it should be a vote i believe this is spoiled and then they argue and they pull that vote out an under count would be the opposite you didn&#39;t count this as a vote it was it was interpreted as a rejected ballot i believe believe that this is actually a legitimate vote i believe i can see intent and this is not like the myth about scantrons when you were a kid where you&#39;ve got to fill in the bubble perfectly and if you&#39;re outside it it&#39;s a false answer the carter said the magic word it&#39;s about intent if intent is clear you get a vote you can put a check mark you can put an x you can put a big circle around it you&#39;ll have lots of candidates argue about when for example if you had like everything crossed out except one that&#39;s probably going to be considered a spoiled ballot but you&#39;ll have somebody say the ballot they didn&#39;t cross out that&#39;s the one their intent was for and somebody else will say no all you know is they said they didn&#39;t like those other ones and someone else still say no maybe they did like those other ones and they were just trying to check all of the ones that they thought they were like we can&#39;t read intent therefore that should be a rejected ballot that&#39;s the nature of the arguments at this point one of the things that i think we do need to acknowledge is we have a bit of a different advanced poll system here. And if we assume that it was working fairly well, I agree with Stephen, you&#39;re not going to see major shifts in the numbers. It&#39;s just not how our system tends to work. We do see shifts, though, and you&#39;ve got to be mindful of it. But if for whatever reason, these computers are glitching, it</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, so your first recount is the automatic one that occurs, you know, when Elections Alberta effectively just goes and recounts it when it&#39;s a margin less than that. You can then request a judicial recount beyond that. And once it&#39;s a judicial recount, so-called because it&#39;s in the justice system, it is possible to appeal things further from there. I don&#39;t know of any cases, but in theory, you could appeal all the way through our appeal system. You could end up at the Supreme Court arguing about seven votes in Calgary,</span>

She certainly was able to tell the narrative about about her candidacy. And that narrative, I think, played better. And again, it may be false data at this stage.

And if you&#39;ve decided that you want to make the campaign about Danielle Smith, that&#39;s a strategy. And they stuck to that strategy. And I think that they executed that strategy very, very well. And I think we would be foolish It&#39;s foolish to forget the fact that Stephen has underlined, I have underlined multiple times in this pod, 2,600 votes. And this is a totally fucking different podcast, right? We&#39;re talking about, oh my God, you want to talk about a miracle on the prairies, Danielle Smith, the idea that the NDP could construct such a hyper-targeted campaign that they&#39;re winning all of these seats by just a few hundred votes and they fucking handed you your lunch? Like that would be a different conversation. conversation. And they were in there right up until the last minute. They could have won this thing.

            <span class="text">well the thing about story is easy to remember it It breaks down defenses. We talked about that just another episode ago or so. It is a communications tool. It helps with the durability of the message. It makes it less attackable because all of a sudden you&#39;re attacking Sarah, who was in the ER, and not Rachel Notley. And it&#39;s like a mnemonic. It helps you remember the particular issue at play, which is part of why I still think about the story from the debate night that has to do with education. And I think about overcrowded classrooms. classrooms. But also, I do believe there&#39;s a media angle, which is the media&#39;s interest is in stories, right? You know, and, and to be able to provide that human interest, human interest is one of those main things journalists are trained to look for when they&#39;re building stories. And if you provide them the human interest, and you&#39;re providing them the conflict, because it&#39;s an election, I mean, you are doing so much of their job for them, and you&#39;re helping build exactly Exactly the narrative they want and the narrative you want. And so I do think it plays very strongly into an earned media strategy as well. But at the end of the day, while that&#39;s a great way to get into the newspaper, it&#39;s also an increased reach. It also increases that durability of the message. And so it&#39;s just, you know, it&#39;s important in comms, right? It&#39;s why we don&#39;t just have billboards that have stats up there, right? It&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s about how it makes you feel and it&#39;s the emotion and it&#39;s the people that you can project yourself into. to do</span>

Najwan strikes me as someone with a tremendous amount of capacity, but she does not have name recognition. So because she doesn&#39;t have name recognition, I don&#39;t put her into the star candidate quality. Now, Drew Farrell has name recognition, but really no capacity.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right like because like they go out there and they do their thing a star candidate advances your party brand and so that does usually require a certain name recognition and but it&#39;s more than that because you can have negative name recognition you can have a brand that&#39;s like oh they&#39;re very difficult oh they did this thing that&#39;s controversial i don&#39;t really like and celebrity alone does not a star candidate make for</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and their individual brand, because star candidates are like mini leaders in that sense, right? It&#39;s like, when I think about the NDP, I think about, and you know, for them, maybe a star candidate because of where they were trying to go with their brand is like somebody with unimpeachable ethics or, you know, somebody who really understood the economy because they were trying to shore up that particular private or whatever it may be. But it&#39;s, it&#39;s somebody who helps tell the story you&#39;re trying to tell about your political party. So yeah, Yeah, I don&#39;t think Drew Farrell was a star candidate, not because I don&#39;t think she has name recognition or not because I don&#39;t think she has capacity, but for me, because she didn&#39;t elevate the NDP&#39;s brand. It wasn&#39;t part of the NDP&#39;s brand story. Yes, she was well known and the city is well known. I mean, let&#39;s not break the – like she was a candidate until yesterday, but it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You start by getting yourself known. You start by joining your community association. You start by working on your soccer board. You start by joining your school council. council uh you become a person who is interested and known in your community so that when they choose you as a candidate that they are choosing someone who actually has name recognition and i think that actually was one of the big challenges of the ndp&#39;s uh candidate selection was they tended to to choose people that were only known in one community and that one community was being an ndp person for a long enough period of time yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i you know the answer for me is is stevens is right right it&#39;s like saying how do you buy a house in cash when you have no money right yeah baked into it is you have to you get working or you get lucky you either go out there and you start building the reputation needed to be a viable candidate in an area where you&#39;ve got a chance to win or you run in a place where they&#39;re just desperate for a candidate and you hope that you just you catch a break like a giant wave like 2015 for the ndp 1984 for the federal conservative it at the pcs like they do happen and yeah people win the lottery but it&#39;s not a great strategy if you said i want to buy a house and i said here&#39;s two dollars for a scratcher you know and</span>

You want to wait until they&#39;re in the everything you ask for stage. And you have to put them through vetting. You have to wait until it&#39;s closer to the end. um anybody who&#39;s ever been involved in a volunteer project for years knows that you know you can start with all the good intentions in the world but something&#39;s going to happen and your life is going to change and</span>
