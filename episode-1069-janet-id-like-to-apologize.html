        <p>The gang start a series of reactions to the Alberta election by talking about the day after, unpacking just how differently things could have gone with only a few votes and beginning discussion about what the campaigns did well and could have done differently.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter give their instant reaction to the results of the 2023 Alberta election and talk about what happens the day after the campaign, how few votes separated an NDP majority from a 15-seat UCP majority, and begin unpacking what the NDP might have been able to do differently. Why weren’t Calgary-Acadia and Calgary-Glenmore the predicted bellwethers? How soon does the work for the next campaign begin? And is tonight the night Stephen Carter quashes all beefs? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

I&#39;m refusing to buy into this narrative that this is a significant victory for the UCP. It just isn&#39;t.

          <div class="said">here&#39;s the reality here carter&#39;s 7500 to our 45 42 projection that&#39;s the 45 42 just for the ndp to get a majority they needed 2600 additional votes spread across six seats or they needed to flip 1300 votes like this is really really close to your point if you do that same math the other way the difference was roughly equivalent for the ucp all of a sudden winning with 53 seats and so i guess the point i want to make is we were talking to people throughout the campaigns campaigns and uh the central campaign of the ucp they were saying we think 50 seats is our floor obviously they&#39;re currently sitting below 50 seats below what they thought their floor was you talk to people in the ndp and they said we think we got it we think we&#39;re 46 47 seats right and um and we ended up somewhere almost in between those perfectly at the end of the day but one of the reasons why i think well steven and i were like i don&#39;t know maybe the ndp do have it is that when you talk to the local UCP campaigns, they were feeling that sweat. It was kind of like sweat observable from orbit. Like there were a lot of anxiety texts that we were getting from people. And so it seems certainly plausible that the NDP were gonna win this thing.

This is the difference between being able to understand, you know, I am I am absolutely flummoxed that five seats were lost in Calgary that we thought should have gone to the NDP. But, you know, Esmahan, who ran those two campaigns, managed to pull out the smallest of victories in Glenmore and Acadia, which is, I think, just a testament to how hard she worked and the effort and skill that she brought to the table.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, look, I think I also thought that Glenmore and Acadia would be bellwethers. And in my own little spreadsheets, I was thinking they were seats in 43, 44, 44, 45, depending on the day, in terms of what was likely to be part of an NDP government. And so I will say I also was pretty confident that if those two seats went to the NDP, that the NDP were going to get government because I frankly thought they fell before many of the seats that Stephen&#39;s just mentioned. I also thought they fell before Lethbridge East. I thought they fell before some of the ridings around Edmonton, and they didn&#39;t. They fell before. And campaigns matter, and the reality is Esmahan ran two very good campaigns down in South Calgary, and all credit to her. And also, we make these projections, but we forget about the human element, I think, an awful lot, and how, you know, this is truly 87 campaigns. pains and yeah we can get pretty close and if we&#39;re going to be charitable to ourselves the idea that calgary north is going to fall before glenmore that&#39;s not crazy that&#39;s a hundred votes wrong yeah right like that&#39;s not a crazy thing less</div>

And if that NDP victory materialized out of advance votes that showed up three hours late after the tabulator machines were malfunctioning and nobody was talking about it, the tinfoil hat brigade would have been out in full fucking force talking about this election that the NDP stole. Look at the overall popular vote. They lost by eight points. there&#39;s no way they could have gotten all the seats they were losing until these advance votes came in all of these things would have been part of the discourse today and it would have been bonkers we would have had our own january 6th because elections alberta doesn&#39;t know how to communicate and there&#39;s an adage in crisis communications you&#39;ll both be very familiar with it is you open the front door or people start looking in the windows and they they misinterpret what they see when they look in the windows and they fill in their own uh you know Carter talked about, I can&#39;t remember, but post hoc confabulation is the one I&#39;ll throw at you, which something happens, and then you attribute a narrative to it.

The only question would be is, you know, you put this ballot over here as an unreadable ballot. When I look at it as the scrutiny, I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s unreadable. I think that there was a clear indication that this is for this particular candidate.</div>

And if we assume that it was working fairly well, I agree with Stephen, you&#39;re not going to see major shifts in the numbers. It&#39;s just not how our system tends to work. We do see shifts, though, and you&#39;ve got to be mindful of it. But if for whatever reason, these computers are glitching, it</div>

You can then request a judicial recount beyond that. And once it&#39;s a judicial recount, so-called because it&#39;s in the justice system, it is possible to appeal things further from there. I don&#39;t know of any cases, but in theory, you could appeal all the way through our appeal system. You could end up at the Supreme Court arguing about seven votes in Calgary,</div>

And if you&#39;ve decided that you want to make the campaign about Danielle Smith, that&#39;s a strategy. And they stuck to that strategy. And I think that they executed that strategy very, very well. And I think we would be foolish It&#39;s foolish to forget the fact that Stephen has underlined, I have underlined multiple times in this pod, 2,600 votes. And this is a totally fucking different podcast, right? We&#39;re talking about, oh my God, you want to talk about a miracle on the prairies, Danielle Smith, the idea that the NDP could construct such a hyper-targeted campaign that they&#39;re winning all of these seats by just a few hundred votes and they fucking handed you your lunch? Like that would be a different conversation. conversation. And they were in there right up until the last minute. They could have won this thing.

          <div class="said">well the thing about story is easy to remember it It breaks down defenses. We talked about that just another episode ago or so. It is a communications tool. It helps with the durability of the message. It makes it less attackable because all of a sudden you&#39;re attacking Sarah, who was in the ER, and not Rachel Notley. And it&#39;s like a mnemonic. It helps you remember the particular issue at play, which is part of why I still think about the story from the debate night that has to do with education. And I think about overcrowded classrooms. classrooms. But also, I do believe there&#39;s a media angle, which is the media&#39;s interest is in stories, right? You know, and, and to be able to provide that human interest, human interest is one of those main things journalists are trained to look for when they&#39;re building stories. And if you provide them the human interest, and you&#39;re providing them the conflict, because it&#39;s an election, I mean, you are doing so much of their job for them, and you&#39;re helping build exactly Exactly the narrative they want and the narrative you want. And so I do think it plays very strongly into an earned media strategy as well. But at the end of the day, while that&#39;s a great way to get into the newspaper, it&#39;s also an increased reach. It also increases that durability of the message. And so it&#39;s just, you know, it&#39;s important in comms, right? It&#39;s why we don&#39;t just have billboards that have stats up there, right? It&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s about how it makes you feel and it&#39;s the emotion and it&#39;s the people that you can project yourself into. to do</div>

Najwan strikes me as someone with a tremendous amount of capacity, but she does not have name recognition. So because she doesn&#39;t have name recognition, I don&#39;t put her into the star candidate quality. Now, Drew Farrell has name recognition, but really no capacity. So, you know, we take her off of our star candidate list. list so star candidate for me name recognition and capacity um where you know like so back in the day christine silverberg was the chief</div>

It&#39;s like, when I think about the NDP, I think about, and you know, for them, maybe a star candidate because of where they were trying to go with their brand is like somebody with unimpeachable ethics or, you know, somebody who really understood the economy because they were trying to shore up that particular private or whatever it may be. But it&#39;s, it&#39;s somebody who helps tell the story you&#39;re trying to tell about your political party. So yeah, Yeah, I don&#39;t think Drew Farrell was a star candidate, not because I don&#39;t think she has name recognition or not because I don&#39;t think she has capacity, but for me, because she didn&#39;t elevate the NDP&#39;s brand. It wasn&#39;t part of the NDP&#39;s brand story. Yes, she was well known and the city is well known. I mean, let&#39;s not break the – like she was a candidate until yesterday, but it</div>
