        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips break down the federal budget vote that saw the Carney government survive with a razor-thin margin of 170-168. What do the strategic abstentions from NDP and Conservative MPs really mean? What lessons can the federal NDP learn from the recent BC NDP convention? And can Carter ever recover from the live show beatdown, or will Corey's facial expressions haunt him forever? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

But the Conservatives getting through this moment, is that a bit of a strategic victory for Polyev here?

He doesn&#39;t necessarily need to have a whole bunch of floor crossers when the NDP knows that if they fall at this, if they go to an election at this stage, I mean, how can it get worse? Well, let&#39;s find out, right? So, So I think that there&#39;s a reality that says that this isn&#39;t going to go to an election. This government&#39;s not going to an election until such time as Mark Carney wants it to go to an election. Because in the near term, it doesn&#39;t benefit the conservatives and it doesn&#39;t benefit the NDP.</div>
