            <span class="text">Corey, this was a mistake on my part, clearly, walking into that analogy. You know, even though it&#39;s true, we did actually use some of our Patreon dollars to buy a drone and send it across the country to another podcast. In fact, Team Canada Women&#39;s Soccer is copying a strategy that is well known in the strategist&#39;s playbook.</span>

But let&#39;s start with the, I wanted to talk about Kamala Harris, how the Democrats have fallen in line just so quickly. It seems like it&#39;s been a month. It&#39;s been a week. The excitement continues. We talked about the money and the initial excitement. I want to talk about what this sort of like media narrative and the media attention that the campaign has been getting, and including social media, I should say, over the last week means for the campaign. Have they set this impossibly behind bar for themselves? We&#39;ll talk about all that sort of stuff. But can we start with the J.D. Vance stuff? Because as much as I want to make fun of J.D. Vance, the memification of Vance, which is going on last week, it was Diet Mountain Dew, which led to the cantaloupe talk on our part. This week, it&#39;s this thing about, you know, couches and childless cat women that he&#39;s kind of talking about. I&#39;d be scared if Mountain</span>

And that, to me, absolves you in some respects of the actual sin that Corey&#39;s kind of focused on of doing the negative. I disagree. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a sin to doing negative.

That&#39;s a question that someone might phrase much more articulately than I have to you guys in the HQ today, being like, fuck, this is great, but I wish the election were tomorrow in some ways.
