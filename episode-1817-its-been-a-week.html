          <p>As they discuss the JD Vance couch "rumours"/memes, the gang would like to remind you that this show isn't for kids - but also that your kids have definitely seen this JD Vance content anyhow.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Kamala Harris and the K-Hive going full Donald Trump on Donald Trump - plus her polling and fundraising bumps, her rapid consolidation of power, and Trudeau calling of two federal by-elections back home in Canada. What are the broader strategy lessons that can be pulled from the past week? How much threat does this - and two federal by-elections - expose Justin Trudeau to? And why did Corey reject Zain's alternate title of "Fouchcucker"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

The excitement continues. We talked about the money and the initial excitement. I want to talk about what this sort of like media narrative and the media attention that the campaign has been getting, and including social media, I should say, over the last week means for the campaign. Have they set this impossibly behind bar for themselves? We&#39;ll talk about all that sort of stuff. But can we start with the J.D. Vance stuff? Because as much as I want to make fun of J.D. Vance, the memification of Vance, which is going on last week, it was Diet Mountain Dew, which led to the cantaloupe talk on our part.

What do you kind of like, if we take stock of that, this moment, and if we take a stock of that as a principle of our politics, what analysis or insights do you have? Because there&#39;s something really interesting happening about how people are almost seeing a moment through a meme first, or at least, not a vast majority, but a subset of people. i&#39;d say a greater share of people now than than before um perhaps what do you kind of take away from that i know we&#39;re living in it in some ways and we&#39;ve have lived in it but if we take stock of it in this moment what what is your take well</div>
