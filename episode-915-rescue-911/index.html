        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk shadow cabinets, reversing direction and managing an unruly caucus, and Canada's "vaccine certainty". Do Erin O'Toole's choices for shadow cabinet matter? What can we learn from Jason Kenney "reversing" his controversial  coal policy? And how many dead professors are out there running online courses? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

So just if you&#39;re listening to this, if you&#39;re one of the folks that&#39;s come to this podcast because of the Jesperson bump, welcome. You&#39;ll soon understand we don&#39;t care for you all that much. And this is a very self-involved institution about us. So welcome anyways, I guess. Secondly, I just want to let the people know what&#39;s going to happen if they are indeed now going to listen to Jesperson after they&#39;ve heard this. I&#39;m going back and forth on timing. Corey, I see you&#39;re uncomfortable with that. But I think the people can keep up because they&#39;re smart. I will be doing one of two things, which is either aggregating what you two say uh and saying it uh simpler uh or i may just take over the hosting job from ryan because um as you know uh it&#39;s a natural proclivity for me to just just step on toes can</div>

I want to talk about Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s shadow cabinet. I&#39;ll do this relatively quickly because I want to talk about not just who was shuffled or the primary person that I think is going to be most noticeably shuffled, Carter, your friend, but also talk about what goes into a shadow cabinet and its usefulness. So the main thing here is that Pierre-Paul Rievre is out as the critic for finance as O&#39;Toole shuffles his cabinet. Ed Fast is now the new Tory point person on finances, now having to respond and challenge, more specifically, Christa Freeland on that particular file. So, Carter, let&#39;s talk about this particular political strategy by O&#39;Toole first, and then we&#39;ll expand the conversation slightly to talk about the meaning and the import, and perhaps if we can get into it, the strategy of setting up a shadow cabinet.

          <div class="said">yeah. But you are signaling that he has got a voice that is now less important within the conservative party. And that will also tell you a bit about the cabinet making that Aaron O&#39;Toole ultimately gets involved in if he becomes the prime minister. The other thing, though, is that you are signaling something to Canadians, you are allowing one of the benefits of government always has is that they&#39;re the government, you know, talk about the power of incumbency, the fact that you can see them doing these things, because they are doing these things. It&#39;s easy to imagine Justin Trudeau as prime minister, he&#39;s the fucking prime minister. It&#39;s not as easy to imagine Aaron O&#39;Toole being the prime minister he has not had that job but by taking on the trappings of the government by acting as though you were the government and aaron o&#39;toole did this as well by releasing a readout of a conversation with a u.s envoy it is easier for canadians to imagine you to be the government and when they look at your shadow cabinet and they think of it like a cabinet and they say what does this tell me about aaron o&#39;toole it becomes a communications marketing piece as well carter</div>

          <div class="said">carter to To that point, I think Corey&#39;s covered a lot of the why do it and the import of it. Talk to us about some of the strategies around setting up a shadow cabinet, around either messaging or marketing or considerations. Is it as similar as setting up a cabinet if you&#39;re a government? Is there other things you can get away with, for example, that you couldn&#39;t if you were government, where you&#39;re having to actually now give people personal responsibilities? Do you have more leeway in a shadow cabinet? You can do more creative, interesting things because there&#39;s no real accountabilities. I&#39;m kind of curious what some of the strategery can look like and how creative one can get and how far they can perhaps push the bounds of thinking when they put together their shadow cabinet.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, at the federal level, it still is a trick because the federal level, you have more members of parliament than you have shadow cabinet positions, right? Right. So at the provincial levels, oftentimes a opposition party won&#39;t will almost not have as many voices as they need to have roles. So you&#39;ll be the shadow minister of X, Y and Z. And so you&#39;ll you&#39;ll be a little bit harder to manage a full, you know, to really dig into one portfolio. You may have to lean on one and and ignore the others a little bit. But at the federal level, your caucus is sufficient that you can actually have a shadow minister for every minister of the government, which kind of prohibits some of the game playing. Because what you really are trying to do, to Corey&#39;s point, is to signal what your government would look like. You know, when the shadow minister stands up and says, I disagree with the government&#39;s decision in this area and we think we should do the X, what they&#39;re really doing is putting forward the alternative government strategy. strategy uh so this is what our government would do but it also does something that cory you know because cory&#39;s points were all bang on i don&#39;t want to reiterate them all i just want</div>

For those who aren&#39;t aware of the idiosyncrasies of Alberta politics, we basically tend to think of it as three regions of roughly equal seat distribution, Calgary, Edmonton, and everywhere else. Edmonton&#39;s a mortal lock for the NDP. They have almost, they have all but one of the seats right now. The rural areas, maybe not as much of a hegemony for the UCP in a future election, but certainly it looks very, very strong. Calgary is going to be a bit of the battleground here. and you can really damage yourself if it looks like you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of giving into views that are seen by most calgarians is pretty kooky now if you want to however look at it the other way from like a party management point of view the the simple reality is there are a disproportionate number of no lockdowners within the ucp and</div>

Jason Kenney needs to think about these things in terms of what he is trying to do. And that means probably coming down to first principles again and saying, all right, a lot of shit is happening. We have caused a lot of this shit to happen. We need to fly the plane first and foremost. We can&#39;t fly into anything. Then we need to figure out how we are going to get to 2023. What is the course we are charting between here and the next election? And once they have that figured out, they need to communicate on that path relentlessly. Right now, the government is not communicating well. They are trying to talk to both the far right and moderates at the same time. And this is the effect we are seeing. They are not flying in one particular direction. They are whipping from one side to the other. And arguably, they&#39;ve got problems with the actual running of the plane that we have seen through all of these things.

Starting next week, this is in his voice, we&#39;re expecting hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses each week. And that&#39;s just from Pfizer. With these shipments, we remain on track to receive 20 million doses from Pfizer and Moderna this spring. Stephen Carter, we&#39;ve talked about expectation setting. We&#39;ve talked about about the liberals, issues, management, woes, not just on this vaccine file, but historically. What do you make of that communication? You&#39;ve got your strategist hat on already. I&#39;m not going to ask you to put it on later in the segment. You have it on now.

The headline here reads interesting. We know about the tensions that have surrounded Trudeau and Modi in the past, and Trudeau and the Indian government more largely, I should say, to be clear. It&#39;s interesting that a Western country would be looking to India. There&#39;s that sort of brand play here. I&#39;m just kind of curious, what&#39;s a conversation or a headline like this means for the Trudeau government, perhaps even as an extension to the COVAX conversation, where you&#39;re thinking about the Trudeau government taking from, you know, developing countries for our own domestic supply. Now you see India, which, you know, is an economic, you know, upswing in many ways historically. But it seems like a weird headline to read if you&#39;re reading it here domestically, which is why I kind of wanted to bring it to your attention and just get your gut feel on what you guys thought of it.

People tend to, people my age, so if you&#39;re around 40 years old, you think of India as what India was like in the 1990s, right? right? And India was a developing nation, quite a few steps behind many of the other nations in the region. You know, China and India were in a totally different kind of economic paradigm in those moments. Both have become much more economically significant players. India is a fascinating country because, you know, there is extreme wealth and extreme poverty.
