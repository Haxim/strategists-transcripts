            <span class="text">there&#39;s a lot of knee-jerk opinions, including from myself. Like, we all see it, and it becomes a bit of a Rorschach test, right? Like whatever you didn&#39;t like about Harris or the Democrats or the state of society becomes the reason why she lost. And I think the reality is it&#39;s going to take a little bit of time to disaggregate and to look at it relative to other jurisdictions and understand what&#39;s uniquely American. But I think two things are fundamentally true. And I actually think the argument about which one is true is missing the point because they can both be true.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And they both stack on each other in alarming ways here. One is, it&#39;s absolutely true that incumbents are taking a beating all the way across the democratic world. But it is also true that the Dems don&#39;t know how to speak to people that they used to know how to speak to. And these are not, these are not unrelated. And they can both be true. Because I guess just to get us kicking off here, what I would say is, look,</span>

            <span class="text">look, yes, it is true that there are anti-incumbency vibes across the Western world, right? But it&#39;s not as though the Democrats being in a precarious position against a historically bad candidate is something that just occurred this year. They shouldn&#39;t have lost in 2016. 2020 should not have been close. Donald Trump is historically bad and an unprecedented threat to American norms. You know, nobody could convince me otherwise about that. And that didn&#39;t just happen in the last 12 months here, right? But Donald Trump is is also tied into that broader story because dissatisfaction with the system is real is a real concern and by the system i don&#39;t mean american democracy i kind of mean democracy like people are mad everywhere left or right they&#39;re mad at their government nobody in all of democracy land seems happy and people are starting to come to some worrying conclusions right a lot less enthusiasm for for fucking democracy as a result of people just feeling like the system is not not getting them what they want.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey&#39;s right in some ways. I think the most fascinating element to this sort of outcome for me is that you could have walked into this election on election night and had the scenario that played out, and it could have been blindingly obvious that this was going to be the case, that Kamala Harris was an extension of Joe Biden. And of course, this was going to be a referendum on Biden when we knew that the anti-incumbency wave was one compounding factor. But the other one was the fact that people were looking at this through the cost of living and economic question. And Kamala Harris didn&#39;t do enough to separate herself. It was blindingly obvious that this was going to be the case. It also could have been blindingly obvious if Harris trumped it with 300 plus electoral votes that it was, of course, Donald fucking Trump on the other side. So I think Corey&#39;s right, like we can&#39;t overreact one way or the other. Because I think one of the things that the Democrats need to do in this particular case, as cliche as it might seem, is think about the things that I think they did right. And I really think they had an excellent six-week stretch with Harris, where they were actually nailing the freedom side of things, the vibes. Actually, I think that is a huge part of their success and why it was so close. And I would hate for them to think about throwing that sort of stuff away. Adding to that, I think there&#39;s a lot of commentary out there by people much more, quote-unquote plugged in, but perhaps that&#39;s actually not of benefit in their analysis. But I will circle a few things that I found interesting. Number one, perhaps there was a bit of a mirage for Team Biden in 2022 in terms of overplaying the democracy and women&#39;s rights angle, which found itself to be a core focus in 2024. Perhaps to Corey&#39;s point, people don&#39;t care about democracy because it doesn&#39;t mean a lot to them when their grocery bills are so high and the the economy isn&#39;t necessarily performing to the way that they need to. And then the third point I&#39;d kind of add onto the table, which I think Corey also alluded to, is the Democrats really need to do something about their, in its highest form, messaging, but I think in its more precise form, language. They have an issue with language, whether it&#39;s linguistic simplicity or just meeting people where they&#39;re at and how they speak. speak.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Democrats have had a long historical sort of Achilles heel around taking popular things and making them less popular with how they package them and how they speak about them. That&#39;s actually been a longstanding thing. And in fact, it&#39;s been one of the reasons why Democrats have shied away from popular policy positions is because they actually haven&#39;t had the ability to necessarily communicate them in eloquent, simple terms that connect with people. And now I think there&#39;s a really interesting postmortem sort of battle going on right now because some people in the Democratic Party are trying to give honest postmortem. Very few, I would say. And most people are trying to continue to win the tug of war because the existential crisis for the Democrats is now just not simply on linguistic messaging. It&#39;s about which direction this party goes. Is the left to blame for the social issues? Is the left actually the only reason that they were this close with economics, the left sort of leading economics that Biden pulled ahead? And there&#39;s a longstanding sort of debate that&#39;s now going to find itself in real time as the Democrats try to, you know, do the live on air tug of war that is the future of their party.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Some good thoughts from Zane there. Corey, you wanted to respond to at least some of it?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, look, I think Zane and I, I suspect would probably agree. It&#39;s not a one of the above thing. It&#39;s all of the above in some combination. And we&#39;re just we&#39;re talking about which one is probably the most prevalent. And so I think the Democrats can&#39;t hand wave away one or the other. They&#39;ve got to look at the whole package. Frankly, as Canadians, we shouldn&#39;t look at one and just say that&#39;s that&#39;s the reason it is here. But one of the things that I&#39;ll tell you that I don&#39;t actually believe was a huge problem for the Democrats, with a little last risk I&#39;ll throw on the end here, is Harris. I think Harris was pretty good. Like, I would not have picked her. I think that there should have been a primary. I think even if she had won the primary, it would have strengthened things. But people just sort of immediately decided, okay, here we are. And Zane&#39;s right. Then the vibes were pretty good for a while. And she was, she was pretty good. She killed Donald Trump in the debate. Like, I have not seen a debate that one-sided in a long, long time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But she only had 100 days. And it was what it was. Like, you were not going to fundamentally change the frame in 100 days. And as Zane said it, right, Biden was a bit of a millstone around her neck here. And that was never going to change in 100 days. Maybe if she had 300 days, 400 days, she could have created some distance, a little bit of that Kabuki theater where she has a different position than the president, and it looks like they&#39;re disagreeing in a way that&#39;s not hurtful, but actually helpful. That all could have been possible, right? But I think that ultimately, one</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like, she did fine within that pretty limited construct. And I do think that on reflection, there were a couple of things that we should have looked at. And it actually goes to Zane&#39;s point about messaging and language, and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and the Democrats struggling a little bit with those things. I actually also think there&#39;s a delivery mechanism question. I think it&#39;s a fundamental nuts and bolts. How do people make decisions? How do people form opinions in 2024 thing? I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get into this a lot over the coming weeks and months, years even, but I don&#39;t think we know how people make decisions anymore at all. And I just, I think about that debate, the debate where I believe Harris killed him.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Most people interpreted the debate through media, right? They got it from their friends, or they got it from the news media, or they got it from social media, whatever it was, they</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they got it secondhand. And one of the things that I think a lot about now, especially with the benefit of hindsight here, is every single one of those stories, all of them that said that Harris won the debate or was really strong and essentially put Trump on the back foot. Like, you couldn&#39;t find many people who thought Trump won that debate. But all of those stories talked about, and then Donald Trump only turned to the economy at the last minute, which was his strongest position, and why didn&#39;t he spend more time on that? And I was thinking about it, like, how much water got carried for Donald Trump in some of that analysis, even the analysis that said Kamala Harris won, because it was just a given that Donald Trump was better at the economy. And why didn&#39;t he talk about the economy more? And the critiques of Donald Trump became oblique critiques of Kamala Harris. And I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">could make a case that she could probably tighten things up if she had a bit more time. I think there is a strategic failure on the campaigns part. I, like Corey, think she was not a perfect candidate. But man, did I think she ran an excellent 100 plus days. I mean, the fact that she came in there, won that debate, had an incredible launch, fantastic convention. intervention um you know and and i and i think this there is like a race and gender component to this where even in in this in this post-mortem phase so many people are blaming a single answer that she gave on the view where she said she had nothing that she would do different than joe biden as being the her demise i mean fuck that right like joe biden is allowed 50 fucking gaffes a week and he was still the candidate this woman isn&#39;t allowed like one moment in which she cleaned up fucking 15 seconds later, and you&#39;re going to use that. You&#39;re going to simultaneously argue that mainstream media doesn&#39;t matter anymore, and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">then argue that an answer that she gave in a 10 second clip on The View broke her candidacy. You can&#39;t have it both ways. In fact, I think that&#39;s one of the reasons the Democrats are so fucking</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">fucking dumb sometimes in terms of trying to process blame. They want to be the smartest people in the moment, and they want to be the smartest people people after the moment. They&#39;re one of the most crystallized thoughts versus the most logical thoughts, which is you can&#39;t say that there&#39;s a right-wing media ecosystem that had already incubated a particular viewpoint for millions of Americans and nothing mattered six months before the election while simultaneously saying, fuck, she could have had it if she&#39;d said something different on The View. Like, get fucked. Like, that&#39;s not a real thing, like, to me. And so- Yeah, I agree with that, for sure. You know, and I think that you cannot understate the importance of the right wing media system that has been created. And I don&#39;t even think I&#39;m not even talking about Rogan here. I think that was just a cherry, you know, on the pie for Trump, or on the proverbial sort of, you know, Sunday. I&#39;m talking about like the deliberate right-wing media ecosystem that has been created that is a parallel, not even of the Manosphere podcast universe that has been kind of seeding these messages, taking ground away, communicating like a Howard Stern or an Opie and Anthony Wood during the daytime to your Hispanic or your black construction worker sort of dude all across the States for months. This wasn&#39;t like the last six weeks they turned it on and they killed it. This has been happening for months. And the Democrats ignore that that particular aspect as well to their peril. I&#39;ll add one more point here. And I know we&#39;re kind of going a yes and sort of thing. There&#39;s also another really fascinating element to this to me that gives me a bit of hope. And I know we&#39;re not talking about the future. But if I&#39;m a Democrat or a progressive, you could also and Corey, you may agree on this. I suspect you will. And I haven&#39;t had a chance to reach your sub stack piece. But you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you could also, you could also overcorrect if you&#39;re the Democrats, you could also overcorrect in terms of what this election meant to you. You&#39;ve lost black men, you&#39;ve lost Hispanic men, you&#39;ve lost white women, like you could just go fucking nuts and be like, we got to rebuild everything from the ground up. And part of it, like there&#39;s a case to be made. But at the same time, it is true in the American electorate system that coalitions aren&#39;t passed through, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right? Right? Like, you know, Clinton was not able to hand his coalition to Gore. Obama wasn&#39;t able to hand his coalition to Clinton. And I mean, Hillary in this case, right? And so in this case, when you&#39;re looking at what Trump was able to do, don&#39;t assume this coalition is going to be handed to the heir apparent of a J.D. Vance or whoever. And yes, I am speaking of a world in which we have future elections. But don&#39;t suspect that this coalition is just going to be handed over and And overcorrect the lessons that you&#39;re learning here in a certain way versus like deliberately thinking about things that apply across the board in terms of how you think and how you communicate going forward.</span>

But he&#39;s got almost a majority of the vote, which is almost unheard of for Republicans in this day and age here. But I don&#39;t know.

And then when you scale that out amongst a Democratic consultant class of which, you know, when you combine the PACs and you combine the history and the longevity of how long some of these folks have been working on these campaigns, one of the things I&#39;d kind of go back to is when you go ask your question, Annalise, do campaigns still matter? matter. I have been on the other side of Corey&#39;s sort of, no, they don&#39;t, for a while. But I think he makes some really compelling points. And I think one of them, and I know you&#39;ve made this argument, Corey, I think you started making it during the BC election, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Yeah.</span>

And what I mean by that is that one of the things we were touting, that the media was touting, was the Democratic machine. In fact, fuck, like, GOTV, they&#39;ve got a machine in Pennsylvania.

That&#39;s when Harris ran on the vibes, the walls pick, freedom, I thought was a really interesting message and crystallization. And then the Democrats did what the Democrats do, the machine took over, and they had to appeal to all their constituency groups. And an election that was supposed to kind of be run on a feeling of joy and putting stuff together went back to being a 2022 rehash in some way of women&#39;s rights, and it became a policy election. And they kind of found themselves, perhaps to their own—perhaps an own goal in their own right, having a policy election when they were setting themselves up with a candidate who wanted to really not have that type of election, at least</span>

I think that is an action that this is the time that they should do that, right? Including some of your most cherished tactics, like door knocking. In fact, I think door knocking needs its own – like, logically, taking our campaign hats off, interrupting someone at home when people do not want to talk to you and asking them about a topic that they don&#39;t want to talk to you about sounds like an insane thing to do.</span>

Like stress testing that as a core tactic, for example, just like you would test the radio spot, the TV spot, the 15 seconds, the sixes, the 30s, all these things I think is a really helpful and interesting thing to do. The second thing that I can&#39;t overstate enough, though, is that Trump&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">Do it now. Do it. Do it a little bit later and then keep doing it. I mean, so do it now in the sense when it&#39;s fresh and you&#39;ve got these reactive thoughts, do it a bit later when those reactive thoughts are less reactive and you&#39;re able to have a clear eyed perspective on what is real and what wasn&#39;t. and what was kind of emotional frustration. And then when you do it continuously, I think that&#39;s where you run the experiments. I think the big, I&#39;ll say it again, the big mistake that the Democrats can make is that thinking that their entire campaign was shit. And I think that the overcorrection that they can make is thinking that that coalitions are lost forever or for a generation. Will they have shitty Senate rounds in 26, 28, and 30? Yeah, they will. Like it&#39;s going to be bad for them just because of the red states available and what they have in terms of availability to flip the board in terms of the Senate. But that does not necessarily mean that those coalitions that Trump will transfer over to whoever will be as such. So, you know, go in with a set of assumptions that are more robust than just thinking through what we could have done this time, because that&#39;s not necessarily helpful to you. It&#39;s more about what we can do going forward. And then I&#39;ll add a Corey Hoganism to the table, which I suspect he would have anyway. So let me get to it before he does, which is, you&#39;re also not trying to build the playbook</span>

That he&#39;s not going to keep his coalition, so to speak, or transfer it over. So don&#39;t overcorrect. Everything you did wasn&#39;t shit, right? Think about like things from its broadest perspective in terms of longevity. But also, you&#39;re not trying to recreate the 2024 campaign Bible that would would have allowed Kamala Harris 130 days out to win an election.

I think there&#39;s a lot of anxiety. There&#39;s a lot of angst. And frankly, there&#39;s a lot of bile and hatred for one&#39;s own party. And if I was a Democrat and if I was smart, I would actually collect that right now.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">I would actually say, right now, you&#39;re in a reactionary, emotional state. Lay it on me. Give it to me. It may not be constructive or useful, but that catharsis, I think, is actually super strategic. In order to allow a rebuild, I think people don&#39;t want to wait months in order to give someone a piece of their ear. And I think any good organization recognizes that there&#39;s feedback that&#39;s useful and strategic and constructive and feedback that just needs to be given so that the other person feels heard. And I think there&#39;s a lot of folks right now in the democratic sort of universe, whether they consider themselves part of that aforementioned machine or or not, but are supportive of the outcomes of the Democratic Party&#39;s principles that feel like shit right now. They either have a, I told you so, we should have done this, I&#39;ve got thoughts. And to me, that is actually a mark of engagement, continued engagement. To me, the fact that they still, like they&#39;re angry shows to me that they&#39;re engaged. And if I&#39;m the Democrats and I&#39;m smart about it, I actually want to get that energy, and I want to harness that energy, and I want to use as part of what the rebuild looks like. I think political parties that fail to do that, to capture that energy and let these people internally kind of boil, will ultimately lose those people. And these people are ultimately assets that they need down the line. So that&#39;s one argument I can make for what they should do at this junction, even without proper DNC leadership, so to speak.</span>

I would, you know, even arrange it as, like, support groups for Democrat organizers and others, right? Like, you know, let you reel a bit. Like, you&#39;re not going to do anything constructive or productive, but if you&#39;re at least part of the collection of this bile or maybe this not necessarily useful feedback that&#39;s going to create the next future, but it&#39;s part of someone&#39;s catharsis, I think that&#39;s an incredibly important opportunity.</span>

It&#39;s a lot of people who&#39;ve run campaigns before, who&#39;ve had White House jobs before, who are the other side of K Street now, who are running lobby shops, who are running ad firms, who are doing all these things. I mean, it&#39;s not like, you know, in the democratic world, it is not frowned upon to have played both sides. And in fact,</span>

They might agree on economic left policy or populist economics as a future cause, but they&#39;re not going to hand over the keys to be like, and there you are, said Godfather, the machine is now yours.

            <span class="text">It&#39;s an interesting question, because we don&#39;t know if we should take Trump at his word on this, where he&#39;s going to be a dictator on day one. There&#39;s a lot of commentary about how he might try to get some very non-desirable cabinet picks into cabinet positions. We should circle back to that point in a second. But it&#39;s not uncommon for when you&#39;re an elected president, a newly elected president-elect. Actually, one of the interesting interesting things, by the way, is all of his letterhead doesn&#39;t say president-elect, it says President Donald Trump. Like, you know, he&#39;s coming back and maybe he was always president in his mind, right? But yeah, you&#39;re always going to be announcing these appointments or these nominations is a better way to put at it. It&#39;s just, they</span>

Whether you be Matt Gaetz, a man who, if he had waited three days, we would see the House report about his ethics, right? Which which apparently now we&#39;re not supposed to see, but I would wager we will.

And some of the things he was deciding to do or not do were reported in a way that suggested there was a nervousness by Trump coming in. Like, what was he allowed to do?

And obviously he&#39;s said what he&#39;s going to do in a lot of cases. His actions show he is clearly following through on this notion of loyalty above above anything else. But that loyalty is also, like, they&#39;re going to execute these things.

Now, it&#39;s all going to be in the execution for Trump. But I think Corey&#39;s absolutely right here. And let&#39;s be clear, you know, this is a nightmare scenario in some ways. if you&#39;re a Democrat, rather than having Trump do eight straight years, back-to-back terms, he has this break in between where all the people who hate him leave, say they&#39;re against him, he gets to retool, rebuild, come at it again while learning things, right? Versus if he had just taken another four after winning his first four, you would just kind of like, the machine&#39;s too big in some ways, you just have to carry it forward. In this case, he gets four years to retool rethink and just get a brand new system um in place and and expedite it to his will and have a loyalty test where people came out of the woodwork to say yeah boss not with you great thank you step aside i&#39;ll find someone who is yeah</span>

And I ask because I&#39;ve seen takes on both sides. And I&#39;m curious what your honest thoughts here. Zane, you go first. Who&#39;s it better for? Conservatives.</span>

            <span class="text">Conservatives. I&#39;ll throw it out there. I don&#39;t think anyone who is hoping that this would be a, oh, my God, we&#39;re so lucky to have Justin Trudeau and the liberals in Canada moment and say, you know, we got to do everything we can to protect progressivism. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. I think the fact is, in fact, that the fact that Trump&#39;s coalition was much more diverse than perhaps we assumed it would be heading into this election gives a lot more people license here to vote conservative. I&#39;m not comparing Pierre Polyev to Donald Trump. That&#39;s not what I am saying. However, it does give folks that license. There&#39;s just a natural kinship that you already see with the rhetoric, the linguistic language between the conservatives and Donald Trump and the Republicans. And then I think there&#39;s just some interesting X factors. One that I think is going to be talked about a lot more is how a sitting member of parliament in Jamil Javani is best friends, BFFs with J.D. Vance, like quite literally groomsmen at wedding level BFFs with the vice president and arguably the standard bearer of MAGA going forward. So I think that, you know, advantage conservatives is what I&#39;d say.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Maybe that campaigns are actually about building and arming your base, and that trying to get folks excited about you is the focus, and that you need to start communicating in a way that isn&#39;t alienating to them first. It actually, in fact, the opposite, it excites them. And then the second round is about persuasion. We know that there&#39;s research out there. And I think this is what I&#39;m almost taking the lessons from the Democrats here, rather than being like, here&#39;s what Trump taught us. No, I think the Democrats have all roll on to something, that where they had their moment of zen, their exciting six weeks of joy, that they were doing something there, that there was something happening there. And I think, you know, whether they strategically or accidentally gave that up up is perhaps beside the point in terms of what I think a campaign needs to look like, because I think they&#39;re hitting on some really important things here that progressives should talk about, which is being part of the culture, the feelings of joy, being part of something bigger than yourself. I&#39;d say Trump ultimately won that question. There was a lot of people from the manosphere and other places that Trump thought was selling a movement, not the Democrats, despite the fact that we saw the Democrats for six weeks looking like they sold a movement. So Democrats shouldn&#39;t forget that lesson, right? Like, I don&#39;t want to throw that away, because I think there were some good building blocks there of what they experimented with. And frankly, I&#39;d say one thing that was fascinating about that period of time was,</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">built by the machine in a six-week stretch. And I think there&#39;s something to be said about that. And I&#39;m not trying to like be too cute with my earlier point on the democratic machine, but when they built that stretch, it seemed authentic and organic and like of something natural. And maybe it&#39;s because it was. And maybe it&#39;s because it was rather than it was something engineered as the standard issue campaign that we would expect. And so there&#39;s something for progressives to think about around how you, you know, and of course, the standard progressive brain would overanalyze that and figure out how you try to make an organic moment and engineer it. But there was something to be said about yes, ending and saying, yeah, we&#39;re going to lean into this moment. We&#39;re going to like, you know, we&#39;re going to lean into Bratz summer, we&#39;re going to talk about the, you know, the Kamala pilling of situation. Most of that was not engineered, and you could tell. And there was a six-week spark there where I would do a case study on what the fuck happened there because I want to bottle that up and figure out what we do going forward and without necessarily being too overly analytical about it in certain ways. So maybe that&#39;s a start. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even a good point to make, but I&#39;ll throw it out there. I think there&#39;s something there.</span>

We&#39;re trying to sell them just what we think they want to hear. And there&#39;s something to be said there. Some people have called it the super majority style thinking, being like, I want to just blow the doors off this thing. And who cares? There&#39;s coalition management is second, right? Like, you know, and this is what we need. And I think if I&#39;m a progressive strategist, manager, activist, whatever, maybe I&#39;m like, look, here&#39;s our proof point that the stitching together coalitions piece by piece, poll by poll, and managing in certain way does not get us the outcome and does not even get us the mandate that we want at the end of the day.</span>

Because this next election is coming down on us so quickly. Things are not going to fundamentally change.

            <span class="text">We&#39;ve got to deal with the problem you&#39;re talking about with misinformation. It&#39;s going to require regulatory change. It&#39;s going to require cultural change. It&#39;s going to require education. We&#39;re going to need to train people to be better at identifying these things. We&#39;re going to have to reward people who are critical of their own views and testing whether those views are accurate or not. And that&#39;s all going to take time, much more than one election cycle, two election cycles, three election cycles. So yeah, let&#39;s deal with that problem.

            <span class="text">we&#39;re a relatively small country attached to a relatively big country, share a culture. And I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s no avoiding it. Like, we can sit there and say, oh, those damn Americans, they&#39;re not like us. They don&#39;t have bagged milk like us, right? But I mean, what does that get us? That fucking doesn&#39;t matter at all. Like, this is all coming across the border. It always does. All of a sudden, everybody is referring to EDI initiatives, equity, diversity, inclusion, as DEI initiatives, because that&#39;s what the Americans call them. And it comes across the border, sure as anything. So, you know, it feels like such a force of nature. Like, I just, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s avoidable. But I do think that we can be thinking about mitigations, we can be thinking about how we nudge, adjust things and start making some course corrections. Zane,</span>
