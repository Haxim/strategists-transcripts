        <div class="desc"><p>After a bout with Covid, Zain returns to depose Stephen (whereabouts unknown) and declare himself the keeper of the hot takes.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Zain Velji debrief the 2024 U.S. Presidential election - the past (what happened), the present (what should Democrats be doing now) and the future (what this means for Canadian elections to come). Was Harris simply victims of a global anti-incumbency movement? Do early moves tell us we're in for a different kind of Trump presidency? And will the gang be able to keep the location of Stephen's trip to New Zealand secret for the entire time he's gone? Annalise Klingbeil asks the questions and demands answers.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">there&#39;s a lot of knee-jerk opinions, including from myself. Like, we all see it, and it becomes a bit of a Rorschach test, right? Like whatever you didn&#39;t like about Harris or the Democrats or the state of society becomes the reason why she lost. And I think the reality is it&#39;s going to take a little bit of time to disaggregate and to look at it relative to other jurisdictions and understand what&#39;s uniquely American. But I think two things are fundamentally true. And I actually think the argument about which one is true is missing the point because they can both be true.</div>

          <div class="said">And they both stack on each other in alarming ways here. One is, it&#39;s absolutely true that incumbents are taking a beating all the way across the democratic world. But it is also true that the Dems don&#39;t know how to speak to people that they used to know how to speak to. And these are not, these are not unrelated. And they can both be true. Because I guess just to get us kicking off here, what I would say is, look,</div>

But it&#39;s not as though the Democrats being in a precarious position against a historically bad candidate is something that just occurred this year. They shouldn&#39;t have lost in 2016. 2020 should not have been close. Donald Trump is historically bad and an unprecedented threat to American norms. You know, nobody could convince me otherwise about that. And that didn&#39;t just happen in the last 12 months here, right? But Donald Trump is is also tied into that broader story because dissatisfaction with the system is real is a real concern and by the system i don&#39;t mean american democracy i kind of mean democracy like people are mad everywhere left or right they&#39;re mad at their government nobody in all of democracy land seems happy and people are starting to come to some worrying conclusions right a lot less enthusiasm for for fucking democracy as a result of people just feeling like the system is not not getting them what they want.

          </div>
          <div class="said">Corey&#39;s right in some ways. I think the most fascinating element to this sort of outcome for me is that you could have walked into this election on election night and had the scenario that played out, and it could have been blindingly obvious that this was going to be the case, that Kamala Harris was an extension of Joe Biden. And of course, this was going to be a referendum on Biden when we knew that the anti-incumbency wave was one compounding factor. But the other one was the fact that people were looking at this through the cost of living and economic question. And Kamala Harris didn&#39;t do enough to separate herself. It was blindingly obvious that this was going to be the case. It also could have been blindingly obvious if Harris trumped it with 300 plus electoral votes that it was, of course, Donald fucking Trump on the other side. So I think Corey&#39;s right, like we can&#39;t overreact one way or the other. Because I think one of the things that the Democrats need to do in this particular case, as cliche as it might seem, is think about the things that I think they did right. And I really think they had an excellent six-week stretch with Harris, where they were actually nailing the freedom side of things, the vibes. Actually, I think that is a huge part of their success and why it was so close. And I would hate for them to think about throwing that sort of stuff away. Adding to that, I think there&#39;s a lot of commentary out there by people much more, quote-unquote plugged in, but perhaps that&#39;s actually not of benefit in their analysis. But I will circle a few things that I found interesting. Number one, perhaps there was a bit of a mirage for Team Biden in 2022 in terms of overplaying the democracy and women&#39;s rights angle, which found itself to be a core focus in 2024. Perhaps to Corey&#39;s point, people don&#39;t care about democracy because it doesn&#39;t mean a lot to them when their grocery bills are so high and the the economy isn&#39;t necessarily performing to the way that they need to. And then the third point I&#39;d kind of add onto the table, which I think Corey also alluded to, is the Democrats really need to do something about their, in its highest form, messaging, but I think in its more precise form, language. They have an issue with language, whether it&#39;s linguistic simplicity or just meeting people where they&#39;re at and how they speak. speak.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="turn" data-start="495">

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">And Democrats have had a long historical sort of Achilles heel around taking popular things and making them less popular with how they package them and how they speak about them. That&#39;s actually been a longstanding thing. And in fact, it&#39;s been one of the reasons why Democrats have shied away from popular policy positions is because they actually haven&#39;t had the ability to necessarily communicate them in eloquent, simple terms that connect with people. And now I think there&#39;s a really interesting postmortem sort of battle going on right now because some people in the Democratic Party are trying to give honest postmortem. Very few, I would say. And most people are trying to continue to win the tug of war because the existential crisis for the Democrats is now just not simply on linguistic messaging. It&#39;s about which direction this party goes. Is the left to blame for the social issues? Is the left actually the only reason that they were this close with economics, the left sort of leading economics that Biden pulled ahead? And there&#39;s a longstanding sort of debate that&#39;s now going to find itself in real time as the Democrats try to, you know, do the live on air tug of war that is the future of their party.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, look, I think Zane and I, I suspect would probably agree. It&#39;s not a one of the above thing. It&#39;s all of the above in some combination. And we&#39;re just we&#39;re talking about which one is probably the most prevalent. And so I think the Democrats can&#39;t hand wave away one or the other. They&#39;ve got to look at the whole package. Frankly, as Canadians, we shouldn&#39;t look at one and just say that&#39;s that&#39;s the reason it is here. But one of the things that I&#39;ll tell you that I don&#39;t actually believe was a huge problem for the Democrats, with a little last risk I&#39;ll throw on the end here, is Harris. I think Harris was pretty good. Like, I would not have picked her. I think that there should have been a primary. I think even if she had won the primary, it would have strengthened things. But people just sort of immediately decided, okay, here we are. And Zane&#39;s right. Then the vibes were pretty good for a while. And she was, she was pretty good. She killed Donald Trump in the debate. Like, I have not seen a debate that one-sided in a long, long time.</div>

          <div class="said">But she only had 100 days. And it was what it was. Like, you were not going to fundamentally change the frame in 100 days. And as Zane said it, right, Biden was a bit of a millstone around her neck here. And that was never going to change in 100 days. Maybe if she had 300 days, 400 days, she could have created some distance, a little bit of that Kabuki theater where she has a different position than the president, and it looks like they&#39;re disagreeing in a way that&#39;s not hurtful, but actually helpful.

          <div class="said">they got it secondhand. And one of the things that I think a lot about now, especially with the benefit of hindsight here, is every single one of those stories, all of them that said that Harris won the debate or was really strong and essentially put Trump on the back foot. Like, you couldn&#39;t find many people who thought Trump won that debate. But all of those stories talked about, and then Donald Trump only turned to the economy at the last minute, which was his strongest position, and why didn&#39;t he spend more time on that? And I was thinking about it, like, how much water got carried for Donald Trump in some of that analysis, even the analysis that said Kamala Harris won, because it was just a given that Donald Trump was better at the economy. And why didn&#39;t he talk about the economy more? And the critiques of Donald Trump became oblique critiques of Kamala Harris. And I</div>

I mean, the fact that she came in there, won that debate, had an incredible launch, fantastic convention. intervention um you know and and i and i think this there is like a race and gender component to this where even in in this in this post-mortem phase so many people are blaming a single answer that she gave on the view where she said she had nothing that she would do different than joe biden as being the her demise i mean fuck that right like joe biden is allowed 50 fucking gaffes a week and he was still the candidate this woman isn&#39;t allowed like one moment in which she cleaned up fucking 15 seconds later, and you&#39;re going to use that.

They want to be the smartest people in the moment, and they want to be the smartest people people after the moment. They&#39;re one of the most crystallized thoughts versus the most logical thoughts, which is you can&#39;t say that there&#39;s a right-wing media ecosystem that had already incubated a particular viewpoint for millions of Americans and nothing mattered six months before the election while simultaneously saying, fuck, she could have had it if she&#39;d said something different on The View. Like, get fucked. Like, that&#39;s not a real thing, like, to me. And so- Yeah, I agree with that, for sure. You know, and I think that you cannot understate the importance of the right wing media system that has been created. And I don&#39;t even think I&#39;m not even talking about Rogan here. I think that was just a cherry, you know, on the pie for Trump, or on the proverbial sort of, you know, Sunday. I&#39;m talking about like the deliberate right-wing media ecosystem that has been created that is a parallel, not even of the Manosphere podcast universe that has been kind of seeding these messages, taking ground away, communicating like a Howard Stern or an Opie and Anthony Wood during the daytime to your Hispanic or your black construction worker sort of dude all across the States for months. This wasn&#39;t like the last six weeks they turned it on and they killed it. This has been happening for months. And the Democrats ignore that that particular aspect as well to their peril. I&#39;ll add one more point here. And I know we&#39;re kind of going a yes and sort of thing. There&#39;s also another really fascinating element to this to me that gives me a bit of hope. And I know we&#39;re not talking about the future. But if I&#39;m a Democrat or a progressive, you could also and Corey, you may agree on this. I suspect you will.

And so in this case, when you&#39;re looking at what Trump was able to do, don&#39;t assume this coalition is going to be handed to the heir apparent of a J.D. Vance or whoever. And yes, I am speaking of a world in which we have future elections.

I have been on the other side of Corey&#39;s sort of, no, they don&#39;t, for a while. But I think he makes some really compelling points.

          <div class="said">Do it now. Do it. Do it a little bit later and then keep doing it. I mean, so do it now in the sense when it&#39;s fresh and you&#39;ve got these reactive thoughts, do it a bit later when those reactive thoughts are less reactive and you&#39;re able to have a clear eyed perspective on what is real and what wasn&#39;t. and what was kind of emotional frustration. And then when you do it continuously, I think that&#39;s where you run the experiments. I think the big, I&#39;ll say it again, the big mistake that the Democrats can make is that thinking that their entire campaign was shit. And I think that the overcorrection that they can make is thinking that that coalitions are lost forever or for a generation. Will they have shitty Senate rounds in 26, 28, and 30? Yeah, they will. Like it&#39;s going to be bad for them just because of the red states available and what they have in terms of availability to flip the board in terms of the Senate. But that does not necessarily mean that those coalitions that Trump will transfer over to whoever will be as such. So, you know, go in with a set of assumptions that are more robust than just thinking through what we could have done this time, because that&#39;s not necessarily helpful to you. It&#39;s more about what we can do going forward. And then I&#39;ll add a Corey Hoganism to the table, which I suspect he would have anyway.

I think there&#39;s a lot of anxiety. There&#39;s a lot of angst. And frankly, there&#39;s a lot of bile and hatred for one&#39;s own party. And if I was a Democrat and if I was smart, I would actually collect that right now.</div>

          <div class="said">I would actually say, right now, you&#39;re in a reactionary, emotional state. Lay it on me. Give it to me. It may not be constructive or useful, but that catharsis, I think, is actually super strategic. In order to allow a rebuild, I think people don&#39;t want to wait months in order to give someone a piece of their ear. And I think any good organization recognizes that there&#39;s feedback that&#39;s useful and strategic and constructive and feedback that just needs to be given so that the other person feels heard. And I think there&#39;s a lot of folks right now in the democratic sort of universe, whether they consider themselves part of that aforementioned machine or or not, but are supportive of the outcomes of the Democratic Party&#39;s principles that feel like shit right now. They either have a, I told you so, we should have done this, I&#39;ve got thoughts. And to me, that is actually a mark of engagement, continued engagement. To me, the fact that they still, like they&#39;re angry shows to me that they&#39;re engaged. And if I&#39;m the Democrats and I&#39;m smart about it, I actually want to get that energy, and I want to harness that energy, and I want to use as part of what the rebuild looks like. I think political parties that fail to do that, to capture that energy and let these people internally kind of boil, will ultimately lose those people. And these people are ultimately assets that they need down the line. So that&#39;s one argument I can make for what they should do at this junction, even without proper DNC leadership, so to speak.</div>

The plan was always to put these types of folks that would never question Donald Trump in the bureaucratic level all across government while having Ramaswamy and Elon shrink bureaucracy so that these mid-level folks or attempt to so that these mid-level folks, you know, have have more power. Now, it&#39;s all going to be in the execution for Trump. But I think Corey&#39;s absolutely right here. And let&#39;s be clear, you know, this is a nightmare scenario in some ways. if you&#39;re a Democrat, rather than having Trump do eight straight years, back-to-back terms, he has this break in between where all the people who hate him leave, say they&#39;re against him, he gets to retool, rebuild, come at it again while learning things, right? Versus if he had just taken another four after winning his first four, you would just kind of like, the machine&#39;s too big in some ways, you just have to carry it forward. In this case, he gets four years to retool rethink and just get a brand new system um in place and and expedite it to his will and have a loyalty test where people came out of the woodwork to say yeah boss not with you great thank you step aside i&#39;ll find someone who is yeah</div>

I don&#39;t think anyone who is hoping that this would be a, oh, my God, we&#39;re so lucky to have Justin Trudeau and the liberals in Canada moment and say, you know, we got to do everything we can to protect progressivism. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen. I think the fact is, in fact, that the fact that Trump&#39;s coalition was much more diverse than perhaps we assumed it would be heading into this election gives a lot more people license here to vote conservative. I&#39;m not comparing Pierre Polyev to Donald Trump. That&#39;s not what I am saying. However, it does give folks that license. There&#39;s just a natural kinship that you already see with the rhetoric, the linguistic language between the conservatives and Donald Trump and the Republicans. And then I think there&#39;s just some interesting X factors. One that I think is going to be talked about a lot more is how a sitting member of parliament in Jamil Javani is best friends, BFFs with J.D. Vance, like quite literally groomsmen at wedding level BFFs with the vice president and arguably the standard bearer of MAGA going forward. So I think that, you know, advantage conservatives is what I&#39;d say.</div>

          <div class="said">Maybe that campaigns are actually about building and arming your base, and that trying to get folks excited about you is the focus, and that you need to start communicating in a way that isn&#39;t alienating to them first. It actually, in fact, the opposite, it excites them. And then the second round is about persuasion. We know that there&#39;s research out there. And I think this is what I&#39;m almost taking the lessons from the Democrats here, rather than being like, here&#39;s what Trump taught us. No, I think the Democrats have all roll on to something, that where they had their moment of zen, their exciting six weeks of joy, that they were doing something there, that there was something happening there. And I think, you know, whether they strategically or accidentally gave that up up is perhaps beside the point in terms of what I think a campaign needs to look like, because I think they&#39;re hitting on some really important things here that progressives should talk about, which is being part of the culture, the feelings of joy, being part of something bigger than yourself. I&#39;d say Trump ultimately won that question. There was a lot of people from the manosphere and other places that Trump thought was selling a movement, not the Democrats, despite the fact that we saw the Democrats for six weeks looking like they sold a movement. So Democrats shouldn&#39;t forget that lesson, right? Like, I don&#39;t want to throw that away, because I think there were some good building blocks there of what they experimented with. And frankly, I&#39;d say one thing that was fascinating about that period of time was,</div>

          <div class="said">built by the machine in a six-week stretch. And I think there&#39;s something to be said about that. And I&#39;m not trying to like be too cute with my earlier point on the democratic machine, but when they built that stretch, it seemed authentic and organic and like of something natural. And maybe it&#39;s because it was. And maybe it&#39;s because it was rather than it was something engineered as the standard issue campaign that we would expect. And so there&#39;s something for progressives to think about around how you, you know, and of course, the standard progressive brain would overanalyze that and figure out how you try to make an organic moment and engineer it. But there was something to be said about yes, ending and saying, yeah, we&#39;re going to lean into this moment. We&#39;re going to like, you know, we&#39;re going to lean into Bratz summer, we&#39;re going to talk about the, you know, the Kamala pilling of situation. Most of that was not engineered, and you could tell. And there was a six-week spark there where I would do a case study on what the fuck happened there because I want to bottle that up and figure out what we do going forward and without necessarily being too overly analytical about it in certain ways. So maybe that&#39;s a start. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even a good point to make, but I&#39;ll throw it out there. I think there&#39;s something there.</div>

Some people have called it the super majority style thinking, being like, I want to just blow the doors off this thing. And who cares? There&#39;s coalition management is second, right? Like, you know, and this is what we need. And I think if I&#39;m a progressive strategist, manager, activist, whatever, maybe I&#39;m like, look, here&#39;s our proof point that the stitching together coalitions piece by piece, poll by poll, and managing in certain way does not get us the outcome and does not even get us the mandate that we want at the end of the day.</div>
