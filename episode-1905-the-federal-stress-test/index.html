        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss a federal stress test unfolding on two fronts: The killing of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents and open U.S. interference in Alberta's separatism debate. What happens when American political actors start shaping domestic politics? Why isn't there a more serious political pushback in the US after another fatal federal law enforcement shooting? And is anyone even pretending this is normal anymore?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p>Audio excerpt from "Unless You Are Free" by Ani DiFranco &amp; Utah Phillips (Fellow Workers, Righteous Babe Records)</p><p></p>

You know, the way I&#39;ll kind of put it, like, I thought the separatist strategy had threefolds. Number one, you make it socially acceptable for them to get really loud about separatism, right? That it&#39;s a socially acceptable thing to talk about, that it won&#39;t get you barred into the corner of society. Number two, you make it a solution to any grievance you have. Any grievance whatsoever, separatism is a solution. And number three, and this is where I&#39;m surprised they&#39;re rejecting America, I fundamentally thought it was about finding a dance partner. And now that America has emerged as a potential dance partner, I&#39;m surprised that their strategy has been to reject America, at least publicly. I&#39;m curious to get your thinking on whether you agree with my thesis or what you think of their strategic approach here.</div>

But now that a dance partner has appeared, if they&#39;re smart, they would also not reject that outright as being a reason why other people would support it. So kind of adding to point number two, you add a list of every grievance you have, immigration, kid, woke ideology, whatever that might look like, right? Your taxes. Separation is the answer. And there could be a potential to be negotiated later. U.S. dollar one-to-one conversion, an American passport, like all these sort of things could be upside for you that you may find a home. And if you&#39;re more aligned with the Trump ideology, that could actually be quite a motivator for folks. my main point was that this is a serious threat whatever</div>

I&#39;m curious your guys&#39; take on his playing a more formal role. Would you, if he called either of you as neutral advisors, would you suggest that he do so?

But secondly, I&#39;m actually, from our purposes, quite curious to hear your take on a theme that we&#39;ve visited in the past, which is, are politicians being pundits? And we&#39;ve seen this over the course of the last number of days, where, you know, whether you like it or not, Canadian politicians, to some degree, have been asked or have themselves commented on the situation in the United States, and they&#39;ve given their sort of like moral sort of value difference sort of commentary etc we&#39;ve generally been pretty against punditry from politicians mainly because you control the levers of power and you can you actually can do stuff so stop just talking about you know your analysis of the game but i am curious if this moment is different so that&#39;s where i want to go on this piece i&#39;ll let you get a shot at the first part of it carter and i didn&#39;t mean to intend shot with any other well</div>
