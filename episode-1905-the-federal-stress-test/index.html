        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips discuss a federal stress test unfolding on two fronts: The killing of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents and open U.S. interference in Alberta's separatism debate. What happens when American political actors start shaping domestic politics? Why isn't there a more serious political pushback in the US after another fatal federal law enforcement shooting? And is anyone even pretending this is normal anymore?</p><p>Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p>Audio excerpt from "Unless You Are Free" by Ani DiFranco &amp; Utah Phillips (Fellow Workers, Righteous Babe Records)</p><p></p>

U.S. dollar, American passport, all those false promises that come with that, right? Or hypothetical promises, let me call it that. But for others, they seem to be really retreating away.

          <div class="said">Carter, I&#39;m curious to get your take on their strategy here of denying Americanism as a core part of their strategy or actually leaving the door open, because you would think that there&#39;d be part of their coalition that they are forming, at least in the signature gathering phase, that might not be detracted from the American opportunity, but see it as a possibility. You know, the way I&#39;ll kind of put it, like, I thought the separatist strategy had threefolds. Number one, you make it socially acceptable for them to get really loud about separatism, right? That it&#39;s a socially acceptable thing to talk about, that it won&#39;t get you barred into the corner of society. Number two, you make it a solution to any grievance you have. Any grievance whatsoever, separatism is a solution. And number three, and this is where I&#39;m surprised they&#39;re rejecting America, I fundamentally thought it was about finding a dance partner. And now that America has emerged as a potential dance partner, I&#39;m surprised that their strategy has been to reject America, at least publicly. I&#39;m curious to get your thinking on whether you agree with my thesis or what you think of their strategic approach here.</div>
