        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about a wild 24 hours in Alberta politics that included midnight calls for the Premier's resignation, a leaky caucus meeting and - ultimately - the expulsion of two UCP members. What is Drew Barnes' ultimate objective? Can Jason Kenney survive this moment? And are we really doing the headlines too? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  But first, unbelievably, the headlines... <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

And this one starts with The New York Times, where the Ohio lottery is to give five people a million dollar each to encourage vaccination. That&#39;s right. The many propositions that governments have used to bolster slumping demand for the vaccine in the United States. Well, Republican Governor of Michigan Mike DeWine of Ohio, I should say, raised the ante considerably on Wednesday, announcing that the state would give five people a million bucks in return for having been vaccinated as part of their weekly lottery program. Stephen Carter, we have talked about incentives. We&#39;ve talked about vaccine hesitancy. We&#39;ve talked about vaccine behavior.

Carter, do you legitimately feel like an incentive like this could work in Canada? It&#39;s almost like we&#39;re a few paces behind in terms of our cycle. But if we get to this point, is this something to keep in mind quite legitimately?</div>

It&#39;s absolutely inconsequential when you consider the overall health budget and the costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. So it costs nothing. And</div>

I&#39;m not 100% convinced that the lottery formulated the way they&#39;ve done it will have any material effect. But what I like about the United States always is that there are 50 crazy experiments. So let&#39;s see which states figure this out. Let&#39;s see if it has any material effect relative to their neighbor states, because maybe it&#39;s just a situation where you&#39;re paying $5 million to people who would have been vaccinated anyhow.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, what was interesting about this tweet that they&#39;ve since deleted was a couple of things. You know, if you&#39;re on social media like us, you notice a few of these things. One of them was that it was a scheduled tweet. You could tell because exactly at a particular timestamp, like 8 a.m. So this must have gone through like a vetting process by some folks being like, yeah, put it in the queue, so to speak, right? Right. So this was not a off the cuff. Someone came up with an amazing idea that Trudeau kind of said one dose summer. So, you know, Trudeau sounds like Trudeau. And they kind of put it up. This was at least some form of vetting, which I thought was interesting because there&#39;s probably checks and balances to these things. And then the second thing was, you know, a question around which audience were they trying to play with? So those are just two observations from my mind. But I&#39;m curious to get your reaction to this mean tweet by the conservatives. Well,</div>

Minister backtracks on Bill C-10, says social media users will never be regulated. I mean, this bill has been a disaster from the beginning. We&#39;ve talked about it briefly in a few episodes ago. Stephen Carter, what do you think this kind of says about the minister here? I&#39;m just kind of curious from your communications lens, you know, was this a policy issue? Was this a communications issue? Now that the bill is held up, he couldn&#39;t really translate it all that well to Canadians in terms of what it was or was not supposed to do. I&#39;m quickly getting your thoughts on the minister here on this particular bill.</div>

It did not work from the beginning. It did not have simple talking points that he could stick to and understand. And based on the various discussions and the various times he&#39;s spoken to the bill, he has not been able to present a clear understanding of what this bill is designed to do, because I fear that this minister did not understand what this bill was designed to do. And that is a real problem if you&#39;re Justin Trudeau, because the prime minister&#39;s office can&#39;t do it all. This type of bill, this type of regulation of the internet shouldn&#39;t be that challenging. We&#39;ve covered it off here before.

          <div class="said">Well, I&#39;m not. There is no case for it, because the the best case was made in the moment. And that was by the conservative leader when he said Bill Morneau&#39;s resignation is further proof of a government in chaos. And of course, that that conservative leader was Andrew Scheer. So he&#39;s gone. This is not something that&#39;s stuck. And I think that this is part of the reason that Scheer himself is gone, because they chased they chased issues that didn&#39;t matter. And so my recommendation to the conservatives, don&#39;t chase this. it&#39;s over it&#39;s done uh chase c10 that seems to be working chase um chase the budget chase uh chase what you can do for canadians but bill morneau is gone and these ethics violations come with no impact at all it&#39;s over move on cory</div>

          <div class="said">Liberals aren&#39;t sorry. The Liberals aren&#39;t apologizing for their ethics failings. They didn&#39;t fire Bill Morneau. Morneau, they just wanted to move behind the curtain. They tried to get him a cushy job elsewhere. In fact, as was reported in Blacklock&#39;s last month, they spent nearly $11,000 during a pandemic on hospitality and printing in order to try to get this guy the OECD job. I mean, it&#39;s madness to think that somehow Morneau was being punished. This is just another example of how when the spotlight gets too hot, the liberals try to give their buddies jobs somewhere in the dark. And that&#39;s all you&#39;re seeing here. And you should not give Justin Trudeau a pass for this. This is not ethical heroism. This is ethical failure at the highest stages. It wasn&#39;t bad enough that he had to be an ethical failure in Canada. He tried to make Bill Morneau the world&#39;s ethical failure by putting him in charge of the OECD.</div>

We record tonight on Thursday evening. The party caucus met Thursday evening to discuss a letter from former UCP caucus chair Todd Lowen, published announcing his resignation as chair and stating that Premier Jason Kenney was, quote unquote, causing dysfunction within the party. MLAs from the party voted to remove him as well as, wait for it, drumroll, Stephen Carter, True Barnes, of course, finally, from the government caucus in a statement issued by Mike Ellis, who&#39;s the party whip. He said members recognize the need for government caucus to remain strong and united behind our leader, Premier Jason Kenney, as we continue to fight through what looks to be the final stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. OK, guys, a lot to talk about. I mean, we had the letter in terms of timeline. First, in terms of how the letter was delivered. What was it, midnight, 1 a.m., something like that, like in the middle of the night, right? I think if we heard about it, we heard about 5, 6 a.m. when we were getting up in the morning. So timing, I want to talk about that. I don&#39;t want to actually bypass the entire letter conversation. Then the subsequent steps of an additional MLA coming and supporting this particular MLA, Todd Lowen. No real support for Jason Kenney from his caucus. I want to talk about whether that was strategy, whether that was happenstance, whether that was a directive by the Premier&#39;s office, whatever that was. Then we get into a caucus meeting that lasts several hours, leading into a vote later in the evening, where we find out the results of what I just mentioned, these two members, Drew Barnes and Todd Lowen, out of caucus. Corey, can we start with the letter? Or do you want to start somewhere else? Because I wanted to start with how the letter was delivered first. But maybe give me, before I jump into that, how bad is this for Jason Kenney, top line, and then let&#39;s jump into the mechanics of what happened over the course of the last 24 hours. Well,</div>

          <div class="said">to drop, bridge the gap for me, my friend. No, the way that the way that premiers go down is when the people who are in their caucus take them down. The people who are outside your caucus can&#39;t do anything to you. Right. Right. The people who are outside of the caucus are sitting out there thinking about their next moves and how they&#39;re going to get reelected, forming their own party. They&#39;re not coming back in. So it&#39;s the people who are in the caucus that represent the real threat to you. So what what I&#39;m certain Kenny&#39;s concerned about right now are the six. What did you say, 60 that are left? Those 60 are, you know, they&#39;re more than enough to keep your majority. There&#39;s 16 more that can leave and you can still hold your majority government. But you have to make sure that those people aren&#39;t gunning for you because all of these things added together, like I said a number of episodes ago, the best thing that could happen to Kenny is that he kicks eight people out of his caucus and those eight people form a different party. And then he can start to shift into what does a true conservative government look like? A true conservative government that&#39;s concerned about the cost of health care, that doesn&#39;t want to see people&#39;s lives wasted for no particular purpose, that wants businesses to get back to being</div>

So that&#39;s what should have happened to Drew Barnes months ago.

Carter, on option number one, finish off what the tactics are for a quick unseating of a leader, right? You said letter-writing campaigns. I interrupted you, and you said, yeah, they need to be specific. People need to put their names on them. What other pressure tactics get a premier to resign in scenario one?

She made it through the leadership review, but then she was unable to sustain through the actual caucus revolt because she kept committing errors. right so the errors right now um the the challenge that this timeline has is that the errors that are happening most of the caucus i don&#39;t think see them as errors i think most people most of the caucus recognize that the thing that is making kenny unpopular with the 13 or 15 mlas is the thing that&#39;s going to actually make him popular with albertans right stop this fucking pandemic So I think that those</div>

And maybe you&#39;ve got to be very careful with the the tone too i mean if i were jason kenney i would probably start each call with well this was a hell of a week wasn&#39;t it and i think we probably got a few things to talk about and um and you you cannot reek of weakness but you need to say like i i want to talk to you i want to hear more from you and um i you know carter i&#39;m really curious your thoughts on this i would be really hesitant about saying like i&#39;m gonna change i&#39;m gonna listen i&#39;m gonna do all of this more.

I will say, and this maybe as a bridge into Barnes and whatnot, sometimes two people storm off and say, I&#39;m going to start a parade and nobody follows. And that can happen for all sorts of different reasons. And so also don&#39;t assume that somebody is going to leave, because that&#39;s the other error you can make in this particular moment is say, well, did you see them? Do you see how they acted in that situation? And maybe they acted in a way that means you should keep your eye on them, but you shouldn&#39;t necessarily read deeply and negatively into everything.

Neither of these guys are involved, you know, would be involved with municipal politics necessarily, but there&#39;s, you know, certainly not in the two big cities.

Her message today very swiftly, as soon as this story broke late last night slash early this morning, technically, was saying this guy can barely govern. I&#39;m paraphrasing, can barely govern his party. How do we expect him to govern the province in the midst of COVID? She made a really clean example to the fact that where Todd Lowen is from, a writing that shares a name with her dad. out in Fairview that there&#39;s hospitals that don&#39;t necessarily even have enough doctors to staff them because of this party, that this is a government and a party that should be focused on Albertans, but instead they&#39;re focused on their own infighting. First of all, good message, bad message on what you heard from her and her party today. And more so than let&#39;s talk about Thursday to Sunday for her.</div>
