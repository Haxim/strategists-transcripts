What do you think of that move for Danielle Smith and even even how she couched it within the confines of that nine-minute address.

And I&#39;m just going to say that&#39;s absolutely not the case by putting in United Canada into the title. What did it cost her? Nothing. What does it get her? It gets her away from the critique that this is ultimately going to lead to the separation. So I think it was a brilliant move.

That the headline of the bill is now the message in itself. There&#39;s no mystery. There&#39;s no ambiguity. Talk to me about that change in politics that we&#39;ve seen. Do you like it from from a political messaging and strategy perspective, that we&#39;ve got so, can I say ham-fisted or heavy-handed with how blunt we are with how we name these pieces of legislation so that you don&#39;t really care what the guts of it are.

But when we were working at H&amp;K in the bitumen bubble, we didn&#39;t necessarily coin the term, but we were certainly in the room. The bitumen bubble was simply a branding exercise to ensure that we could get our message out to talk about the disadvantages of Alberta oil and gas at that particular moment in time. And it was the, what was it? It was the bubble, the difference between what the prices of West Texas and West Canada Select were. And, you know, those types of differences, like you&#39;re never going to explain to people a complex idea. idea,</div>

Then if they start to get into it, then they&#39;ll spend three minutes on it. And if we can get them to 30 minutes, then we&#39;re really cooking. And we used to equate different points of engagement. So we&#39;d write the headline for the three seconds. We&#39;d write the body for the 30 seconds. We&#39;d then get them to click a link for the next three minutes, you know, for the three minute engagement. That&#39;s what we would count that with. And if someone gave us their email address, then we counted it as a 30 minute engagement. And again, keep in mind, it wasn&#39;t actually three seconds, 30 seconds, three minutes, 30 minutes.

So the NDP&#39;s attempt at vote buying is going to be less successful than the UCP&#39;s attempt at vote buying. because this is not fiscally conservative by any stretch of the imagination she&#39;s able to do this because we&#39;ve got a 12 billion dollar surplus um because we&#39;ve got you know oil and and oil is going crazy right now and it&#39;s a jobless recovery or much less jobs uh than we would have expected to see from this type of economic activity so she&#39;s she&#39;s she&#39;s in a spot where she&#39;s flush and while at the same time she&#39;s flush she&#39;s also got people who are really struggling. So she&#39;s able to throw money into this situation. It becomes less cynical, if you will, because it actually is a difficult period of time. There is high inflation. There is lower employment than Alberta is used to in these types of economic boom periods. And it plays against her type. It plays against her own brand. Therefore, it becomes easier to say, well, this is absolutely necessary if even Danielle Smith and the fiscally conservative UCP are going to do this. When you&#39;re handing out large S on behalf of the progressive conservatives at the end, it was less impressive because we were handing out large S every opportunity we got. And people had started to write it off and say, well, of course they&#39;re handing out this, that, and the other thing. That&#39;s how they get elected. And I suspect that if the NDP was to come forward and say, we&#39;re going to do this times two, the NDP would have their own credibility affordability problems.

Talk to me about the deliberate nature of her using crisis over and over again with what we know about political leaders in terms of if they can act in crisis mode or be a leader in crisis mode, it actually provides them some runway of opportunity. Do you feel like that&#39;s what she was trying to do here? Not necessarily will or extend a crisis, but really frame that? Because That&#39;s what I kind of heard. But I&#39;m curious if you heard the same thing to try to then be like, I&#39;m a responder to this crisis.

I would love to say, I&#39;d love to know where the record debt comes from. anti-energy policies again fascinating we have produced more oil and more greenhouse gases under justin trudeau than any other prime minister in canadian history and he&#39;s not the longest serving by any stretch of the imagination so what exactly are the anti-energy policies that she&#39;s talking about because we went past the you know i think it was the red who i can&#39;t remember who put a cap in the cap of greenhouse gases was not like we&#39;re well past those caps now they&#39;ve been repealed, obviously, under Jason Kenney.

But we&#39;re now at the speech from the throne this week. We&#39;re going to head into it. What advice would you have for the government as they try to maybe work off or take the momentum of this address by Danielle Smith into the speech from the throne? Is it the same message? Are you going? Is it OK to say the same thing over and over again? Would you advise an expansion package? How would you just on broad framework related things, take the energy of the nine minutes into what I suspect is going to be a longer speech from the throne, of course, not delivered by the premier herself?</div>
