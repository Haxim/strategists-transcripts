What do you think of that move for Danielle Smith and even even how she couched it within the confines of that nine-minute address.

My intention was to level us up to be the equals to the government of Canada. So we are now I&#39;m just going to take your your language or she&#39;s trying to, you know, rip us away from the rest of Canada. And I&#39;m just going to say that&#39;s absolutely not the case by putting in United Canada into the title. What did it cost her? Nothing. What does it get her? It gets her away from the critique that this is ultimately going to lead to the separation. So I think it was a brilliant move.

Do you like it from from a political messaging and strategy perspective, that we&#39;ve got so, can I say ham-fisted or heavy-handed with how blunt we are with how we name these pieces of legislation so that you don&#39;t really care what the guts of it are.

But when we were working at H&amp;K in the bitumen bubble, we didn&#39;t necessarily coin the term, but we were certainly in the room. The bitumen bubble was simply a branding exercise to ensure that we could get our message out to talk about the disadvantages of Alberta oil and gas at that particular moment in time. And it was the, what was it? It was the bubble, the difference between what the prices of West Texas and West Canada Select were.

Then if they start to get into it, then they&#39;ll spend three minutes on it. And if we can get them to 30 minutes, then we&#39;re really cooking. And we used to equate different points of engagement. So we&#39;d write the headline for the three seconds. We&#39;d write the body for the 30 seconds. We&#39;d then get them to click a link for the next three minutes, you know, for the three minute engagement. That&#39;s what we would count that with. And if someone gave us their email address, then we counted it as a 30 minute engagement. And again, keep in mind, it wasn&#39;t actually three seconds, 30 seconds, three minutes, 30 minutes.

            <span class="text">There&#39;s an answer to this question. There is an answer to this question. It is to act outside of type. So the NDP&#39;s attempt at vote buying is going to be less successful than the UCP&#39;s attempt at vote buying. because this is not fiscally conservative by any stretch of the imagination she&#39;s able to do this because we&#39;ve got a 12 billion dollar surplus um because we&#39;ve got you know oil and and oil is going crazy right now and it&#39;s a jobless recovery or much less jobs uh than we would have expected to see from this type of economic activity so she&#39;s she&#39;s she&#39;s in a spot where she&#39;s flush and while at the same time she&#39;s flush she&#39;s also got people who are really struggling. So she&#39;s able to throw money into this situation. It becomes less cynical, if you will, because it actually is a difficult period of time. There is high inflation. There is lower employment than Alberta is used to in these types of economic boom periods. And it plays against her type. It plays against her own brand. Therefore, it becomes easier to say, well, this is absolutely necessary if even Danielle Smith and the fiscally conservative UCP are going to do this. When you&#39;re handing out large S on behalf of the progressive conservatives at the end, it was less impressive because we were handing out large S every opportunity we got. And people had started to write it off and say, well, of course they&#39;re handing out this, that, and the other thing. That&#39;s how they get elected. And I suspect that if the NDP was to come forward and say, we&#39;re going to do this times two, the NDP would have their own credibility affordability problems.

Do you feel like that&#39;s what she was trying to do here? Not necessarily will or extend a crisis, but really frame that? Because That&#39;s what I kind of heard. But I&#39;m curious if you heard the same thing to try to then be like, I&#39;m a responder to this crisis.

And so a lot of what she said throughout the course of that speech really seemed to be attempting to justify the spending of money at that particular moment, which to me suggested like I think it was telling and I think it told us something very interesting about the debate that must have gone on in government around there. And that was, is this justified or not? Certainly, because we know this is not even the idea that they originally floated of money going to everybody, which,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, give me your read on this, because my read was maybe the most cynical of the bunch, perhaps, which was, I think she&#39;s trying to keep the crisis branding alive and top of mind so that she can kind of be said solution or hero, as Corey said, the crisis. What did you kind of make of that as she repeated those words over and over again on the affordability crisis?</span>

            <span class="text">said the affordability crisis was, you know, the inflation was because of rampant spending from the federal government. That&#39;s true. We are spending more than ever before, but it&#39;s down since the pandemic height. Record debt, by what measure? I would love to say, I&#39;d love to know where the record debt comes from. anti-energy policies again fascinating we have produced more oil and more greenhouse gases under justin trudeau than any other prime minister in canadian history and he&#39;s not the longest serving by any stretch of the imagination so what exactly are the anti-energy policies that she&#39;s talking about because we went past the you know i think it was the red who i can&#39;t remember who put a cap in the cap of greenhouse gases was not like we&#39;re well past those caps now they&#39;ve been repealed, obviously, under Jason Kenney.

This is all part of the narrative. It&#39;s a crisis that doesn&#39;t exist, except in the heads of Albertans. And the reason that it exists there is because we keep being told that bad things are being done to us by this evil, evil federal government. So that&#39;s where the crisis lies.

You always love to talk in the terms of political brand. She&#39;s got control of our provincial checkbook. There&#39;s a big surplus. Would you tell her to embrace this role of this political brand of hero in a crisis? Or do you feel like, to Corey&#39;s point, that&#39;s a bit of a risk because of how multimodal in its core essence affordability and inflation actually are in terms of any one one person&#39;s ability to solve it. How would you advise her on this ability, perhaps, that she could carve out if she wanted to on embracing this hero in a crisis branding and frame that is accessible to her, perhaps?</span>

To win the next election, she&#39;s identified different groups that she believes will be, maybe, like, let&#39;s just say, I don&#39;t have any kind of special insight here, but she&#39;s identified identified certain groups that she feels she&#39;ll require in order to get to that election and to victory.

But we&#39;re now at the speech from the throne this week. We&#39;re going to head into it. What advice would you have for the government as they try to maybe work off or take the momentum of this address by Danielle Smith into the speech from the throne? Is it the same message? Are you going? Is it OK to say the same thing over and over again? Would you advise an expansion package? How would you just on broad framework related things, take the energy of the nine minutes into what I suspect is going to be a longer speech from the throne, of course, not delivered by the premier herself?</span>
