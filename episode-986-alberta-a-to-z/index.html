        <p>Zain Velji returns to set things right with this 90 minute grab-bag based on a number of recent Alberta issues: a judge ruling certain advice to cabinet from Chief Medical Officer of Health Deena Hinshaw must be made public; problems filling classrooms and hospitals; and the last days of a mail-in ballot - what should be done, when and why. The pronunciation of the letter Z guest stars.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter take on a grab-bag of political issues in Alberta that illustrate points around cabinet confidentiality, governments fighting "multi-front wars" and the dying days of mail-in ballot races. Should the public know what an official's advice to cabinet is? Will a big speech in the dying days of a mail-in ballot help you or hurt you? And is Corey drinking with the Pope again? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Alberta&#39;s chief medical officer of health can&#39;t claim cabinet confidentiality to prevent the divulging of some of her closed-door recommendations on the COVID-19 restrictions a judge has ruled. The ruling came amid a court proceeding whose plaintiffs are arguing Alberta&#39;s pandemic public health orders overseen by Dr. Dina Hinshaw violated constitutional rights. rights. The judge has asked three questions. This is Justice Barbara Romaine proposed asking Hinshaw three questions in a private hearing before deciding whether to make the answer to those questions public. And as part of the hearing evidence, the three questions, just so folks who may not have been tuned into this story, are number one, did the premier and cabinet ever direct you, Dr. Hinshaw, to impose more severe restrictions in your chief medical officer of health orders than you had recommended to them? Question two, did Cabinet ever direct you to impose more severe restrictions on particular groups such as churches, gyms, schools, and small businesses than you had recommended to them? And finally, question number three, did you ever recommend to Cabinet that restrictions should be lifted or loosened at any period of time that the recommendation was refused or ignored by Cabinet?</div>

          <div class="said">there&#39;s a lot of stuff that&#39;s happening as it relates to policy, as it relates to ramifications on workers&#39; rights. One of the things that we&#39;ve been talking about is, is there a deliberate or perhaps not so deliberate strategy here, Carter, on shortages, CB teachers facing teacher shortages as substitutes can&#39;t cover absences? We&#39;ve seen that story. We&#39;ve seen more family doctors, a dramatic drop in family physicians accepting new patients has left many Albertans without a family doctor to call their own. We&#39;re also seeing discussions between crown prosecutors in the province are ongoing with hopes of preventing a mass strike action that paralyzed the justice system.</div>

          <div class="said">The leadership review, I think, is very attractive, very sexy, a lot of political theater, palace intrigue. But there&#39;s stuff happening in Alberta, Carter. And this is one of the through lines that I think is worthy for us to discuss. So maybe I&#39;ll get your take. Do you feel like there&#39;s a deliberate strategy of scarcity or shortage that is being implemented by this UCP government?</div>

He&#39;s saying that he is tired of making excuses for the people who ask why the government is doing stuff. He feels like people are worn out. He&#39;s been a longstanding PC UCP volunteer. I want to focus less on Mr. Al Brown here, the veteran activist of the conservative movement here in Alberta. Carter, what I want to focus on is what we expect now in terms of the drumbeats, in terms of the storylines, as we look into the next 17-ish days heading into Wednesday. We have seen some stories that we&#39;ve predicted and we knew were going to happen, and we&#39;re going to see more of those. Those fall into the category of, oh my God, the world is on fire. Someone received two memberships. Someone received two voting cards, someone who did not sign up received a membership, and the media is covering those individuals. And I&#39;m not trying to minimize those, but those happen every single time. And whether those are a big deal or not, we can discuss. We see stories like this, where someone who conveniently comes out 16, 17 days before the vote says, I&#39;m done with this, cover me in an opinion column, cover my story to create a movement of momentum, proxy perhaps for the other side.

          <div class="said">No, he&#39;s better off to stay away. And Jason Kenney&#39;s, you know, better to talk to, you know, when he&#39;s making those telephone calls. Mentioned how Brian Jean couldn&#39;t win in 2015 and how Daniel Smith screwed up 2015. The United Conservative Party is not based on politicians&#39; actions. It&#39;s based on the people&#39;s actions. And that&#39;s where Jason Kenney&#39;s always represented. it um danielle and uh and brian have severely fucked this up by getting involved as quickly as they did if they just did what i suspect uh travis taves is doing and shut the hell up until such time as there&#39;s actually a leadership uh travis is going to have a much stronger position</div>
