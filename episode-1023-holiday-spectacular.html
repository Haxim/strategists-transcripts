Food prices, am I right? And wait, is that your partner watching TikTok memes after having lost all your household wealth and retirement on crypto? Life, am I right? Regardless, grab your kids, maybe some lukewarm discount eggnog and any semblance of hope you have left. Now burn it all because it&#39;s time for the Strategist Holiday Spectacular brought to you by Flair Airlines. My name is Zane Velji and with me as always... It&#39;s</span>

This episode is packed. It&#39;s packed with insights. It&#39;s packed with a year of review. But it is also prescient. Do you know why, Corey? Because it predicts the future. This is the episode that predicts how white Christmas will be. And let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, how white that is right for the 12th year in a row we&#39;re going to start off with our annual strategist holiday spectacular tradition now if you&#39;re new to the show welcome but cory you know the roles this is a 10 question quiz for steven carter oh god he has a 10 question quiz every year to judge how white he is yeah the</span>

Rooted in anger, rooted in frustration, and rooted in this idea that they can just take back the country through any crazy reading of the Constitution, crazy reading of the Bill of Rights. And you can sit there like an executive at Air Canada scowling at Flair Airlines and say, yeah, but they don&#39;t even have peanuts on their flight. But the reality is, it landed. It&#39;s there, it&#39;s here. It&#39;s certainly something that we&#39;re going to be contending with going into 2022. It has changed our politics fundamentally. It has ended careers. It has launched new careers in politics. You bet the convoy landed. Do you need to like it? No, but you got to acknowledge it.</span>

The fact that he doesn&#39;t think it landed is because it is to him just theoretical. To a family like mine, it was massively substantive. You know, if you have children in childcare in a province like Alberta, it has absolutely changed the game. That&#39;s true in provinces across the country here. it is it is by far the most material thing government has done in my day-to-day life in the past you know five to ten years and um that&#39;s not to say government hasn&#39;t done other things this is just we&#39;re talking about magnitude here of like the cost of a mortgage has been reduced from a large families you know if you&#39;ve got a large young family this has been such a game changer carter</span>

            <span class="text">carter he says that because he&#39;s got like 20 25 children but that&#39;s not the norm i think it it gets better as things move along, which does not minimize the impact that it&#39;s had so far. I think it&#39;s just going to be when you have a full year of it, like when you get that mortgage level back, it&#39;s really going to be something. It&#39;s going to allow a lot of people to go to work and it&#39;s going to have tremendous impact for families in the future tense.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s illustrative of a bigger problem in politics. Politicians do this all of the time. As soon as an opponent makes a critique, their first instinct is to dismiss and deny the critique. If they had looked across the world, if they had looked at every other jurisdiction, if they had just taken kind of an honest assessment of things, they would have said, yeah, okay, this is going to be a problem. And I think the liberals spent a good quarter, like a good three months, pretending that the cost of living increases we&#39;re seeing was not a big deal, no problem at all. and this was consistent with other activities of theirs around supply chain challenges we&#39;ve had as a country getting medicine for kids not a big deal overblown just pictures of empty shelves we said this at the time and i think it was actually even in 2021 technically so probably outside of this year&#39;s scope but there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there was a time where you&#39;d go to the grocery store and there would be empty shelves were they all empty no so it was ridiculous to pretend they were were they all full no they they were not, right? And so what we saw was partisans just jump in on cost of living and just find every way they could to say, you don&#39;t have a problem here. Oh, your mortgage is not going to be too big. Oh, the cost of food is not going to be too bad. But people are feeling it, you know, people are looking at what a gallon of milk costs, and they&#39;re saying this is too expensive. And the liberals, by denying it for a few months, gave a few months of the issue being entirely entirely framed by their denials, which look out of touch now, and Polyev&#39;s attacks, which look accurate, prescient, and on point. And so that was the one that I think both had the most consequence, the most real consequence in the year for real people, and also most likely to affect the next election, if the liberals do decide to do something as foolhardy as pull the trigger early.</span>

And moves on to our next segment, the Flair Airlines rare perfect landing. Corey Hogan, here&#39;s how it works. I&#39;m going to give you a list of what I consider to be the rare perfect landings in politics this year. You tell me which one takes the cake, which one deserves the award.

Peer on cost of living, peer on data mining. Jagmeet on the NDP-Liberal deal, QP Ontario. I&#39;ve kept it pretty domestic. Daniel Smith, you come from behind victory. Emergency Act and Trudeau in his testimony. Carter, Corey goes with Vladimir Zelensky as leader of Ukraine, 300 plus days in that war. We forget that was all in 2022.

And I&#39;m going to kind of stick with the domestic side that you&#39;ve laid out, Zane. I&#39;m going to give an honorary mention to Justin Trudeau and the Emergency Act.

But while something is fleeting like the passport issue, which Corey mentioned earlier, this cost of living issue has legs.

            <span class="text">Eby. Give me why. I&#39;m taking Eby because I think I think ultimately, well, A, he&#39;s not coming up for re-election next year. So you get to be premier for longer, right? B, you are much more in sync with your province. You&#39;re not going to have an easy run. Like, I think actually that it&#39;s going to be quite a competitive race in BC. But, you know, give credit to Horgan. He has really recreated the BC landscape to the point where the NDP look more like the default governing party of BC than the liberals do.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

The thing that Danielle Smith has is a very short runway and a very uncertain future. Now, she could very well win.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And she probably has better odds than a lot of people are giving her, simply because of how the math works out between the cities and rural areas. And, you know, you can only win so much of Edmonton before you get all of the seats And every other vote is additive, right? You can only win so much in downtown Calgary and it&#39;s not getting another seat. But that said, she is deeply unpopular. She is going to have to deal with her caucus if she continues to be deeply unpopular, even before the election. And</span>

The public, in my opinion, I&#39;d be curious to hear Carter&#39;s too, is much more forgiving of previous incompetencies than previous corruptions. And if they perceive Mary Ng as being corrupt, that is going to be very difficult to shake. And that&#39;s the kind of thing that dogs you for a long time.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. This is what&#39;s interesting. Can you expand on that a bit? Because I think there&#39;s a lot of conflation that people have, and perhaps even a lot of confusion to say, does that mean that the NDP are doing out-of-type or, as Carter would say, non-type policies? Is that what this is for both parties, Daniel Smith or Jagmeet Singh? Or is it something different, Corey, to your point about the type of wine you&#39;re bringing to the party? Expand on that. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about. It&#39;s what you&#39;re putting in the window. It&#39;s what you&#39;re allowing the rest of your party to put in the window as well.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, let&#39;s put it it this way. Taxing the rich, pretty popular. Spending it on social programs, pretty popular. Raising a minimum wage, even a federal minimum wage that doesn&#39;t affect a lot of people, pretty popular. Do these things. Build an overall package of you being there for, you know, everyday Canadians and assisting them with the various things that are going on in their lives. Things that are less popular, you know, anytime you take a strong position on animal cruelty. Listen, I&#39;m a vegetarian, but I&#39;m going to tell you right now that shit doesn&#39;t fly with with a lot of people. You can consider as well, your, your, you know, social justice, social equity, pick the ones that really matter to you and consider the ones that are going to come off to many Canadians, even if you feel them sincerely as a performative or out of step with where they are. Focus on the things that people universally agree with, that are very, very popular, and not the stuff that seems different and scary to a lot of like the, you know, the median voters in areas Areas like Brampton that are voting for Patrick Brown, areas like Hamilton that are voting for Andrea Horvath, you know, you&#39;ve got to find, you&#39;ve got to find a way to just pick what&#39;s working for you and amplify that rather than diluting it with a bunch of other stuff, which is going to come off as much less popular. and you know i mean it&#39;s so difficult to have this conversation without actually just sounding like an asshole or even saying things i don&#39;t agree with right but i think for example about how at the ndp federal convention how badly derailed they got because i think there wasn&#39;t like a sign language interpreter for a while do you remember this i do i do yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah this wasn&#39;t yeah i remember this a bit yeah yeah and so it&#39;s important accessibility is super important important. But what I found, you know, there as well is like, this was not an expectation anybody had of like a political convention five years ago, 10 years ago, maybe you should have. But you are the NDP, you are the vanguard. And you&#39;ve got to think about how the, you know, the bleeding edge is scary to people. And so think about the things that people have thought about and put those in the window and be very conscious about the type of party you&#39;re presenting yourself as.</span>

Two things that are for the 80%. I think often what people think is that that means diluting what you believe in, even if you sit on one of the polls, so to speak, because there&#39;s still things that people on the left and people on the right believe in that could be popular with a large swath of people.
