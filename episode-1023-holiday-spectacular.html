        <p>Like last year's eggnog you just found at the fridge, our annual Holiday Spectacular is a tradition that only gets better with age. Hear Zain, Stephen and Corey talk about the worst political delays, best political landings, the things they liked, the things they didn't - plus the ever popular political eulogies for those whose careers ended in 2022.</p><blockquote><p><em>Check the roof for reindeer and break out your performance turtlenecks because it's time again for The Strategists to unpack the year that was in their annual Holiday Spectacular. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the best and the worst of the year, write political obituaries and talk about the year-to-come in this regular-length special. Our discount airline sponsor* picks the topics while Zain Velji keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Is that you carving a turkey? Amazing work there. Why are you carving it so early? It&#39;s not even Christmas. And man, that turkey probably cost you more than it did last year. Food prices, am I right? And wait, is that your partner watching TikTok memes after having lost all your household wealth and retirement on crypto? Life, am I right? Regardless, grab your kids, maybe some lukewarm discount eggnog and any semblance of hope you have left. Now burn it all because it&#39;s time for the Strategist Holiday Spectacular brought to you by Flair Airlines. My name is Zane Velji and with me as always... It&#39;s</div>

This episode is packed. It&#39;s packed with insights. It&#39;s packed with a year of review. But it is also prescient. Do you know why, Corey? Because it predicts the future.

Rooted in anger, rooted in frustration, and rooted in this idea that they can just take back the country through any crazy reading of the Constitution, crazy reading of the Bill of Rights. And you can sit there like an executive at Air Canada scowling at Flair Airlines and say, yeah, but they don&#39;t even have peanuts on their flight. But the reality is, it landed. It&#39;s there, it&#39;s here. It&#39;s certainly something that we&#39;re going to be contending with going into 2022. It has changed our politics fundamentally. It has ended careers. It has launched new careers in politics. You bet the convoy landed. Do you need to like it? No, but you got to acknowledge it.</div>

The fact that he doesn&#39;t think it landed is because it is to him just theoretical. To a family like mine, it was massively substantive. You know, if you have children in childcare in a province like Alberta, it has absolutely changed the game. That&#39;s true in provinces across the country here. it is it is by far the most material thing government has done in my day-to-day life in the past you know five to ten years and um that&#39;s not to say government hasn&#39;t done other things this is just we&#39;re talking about magnitude here of like the cost of a mortgage has been reduced from a large families you know if you&#39;ve got a large young family this has been such a game changer carter</div>

Or finally, Corey, was it the Ontario NDP and Liberals in their delay in defining and going after Doug Ford aggressively? I&#39;ll do a summary for you again. Trudeau on the Emergencies Act, Trudeau on cost of living, the CPC on Patrick Brown, Jason Kenney getting flat-footed, Stephen Eby getting flat-footed, or the Ontario NDP and and the Ontario Liberals delaying in trying to define Doug Ford, allowing him to sweep an even larger majority. Corey, you can give me an other, or you can give me one of these. Which one is it for you?</div>

          <div class="said">it&#39;s illustrative of a bigger problem in politics. Politicians do this all of the time. As soon as an opponent makes a critique, their first instinct is to dismiss and deny the critique. If they had looked across the world, if they had looked at every other jurisdiction, if they had just taken kind of an honest assessment of things, they would have said, yeah, okay, this is going to be a problem. And I think the liberals spent a good quarter, like a good three months, pretending that the cost of living increases we&#39;re seeing was not a big deal, no problem at all. and this was consistent with other activities of theirs around supply chain challenges we&#39;ve had as a country getting medicine for kids not a big deal overblown just pictures of empty shelves we said this at the time and i think it was actually even in 2021 technically so probably outside of this year&#39;s scope but there</div>

          <div class="said">there was a time where you&#39;d go to the grocery store and there would be empty shelves were they all empty no so it was ridiculous to pretend they were were they all full no they they were not, right? And so what we saw was partisans just jump in on cost of living and just find every way they could to say, you don&#39;t have a problem here. Oh, your mortgage is not going to be too big. Oh, the cost of food is not going to be too bad. But people are feeling it, you know, people are looking at what a gallon of milk costs, and they&#39;re saying this is too expensive. And the liberals, by denying it for a few months, gave a few months of the issue being entirely entirely framed by their denials, which look out of touch now, and Polyev&#39;s attacks, which look accurate, prescient, and on point. And so that was the one that I think both had the most consequence, the most real consequence in the year for real people, and also most likely to affect the next election, if the liberals do decide to do something as foolhardy as pull the trigger early.</div>

Everybody can see it. And he represents a, you know, a power block in the United States that is growing, not shrinking.

The public, in my opinion, I&#39;d be curious to hear Carter&#39;s too, is much more forgiving of previous incompetencies than previous corruptions. And if they perceive Mary Ng as being corrupt, that is going to be very difficult to shake. And that&#39;s the kind of thing that dogs you for a long time.

          <div class="said">Okay, let&#39;s put it it this way. Taxing the rich, pretty popular. Spending it on social programs, pretty popular. Raising a minimum wage, even a federal minimum wage that doesn&#39;t affect a lot of people, pretty popular. Do these things. Build an overall package of you being there for, you know, everyday Canadians and assisting them with the various things that are going on in their lives. Things that are less popular, you know, anytime you take a strong position on animal cruelty. Listen, I&#39;m a vegetarian, but I&#39;m going to tell you right now that shit doesn&#39;t fly with with a lot of people. You can consider as well, your, your, you know, social justice, social equity, pick the ones that really matter to you and consider the ones that are going to come off to many Canadians, even if you feel them sincerely as a performative or out of step with where they are. Focus on the things that people universally agree with, that are very, very popular, and not the stuff that seems different and scary to a lot of like the, you know, the median voters in areas Areas like Brampton that are voting for Patrick Brown, areas like Hamilton that are voting for Andrea Horvath, you know, you&#39;ve got to find, you&#39;ve got to find a way to just pick what&#39;s working for you and amplify that rather than diluting it with a bunch of other stuff, which is going to come off as much less popular. and you know i mean it&#39;s so difficult to have this conversation without actually just sounding like an asshole or even saying things i don&#39;t agree with right but i think for example about how at the ndp federal convention how badly derailed they got because i think there wasn&#39;t like a sign language interpreter for a while do you remember this i do i do yeah</div>

But what I found, you know, there as well is like, this was not an expectation anybody had of like a political convention five years ago, 10 years ago, maybe you should have. But you are the NDP, you are the vanguard. And you&#39;ve got to think about how the, you know, the bleeding edge is scary to people.

Two things that are for the 80%. I think often what people think is that that means diluting what you believe in, even if you sit on one of the polls, so to speak, because there&#39;s still things that people on the left and people on the right believe in that could be popular with a large swath of people.
