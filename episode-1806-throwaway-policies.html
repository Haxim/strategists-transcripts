So I&#39;m happy to move this on to our first segment, Carter, the joy of giving. Yeah, Stephen Carter, here&#39;s the thing.</span>

            <span class="text">You for a long time have said that politics is all about giving goodies to people, what you can give them, right? Whether it be a tax break, whether it be a new service, whether it&#39;s micro-targeted, Carter, to the the campaign to the specific constituency or riding. We&#39;ll give you a community hall, whatever you need. We&#39;re going to give you shit. Well, Carter, are we turning a corner? Have we actually too simplistically said that that&#39;s what politics is about in election season? Because Rishi Sunak, Carter, will introduce mandatory national service for those 18 and older if he wins the election on July 4th. This is comprising of community participation, potential military service, volunteering your time, not getting from the government, but giving back to your country. Carter, have we got it wrong the whole time as strategists that this is all about giving to people rather than receiving from them in an election season?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think that Rishi Sunak stands probably as the greatest campaigner of our time. time uh and as as one of the greatest campaigners of our time i am uh open to rewriting the rule book and saying you know what it is what you take from the electorate that is the most important thing and if you can take an 18 year old&#39;s first years of adulthood uh well first of all i&#39;m i&#39;m for it uh i&#39;m for it because i&#39;m in my 50s and no one&#39;s going to come after me and ask me for my for a year of my time. So it feels pretty great. I&#39;m actually really interested to see the cynical nature of this. Will older people say, yeah, that sounds great. And younger people who weren&#39;t going to vote for the Tories anyway, just go running away from Rishi Sunak as fast as humanly possible. This does, though, fit into one of our categories of giving someone something.</span>

This could have been a policy that the prime minister, because he is the prime minister, have announced at any period in time if he wanted to roll out national service. But is there any part of you that as a commentator, but also as a strategist says, yeah, there&#39;s like a cynical motivation that older people, like the simple math as we&#39;ve described it politically, that older people will probably relish in this or may even like it. But is there a part of you that says, maybe people are just wanting to get involved and maybe a call to service a call to give a call to uh you know uh put yourself out there rather than be on the receiving end might actually be part of a political playbook going forward well</span>

            <span class="text">Seems kind of haphazard in how it&#39;s been announced, but I don&#39;t want to get into that, so to speak. What do you think of, in a voting period, talking about who can vote but not in this period? Like, I think that&#39;s so interesting to me, like, from a political perspective, because as our politics here are driving more towards mortgages and housing and young people unlike those policy issues, this is looking more at like rights and responsibilities. And I may be painting too much of a reductive picture of what&#39;s happening in the UK. And just to be clear, we&#39;re just one week into what they&#39;re up to. But I&#39;m curious how you see those parallels between what we&#39;re shaping up for for our young people versus what they&#39;re shaping up for over there.</span>

            <span class="text">you know, I have conflicting feelings about the base issue.

I, you know, I don&#39;t have a great system for it, but I almost wonder if there shouldn&#39;t be a period where you kind of like your driver&#39;s license you kind of validate that you can vote and you know and it&#39;s automatic at 25 or something like that when the human brain is fully developed but maybe something like that but i do think that there is something long-term thinking about starmer doing this like it looks like he&#39;s going to win this election massively certainly we do see a correlation between getting old and voting conservative and a kind of a reverse correlation where where labor does better with younger demographics and he might be thinking you do this without mentioning it during election you&#39;re going to get crushed you&#39;ve mentioned it in the election though you&#39;ve got a mandate to do it and this is probably long term to the advantage of labor uh because you know uh there tends to be a lot of passion about changing the world uh when you&#39;re younger you know when you&#39;re when you&#39;re 18 17 you want to change the world you</span>

Here&#39;s what&#39;s interesting. Do you see either of these as outright political winners, or are these just wedge issues to get attention? And what I find interesting about them is that as our country trends towards spending spending billions of dollars and policy promises – Trudeau&#39;s most recent budget is an interesting one – that what really seems to be getting the headlines – and</span>

Because you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s not for the folks that will ultimately create the bulk of the undecideds or those that are ultimately going to vote.

            <span class="text">Corey articulated it just a second ago. Both of these proposals fit into core values of the organizations that they&#39;re representing. Right. So when Labour talks about giving more people the right to vote and giving young people the right to vote, it fits into their core values as an organization. organization when the conservatives are talking about service compulsory service it fits into the core values of who they are as an organization that is a value play to base that isn&#39;t changing anybody&#39;s vote but it is ensuring that the base knows that they&#39;ve been heard and i bet you that it&#39;s setting up something that&#39;s going to be far more middle that&#39;s going to be you know something that um is is maybe not loved by the base quite so much because it&#39;s going to be something designed to win people who aren&#39;t paying attention.</span>

These are both policies that support the general feel you get from these organizations. And in the case of Rishi Sunak&#39;s, it&#39;s also kind of a shocking one that shocks people out of their stupid, like it&#39;s not a good policy. Forcing people to do things is not how you create love of country. That&#39;s how you create resentment.

If you&#39;re the liberals at this point, I mean, yes, he&#39;s, you know, the neutral speaker, but one of the reasons he&#39;s getting these votes is because he&#39;s not seen as a neutral speaker.

            <span class="text">well Well, look, I agree with the core of what he spilled all over aisle five here. But two things. One is I would say that as a party leader, you have to, the way you phrase it, you got to think about it a little bit, right? Like you can&#39;t have carnage in the party amongst the organizers. But I will say, and this is the second thing I wanted to say, this is a self-healing wound. Like this is the remarkable thing about political parties, because what happens is, A, as Stephen said, somebody lost, and so they&#39;re immediately less relevant. and the person who won has a massive incentive to defend you and to defend the party and to defend the process and they will and they will do that on the riding level without too much from you at all right like they&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll mend those bridges and they&#39;ll have the coffees and they&#39;ll hear the people out and they&#39;ll say oh the unpleasantness is behind us but you know it was all good but i want you on my team and so it self heals in that way the other way it self heals is an election comes and the minute an election comes the person who&#39;s complaining all</span>

This is a long-standing, nearly three-decade liberal seat, of course, with former Minister Bennett holding that seat for a long time. They have Leslie Church, who we&#39;ve talked about in the past, a former chief of staff to Christopher Freeland. This is someone who is carrying the liberal banner in this by-election. The Conservatives have Don Stewart, financial services worker. The NDP announced in April that Amrit Par, who&#39;s a non-profit director, is going to be serving as their candidate, so to speak. The reason I focus in on this one, Corey, is that we&#39;re already hearing rumblings that this longstanding, ironclad,</span>
