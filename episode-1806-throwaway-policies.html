        <div class="desc"><p>With the help of eric from Discord, The Board of The Strategists Media Corporation constructs <a href="https://x.com/strategistspod/status/1795608472811454486" target="_blank">the perfect Alberta NDP leadership ballot</a>. The gang then continue their UK election talk and check in on how worried Canadian politicians - and <a href="https://www.westernstandard.news/alberta/carter-raises-ire-of-radio-host-for-dissing-nenshi-opponents-in-ndp-race/54779" target="_blank">known Naheed Nenshi lover Stephen Carter</a> - should be.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Sunak and Starmer's contrasting national service and youth franchise policies, and assess how worried politicians should be on a grab bag of files from continued non-confidence votes in the Speaker to the Toronto St. Paul's by-election to reports that some on the right of the Alberta UCP are sharpening their knives and coming after... Danielle Smith? Is there political gain in asking people to give up something and be part of something? Should Pierre Poilievre be concerned about claims that nomination contests are subject to meddling and dirty tricks? And what does Eric from Discord get for his work in creating the perfect Alberta NDP leadership ballot? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">You for a long time have said that politics is all about giving goodies to people, what you can give them, right? Whether it be a tax break, whether it be a new service, whether it&#39;s micro-targeted, Carter, to the the campaign to the specific constituency or riding. We&#39;ll give you a community hall, whatever you need. We&#39;re going to give you shit. Well, Carter, are we turning a corner? Have we actually too simplistically said that that&#39;s what politics is about in election season? Because Rishi Sunak, Carter, will introduce mandatory national service for those 18 and older if he wins the election on July 4th. This is comprising of community participation, potential military service, volunteering your time, not getting from the government, but giving back to your country. Carter, have we got it wrong the whole time as strategists that this is all about giving to people rather than receiving from them in an election season?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think that Rishi Sunak stands probably as the greatest campaigner of our time. time uh and as as one of the greatest campaigners of our time i am uh open to rewriting the rule book and saying you know what it is what you take from the electorate that is the most important thing and if you can take an 18 year old&#39;s first years of adulthood uh well first of all i&#39;m i&#39;m for it uh i&#39;m for it because i&#39;m in my 50s and no one&#39;s going to come after me and ask me for my for a year of my time. So it feels pretty great. I&#39;m actually really interested to see the cynical nature of this. Will older people say, yeah, that sounds great. And younger people who weren&#39;t going to vote for the Tories anyway, just go running away from Rishi Sunak as fast as humanly possible. This does, though, fit into one of our categories of giving someone something.</div>

But is there any part of you that as a commentator, but also as a strategist says, yeah, there&#39;s like a cynical motivation that older people, like the simple math as we&#39;ve described it politically, that older people will probably relish in this or may even like it. But is there a part of you that says, maybe people are just wanting to get involved and maybe a call to service a call to give a call to uh you know uh put yourself out there rather than be on the receiving end might actually be part of a political playbook going forward well</div>

What do you think of, in a voting period, talking about who can vote but not in this period? Like, I think that&#39;s so interesting to me, like, from a political perspective, because as our politics here are driving more towards mortgages and housing and young people unlike those policy issues, this is looking more at like rights and responsibilities. And I may be painting too much of a reductive picture of what&#39;s happening in the UK. And just to be clear, we&#39;re just one week into what they&#39;re up to. But I&#39;m curious how you see those parallels between what we&#39;re shaping up for for our young people versus what they&#39;re shaping up for over there.</div>

These are policies that de-risk you, that fill time, that generate conversation. I like all of that. Go one step further. For which audience? Because you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s not for the folks that will ultimately create the bulk of the undecideds or those that are ultimately going to vote. For which audience is this for at the beginning? And then Corey, you have a take at this. Who is this for? What&#39;s the strategy here? Corey</div>

          <div class="said">Corey articulated it just a second ago. Both of these proposals fit into core values of the organizations that they&#39;re representing. Right. So when Labour talks about giving more people the right to vote and giving young people the right to vote, it fits into their core values as an organization. organization when the conservatives are talking about service compulsory service it fits into the core values of who they are as an organization that is a value play to base that isn&#39;t changing anybody&#39;s vote but it is ensuring that the base knows that they&#39;ve been heard and i bet you that it&#39;s setting up something that&#39;s going to be far more middle that&#39;s going to be you know something that um is is maybe not loved by the base quite so much because it&#39;s going to be something designed to win people who aren&#39;t paying attention.</div>

But I will say, and this is the second thing I wanted to say, this is a self-healing wound. Like this is the remarkable thing about political parties, because what happens is, A, as Stephen said, somebody lost, and so they&#39;re immediately less relevant. and the person who won has a massive incentive to defend you and to defend the party and to defend the process and they will and they will do that on the riding level without too much from you at all right like they&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll mend those bridges and they&#39;ll have the coffees and they&#39;ll hear the people out and they&#39;ll say oh the unpleasantness is behind us but you know it was all good but i want you on my team and so it self heals in that way the other way it self heals is an election comes and the minute an election comes the person who&#39;s complaining all</div>
