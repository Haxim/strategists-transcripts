            <span class="text">Fantastic. Thank you so much. Both parties wrapped up their virtual conventions this Sunday. The Liberals actually had a convention speech Saturday with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he focused most of his attacks on the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois. The three-day gathering focused on campaign readiness and didn&#39;t, well, Prime Minister Trudeau didn&#39;t necessarily talk about election timing. A lot of it was about election readiness, framing the timetable and the rationale for going to the polls. The NDP also had a three-day event, which was plagued with hiccups and frustrations, technical and, I&#39;d say, ideological, perhaps. The NDP sought to unite their grassroots around a message of fair treatment, financial relief, and liberal failures during the pandemic. I&#39;m going to break both of these down, and I&#39;m going to break them down on three things.</span>

We&#39;ll then go into tech because I really want to get your sense as to how much the NDP&#39;s tech failures and hiccups are going to cost them, especially as they try to go after young people as a stated demographic. And then Trudeau. We&#39;ll talk about Trudeau&#39;s speech on the liberal side, and we&#39;ll talk about Jagmeet Singh&#39;s attacks against Trudeau and testing some lines. So let&#39;s start with tone. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you, and let&#39;s start with the liberals first. The tone of the liberal convention seemed to be very strongly a love-in, you know, versus perhaps the NDP and the conservatives where there was friction and fractures within the party. Almost everything seemed frictionless. It seemed pre-programmed. It seemed like an AGM where you&#39;re reading from the minutes, so to speak. But beyond that, what did you kind of make of the tone that you saw from the liberals this weekend?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, you raise an interesting point right off the bat, Zane, and it&#39;s something that&#39;s worth unpacking. And I think it&#39;s part of why the liberal convention went smoother than the NDP convention or the conservative convention is that there&#39;s nobody who&#39;s too liberal, right? Quote unquote, too liberal. The extreme of the liberal party is what? Extremely moderate? I mean, that&#39;s almost the definition of the organization. Pragmatism is sort of baked into the DNA of the Liberal Party. It&#39;s about calibrating towards where the people are or where you believe they&#39;re going to be. And disagreements tend to be along the lines of, do</span>

Like I suspect that some of the things that the NDP did that we look at right now and say like, holy cow, it&#39;s outside of the mainstream for different reasons, I guess is my point in any of these situations. But, you know, the fundamental problem is the same. There is a group of people who, you know, are more pure in their ideology and that&#39;s where kind of those policy rubs come from. But with the NDP, there&#39;s an extra one here. And I know we&#39;re supposed to be talking about the liberals first, but I want to throw it on the table. Let&#39;s just do tone</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, okay, let me ask you this. The reason I would start with the liberals on tone is I kind of want to talk a bit about policy, too. Were you surprised that so much of the left-wing policy—and we could talk about its meaningfulness as it relates to both budget and finding itself in the campaign platform— but around, let&#39;s accept the Green New Deal, let&#39;s accept UBI, that these things that are real leftward march were adopted so almost unanimously by the party without much trauma.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">performatively more left-wing than it was, say, 20 years ago. But you do have to keep in mind that the Liberal Party policy Policy conventions are often where you see those things adopted well in advance of when they become mainstream party policies. Think about decriminalization of marijuana. I think that like the University of Calgary Liberal Club got that thing passed in one of the conventions in the early, early 2000s. And of course, it became policy 15 years plus later. But quite often, the Liberal Party policy convention is a bit of a vanguard. And it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s the role it&#39;s played there. And it&#39;s not as contentious in that sense as it is in the NDP because I think the Liberal Party has a broader cultural – I mean cultural to the Liberal Party, understanding that the leader is going to pick and choose what they think is right for the moment. And again, that goes back to that pragmatism baked into the Liberal brand, which love it or hate it, but it&#39;s – We&#39;ll let you pick</span>

But again, I would stress that that proof point that the NDP throw at the liberals are exactly why I wouldn&#39;t read too, too much into UBI all of a sudden getting such an easy ride at convention.

I mean, that&#39;s a very different situation. So I don&#39;t think that we can just sort of lump it all together and say that&#39;s a challenge. The other thing is the</span>

            <span class="text">every party has that person who always goes up to the microphone on every item. The big difference here, and one that I think we glossed past too quickly, is that these are virtual conventions. And if you are in the media box in an in-person convention and Jesse McClain goes up and says, shame on you, shut this whole convention down, and you just hear the majority groan from the room that&#39;s like, oh my god, okay, just stop it, right? And it becomes clear what the sense of the room is. And when you have 95% support on certain things, that groan becomes like there&#39;s no disputing that this is just a lone person standing up voicing an opinion that is in no way, shape, or form either the majority or even a strong minority opinion.</span>

Maybe they should have made more use of like very rapidly, maybe thumbs up, thumbs down, almost dial group style. I don&#39;t know.

            <span class="text">That&#39;s a great point, Corey. And you&#39;ve already bled into a bit of the technology. So, Carter, I&#39;ll start with you on that. The tech differences between the two, right? Almost one seemed to be fine, you know, because, you know, it was fine. The other, you know, seemed to have that commentary where the equivalency of every voice seemed to reign supreme. Captioning, ASL stuff that Corey&#39;s mentioned. People jumping on the mic saying, we don&#39;t have enough time for debate. bait, people then taking to social media, saying, you know, this doesn&#39;t work, like people don&#39;t kind of get off fucking mute, like just being pissed off at their own party. The lingering effects on the technology side is what I wanted to start with for the NDP. Do you feel like they&#39;re significant? Do you feel like they say anything beyond this weekend? Or is this just blow past it? This isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t indicative of anything.</span>

Because I want to say that the next time there&#39;s a policy convention, the next time there&#39;s a big get-together, it will be in person. I want to believe that. I want to believe that this technological solution is only a one-time thing. My fear is that the technological solution is probably a lot cheaper.</span>

These kind of technologies that are, you know, we&#39;ll just use Zoom or we&#39;ll just use, you know, a broadcasting platform. That&#39;s not going to cut it. You need to have, as Corey was saying, the ability to do an instant poll in the room. You need to have the ability to do all kinds of different speaking arrangements and broadcasts and things like that. You know, if you&#39;re just broadcasting using rather simple tools,</span>

His speech, you know, 20-some minutes, a Q&amp;A, sit down thereafter, after. Backdrop, pictures of Jagmeet Singh, tiled with Jagmeet Singh for NDP, sort of leadership signs, all on a digital backdrop. I want to start with the Trudeau speech first, both from what you saw from the staging and the stagecraft, which we always talk about and we love talking about, and then the content. You know, for bringing some listeners in on this, the content was largely about Aaron O&#39;Toole, the future of this country, what the liberals have done during the pandemic, how they&#39;ve helped Canadians, talking about O&#39;Toole being disconnected, not necessarily having real-world solutions for real-world problems. Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you on this. Trudeau, let&#39;s start here first. Overall thoughts on what he said and how the stagecraft was while he said it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I disagree with you that it was largely focused on O&#39;Toole. I think it was focused almost equally on the Bloc Quebecois, maybe slightly less weight, but there was basically two messages that were used depending on who was</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was the target of that particular section of the speech, right? With O&#39;Toole, it was this idea that they aren&#39;t actually behind the supports that kept you safe, right? They would have been much happier not giving those supports, look at all of these various comments. and um and then they also talked about the denial of climate change right or or the suggestion that there was a denial of climate change um for the sections that were more well that were in french and more towards the you know quebec audience they talked about the bloc quebecois not really ever having the ability to make changes and that the liberals were the ones that actually delivered for quebec and by the way did you know eight out of ten dollar i think it was eight out of ten dollars spent during the pandemic were spent by the federal government not by the provinces so So they took a couple of different message tracks. They overlapped on a couple of components around the pandemic, because, of course, that makes sense. It&#39;s not, you know, the conservatives, they don&#39;t want to do this for you. The Bloc Quebecois, they throw out ideas they can never do, but we&#39;re the ones who actually deliver. And also the Quebec audience and the English audience both got versions of the, I should say the French audience and the English audience, both got versions of the conservatives</span>

Let&#39;s talk before we get into the materials and his his attacks against Trudeau and really trying to make clear to Canadians that we are not the same. They may try to think that they&#39;re us, but they are not us. What did you like about what you saw, Carter?

            <span class="text">the liberals are meanwhile diving in with both feet into your world. So you&#39;ve got to look at where this exists. And things like wealth tax, very popular with the public, but no party seems to have the guts to go a little more aggressively on them. It&#39;s not just wealth tax, though. There&#39;s a number of things you could look at on the environmental front. There&#39;s a number of things you could look at in terms of, you know, labor supports, child care, all of those things that the liberals are dipping their toe into. And you can say, hey, I&#39;m on the other end of the pool already here, guys. But that&#39;s not really what came out of this convention. And instead, it tended to be a lot of like the culture war stuff. We talked a lot about, you know, the various concepts that were floating around the convention. But you could put together an economic policy that Canadians, at least at first blush, would look at, and we know from polling, would have majority support. So that would be my recommendation. The other thing I would say is the Alberta Liberals, you know, that ship was full of holes and I got it to port. I got all those incumbents reelected. They just took it out in a storm four years later, Carter. That&#39;s not my fault.</span>

But he took a different tack. Instead, he said, yeah, I agree. We&#39;ve got a lot of learning to do. We&#39;ve got to get better about this. Both of the presidential candidates felt that they could take a knockout of the convention. And the convention wasn&#39;t great. But the idea is really about controlling the story coming out of it. And unfortunately, the contrast between the Liberal convention and the NDP convention. If you&#39;re the NDP, it&#39;s brutal. It is a brutal contrast. The Liberals had Mark Carney and a relatively seamless display of progressive chops, bringing out some policies that actually, in many ways, look far more ambitious than what the NDP put forward. And if you&#39;re the NDP, or if you&#39;re looking at the NDP, it looks like it&#39;s chaos. They can&#39;t organize a virtual convention. Why would you trust them with a country? Look at all of the infighting. They don&#39;t even know what the hell they want to be. Look at all of the drama. And so, not great. Not great, guys.</span>

Right strategy to kind of broadcast that and put that out there? And is it the right group?

            <span class="text">you can if you can run a pretty seamless show it affords you more options because one of the things you will note in any convention that has a vocal group is you have given them a club to hit you with on on process if you don&#39;t do your process anything other than flawlessly right so even if uh you if say you are a person who&#39;s just opposed to jagmeet sing right yeah let&#39;s just use this example here and uh you can&#39;t manage to get your fellow conventioneers to care about the thing that you oppose him for say it&#39;s a policy on israel say whatever yeah yeah</span>

            <span class="text">ultimately don&#39;t you think the ndp wish that they had none of these technology flaws. Like if none of them existed, it would be an entirely different narrative coming out of this weekend, entirely different, because you wouldn&#39;t have had the people standing up making the complaints about the policy, or sorry, the process, which leaves you with what? Which leaves you with almost unanimity on all of the policy things that have gone on. That would have been a much better result for the NDP.</span>

            <span class="text">a much better leader than Andrew Scheer for the conservatives to win the whole kit, the whole caboodle. So I don&#39;t know why people are so quick to write the guy off. I actually think when people get to know him, when they start hearing the story, when they&#39;re kind of forced to deal with his moderation and he&#39;s not the caricature that the liberals are drawing of him, it&#39;s going to be a totally different ballgame. I mean, I think Aaron O&#39;Toole, if you asked me to put money on it right now, you&#39;d have to give me odds, but they wouldn&#39;t have to be big odds that Aaron O&#39;Toole is the next prime minister</span>
