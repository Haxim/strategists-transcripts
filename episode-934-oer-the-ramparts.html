        <p>On this July 4, Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter check in on our southern neighbours, "them the people", before diving into federal election speculation. Which parties are well positioned for a summer election and which would be in trouble? Why are Californians so recall happy? And do Stephen and Corey even listen to the question? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions (and ignored scales) and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">Well, listen, Carter, let&#39;s go from one American story to all the American stories. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, checking in on them, the people. That is correct. We are wanting to check in on our friends in the United States, of course, through a political lens. There&#39;s many stories for us to hit on over the course of the, that have actually happened or are in progress over the last, I&#39;d say, six to eight weeks since we haven&#39;t touched the United States in any significant fashion. Carter, let&#39;s start here. I want to start with Joe Biden and infrastructure. Sounds sexy. It&#39;s because it is sexy, Carter. Joe Biden is doing Joe Biden things where he wants to engage a bipartisan group to pass his historic infrastructure bill. He&#39;s engaged Republicans in negotiations on the traditional infrastructure bill side, bridges, roads, etc. But he&#39;s also trying to play this really fine balance with progressives within the Democratic party who want what they call the family infrastructure in Canada, what&#39;s been called social infrastructure. This includes everything from child care and, you know, all these sort of measures related to income supports and social welfare used in not the classic sense, but in the sense of, you know, ensuring that social programs are fulfilled. When you see this, Carter, when you see old school Biden wanting to reach across the aisle, but also having to maintain this coalition within his party. What are the first thoughts that you have? Do you feel like he&#39;s now reaching too far when he&#39;s got, you know, all three in the executive branch? He&#39;s got Congress, he&#39;s got the Senate. Should he be trying to do bipartisan initiatives like this? Or is this one of those things like learn from the Obama years, stick to your core and just get shit done with the limited amount of time you may have this power?</div>

But they have the filibuster rules And the filibuster rules have kind of evolved from this idea that it used to take, you know, 60 senators to move the debate or end the debate and getting to the actual voting, which meant that a single senator could stand up and filibuster, right, stand and speak for as long as he or she wished to try and stop the actual vote. And what it has meant now is that essentially, if you don&#39;t have the right number of votes, they don&#39;t even try. They don&#39;t make the senators stand on the floor. They don&#39;t make them.

They had gone through all of these efforts. I don&#39;t entirely disagree with some of the criticisms that Donald Trump has leveled if this turns out to be all there is. And they just felt like, well, they had to now. They&#39;d gone down this road so far. Then they&#39;re going to have to bring something. And it&#39;s not even so much that they needed something to show for it. It&#39;s that there was just people calling for blood in the streets, and if they heard, well, yeah, we found criminal wrongdoing, but we didn&#39;t think it was serious, so</div>

That was just not a position the DA could take in this particular situation because it was so politically charged, because it had become so difficult. So all of a sudden that then feeds into Donald Trump and this idea of I&#39;m a victim and look at all of this, and it becomes almost a case study for him to be able to point to and say, see, you wouldn&#39;t see that in normal context.

          <div class="said">What is Biden&#39;s bully pulpit on this in the sense of how can he use the fact that he&#39;s got the title of president, the office of president effectively? How does that help the strategic outcome that he&#39;s trying to seek? It&#39;s maybe not the legal one. It&#39;s not the legislative one. It&#39;s not the state one. But, you know, we&#39;ve seen Obama take tours to talk about gun violence. We&#39;ve seen other presidents use that bully pulpit. Talk to me a little bit about that and what a bully pulpit can do and perhaps apply it to this situation that we&#39;ve seen with the Voting Rights Act and the current state of voting rights in the United States.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, the bully pulpit is really interesting in this situation because it turns out that every time, generally speaking, when voters&#39; rights are constrained, they turn out in record number in the next election. So the bully pulpit in 2022 2022 could be very interesting if they&#39;re able to, for example, and I think that Stacey Abrams loss in Georgia really was the beginning of the of the shift in Georgia to what we now see as kind of, you know, two Democratic senators from Georgia, a significant shift in the number of voters that came out. They stood in lines. They did not let this voter this voter restriction tactic and the suppression that it was it was enforced upon them. They did not allow that to stop them. Instead, they stood strong and said, we will not we will not be cowed</div>

So if Biden takes his bully pulpit and uses it at the right time, I mean, ideally what would happen is some sort of new Supreme Court ruling or some sort of new legislation, you know, something that happens just a few months before the 2022 election that just pisses off Democratic and independent voters and gets them to go to the polls or infrequent voters or first time voters. And if you can organize that type of activity, then then that&#39;s what you should be doing. Someone should be studying what Stacey Abrams did in Georgia and trying to implement that, not nationwide because it&#39;s just too big, it&#39;s too hard, but implementing that in key areas for Democrats, whether it&#39;s Arizona or it&#39;s Michigan or any of these other states that are bringing forward these types of rules.</div>

But at the same time, we want our groups and community leaders to also take the belt suspenders approach of educating people on how to deal with these new laws. What do they mean? How do I still vote meaningfully? It kind of speaks to your point around someone ultimately coming to Biden and being like, OK, you just gave us a cocktail of things you&#39;re going to do. Which one is it? And when you see that suite of reasons alongside some of the ones we&#39;ve been discussing right now,</div>

The clock&#39;s ticking for California recall candidates trying to oust Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. We now have a date. September 14th is state officials have called that as the election and ballots will hit mailboxes weeks before then. This short timeline enabled by Democratic allies of the governor allows Gavin Newsom, who has just had the guns out for him and the prospects as he looks to convert on a rebounding economy and stabilizing poll numbers. Before we jump into all of it, Corey, explain to us what a recall election is and maybe explain to us a bit around why Gavin Newsom is being targeted with one.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, in certain American states and increasingly in some Canadian jurisdictions, it&#39;s a law that allows you to end a term before the term concludes. So instead of it being fixed, say four years, if enough people sign something, then ultimately they will either be immediately removed or there&#39;ll be an election to see if they should be removed. And California has one of the most, I guess we&#39;d call it, accessible recall laws in the United States. You only need 12% of the turnout of the last election for governor to sign it in order to force a recall vote. This is in California, two parts. The first question is, do you want to recall the governor, yes or no? It</div>

          <div class="said">It might not be the exact wording of the question. And then the second one is, okay, if the answer is yes, or if the governor is recalled, who&#39;d you vote for? Who do you want to vote for? And then anybody and their dog can get on there because you only need something like 7000 signatures. I&#39;m going from memory. So that might be not quite accurate. And, and you&#39;re in like you&#39;re there, you get to be a candidate. And this is, of course, famously how Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor in</div>

But it might not matter at all, because people might just on party lines say, no, I do not want to recall Governor Newsom.</div>

You know, the rates have gone down, obviously, unpredictability with California wildfires and Delta variants, and whoever knows what other curveballs are thrown at him.

I think the recall is a tool that is either too easy to use, as in the case of California, it&#39;s too hard to use, as in the case of Alberta, and it creates this kind of false sense of connection. We have a representative democracy. Those representatives face the electorate at predetermined times. Those predetermined times are not egregiously long at four years, two, four and six years for most. And on top of that, I think that California&#39;s even got term limits. So, you know, like it&#39;s just it&#39;s an absolute waste of time that especially in an executive system where the the, you know, the governor or the president has to, you know, is</div>

          <div class="said">Oh, maybe, maybe either, maybe both. One of the interesting things about recall legislation is that it&#39;s sort of designed for more civil politics. Because of course, especially, I mean, look at our system here in Canada, nobody gets 50% of the vote when there&#39;s multiple parties. And so you end up in a situation where even if you are saying a head to head race, they may not have been your, you might not love them, they might just be better than the other guy, so to speak. And so you hold your nose and sort of tick a box. And so I guess my – not even problem with recall. One of the things that I think needs to be observed and noted about recall is the mechanism through which you pull back the governor and get a new governor is so very different from the mechanism in which you elect a governor. And political parties have a similar sort of thing with leadership review, but you have the population of California having a list to candidates and choosing newsome right and uh</div>

I think we talked about it last episode where, Corey, you mentioned that, listen, the political class is aware that this is going to happen. That&#39;s all the sort of runway that the liberals need to make this happen. But let&#39;s do a bit of a check in on the parties. Let&#39;s check in on some of the high-level indicators, you know, momentum, maybe money, maybe a bit of organizing. Let&#39;s start with the Liberals, and I think we can knock this one off pretty easily because it seems like most things are well in their column. But let&#39;s talk about the ups and downs that they may face. Carter, talk to me about the Liberals. Maybe use my rubric, momentum, money, and organizing. It seems like they&#39;ve got certainly the momentum. Talk to me about money and organizing. They clearly don&#39;t have all their candidates nominated. eliminated we&#39;ve talked about in the past that that&#39;s not a huge concern uh when you&#39;re when you&#39;re trying to call an election relatively quickly but give me their upsides and then give me some of their risks as well and we&#39;ll go through each of the parties there</div>

          <div class="said">their money was behind we talked about that on the podcast uh i&#39;m sure they&#39;ve got enough money to run an election because of course we&#39;re capped So at some point, ironically, the pre-writ period, you can spend a little bit more money. So the shorter the pre-writ period, right, this period of, well, maybe they&#39;re going to call it now. Like if you were a conservative, you&#39;d be buying billboards. And those billboards may not count because you&#39;re not in the writ period. And you may have more money to do that. So the faster that it happens, it may, in fact, benefit the liberals.

          <div class="said">between the polling and the speed, I think that they think that they can achieve a majority government. I think Corey has been the most articulate about this in questioning whether – why to do this in previous conversations. But it doesn&#39;t seem to matter what we think. They have a plan and they&#39;re definitely moving towards an election. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any political pundit in Canada that doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s happening really quickly.</div>

I kind of threw out some metrics of organizing momentum and money. You can clearly add some more, but tell me what&#39;s the state of the affairs in terms of readiness for the liberals from your perspective.</div>

I think they see the environment as being somewhat favorable to them, because, of course, we are rapidly going to be approaching the place where certainly even if you were called on election today or tomorrow, where before you got to the ballot, you could have your second dose of vaccine if you wanted it. And it&#39;s not so long of a gap that you start to take it for granted and think, yeah, but what have you done for me lately? Also has the advantage of a conservative leader who has not been successful in defining himself with Canadians, at least not in a positive sense.</div>

Well, it&#39;s been a long time since we&#39;ve thought of politics outside of a COVID context. And polling may be giving the liberals a bit of a sugar high, a bit of a false positive. They won&#39;t know until that&#39;s tested. None of us will really know until that&#39;s tested. If we see Canadians say, well, that&#39;s great. Thank you, Liberal Party, for getting us all of those vaccine doses. But you know what? We&#39;re ready to kind of think about other things now. And we wouldn&#39;t mind thinking about the economy or more deeply about the environment, you name it. But we won&#39;t know until the election calls.

But you&#39;ll see a stronger amount of discipline. And there&#39;s no opportunity to define yourselves like an election. It&#39;s a time to talk about what&#39;s next and what&#39;s going to be. And so maybe Aaron O&#39;Toole looks at that and says, I can do this. And lest we forget, Andrew Scheer was not exactly anybody&#39;s idea of a star candidate. And he got more of the popular vote than Justin Trudeau. So there might be a bit of a shy Tory effect as well. That&#39;s when people are less inclined to say that they&#39;re conservative. Comes from the UK. Okay, Neil Kinnock was supposed to win an election. He did not win. I think that was Major, right? And Major was the person who won, not it was a big deal, although it was a big deal as well. And maybe there&#39;s also a situation where people are parking their votes in undecided, just grumbling, but as conservatives, they&#39;ll ultimately come back to Aaron O&#39;Toole, because in this class of civilizations world we live in, if it becomes liberal versus conservative, they&#39;re going to put their chips with conservative. So, I don&#39;t know. They&#39;ve got a problem with candidates. They don&#39;t seem to have the numbers of candidates you might hope for. I suspect they&#39;ll be fine on the money front, but they didn&#39;t raise as much as the Liberals, right? Right.</div>

Or are you part of the camp that says, if you&#39;re advising O&#39;Toole right now, you&#39;re doing anything you can to delay this thing further, whether that be, you know, throwing out some of your oppo early to kind of create some bricks on the road or whatever you need to, to try to delay this election or try to, you know, know, throw, you know, put a put a stick in the liberals wheel to ensure that you have a bit more time.

They are a regional party that stands for the region and everybody knows what they&#39;re going to get when they vote for them. And that makes them very, very difficult to unseat. If the Reform Party had stayed like that in Western Canada, the Reform Party exists to this day and they would be a massive player. This is one of the reasons I&#39;m not a big fan of proportional representation. The regionalization problem in Canada is particularly acute cute and uh quebec is just really dug in on it and uh the party quebecois will be a or the black quebecois my my mistake is going to still be uh a factor at the end of this election the same way that they are now cory</div>

We&#39;re going to go as we went from from the United States to Canada, we&#39;re going to now go very local, to here in Alberta, touching upon it with a name that I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not happy that is now part of the political zeitgeist in this province, but one Steve Allen. Yes, he has not asked for another extension on his official inquiry or commission, but in fact, he&#39;s now set up an endorsement for a municipal candidate. Corey, do you want to walk us through this? And simultaneously, can you give me a letter on this endorsement, both from content and quality and timing and just everything included. Can you give me a consolidated letter grade on this Steve Allen endorsement?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, it&#39;s an interesting one. I&#39;ll try to narrow my critique here because there&#39;s a lot that you could point to. But Steve Allen, for those of you who have not been keeping track, is the commissioner responsible for the anti-energy campaign inquiry here in Alberta. The idea is is supposed to look into all of this foreign money coming to Alberta to fight against Alberta&#39;s interests. And he was supposed to look into this and expose this. And he read a report about this. And this report is now going to be a year late. It has had budget overruns. The documents they released last year were a</div>

          <div class="said">a lot of reaction online where people said, well, that&#39;s like the biggest anti endorsement I&#39;ve ever seen, you know, which, you know, maybe it&#39;s not totally fair to Steve Allen, who&#39;s well known as a community leader. The letter itself talked about, hey, Jeff Davison&#39;s a great guy, if you want to like cancel the green line, I&#39;m paraphrasing, but like, you know, it listed out some policy positions that I think a lot of people would be pretty horrified by. And, and then, Then, of course, it also came from a commissioner of an inquiry.</div>

Ha, ha, ha. This endorsement was over budget. Ha, ha, ha. But all very good. But this is somebody with the power – like in the Alberta Inquiries Act, it is like they have the powers of a judge of the Court of Queens bench. Like they have real legal authority. This is a quasi-judicial appointment. And the idea that they would be mixing up in politics at all, let alone helping fundraise for a mayoral candidate, let alone weighing in on the issues of the day, I thought was a bit wild. held.

          <div class="said">obviously, that&#39;s not something anybody in a position like that should be doing. But what really struck me is it gives you a lot of insight into how Steve Allen sees his position. And he doesn&#39;t see it as being a judge or quasi-judicial or somebody with a very serious nonpartisan role to kind of sift through the evidence and tell it as it is. He sees it as, I&#39;m a guy hired to write a government report by a UCP government. So I&#39;m just going to continue living my life as normal, Well, weighing in on the things I want to weigh in on.
