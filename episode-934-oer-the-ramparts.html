Yeah, and de Blasio really gets, you know, best of both worlds. He gets obviously a mayoral candidate who can do well for the city, really carry on that food-based legacy. And also someone who really probably could do a better job than de Blasio on many files that he has dropped over the course of his life. When</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Well, listen, Carter, let&#39;s go from one American story to all the American stories. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, checking in on them, the people. That is correct. We are wanting to check in on our friends in the United States, of course, through a political lens. There&#39;s many stories for us to hit on over the course of the, that have actually happened or are in progress over the last, I&#39;d say, six to eight weeks since we haven&#39;t touched the United States in any significant fashion. Carter, let&#39;s start here. I want to start with Joe Biden and infrastructure. Sounds sexy. It&#39;s because it is sexy, Carter. Joe Biden is doing Joe Biden things where he wants to engage a bipartisan group to pass his historic infrastructure bill. He&#39;s engaged Republicans in negotiations on the traditional infrastructure bill side, bridges, roads, etc. But he&#39;s also trying to play this really fine balance with progressives within the Democratic party who want what they call the family infrastructure in Canada, what&#39;s been called social infrastructure. This includes everything from child care and, you know, all these sort of measures related to income supports and social welfare used in not the classic sense, but in the sense of, you know, ensuring that social programs are fulfilled. When you see this, Carter, when you see old school Biden wanting to reach across the aisle, but also having to maintain this coalition within his party. What are the first thoughts that you have? Do you feel like he&#39;s now reaching too far when he&#39;s got, you know, all three in the executive branch? He&#39;s got Congress, he&#39;s got the Senate. Should he be trying to do bipartisan initiatives like this? Or is this one of those things like learn from the Obama years, stick to your core and just get shit done with the limited amount of time you may have this power?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, Obama&#39;s situation was a lot different because at the beginning of his term, he had the Senate and he still wanted to portray this sense of bipartisanship that really wasn&#39;t necessary because he didn&#39;t have to work his way around the filibuster.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The filibuster has changed everything. And now that it&#39;s a 50-50 Senate,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, in Canada, we would think, well, 50-50 plus one, you&#39;ve got Kamala Harris as the tiebreaker. What&#39;s your problem? You&#39;ve got your majority. But they have the filibuster rules And the filibuster rules have kind of evolved from this idea that it used to take, you know, 60 senators to move the debate or end the debate and getting to the actual voting, which meant that a single senator could stand up and filibuster, right, stand and speak for as long as he or she wished to try and stop the actual vote. And what it has meant now is that essentially, if you don&#39;t have the right number of votes, they don&#39;t even try. They don&#39;t make the senators stand on the floor. They don&#39;t make them. And this matters because there&#39;s multiple different ways of getting around this that I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll talk about later. But getting</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">getting around the filibuster is is a big part of Joe Biden&#39;s problem because he&#39;s got some senators that just don&#39;t want to get around it on his own side.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So that means that any significant piece of legislation that he can&#39;t put through through</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">through reconciliation means that he has to try and get this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">managed. And so what he&#39;s done with the infrastructure legislation is actually found the 10 Republicans and found the piece of legislation that he can actually now get passed. And that&#39;s where things get interesting, because getting something passed in the Senate that is Republican dominated, if we if we can accept the 50 50 as dominant, given the filibuster rules, he runs into an immediate problem with the House in the Democratic because the Democrats don&#39;t have a huge majority in the House and the progressive Democrats have a much larger sway</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">sway in the House than the than the progressive senators, of which there may be one or two. So the Senate and the House, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it doesn&#39;t matter that they&#39;re all, quote unquote, democratically controlled because they&#39;re not democratically controlled enough to find the best solutions. Now, I think his classic infrastructure bill may get through with it, with a bipartisan push and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and other infrastructure. I think that they&#39;re they&#39;re exploring the idea of including it in a reconciliation money bill, which would be really interesting. interesting um and it may or may not get past joe mansion and um uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">uh kristin cinema but uh we&#39;ll see i mean it for me this is a very interesting type of politic that we don&#39;t often see in canada because we have we have a caucus is so heavily whipped and we also have even in the minority uh parliament um you know the the government is basically able to achieve whatever they need to.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you know, America, country divided on partisan lines, though many respondents constantly to polls say that they want all parties to work together. What do you think of bipartisan dealmaking? You know, from the specifics of this infrastructure bill, you know, obviously not the most expeditious way to pass legislation. Do you feel like the process is still important, still part of like a functioning democracy? Or are you part of the camp that says, fuck it, you&#39;ve got what you got. You just pass it through through the folks on your side?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">If that&#39;s available to you, that seems like a more direct path in America today. This kind of notion of this Senate that is this deliberative body that&#39;s going to work together and come to consensus. And yeah, maybe they&#39;re going to be this cooling influence on our red hot house and be more moderate in their outcomes and drive the government overall to more moderate outcomes. That seems really old fashioned in 2021, especially after we&#39;ve seen how how the republicans with their majorities rammed through or blocked uh supreme court appointments and uh and</span>

Now, it&#39;s all very murky, and ultimately, perhaps even a little bit dull, but vitally important in how the infrastructure bill has become intertwined with reconciliation processes. And Pelosi, you know, Speaker of the House saying things like, yeah, we&#39;ll vote on your infrastructure bill once we get a reconciliation process, which of course, in turn would allow them to get around filibusters more often and all that complicated stuff.

There is calls that on strategy here for Biden, that this could first of all, the reason we&#39;re talking about this, let me just, you know, underline is is really that many folks, at At least political watchers in the U.S. believe that this could be the bill that either kind of bolsters</span>

This one over the weekend in Sarasota, Florida, where he railed against prosecutorial misconduct against the government for going after the Trump organization and its chief financial officer for not reporting and not paying nearly $2 million in taxes and fringe benefits to the organization. Carter, two prongs here, but maybe we can combine them into one. is Trump&#39;s comeback a real thing?

I think that the pressure that is going to come on those within his organization to turn on him. I mean, even today, he sounded surprised for a man who says that no one understands tax law like he does. He seemed to be surprised that if you get all your your housing, your cars, your gym memberships and whatever from your company, that&#39;s a taxable benefit. It&#39;s a taxable benefit in the United States as much as it&#39;s a taxable benefit here up here in Canada. So he seems surprised. So I think he may be in personal jeopardy.</span>

            <span class="text">guess what I find interesting here is that the DA was in a bit of a damned if you do damned if you don&#39;t situation. They had spent so much time. They had gone through all of these efforts. I don&#39;t entirely disagree with some of the criticisms that Donald Trump has leveled if this turns out to be all there is. And they just felt like, well, they had to now. They&#39;d gone down this road so far. Then they&#39;re going to have to bring something. And it&#39;s not even so much that they needed something to show for it. It&#39;s that there was just people calling for blood in the streets, and if they heard, well, yeah, we found criminal wrongdoing, but we didn&#39;t think it was serious, so</span>

            <span class="text">didn&#39;t give a shit, right? That was just not a position the DA could take in this particular situation because it was so politically charged, because it had become so difficult. So all of a sudden that then feeds into Donald Trump and this idea of I&#39;m a victim and look at all of this, and it becomes almost a case study for him to be able to point to and say, see, you wouldn&#39;t see that in normal context. And there&#39;s</span>

And essentially what that did was it took away the requirement by states to go to the Justice Department to get their changes to voting rights approved in advance. So in essence, if they&#39;re going to make changes to the voting structures, like they&#39;re going to reduce to one polling station or they&#39;re going to require mandatory identification, that would go to the Justice Department and they could stop it prior to it being implemented.

            <span class="text">Corey brings up some excellent points, Carter. Everything from federal lawsuits to congressional action to make this about the states and mobilize and organize statewide. I want to ask you about one in particular that I think is important and perhaps is just baked in, but it&#39;s the bully pulpit. it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">What is Biden&#39;s bully pulpit on this in the sense of how can he use the fact that he&#39;s got the title of president, the office of president effectively? How does that help the strategic outcome that he&#39;s trying to seek? It&#39;s maybe not the legal one. It&#39;s not the legislative one. It&#39;s not the state one. But, you know, we&#39;ve seen Obama take tours to talk about gun violence. We&#39;ve seen other presidents use that bully pulpit. Talk to me a little bit about that and what a bully pulpit can do and perhaps apply it to this situation that we&#39;ve seen with the Voting Rights Act and the current state of voting rights in the United States.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, the bully pulpit is really interesting in this situation because it turns out that every time, generally speaking, when voters&#39; rights are constrained, they turn out in record number in the next election. So the bully pulpit in 2022 2022 could be very interesting if they&#39;re able to, for example, and I think that Stacey Abrams loss in Georgia really was the beginning of the of the shift in Georgia to what we now see as kind of, you know, two Democratic senators from Georgia, a significant shift in the number of voters that came out. They stood in lines. They did not let this voter this voter restriction tactic and the suppression that it was it was enforced upon them. They did not allow that to stop them. Instead, they stood strong and said, we will not we will not be cowed</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">cowed by these by these rules that are being pushed on us by this governor. And as a result, good things happen for the Democrats. So if Biden takes his bully pulpit and uses it at the right time, I mean, ideally what would happen is some sort of new Supreme Court ruling or some sort of new legislation, you know, something that happens just a few months before the 2022 election that just pisses off Democratic and independent voters and gets them to go to the polls or infrequent voters or first time voters. And if you can organize that type of activity, then then that&#39;s what you should be doing. Someone should be studying what Stacey Abrams did in Georgia and trying to implement that, not nationwide because it&#39;s just too big, it&#39;s too hard, but implementing that in key areas for Democrats, whether it&#39;s Arizona or it&#39;s Michigan or any of these other states that are bringing forward these types of rules.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I want to read you a quote here from a senior Biden official. We&#39;re going to fight in the courts. We&#39;re going to fight on the streets. We&#39;re going to fight for fair voting. We&#39;re going to do that. But at the same time, we want our groups and community leaders to also take the belt suspenders approach of educating people on how to deal with these new laws. What do they mean? How do I still vote meaningfully? It kind of speaks to your point around someone ultimately coming to Biden and being like, OK, you just gave us a cocktail of things you&#39;re going to do. Which one is it? And when you see that suite of reasons alongside some of the ones we&#39;ve been discussing right now,</span>

            <span class="text">planning a backup plan in case that you quote unquote fail on these things. But it also maybe tells you a little bit about Joe Biden&#39;s kind of maybe intentions is not the right word, but his view of it and whether he thinks he&#39;s going to be successful in the courts with a six to three conservative majority or legislature where we&#39;ve spent a bit of time already talking about the filibuster. And maybe it&#39;s just not practical that those changes are going to be made in time for these midterm elections, which, hey, it&#39;s America. They&#39;re coming soon, right? It&#39;ll be primary season again before you know it. And so maybe it&#39;s a way to kind of say, hey, we&#39;re not giving up hope because nobody wants to hear that, or at least big blocks of the Democratic constituency don&#39;t.

The clock&#39;s ticking for California recall candidates trying to oust Gavin Newsom, the governor of California. We now have a date. September 14th is state officials have called that as the election and ballots will hit mailboxes weeks before then. This short timeline enabled by Democratic allies of the governor allows Gavin Newsom, who has just had the guns out for him and the prospects as he looks to convert on a rebounding economy and stabilizing poll numbers. Before we jump into all of it, Corey, explain to us what a recall election is and maybe explain to us a bit around why Gavin Newsom is being targeted with one.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, in certain American states and increasingly in some Canadian jurisdictions, it&#39;s a law that allows you to end a term before the term concludes. So instead of it being fixed, say four years, if enough people sign something, then ultimately they will either be immediately removed or there&#39;ll be an election to see if they should be removed. And California has one of the most, I guess we&#39;d call it, accessible recall laws in the United States. You only need 12% of the turnout of the last election for governor to sign it in order to force a recall vote. This is in California, two parts. The first question is, do you want to recall the governor, yes or no? It</span>

Who do you want to vote for? And then anybody and their dog can get on there because you only need something like 7000 signatures. I&#39;m going from memory. So that might be not quite accurate.

            <span class="text">recall. It doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve all gotten to this spot, but there&#39;s been initiatives against every single governor. Pretty common. And the second is, as things have become so increasingly polarized, I think everyone&#39;s suspicion is that 12% might be easier to get. But it might not matter at all, because people might just on party lines say, no, I do not want to recall Governor Newsom.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, what do you think of the Newsom recall? I mean, for a long time, the Republicans, as well as Newsom, have been expecting this. Now there&#39;s a date that&#39;s been announced. It&#39;s a quick trigger, where he&#39;s kind of rebounding off some momentum. You know, the rates have gone down, obviously, unpredictability with California wildfires and Delta variants, and whoever knows what other curveballs are thrown at him. But what&#39;s your read of the Newsom recall and then just recall legislation more generally? I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think recall is stupid. I think the recall is a tool that is either too easy to use, as in the case of California, it&#39;s too hard to use, as in the case of Alberta, and it creates this kind of false sense of connection. We have a representative democracy. Those representatives face the electorate at predetermined times. Those predetermined times are not egregiously long at four years, two, four and six years for most. And on top of that, I think that California&#39;s even got term limits. So, you know, like it&#39;s just it&#39;s an absolute waste of time that especially in an executive system where the the, you know, the governor or the president has to, you know, is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is this is the executive branch of government, then it just is a waste of their time. It&#39;s a waste of their energy and it just undermines the the entire system. So I think that it&#39;s dumb.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, long story short, is this Newsom recall going to go anywhere? Or is this just straight up like optics and political theater that we&#39;re witnessing in California? California?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, maybe, maybe either, maybe both. One of the interesting things about recall legislation is that it&#39;s sort of designed for more civil politics. Because of course, especially, I mean, look at our system here in Canada, nobody gets 50% of the vote when there&#39;s multiple parties. And so you end up in a situation where even if you are saying a head to head race, they may not have been your, you might not love them, they might just be better than the other guy, so to speak. And so you hold your nose and sort of tick a box. And so I guess my – not even problem with recall. One of the things that I think needs to be observed and noted about recall is the mechanism through which you pull back the governor and get a new governor is so very different from the mechanism in which you elect a governor. And political parties have a similar sort of thing with leadership review, but you have the population of California having a list to candidates and choosing newsome right and uh</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And so that&#39;s fascinating to me, because that allows whenever you see kind of a delta in the rules like that, that allows for fuckery. And that kind of fuckery, I think, is what we have to be on guard for, I think, in general, when recall legislation is created, because it allows people to gum up the system by just getting Getting their 12% of the vote, whipping somebody back, having another election that has different rules, right, where it&#39;s just first</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;re expecting an election at some point this this summer. And I want to do you know, we&#39;ve we&#39;ve talked about this in the past. I think we talked about it last episode where, Corey, you mentioned that, listen, the political class is aware that this is going to happen. That&#39;s all the sort of runway that the liberals need to make this happen. But let&#39;s do a bit of a check in on the parties. Let&#39;s check in on some of the high-level indicators, you know, momentum, maybe money, maybe a bit of organizing. Let&#39;s start with the Liberals, and I think we can knock this one off pretty easily because it seems like most things are well in their column. But let&#39;s talk about the ups and downs that they may face. Carter, talk to me about the Liberals. Maybe use my rubric, momentum, money, and organizing. It seems like they&#39;ve got certainly the momentum. Talk to me about money and organizing. They clearly don&#39;t have all their candidates nominated. eliminated we&#39;ve talked about in the past that that&#39;s not a huge concern uh when you&#39;re when you&#39;re trying to call an election relatively quickly but give me their upsides and then give me some of their risks as well and we&#39;ll go through each of the parties there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there was a series of polls last week that just showed them to be doing super well the momentum seems to be there there the money does not seem to be there um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">their money was behind we talked about that on the podcast uh i&#39;m sure they&#39;ve got enough money to run an election because of course we&#39;re capped So at some point, ironically, the pre-writ period, you can spend a little bit more money. So the shorter the pre-writ period, right, this period of, well, maybe they&#39;re going to call it now. Like if you were a conservative, you&#39;d be buying billboards. And those billboards may not count because you&#39;re not in the writ period. And you may have more money to do that. So the faster that it happens, it may, in fact, benefit the liberals. But they – between</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">between the polling and the speed, I think that they think that they can achieve a majority government. I think Corey has been the most articulate about this in questioning whether – why to do this in previous conversations. But it doesn&#39;t seem to matter what we think. They have a plan and they&#39;re definitely moving towards an election. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any political pundit in Canada that doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s happening really quickly.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. Corey, walk me through it. Maybe let&#39;s use the rubric of plus minus delta. What&#39;s good? What&#39;s bad? What might need to change? I kind of threw out some metrics of organizing momentum and money. You can clearly add some more, but tell me what&#39;s the state of the affairs in terms of readiness for the liberals from your perspective.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they get to choose the date. So they have a pretty massive advantage there. And when we talk about readiness, the liberal sense of readiness or not is, especially without Parliament sitting right now, it&#39;s the only thing that matters. If</span>

            <span class="text">If they feel ready, they can go. If they don&#39;t feel ready, they won&#39;t go. But this is starting to feel like it&#39;s a question of when, not if. you know there&#39;s chatter that the election could be called as early as this week do i think that&#39;s likely i&#39;m not so sure about that certainly possible um certainly enough people are whispering about it but you know the outside like the furthest people seem to think this election is going to be called is in late august for like a september early october vote at this point so um i think that just based on that alone we can have a pretty good sense the liberals feel pretty fucking ready you know they&#39;ve got the candidates they&#39;ve got the money the polls Polls are on their side. I think they see the environment as being somewhat favorable to them, because, of course, we are rapidly going to be approaching the place where certainly even if you were called on election today or tomorrow, where before you got to the ballot, you could have your second dose of vaccine if you wanted it. And it&#39;s not so long of a gap that you start to take it for granted and think, yeah, but what have you done for me lately? Also has the advantage of a conservative leader who has not been successful in defining himself with Canadians, at least not in a positive sense.</span>

I would be really stretching if I were to pull something in and say, yeah, but look at that.

If people haven&#39;t thought about it very long, it&#39;s not going to take very much to knock it out of their heads. Well, it&#39;s been a long time since we&#39;ve thought of politics outside of a COVID context. And polling may be giving the liberals a bit of a sugar high, a bit of a false positive. They won&#39;t know until that&#39;s tested. None of us will really know until that&#39;s tested. If we see Canadians say, well, that&#39;s great. Thank you, Liberal Party, for getting us all of those vaccine doses. But you know what? We&#39;re ready to kind of think about other things now. And we wouldn&#39;t mind thinking about the economy or more deeply about the environment, you name it. But we won&#39;t know until the election calls.

But you&#39;ll see a stronger amount of discipline. And there&#39;s no opportunity to define yourselves like an election. It&#39;s a time to talk about what&#39;s next and what&#39;s going to be. And so maybe Aaron O&#39;Toole looks at that and says, I can do this. And lest we forget, Andrew Scheer was not exactly anybody&#39;s idea of a star candidate. And he got more of the popular vote than Justin Trudeau. So there might be a bit of a shy Tory effect as well. That&#39;s when people are less inclined to say that they&#39;re conservative. Comes from the UK. Okay, Neil Kinnock was supposed to win an election. He did not win. I think that was Major, right? And Major was the person who won, not it was a big deal, although it was a big deal as well. And maybe there&#39;s also a situation where people are parking their votes in undecided, just grumbling, but as conservatives, they&#39;ll ultimately come back to Aaron O&#39;Toole, because in this class of civilizations world we live in, if it becomes liberal versus conservative, they&#39;re going to put their chips with conservative. So, I don&#39;t know. They&#39;ve got a problem with candidates. They don&#39;t seem to have the numbers of candidates you might hope for. I suspect they&#39;ll be fine on the money front, but they didn&#39;t raise as much as the Liberals, right? Right.</span>

Like, perhaps there is a argument to be said, like, fuck it, let&#39;s just do this right now. Do you buy that? Or are you part of the camp that says, if you&#39;re advising O&#39;Toole right now, you&#39;re doing anything you can to delay this thing further, whether that be, you know, throwing out some of your oppo early to kind of create some bricks on the road or whatever you need to, to try to delay this election or try to, you know, know, throw, you know, put a put a stick in the liberals wheel to ensure that you have a bit more time.

They don&#39;t ever try to make themselves into something that they&#39;re not. They are a regional party that stands for the region and everybody knows what they&#39;re going to get when they vote for them. And that makes them very, very difficult to unseat. If the Reform Party had stayed like that in Western Canada, the Reform Party exists to this day and they would be a massive player. This is one of the reasons I&#39;m not a big fan of proportional representation. The regionalization problem in Canada is particularly acute cute and uh quebec is just really dug in on it and uh the party quebecois will be a or the black quebecois my my mistake is going to still be uh a factor at the end of this election the same way that they are now cory</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to do my last question. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you for an obvious reason. We&#39;re going to go as we went from from the United States to Canada, we&#39;re going to now go very local, to here in Alberta, touching upon it with a name that I&#39;m sure he&#39;s not happy that is now part of the political zeitgeist in this province, but one Steve Allen. Yes, he has not asked for another extension on his official inquiry or commission, but in fact, he&#39;s now set up an endorsement for a municipal candidate. Corey, do you want to walk us through this? And simultaneously, can you give me a letter on this endorsement, both from content and quality and timing and just everything included. Can you give me a consolidated letter grade on this Steve Allen endorsement?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s an interesting one. I&#39;ll try to narrow my critique here because there&#39;s a lot that you could point to. But Steve Allen, for those of you who have not been keeping track, is the commissioner responsible for the anti-energy campaign inquiry here in Alberta. The idea is is supposed to look into all of this foreign money coming to Alberta to fight against Alberta&#39;s interests. And he was supposed to look into this and expose this. And he read a report about this. And this report is now going to be a year late. It has had budget overruns. The documents they released last year were a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a little subpar, to put it modestly. Ironically, included some foreign analysis of the situation, because of course, that&#39;s pretty rich territory for irony. And now Now, a letter has been released, I saw a journalist reporting on it, where the same Steve Allen has asked people to support Jeff Davison for mayor of Calgary. Now, I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think the reason Zane came to me first is because Carter&#39;s involved in a municipal mayoral campaign. And so yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a lot of reaction online where people said, well, that&#39;s like the biggest anti endorsement I&#39;ve ever seen, you know, which, you know, maybe it&#39;s not totally fair to Steve Allen, who&#39;s well known as a community leader. The letter itself talked about, hey, Jeff Davison&#39;s a great guy, if you want to like cancel the green line, I&#39;m paraphrasing, but like, you know, it listed out some policy positions that I think a lot of people would be pretty horrified by. And, and then, Then, of course, it also came from a commissioner of an inquiry.</span>

            <span class="text">And that, to me, is the one that I want to focus on here because I was – I thought – yeah, I mean, right for comments about, yeah, this endorsement was 12 months late. Ha, ha, ha. This endorsement was over budget. Ha, ha, ha. But all very good. But this is somebody with the power – like in the Alberta Inquiries Act, it is like they have the powers of a judge of the Court of Queens bench. Like they have real legal authority. This is a quasi-judicial appointment. And the idea that they would be mixing up in politics at all, let alone helping fundraise for a mayoral candidate, let alone weighing in on the issues of the day, I thought was a bit wild. held.

            <span class="text">obviously, that&#39;s not something anybody in a position like that should be doing. But what really struck me is it gives you a lot of insight into how Steve Allen sees his position. And he doesn&#39;t see it as being a judge or quasi-judicial or somebody with a very serious nonpartisan role to kind of sift through the evidence and tell it as it is. He sees it as, I&#39;m a guy hired to write a government report by a UCP government. So I&#39;m just going to continue living my life as normal, Well, weighing in on the things I want to weigh in on.
