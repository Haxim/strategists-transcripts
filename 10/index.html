Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about how candidates prepare for a debate, the value of endorsements and the Alberta NDP&#39;s corporate tax promises. Can Thursday&#39;s leader&#39;s debate change the course of the Alberta campaign? Do endorsements sway voters? And did Corey spend a weekend at a Cato Institute re-education camp?

Plus, Annalise farms the Discord and Twitter for questions, including: why are political leaders so eager to break out the windbreaker in an emergency?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the second week in the Alberta election: the state of the race, the looming debate, and how campaigns act when they’re halfway between takeoff and landing - plus, inexplicably, audience questions. Is Danielle Smith’s campaign drowning in her past comments? Should the NDP concerned about the “Shy Tory effect”? And that’s all great, but is Bret(t) spelled with one “T” or two?

Plus: FOX News, PSAC deal and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter read the tea leaves on Mark Carney’s visit to the National Liberal Convention (and use it as a jumping off point to discuss how one positions themselves to be a party-leader-in-waiting) before discussing the CRTC holding hearings on FOX News’ place on Canadian airwaves. Does Mark Carney risk wearing out his welcome if he doesn’t take the next step? Do FOX News’ actions require it to be dropped from cable?

But, also, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter present duelling strategies for the upcoming Alberta election in this episode recorded live in Calgary, with Carter creating a strategy for the NDP and Hogan a strategy for the UCP, before turning to their thoughts on the election overall. Does Corey have the Powerpoint chops to bring home the W? Will hilarity ensue? And will Stephen pour water all over himself before or after the intermission? Annalise Klingbeil hosts and SPECIAL GUEST Zain Velji acts as the voice of the audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

PLUS: there&#39;s a new discount airline in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about a contentious week in federal politics that was capped by the Prime Minister&#39;s Chief of Staff testifying on foreign interference. Does Pierre Poilievre have a &#34;packaging&#34; problem? Did anybody&#39;s mind change when Justin Trudeau talked with a PPC supporter at the University of Manitoba? And why would any airline limit ticket purchases to an app? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Why can&#39;t Smith stick to a story? Will Ontario go forward with the recommendation to do away with public opinion polls during the closeout to elections? And when is AFL season over?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter briefly talk about the breaking news of Donald Trump&#39;s indictment before turning attention to Alberta Premier Danielle Smith&#39;s caught-on-tape moment chatting with &#34;controversial street preacher&#34; Artur Pawlowski. How much trouble is Danielle Smith in? Could Donald Trump&#39;s indictment lead to a constitutional crisis in the United States? And did Alison Redford ever take a ten-minute call with MADD without Stephen Carter present? Zain Velji, as always, isn&#39;t here.
