Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about how candidates prepare for a debate, the value of endorsements and the Alberta NDP's corporate tax promises.

        <div class="desc"><p>The Zain-free gang get together for Stephen Carter to take a victory lap on the Alberta UCP's purchase of unusable medicine, only to destroy that goodwill half an hour later when he declares war on children, joy and inclusive societies.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about $80 million of unusable medicine, the BC government and Alberta NDP plans for free contraception and whether infants should be allowed at Whitehorse's city council. Will the UCP's efforts to procure children's Tylenol hurt them on Election Day? Is free contraception smart politics? And when did Stephen Carter declare war on families? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

Is an inquiry inevitable? Are Trudeau, Poilievre and Singh holding lit matches in a room soaked with gasoline? And did the gang really mention a movie other than Dave (1993)? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>PLUS: tickets to The Strategists' live show in Calgary on April 2, 2023 go on sale. Hilarity ensues.</em></p></blockquote></div>
