            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i think people are pretty aware of it at this point it was a bit of a slow burn in the lead up it was one of these things where people kept saying it&#39;s gonna happen It&#39;s going to happen. And I think there was some polling. I&#39;m going to butcher it. I don&#39;t remember the exact numbers. But before it was passed, I think something like four in 10 Canadians said they were aware of it. And I&#39;m quite sure that number rocketed up when it started affecting them personally on Instagram and on Facebook. Facebook. So yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah, I think it&#39;s well known. I think one of the things that might surprise a few people is that not everybody does know about it still, which in some ways underlines Meta&#39;s argument that they&#39;re not really about sharing news. That&#39;s not what the sites are. That&#39;s not what they aspire to be. And so this is just like the theater of the absurd at this point. It actually drives me absolutely nuts. I do not support this bill by the federal government. I I think I&#39;ve made that pretty clear on this. I think it was a bad idea executed poorly, as only they can do, right? So self-sure that they know the answers, that they&#39;re going to go in and do this thing. But here&#39;s what it gets down to.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">on one hand, I sort of get it. It&#39;s a public emergency, and you want to be able to reach in any direction and grab a phone and have that phone give you some help, right? right? But, you know, asking an emergency for news to be free is not something we do for satellite radio, Sirius XM. We don&#39;t do it for cable television. That would be helpful. 24-hour news you don&#39;t get without a cable package. We don&#39;t do it for newspaper subscriptions or anything of the like, right? There&#39;s nothing inherently special about Facebook, in my opinion, that makes it a really great source for news. In fact, it seems like a pretty dangerous one because Facebook Facebook doesn&#39;t give it to you, you know, based on like the most recent thing. It&#39;s not chronological. It&#39;s based on engagement. So you might be looking at news from months ago, hours ago, for sure, days ago, most certainly. And can I tell you, as somebody who used to be a government official responsible for government communications, this was a real frustration. Like on social media, often the news people were looking at was not the news. And we always said in our social media posts, go here for the latest news. And we shared a site for it because we didn&#39;t actually want social media to be that source of truth, right? We wanted other people to go to the source of truth. And so let&#39;s bring us back to this whole story with Bill C-18 now and all of this.</span>

The federal government said, you&#39;re making too much money on news is back, so we are going to force you, if you&#39;re going to carry news, to pay the news media.

And listen, maybe that&#39;s your opinion, and that&#39;s fine. And certainly, you can make an argument that there&#39;s a switch somewhere at like, you know, one Facebook plaza, they can just flick and all of a sudden people can share news. And maybe that would be a good thing during an emergency. Like I said, I&#39;m less convinced it is just because I know the challenges with social media during these emergencies. But maybe that&#39;s your position. Okay. But that&#39;s not actually tied to the issue at hand, at least the way that the government is trying to make it. Now, not a bad calm strategy to try to tie it to the issue at hand. It was really interesting to see Facebook or Meta&#39;s response, which was essentially, yeah, we&#39;ve turned on the feature that allows people to mark themselves safe, you know, as though that was what was being asked for.

Instead of this coming in hot letter, if the government had said, listen, we know we&#39;re in a dispute right now. This had to be the tone too, right? We know we&#39;re in a dispute. We understand that they don&#39;t see eye to eye with us on news, but now is not the time. So we&#39;re asking Meta to reverse this at this moment as people have their lives at risk. Obviously, we will need to figure out new protocols if we can&#39;t come to a head. Obviously, a lot of things will need to change, but they&#39;re not going to change overnight. And now, now is not the time. So we&#39;re asking Meta just to reverse this decision at this moment. And then Meta&#39;s in the position where they&#39;ve reversed the decision. Or they don&#39;t. But like, to a very reasonable sounding ask, instead of this coming in hot, you&#39;re putting lives at risk. Because a lot of people, and I would actually put myself in that camp too, would say, you fired first, man. Like, you passed this bill, you forced their hand, they did the thing, now you&#39;re mad they did the thing.</span>

I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some emergency act that you can order a private company to do something. Just do it, right? Like, that&#39;s the other thing that bothers me. The fucking government, just do it. Like, if it&#39;s so serious, just do it. Tell META they&#39;re doing it, and we will figure it all out later under some emergency power you have. For God&#39;s sakes, we&#39;ve seen a pretty good example of emergency powers at use in other contexts in this country in the past couple of years here.</span>

These are your two options at this moment but i think regardless they need to find an opportunity to get out of the bickering right so they either need to come in as the heavy and say no this is just happening or they need to slink back a bit and they need to regroup and determine what the hell it is they&#39;re actually trying to do here and what exactly would be a victory and how they&#39;re going to navigate themselves from a to b like i honestly don&#39;t think they necessarily know where they&#39;re going it feels like they&#39;re hoping a path will open to them somehow cooler heads will prevail somehow they&#39;ll get an agreement with google which will force meta or something i don&#39;t even know i think this is part of the problem like they uh they were in my opinion too cute by half with this legislation as a whole they need to go back and say what was the purpose of this what are we willing to accept what are we willing not to accept or wherever you want to phrase that and and uh and actually come at it with a clear strategy because this feels like just pinging pinging off the issue whenever something comes up and you are any success in that environment will be accidental you know you&#39;ve got to know where you&#39;re going what</span>

They all still have the tags to optimize their content for Facebook, to optimize their content for Instagram, to make sure that it&#39;s as beautiful as possible when sharing. These were choices that they did to make it easier to share on social media. If they didn&#39;t like it, they could have just not done any of them.

And you can think of a million of them, right, where it looked like they had a de facto monopoly. And then the government said, actually, this is kind of dumb, we don&#39;t want to do this anymore.

Everybody listening to this knows this, but this is by far the worst wildfire season on record. you know twice as many hectares burned as the last record yet way off the charts compared to previous years i think we were talking a couple of months ago about the number of smoke-filled days in our home city of calgary over the years and you know i&#39;ll try to repost that chart maybe on our patreon discord or something but it&#39;s insane it is it is incontrovertible these things are happening and there&#39;s not really getting around it i guess all a long way to say serious</span>

How do networks balance wanting to show it and the laws around how much airtime they give candidates? I don&#39;t remember the details, but I do remember in 2016, the conversations about how they couldn&#39;t show reruns of The Apprentice or cutting Trump&#39;s appearance out of Home Alone 2, but</span>

So it seems weird that you would have to balance off like the Trump trial with a bunch of Joe Biden speeches. That seems to be like hitting twice.
