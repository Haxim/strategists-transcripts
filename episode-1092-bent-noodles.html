        <p>The gang discuss the Government of Canada's ongoing fight with Meta over The Online News Act before a broader conversation about the actions a politician needs to take in an age of climate change and climate disasters. <strong><em>[See how easy that was to post, Stephen?]</em></strong></p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Government of Canada and Meta squaring up over wildfire news posts before switching to what politicians need to be doing during a climate emergency and a discussion of the evolving politics of climate change. Will Canadians side with the government over access to news posts in an emergency? Is the conservative solution to climate change just hoping for the best? And how long until the boat lobby comes for Carter? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote><p><br /></p>

And I think there was some polling. I&#39;m going to butcher it. I don&#39;t remember the exact numbers. But before it was passed, I think something like four in 10 Canadians said they were aware of it. And I&#39;m quite sure that number rocketed up when it started affecting them personally on Instagram and on Facebook. Facebook. So yeah,</div>

          <div class="said">yeah, I think it&#39;s well known. I think one of the things that might surprise a few people is that not everybody does know about it still, which in some ways underlines Meta&#39;s argument that they&#39;re not really about sharing news. That&#39;s not what the sites are. That&#39;s not what they aspire to be. And so this is just like the theater of the absurd at this point. It actually drives me absolutely nuts. I do not support this bill by the federal government. I I think I&#39;ve made that pretty clear on this. I think it was a bad idea executed poorly, as only they can do, right? So self-sure that they know the answers, that they&#39;re going to go in and do this thing. But here&#39;s what it gets down to.</div>

          <div class="said">on one hand, I sort of get it. It&#39;s a public emergency, and you want to be able to reach in any direction and grab a phone and have that phone give you some help, right? right? But, you know, asking an emergency for news to be free is not something we do for satellite radio, Sirius XM. We don&#39;t do it for cable television. That would be helpful. 24-hour news you don&#39;t get without a cable package. We don&#39;t do it for newspaper subscriptions or anything of the like, right? There&#39;s nothing inherently special about Facebook, in my opinion, that makes it a really great source for news. In fact, it seems like a pretty dangerous one because Facebook Facebook doesn&#39;t give it to you, you know, based on like the most recent thing. It&#39;s not chronological. It&#39;s based on engagement. So you might be looking at news from months ago, hours ago, for sure, days ago, most certainly. And can I tell you, as somebody who used to be a government official responsible for government communications, this was a real frustration. Like on social media, often the news people were looking at was not the news. And we always said in our social media posts, go here for the latest news. And we shared a site for it because we didn&#39;t actually want social media to be that source of truth, right? We wanted other people to go to the source of truth. And so let&#39;s bring us back to this whole story with Bill C-18 now and all of this.</div>

I don&#39;t even know anymore.

And listen, maybe that&#39;s your opinion, and that&#39;s fine. And certainly, you can make an argument that there&#39;s a switch somewhere at like, you know, one Facebook plaza, they can just flick and all of a sudden people can share news. And maybe that would be a good thing during an emergency. Like I said, I&#39;m less convinced it is just because I know the challenges with social media during these emergencies. But maybe that&#39;s your position. Okay. But that&#39;s not actually tied to the issue at hand, at least the way that the government is trying to make it. Now, not a bad calm strategy to try to tie it to the issue at hand. It was really interesting to see Facebook or Meta&#39;s response, which was essentially, yeah, we&#39;ve turned on the feature that allows people to mark themselves safe, you know, as though that was what was being asked for.

Instead of this coming in hot letter, if the government had said, listen, we know we&#39;re in a dispute right now. This had to be the tone too, right? We know we&#39;re in a dispute. We understand that they don&#39;t see eye to eye with us on news, but now is not the time. So we&#39;re asking Meta to reverse this at this moment as people have their lives at risk. Obviously, we will need to figure out new protocols if we can&#39;t come to a head. Obviously, a lot of things will need to change, but they&#39;re not going to change overnight. And now, now is not the time. So we&#39;re asking Meta just to reverse this decision at this moment. And then Meta&#39;s in the position where they&#39;ve reversed the decision. Or they don&#39;t. But like, to a very reasonable sounding ask, instead of this coming in hot, you&#39;re putting lives at risk. Because a lot of people, and I would actually put myself in that camp too, would say, you fired first, man.

The fucking government, just do it. Like, if it&#39;s so serious, just do it. Tell META they&#39;re doing it, and we will figure it all out later under some emergency power you have. For God&#39;s sakes, we&#39;ve seen a pretty good example of emergency powers at use in other contexts in this country in the past couple of years here.</div>

These were choices that they did to make it easier to share on social media. If they didn&#39;t like it, they could have just not done any of them.

And you can think of a million of them, right, where it looked like they had a de facto monopoly. And then the government said, actually, this is kind of dumb, we don&#39;t want to do this anymore.

And obviously, this is why you have to be very careful about And you&#39;ve got to be very thoughtful and review these things on, you know, if not an hourly basis, daily basis for sure. So you&#39;re not stepping in, you know, a massive amount of challenge. I think we&#39;re at an interesting spot in the climate conversations in this country. It&#39;s not news. Everybody listening to this knows this, but this is by far the worst wildfire season on record. you know twice as many hectares burned as the last record yet way off the charts compared to previous years i think we were talking a couple of months ago about the number of smoke-filled days in our home city of calgary over the years and you know i&#39;ll try to repost that chart maybe on our patreon discord or something but it&#39;s insane it is it is incontrovertible these things are happening and there&#39;s not really getting around it i guess all a long way to say serious</div>

There&#39;s going to be unserious people who are in denial about this. And the CPC risks being lumped in with unserious people if they don&#39;t have solutions. But this is background now. And it&#39;s fucking depressing, by the way. and we are all complicit in it you know yes you were in an ev no doubt steven as you were behind that car belching it but we&#39;re all doing our thing moving about i i mean i was on a boat you know how much gas a boat uses and any given bloody day as i was tooling around here and we all think like our actions aren&#39;t that that big right and so i think that the cpc is going to have a bit of an audience for like why me why do i have to be the person who has to deal with this and so i very intentionally kind of separated carbon tax from climate change when you said it because i think that the cpc is increasingly going to do that they don&#39;t have a solution for climate change they don&#39;t yeah that&#39;s very clear um and they play footsie with people who don&#39;t believe in climate change but they&#39;re going to say this doesn&#39;t need to be the solution like that&#39;s That&#39;s how they&#39;re going to slowly pivot towards action on this particular one.
