        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter face their toughest accountability session ever as they dissect the strategy behind the campaign for one Corey Hogan. They go over what worked (everything) and what didn&#39;t (nothing) and get into lessons learned along the way. Was this the perfect campaign? Is ground game truly dead? Is Carter actually good at his job? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Stephen Carter and Zain Velji finally expose the truth behind the Corey Hogan campaign. The gang discusses how &#34;star&#34; candidates affect volunteer turnout, before diving into a retrospective on the national campaigns. What were the highlights? What were the lowlights? Any why does Zain have such a soft spot for Jagmeet? Corey isn&#39;t getting any sleep tonight, but Annalise is here to ask questions and maybe get answers.&lt;/p&gt;</div>

What do campaigns actually do in the final days? And where is the victory party going to be? Corey Hogan is out pacing nervously, but Annalise Klingbeil keeps things on the rails.&lt;/p&gt;</div>
