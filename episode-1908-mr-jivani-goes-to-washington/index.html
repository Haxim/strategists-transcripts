        <p></p><p>Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter do a weekly separatist checkup and debate what responsibility political commentators, operatives, and public figures have in moments like this. From there the conversation turns south, literally, as they examine Jamil Jivani’s trip to Washington. Will there be a separation referendum regardless of how the signature drive ends? What did Jamil hope to accomplish by going rogue? And which halftime show did Carter actually watch?</p><p style="text-align: left;">Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

I am once again checking the, licking my finger, putting it out of the window and figuring out where that is going. I am still on team yes. Stephen Carter, you have historically been on team no.

This morning, I also saw Lisa Young did a little substack post on like, is it time to move? It is time to talk about how this is going to be a break on people renovating their houses, on making new business investments until we have a strong political leadership that kicks it to the curb. It is time to make, to force Danielle Smith, because she&#39;s the government we have right now, to do that. It can be done, but somebody needs to get up off their ass. And it&#39;s obviously not going to be Carter, but I do think it needs to be a broad coalition of the rest of us, and Carter can come later.</div>

And I&#39;ve also seen over the last little while, it has been tough for Niche and the NDP to break through with the pro-Canada message. They are doing so to the base, but it doesn&#39;t look to me like they are doing so beyond that. It is easier to just go absolutely crazy, braveheart, knife between the teeth at Smith. uh</div>

And there is a drumbeat to it, Carter, that I think is outside of a campaign structure. infrastructure and and i also think in the attention economy you have to build more of a drumbeat it&#39;s not just one campaign it has to be a constant refrain of people talking about the economic social cultural consequences uh of indulging this stuff and it goes beyond just a you know fantasy football of of separation it&#39;s what this does how it undermines the social fabric and and all of those other arguments that need to start to be made and in order to punch through they have to be frequent and they have to come on all channels absolutely</div>

He takes a taxpayer funded trip to meet his BFF, J.D. Vance. He sees Marco Rubio. Oh, and by the way, this is not a sanctioned trip from his friends in the Conservative Party. In fact, Pierre Polyev looks like a complete beta on this and has not said jack fuck all about Jamil Javani taking a what seemed like a Jamil Javani party trip. Because if you look at the video, it&#39;s all Jamil Javani at the back. No conservative branding. That&#39;s interesting to me. And of course, Mark Carney had some choice words about Giovanni in his trip saying LeBlanc briefed him. But this guy is not even the trade critic for his own party, let alone the minister.</div>

And that&#39;s where it becomes quite risky, right, of him essentially handing over to the Americans some lines of attack on Canada as we are in a sort of will they or won&#39;t they phase of actually negotiating COSMA. So that&#39;s why he did it. He wanted to be able to at some point now or in the short term future be able to make the argument you are doing it wrong. And here&#39;s how I know, because J.D. Vance told me X, because Marco Rubio told me Y. etc right um but</div>

Because that will, Harper&#39;s version will withstand some of the, you know, the push and pull of politics. politics polyamorous won&#39;t because it&#39;s way too pro-trump uh and he&#39;s got too much within his own caucus and within his own base that can destabilize him whereas harper uh you know say what you like about him and certainly i have a person who has i but i i am trying to imagine a scenario where some rando and his caucus beetled down to the united states to have some meetings in dc it It would never have fucking happened because Harper knew exactly what his leadership of this country was and he articulated it again last week.
