            <span class="text">i wasn&#39;t intending to discuss this but i will say i was just i&#39;m in edmonton right now and i was at west ed and half the retailers i went to including sport check Trek, TNT Supermarket, like just a random sort of swashbuckle of different retailers, all had signs talking about the GSD holiday as if it was their promotion. Like they were like, GSD, get the GSD off in their own typeface, in their own banners, like custom printed signs. So in some ways, it&#39;s interesting. Maybe it&#39;s a nice incentive, but I don&#39;t know. Corey, like any thoughts on what&#39;s up here? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I&#39;ll say this. I still think it&#39;s not a super thing to do. And obviously, the polling shows that Canadians are pretty skeptical about it, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be helping the Trudeau government in any way, shape, or form. You want to take that? You want to take that? I&#39;m okay. You want to take that, Stephen? No, take it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

Now, the NDP, a week later, have landed in the same position that many wanted them to be in, which is definitiveness, a certainty, and a clarity.</span>

I think that that&#39;s probably the most likely outcome, and I think that that makes it very easy for Jagmeet Singh to say, at the next opportunity, I promise to do something, and knowing in his heart, as he does, that that promise is pretty lukewarm, right? Right. It&#39;s just it&#39;s not much of a definitive statement when you know that you&#39;re not going to have to actually worry about it until the very end.</span>

Does it mean – like I want to get to that in a second. But give me – because if we go there, we lose Singh in the mix. So, Corey, give me your comments on Singh in particular and then let&#39;s go to what does this naturally kind of mean? like where do the dominoes fall sort of thing add some clarity for us between the two of you but corey your thoughts on jagmeet singh first well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah yeah no no i was when when trudeau&#39;s own finance minister is saying hey this isn&#39;t really working for me the ndp couldn&#39;t come to that very obvious conclusion And he gave just the absolute weakest, oh, all options are on the table commentary. And then you saw members of his caucus be more definitive. And then you saw some of that definitiveness almost walked back by the party. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. So that&#39;s interesting to me too, right? And I think that that really brings in the point that I want to make, which is it tells us that the NDP caucus was probably a little bit divided on this. there were clearly hawks in the NDP caucus and doves in terms of bringing down the federal government.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not really sure. It certainly seems like Singh was a dove, but I don&#39;t know. Ultimately, he did end up on the right position. But now, more than anything, I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">want to know what that conversation looks like in the NDP, where there was any doubt as to whether they should take this approach or not.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And you know there had to be that conversation, because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t see people reining in like that. You wouldn&#39;t see them pulling back from a position they&#39;re going to land on just a couple of days later and that&#39;s really interesting that maybe suggests that singh is not as</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as in command maybe as uh sometimes we just assume he is because he&#39;s leader and we don&#39;t hear the same leadership drama about the uh the ndp as we hear about the liberals but it&#39;s worth watching and it maybe suggests that he&#39;s not entirely driving the bus on this or in classic ndp fashion there&#39;s like 10 bus</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. Corey, can you hold on to the rest of your thought? Carter, which do you think is more likely? Singh is not in control? To use Corey&#39;s analogy, that there&#39;s several bus drivers on said orange bus.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that there&#39;s probably more bus drivers. I think that Singh is in control. If he wasn&#39;t in control, they wouldn&#39;t</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">wouldn&#39;t have tried to walk back the caucus statements. The caucus statements would have been definitive and just left out there. I think that they&#39;re trying to appease the leader and respect the leader in a way that you wouldn&#39;t necessarily see the liberal caucus trying.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s expand this, right? So the NDP, four days after it was obvious to everybody that this had to be their position, makes it their position. They stay in the confidence and supply agreement a year beyond when it&#39;s obvious to everybody they need to start finding an exit point from it. They&#39;re seeming to be very slow on reacting. And this in particular, I think, for me has crystallized this notion that one of their challenges is they can&#39;t move fast enough to keep up with politics. Like they might just have some kind of tactical problems at their heart that are not going to serve them very well in a 35 day election campaign. So they better fucking figure out a military footing for this thing. They should have done it long ago. Because they seem a step behind. I think that&#39;s my observation of the NDP. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">well, let&#39;s run two scenarios. One is Trudeau is planning to stick around for some indeterminate amount of time, and one is he&#39;s not. If he is planning to stick around, Carter has laid it out pretty cleanly there. The</span>

            <span class="text">The fact of the matter is the House will come back. There will be confidence votes that can be constructed out of moments like budget, but otherwise you can just push all of those opposition days as late as you want, as late as you can, and buy yourself the time and just know that it&#39;s all going to end in the spring, right? You&#39;re going to have a spring election and you start gearing yourself accordingly. You try to make sure that you&#39;ve got all of those budget goodies ready to go. You&#39;re building everything entirely through that communications lens. And you just say, this is the end of this parliament. Maybe there&#39;s some faint hope that you can get the Bloc Quebecois to give you a couple more months. But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s particularly wise going into an election when they&#39;re your primary opponents. Well, maybe you flatter yourself as the Liberals to call yourself the Bloc&#39;s primary opponents at this point. But it doesn&#39;t seem like it would be a particularly wise idea to show the bloc as effective just before you go shilling for votes in Quebec. So that&#39;s the scenario. I think you just, you know, this election is probably coming at the latest in February, in that even if they&#39;ve pushed the opposition days as far as they can, if</span>

            <span class="text">if he&#39;s resigning, which I still believe is probably the most likely outcome here. I mean, we&#39;ve even jumped over because it&#39;s no longer interesting or surprising, but the Ontario caucus apparently came to a consensus of the 51 people that they want to move on from Trudeau and that this was supposed to be delivered.</span>

And even if he went into an election, the fact that his own caucus has now done these things, isn&#39;t that just the conservative campaign ad? I mean, they&#39;re going to have 100 campaign ads, but that&#39;s certainly going to be a damning one. So I think he goes, and then I think he does prorogue. There is an open question how that prorogation goes. I believe it would be given, but that&#39;s not 100% certain. And then I think we end up with a late spring election in that everybody&#39;s already staked their ground. There&#39;s a new leader. Let&#39;s just say for fun, it&#39;s Chrystia Freeland. She comes in, introduces a throne speech and a budget. It all falls on that right away, off to the races. Boom, there you go. So that,</span>

Do you still want to play about the ghost of Trudeau even if he ends up leaving? How do you start thinking about some of these things, right? Because there&#39;s going to be a bit of dynamism on the liberal side. I&#39;m not saying dynamism is going to be necessarily positive for them, but some change could happen.

            <span class="text">But from a comms rhetoric strategic point of view, the actual reality of what one can do versus what one should do is different. Do you like this move by Pierre Polyev? Do you like this line of thinking? Do you like this strategy by Pierre Polyev? It&#39;s not necessarily new, but it&#39;s a bit creative in a sense. And I thought it&#39;d be worthy of our commentary for half a second. Carter, to you right after court. Yeah. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">Look, I&#39;ll say that Pierre Polyev is pretty good at communications and pretty good at political strategy. He&#39;s shown a lot of adroitness in boxing people in, making them in the awkward position. He&#39;s tortured Jagmeet Singh over the past couple of months on this point, in my opinion. And he knows where this is all going. He absolutely absolutely understands that the very next step is to prorogue parliament if there&#39;s a new leader or to try to avoid a confidence vote for as long as possible so he&#39;s going to rely on the fact that our system is very arcane to most canadians and they&#39;re going to say well yeah he clearly doesn&#39;t have the confidence of the house and and most canadians will not get into the nuance of well but technically you know it has to be tested in these ways and the prime minister has is supposed to be his advice accepted until such a time as the confidence is proven blah blah blah right like Like that&#39;s all going to be lost on people. And what he&#39;s trying to create is a sense of illegitimacy of any actions that go on that further his government, even though, of course, everyone can very quickly point to the Harper circuit breaker in 2008, where Harper had faced a very similar situation. The House had expressed outside of the House that they didn&#39;t have confidence in Stephen Harper. And Harper said, no, you know what, we&#39;re just going to we&#39;re going to put pause on this. We&#39;re going to prorogue Parliament. That prorogation was accepted. And when the House came back, I mean, Harper was proven right that it was actually just needing a cool down and he was able then to govern for the next couple of years. So, yeah, I think what he&#39;s trying to do is smart. I think he very much knows that no governor general is going to accept the leader of the opposition demanding these things. That&#39;s not how our system works. But a lot of Canadians will look at it and say, very reasonable argument. Very reasonable argument. Clearly doesn&#39;t have the confidence of the House. Let&#39;s get on with it.</span>

You&#39;ve got to go out there and you&#39;ve got to put yourself on a limb if you want to have a change in leadership.

            <span class="text">Is this a good – I&#39;ve always wondered about this, right? Right. Like there&#39;s always a big sort of even when the three of us used to work together, there&#39;d be clients would say, turn ads off on the holiday season. No one wants to talk about politics. So let&#39;s not do any activity. Like talk to me about this mushy middle when it&#39;s like a political. I&#39;m not talking about advertising per se. I&#39;m talking about putting your political voice out there. Is this a good time to do any of that? Are people actually more available rather than less available? Right. Which is an argument that we&#39;ve made in the past that people are more glued to their phones, not less glued to their phone. So I&#39;m kind of curious, if you were advising someone and if someone&#39;s like, yeah, I need Trudeau gone, I want them gone, should I do it on the 26th? Like, does that make sense, Stephen? Or is everyone Boxing Day shopping? Is that even a thing? Should I do it on the – should I do it in one of these mushy middle days of the end of December? What sort of advice would you generally give around politicking when there&#39;s an active file like this at this time of year?</span>

And I just need your $1,500 in order to make sure that happens. You know, I know you don&#39;t like the leader. Here&#39;s a great way for you to participate in this is to help me by raising me some money so that I can survive and thrive heading into the new year when the leaders when we&#39;re going to have a leadership race. I need to get the money in before the start of the next fiscal year because once we get into the next fiscal year, you&#39;re going to want to make your donations to the leadership candidates that I&#39;m going to make sure happens, because that&#39;s what we need is a real leadership race. I&#39;d be pushing on the fundraising door. I&#39;d be pushing on the organizational door. I&#39;d be just going, going, going right now.</span>

But that&#39;s not actually the question you have. Is it worth it at this price? Is it worth it relative to the other things I can do? I&#39;ll tell you, this time of year, very expensive time to advertise, right? And if you don&#39;t need to be paying to fight with the retailers during Christmas season, don&#39;t.

You have to make sure the government functions, government functions properly, but don&#39;t be thinking that you&#39;re going to be the star of media releases and media opportunities for the next few months.</span>
