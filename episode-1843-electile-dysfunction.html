        <p>Corey Hogan brings that wearing-a-tie energy, Stephen Carter brings that wearing-a-hoodie energy and Zain Velji announces a new career. The gang convene to discuss the strategy of the rolling Ottawa drama and check in on our increasingly-alarming southern neighbours.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk Singh's NDP revoking confidence, the threat of a spring election and what all the parties should be doing right now - plus a rundown of Trump's expansionist ambitions and Rep. Matt Gaetz' crimes and near-crimes. Should Pierre Poilievre be "constrained by the reality of the situation"? What does it even mean to be an ally of the United States in 2024? And in your head, is Zain's moustache as NC-17 as it is in real life? It isn't. Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">Corey, let&#39;s expand this, right? So the NDP, four days after it was obvious to everybody that this had to be their position, makes it their position. They stay in the confidence and supply agreement a year beyond when it&#39;s obvious to everybody they need to start finding an exit point from it. They&#39;re seeming to be very slow on reacting. And this in particular, I think, for me has crystallized this notion that one of their challenges is they can&#39;t move fast enough to keep up with politics. Like they might just have some kind of tactical problems at their heart that are not going to serve them very well in a 35 day election campaign. So they better fucking figure out a military footing for this thing. They should have done it long ago. Because they seem a step behind. I think that&#39;s my observation of the NDP. Yeah,</div>

There will be confidence votes that can be constructed out of moments like budget, but otherwise you can just push all of those opposition days as late as you want, as late as you can, and buy yourself the time and just know that it&#39;s all going to end in the spring, right? You&#39;re going to have a spring election and you start gearing yourself accordingly. You try to make sure that you&#39;ve got all of those budget goodies ready to go. You&#39;re building everything entirely through that communications lens. And you just say, this is the end of this parliament. Maybe there&#39;s some faint hope that you can get the Bloc Quebecois to give you a couple more months. But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s particularly wise going into an election when they&#39;re your primary opponents. Well, maybe you flatter yourself as the Liberals to call yourself the Bloc&#39;s primary opponents at this point. But it doesn&#39;t seem like it would be a particularly wise idea to show the bloc as effective just before you go shilling for votes in Quebec. So that&#39;s the scenario.

I mean, they&#39;re going to have 100 campaign ads, but that&#39;s certainly going to be a damning one. So I think he goes, and then I think he does prorogue. There is an open question how that prorogation goes. I believe it would be given, but that&#39;s not 100% certain. And then I think we end up with a late spring election in that everybody&#39;s already staked their ground. There&#39;s a new leader. Let&#39;s just say for fun, it&#39;s Chrystia Freeland.

          <div class="said">Look, I&#39;ll say that Pierre Polyev is pretty good at communications and pretty good at political strategy. He&#39;s shown a lot of adroitness in boxing people in, making them in the awkward position. He&#39;s tortured Jagmeet Singh over the past couple of months on this point, in my opinion. And he knows where this is all going. He absolutely absolutely understands that the very next step is to prorogue parliament if there&#39;s a new leader or to try to avoid a confidence vote for as long as possible so he&#39;s going to rely on the fact that our system is very arcane to most canadians and they&#39;re going to say well yeah he clearly doesn&#39;t have the confidence of the house and and most canadians will not get into the nuance of well but technically you know it has to be tested in these ways and the prime minister has is supposed to be his advice accepted until such a time as the confidence is proven blah blah blah right like Like that&#39;s all going to be lost on people. And what he&#39;s trying to create is a sense of illegitimacy of any actions that go on that further his government, even though, of course, everyone can very quickly point to the Harper circuit breaker in 2008, where Harper had faced a very similar situation. The House had expressed outside of the House that they didn&#39;t have confidence in Stephen Harper. And Harper said, no, you know what, we&#39;re just going to we&#39;re going to put pause on this. We&#39;re going to prorogue Parliament. That prorogation was accepted. And when the House came back, I mean, Harper was proven right that it was actually just needing a cool down and he was able then to govern for the next couple of years. So, yeah, I think what he&#39;s trying to do is smart. I think he very much knows that no governor general is going to accept the leader of the opposition demanding these things. That&#39;s not how our system works. But a lot of Canadians will look at it and say, very reasonable argument. Very reasonable argument. Clearly doesn&#39;t have the confidence of the House. Let&#39;s get on with it.</div>

Like there&#39;s always a big sort of even when the three of us used to work together, there&#39;d be clients would say, turn ads off on the holiday season. No one wants to talk about politics. So let&#39;s not do any activity. Like talk to me about this mushy middle when it&#39;s like a political. I&#39;m not talking about advertising per se. I&#39;m talking about putting your political voice out there. Is this a good time to do any of that? Are people actually more available rather than less available? Right. Which is an argument that we&#39;ve made in the past that people are more glued to their phones, not less glued to their phone. So I&#39;m kind of curious, if you were advising someone and if someone&#39;s like, yeah, I need Trudeau gone, I want them gone, should I do it on the 26th? Like, does that make sense, Stephen? Or is everyone Boxing Day shopping? Is that even a thing? Should I do it on the – should I do it in one of these mushy middle days of the end of December? What sort of advice would you generally give around politicking when there&#39;s an active file like this at this time of year?</div>

And I just need your $1,500 in order to make sure that happens. You know, I know you don&#39;t like the leader. Here&#39;s a great way for you to participate in this is to help me by raising me some money so that I can survive and thrive heading into the new year when the leaders when we&#39;re going to have a leadership race. I need to get the money in before the start of the next fiscal year because once we get into the next fiscal year, you&#39;re going to want to make your donations to the leadership candidates that I&#39;m going to make sure happens, because that&#39;s what we need is a real leadership race.
