This is the worst kind of nepotism because anything the Democrats do is actually bad. Anything that the the Republicans do isn&#39;t bad. And I think that that is at the core of being a Republican right now. Now, hypocrisy and the inability to see your own situation is, in fact, the core of republicanism.</div>

And CNN is skirting a major issue where this man, this governor of New York using a position of power and influence has harassed at least 11 women. So yeah, it is the worst form of nepotism.</div>

So CNN, there was analysis done that ultimately concluded that CNN has been tamping down coverage of the investigation to Andrew Cuomo on his brother&#39;s show. Of course, as some people might remember, there was these viral clips during the pandemic where the brothers would interview each other and have this back and forth sort of chuckle fest. And we&#39;ve also learned that Chris Cuomo has been part of his brother&#39;s like core strategy cabinet as related to these assault allegations. If you&#39;re CNN right now, they&#39;ve given him like this this voluntary like he can step aside, do his thing. They haven&#39;t mandated anything from him. Would you cut him off at this point? How would you kind of think about handling this from a communications perspective when your credibility as an institution, I&#39;m talking about CNN here, I would say there&#39;s a brighter spotlight on it than perhaps even during the Trump administration.</div>

          <div class="said">Let&#39;s move on to our next headline. This one comes to us from Reuters. Lack of strong rival may hurt Canada&#39;s Trudeau in election. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces an unusual challenge as he prepares to call an early election without a strong opponent to rail against. The vote may fragment to leave him with another minority government. Corey, do you buy the power of apathy slash no strong opponent argument on Justin Trudeau&#39;s path that he will begin, I&#39;m sure, very soon to form his majority government? Well,</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I don&#39;t know. How cursed is this particular argument, Stephen? I remember hearing this about Alison Redford in 2012. She was going to win all of these seats. I remember hearing that Jim Prentice was going to clear the tables in Alberta. This lack of strong rival thing, you know, in many ways, I&#39;ve become convinced it&#39;s a bit of a canary in the coal mine, because it&#39;s really nobody&#39;s paying attention right now. Like, in some ways, that&#39;s actually what is going on. And that makes for a very volatile election. And I just don&#39;t buy it. Like, you can say that Aaron O&#39;Toole is not a strong rival</div>

          <div class="said">Let&#39;s move on to our next headline. This one comes to us from CBC. Trudeau asks top public servant to look into mandatory vaccination for federal workers. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said today, as in Thursday, he has asked the clerk of the Privy Council to look into making vaccines mandatory for federal employees and is pleading with hesitant Canadians to get their shots. He&#39;s like, this is why I&#39;ve asked the clerk of the Privy Council, who&#39;s responsible for the Federal Public Service, to look at mandatory vaccination for federal employees. The prime minister also said the government is looking into making vaccines mandatory in federally regulated industries such as airline, banking and rail sectors. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on this one. Talk to me about the Trudeau strategy here. Do you think this is smart? Do you think this is a good idea? And why float it out like this rather than just do it? I feel like we&#39;ve talked about that before, but why is this one kind of more of a I&#39;ve asked rather than this is our plan and come out with it after you have it all fully banked and fully formed?</div>

          <div class="said">Okay, we might be up for an election starting as soon as Sunday. Guys, I want to talk to you about strategy of not just Trudeau, but let&#39;s start with the strategy of Jagmeet Singh and Aaron O&#39;Toole. And let&#39;s start with Aaron O&#39;Toole. Today, he puts out this video on Twitter that says, now&#39;s not the time for the election. We can&#39;t do this. This isn&#39;t the time to come together. We&#39;re in a fourth wave. Kind of funny, given the fact that, you know, his provincial partner in crime, Jason Kenney, has effectively declared victory on COVID in some way, shape or form. But, you know, to what it is, Aaron O&#39;Toole says we shouldn&#39;t be going to the polls. We don&#39;t need an election now. Jagmeet Singh has been saying that for a long time. I think his strategy crescendoed earlier last week when he said that the governor general should not agree to Justin Trudeau&#39;s calls for an election. Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on this. What do you think of both of these gents, leaders of the Conservative and NDP respectively, and their strategies, almost kicking and screaming, heading towards an election that almost seems inevitable in the next couple of weeks here? Do you like this if you are in either of their camps right now? And is this good strategy for either of their camps right now? Let&#39;s start there. This</div>

So yeah, if I&#39;m O&#39;Toole, if I&#39;m Singh, I think absolutely make this investment, because the only people paying attention are not in play. When we talked the other day about your election is about the people who are in play, this is what I mean.

But one of the things that the conservatives clearly have determined, and whether they&#39;re right or not, I guess in election campaign will show is that Justin Trudeau is vulnerable on the ethics question. I think going back to January in particular, I think of the statements that Aaron O&#39;Toole put out. Obviously, this was stuff he had in his leadership campaign and after that too, but they are so focused on the ethics question. I&#39;m sure they have some polling somewhere somehow that says people are kind of a little done with Justin Trudeau and his ethical failings. Now, does that mean that this is what he wants to talk about the entire time? No, but they&#39;ve obviously got a sense that they&#39;ve got an audience for this message and so if you&#39;re going to bridge into an election and that election is called over your protests why would you not wrap it into this particular key message of yours now you do have your secure the future plan and a lot of that is about the economy and i suspect that is what they&#39;re going to be talking about over the next bit here presuming an election gets called in the next couple of weeks that&#39;s</div>

He&#39;s spending it, and he&#39;s spending it, and he&#39;s spending it, and he&#39;s calling that a of recovery, but it&#39;s time to move past that and try to move to businesses to recover. It&#39;s time for your enterprise to recover. It&#39;s time for your small business to recover. It&#39;s time to get people back to work. That&#39;s how recovery starts, not by mailing more checks to employers, not by mailing more checks to corporations, not by writing down rents, not by doing all the things that Justin Trudeau has done to get us through this pandemic.

One of the things that O&#39;Toole did that was noteworthy in an overall, you know, not very noteworthy leadership race with Peter McKay was he outflanked Peter McKay on the environmental question, right? People saw O&#39;Toole as being the more conservative choice, McKay being the more classic PC choice. And he He was the first to aggressively take on environment. We&#39;re seeing that issue salience right now in this election in terms of which issues being prioritized in the minds of Canadians is constantly shifting. It&#39;s volatile, right? Pandemic was first. It&#39;s now ninth or fifth, depending on which pollster you read and consume. Is there something to be said of O&#39;Toole trying to fight on day one or week one on traditional Trudeau turf, maybe with something like environment or something like that? Is that bad strategy? And tell me why. I&#39;m just going to throw it out there. I want to get your reactions to that, and then we&#39;ll turn to the prime minister himself, what a good launch for him looks like.

But to your point, I&#39;m not sure I see it either. And maybe this will kind of lead me to my next question, which is, I don&#39;t know if you guys agree, but I feel like as it relates to what I&#39;d call the volatile issue salience in this campaign, we&#39;re not actually, we don&#39;t have a key issue that we&#39;re running this thing on. There might be a suite, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a key thing. It might be economic recovery if O&#39;Toole is successful and, you know, the debt deficit as an issue starts climbing up the ranks in the polling, what advice would you have to groups right now that are going to try to make this election, I&#39;m talking now third party and advocacy groups, that are going to try to get their issue into the mix, saying that there maybe is a little bit of malleability in terms of what this election could be about, like whether that&#39;s affordability or poverty or, you know, child care or your income, whatever that might look like. Like, advice to groups that are trying to get their thing to be considered as part of the ballot box question. Maybe, Carter, I&#39;ll start with you on this.</div>

Guys, let&#39;s move it on to our home province of Alberta. Alberta&#39;s top doctor is defending the province&#39;s plan to lift all COVID-19 health restrictions despite mounting concerns from physicians and political leaders across the country, which now includes Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu. In a letter to Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro, she agrees with the Canadian Pediatric Society&#39;s description of the province&#39;s move as a, quote, unnecessary and risky gamble, unquote. She said, this is Minister Hajdu, that recent modeling for Alberta&#39;s forecasts are a more serious resurgence in cases fueled by the Delta variant, and that all governments need to take reasonable steps to protect Canadians. Carter, give it to me, your 30-second elevator pitch of where the state of affairs in Alberta lie in your mind. I&#39;ll do the same with Corey, and then let&#39;s dig into some of the politics of letter, op-ed, all the sort of moving pieces we saw over this past week. But high level, 30 seconds, go.</div>

They are therefore removing, it&#39;s not just the removal of, you know, ideas or, you know, the restrictions. It&#39;s actually the removal of testing, the removal of the reporting, the removal of the requirements to quarantine. So if you get sick with COVID-19, you can still go to work.

And then secondly, the comparison to other, you know, things that we&#39;ve been neglecting and not dealing with in the healthcare side of things, using examples of opioids and syphilis. What did you overall make of that letter? And Corey, I&#39;ll start with you first. And I did paraphrase a few of the bullet points. You might have others to jump in on with her letter.

          <div class="said">And the reason why it&#39;s an irrational argument is just simple. We test for all kinds of things every single day. Go to your doctor. Take a look at all the tests that are offered to you because when you show up at your doctor, they run a spate of tests just to even sure that you&#39;re healthy. They&#39;ll do a bunch of different tests just to make sure that you are, in fact, healthy without symptoms. Asymptomatic is the word that we&#39;ve now learned that goes with this. And they run those tests because they want to make sure that you&#39;re healthy and they We want to make sure that you&#39;re able to live to the best of your ability. We have the lowest vaccination rates in Canada. If we were vaccinated at 75% or 80%, I could maybe see myself getting around this. But all we&#39;re asking is, number one, test. Number two, report. Number three, if you get the fucking disease, quarantine. these aren&#39;t extraordinary measures that we are asking for these are the minimum requirements that any every other jurisdiction by the way every other jurisdiction is doing these things so when we say well this makes sense to me it doesn&#39;t make sense to any other medical officer of health it doesn&#39;t make sense in any other context so why does it make sense here it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s a it is ridiculous to me and uh they&#39;re paying a price because these are the prices that they&#39;re comfortable paying.

How do governments generally view protests and public action like this? I&#39;m curious if you guys could both speak to that from your government experience. Do they just view it from the optics of it and like where the crescendo is? Could I be extending us for an hour? I very well could. Oh, my</div>

The issue, you know, when you get 3000 postcards that are coming from the exact same source with the exact same letter, you don&#39;t care.
