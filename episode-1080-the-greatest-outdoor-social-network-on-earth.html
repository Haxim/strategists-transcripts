We do know what Elon Musk said, which is too many people are scraping Twitter. So this is like an emergency measure. So us normal people, we get 600 tweets. I think if you&#39;re Twitter blue, you get what? A couple thousand.</span>

But Corey, you were saying that this is the we don&#39;t really have a good understanding of the context, the rationale of a founder who bought a platform is trying to make it financially viable and is perhaps implementing a strategy for you to be on it less. In fact, tweets out saying go outside, get off Twitter, like paraphrasing, but there was a tweet of his over the weekend that said pretty much that yeah</span>

            <span class="text">well okay so let&#39;s just throw it all on the table so there was the idea that they had the google cloud problem they no longer had access to some of this baseline infrastructure there was a suggestion that twitter was essentially doing a ddos attack on itself and that its apis were making massive api calls and until they fixed the problem they needed to reduce access to it there was the idea that uh elon musk simply wanted to throttle access so that the addicts out there would pay their six dollars us a month in order to get twitter blue and as as observed by um you know this person online the fact that twitter stopped paying their hosting bill and that was only one of like four theories as to why this was going down tells you everything you need to know about the current state of twitter like they we are just playing calvin ball here he&#39;s making up the rules as he goes along none of this makes any fucking sense it&#39;s absolutely crazy uh it&#39;s a real testament to the durability of the platform as a core idea and as a network and as a community that it&#39;s survived so long under elon musk but we&#39;re at the 250 day mark with this guy and holy shit has he fucked this one up he&#39;s fucked this up pretty Pretty badly.

Like, should we just let Twitter die at death because, you know, and of course, there&#39;s going to be startups and other companies trying to replicate it as it leaves a whole. But give me your dispassionate perspective as a communicator, as a strategist, as a lover of sort of democracy and information. Do you feel like this form of interaction should not be recreated in that sense? I don&#39;t want you to give me your business take and see if there&#39;s an opportunity. I want to give me your communications, political strategy, democracy take, because I I think that&#39;s the most interesting conversation to me right now.</span>

Well, I think that this is the second or third iteration of this actual platform being created and used, because I would argue that Facebook kind of started like this as well. It was more of a text-based update type of thing. We&#39;re sharing information and sharing other links and things you might find interesting. This is a cute cat video. You should look at this cute cat video or whatever it might have been. in. That sharing was easy and it was entertaining. There&#39;s lots of things that we posted. And then it became more and more and more and more. And it became photos. It wanted to be Instagram. It wanted to be scheduling. It wanted to create events. It became the everything app.</span>

I think that fundamentally, these are all poking at different ways that people connect with each other. And there&#39;s a desire to connect. And of course, we&#39;re all rooted in our phones. And having our phones be a portal to connection is a pretty natural bandaid that people have figured out, whether whether that be Facebook, or Twitter, or Insta, or TikTok now, or you name it. But like, this is a constantly evolving space. And, and some of us just sort of die hard on different platforms. But the reality is Twitter was struggling with, you know, daily average users to begin with you had, Facebook&#39;s got the same challenge, this space just evolves, it moves on. And, you know, some people will take what works. And some people will say, you know, we&#39;re not gonna do that anymore. And, you know, you think about Snapchat, for example, well, Instagram swooped in, stole some features they thought worked well and and there you go and they&#39;re all chasing each other and they&#39;re all doing that and you&#39;re going to have people like blue sky say well look i mean twitter had a foundational core of tens of millions of users who used it for for news and if their big problem with twitter is just that it&#39;s twitter well we can you know we can call it distributed and we can shine it up in this particular way and there you go you can still have your twitter and and if they manage to recreate that network and get a critical mass then yeah i&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a bunch of people who are using a tool like twitter going forward it here but you</span>

I talk about this every year, and I love to talk about it. Carter, it&#39;s the Calgary Stampede. It is here, and I want to talk about it very quickly from the perspective of what it means to the politics of our province. We&#39;re on the heels of an election. The question I have to you, Carter, is does the Stampede matter at all on the heels of a provincial election? It is a time where we&#39;ve called it the political petting zoo. Federal politicians from all over come to see it. You see politicians glad-handing, attending GR events, events, attending community events. The question I have fundamentally is, does the stampede matter at all after an election, or is it just a real advantageous petting zoo prior to an election? Talk to me about this.</span>

            <span class="text">I think that for those of us that are really tied up in elections, it loses a little bit of its luster after an election. But realistically, most people aren&#39;t tied up in it. They just want to see their politicians. And what a great way to be seen. you know you&#39;re flipping those pancakes you&#39;re smiling at people you&#39;re you know pouring the syrup onto their pancakes you&#39;re giving them the scoop of fruit if it&#39;s a if it&#39;s a high-end stampede breakfast otherwise they get you know the piece of overcooked sausage I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s all very exciting and people will line up and they will get their free breakfast as they have for the last 100 years and politicians will hand them out with a smile and people will have access to those politicians in a way that frankly we don&#39;t have every single day plus you know we will still see the march of other political levels um all out to calgary to to do what they do you know justin trudeau will be here jagmeet singh will be here um you know like uh</span>

            <span class="text">like the thing about stampede we might have talked about this in years past but i just want to say it again is it&#39;s not like you see one person at one event you end up being in a traveling road show where you&#39;re at like the same wild of like eight different events in a row you&#39;re seeing the same people like there is just a crowd of 3 000 people in this city who go to political tide stampede events right yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so there&#39;s thinking like who are we trying to get to what are we going to say to them how are we going to create first impressions for our organization in those particular places so they are really sweating how those first interactions go and so as a politician those are high meaning interactions for you not because they mean anything to you they don&#39;t you&#39;re drinking from the fire hose you&#39;ve just finished an election especially if you&#39;re a new politician but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but there&#39;s such an asymmetry in how much people care about that meeting at this particular moment really really important and you can make a massive impression if you as a politician have command of that particular event in a way you can&#39;t in a year two or a year three stampede frankly right because by then your your wallpaper your furniture everyone&#39;s like oh there&#39;s the minister right oh there&#39;s the minister and those interactions don&#39;t mean particularly much so that&#39;s that&#39;s one part the second part is like</span>

            <span class="text">lot of fucking reps in this particular period and if you&#39;re a politician who uses them And you will find yourself markedly better by the end of the summer. Don&#39;t be the politician who sits there with other politicians and avoids talking to the crowd and avoids going out. So it&#39;s an immense training opportunity for new politicians as well. So those are the two main reasons why I think it actually matters a lot, the stampede right after an election. Oh,</span>

If you&#39;re either of the leaders right now, Rachel Notley or Daniel Smith, are you telling your first timers, you&#39;re signing up for everything and you&#39;re camping out in Calgary, you&#39;re building these muscles over the course of the next 10 days? Are you mandating that? Or are you less sold than Corey that this can be a mini 10-day degree for you? What are you doing if you&#39;re chief of staff to either of the two, opposition leader or the premier? More</span>

And, you know, you can just shut off afterwards and say, oh, we&#39;re done now. We&#39;re done. You&#39;re never done. Right. You&#39;re never done. There&#39;s there&#39;s times when there&#39;s less pressure and there&#39;s times when there&#39;s more pressure. But right now is the opportunity to really test your muscles and to see if you&#39;ve got what you need to have to to press the flesh, to have people come to your events, to really showcase who you are to the leader.

I would say, you&#39;ve got 10 days, host three events, have a donor event, have a public event, have a stakeholder event, go, right? I expect to see some good turnout at all of these events. I expect you to attend four events a day. I expect you at those events to have 10 meaningful interactions an hour that your EA is logging and identifying or your constituency manager. That&#39;s somebody that I&#39;ve now got on a Rolodex card, not literally folks, you know, in a computer is fine. But like, that&#39;s a connection that I have now made. And that should result in 10 follow up meetings that you offer. Most will fall through, most will not happen. But at least they know you&#39;ve made a connection and you&#39;ve attempted to get them somewhere on the calendar.

            <span class="text">like the last point Corey brought up, Carter. I want your reaction to that. But I want to get into now the nitty gritty of Stampede because Corey&#39;s brought up one of those points. Politicians have rules around consumption, around consumption of alcohol, Corey just mentioned, but also consumption of food. Many just say we&#39;re not eating. We&#39;re flipping the pancakes. We&#39;re never going to eat them. You never get caught eating, right? Right. Right.</span>

You&#39;re eating in the car. You&#39;re doing your own granola bars and cliff bars the whole time. So, Carter, react to what Corey said here. And then I want to get into I want to clarify a point with Corey before I kind of get into my next sort of topic on the stampede here. But your reaction to it is</span>

            <span class="text">is totally right, especially like the drinking one. I mean, there have been so many politicians that have a tendency to get a little inebriated and view the stampede primarily as an opportunity to drink, party and get and use their their newly found gravitas to get into all these special parties where, you know, oh, man, we get into the VIP sections. We don&#39;t even have to stand in line. Yeah, there&#39;s a cost to that. The cost may not be monetary, but every single one of those people that&#39;s letting you into those events is going to call come a calling for something from you later. So don&#39;t be running in. Don&#39;t be running up your tab on on their alcohol. Don&#39;t be you know, don&#39;t be behaving like buffoons. And so many of them do. do i&#39;m i mean i&#39;ve made the calls to politicians and that i&#39;ve had to say you&#39;re gonna have to explain to me what the fuck you were thinking when you were getting hammered at this event</span>

And certainly they will come with their list of demands very crassly put at that particular moment, because then the transaction, you know, the power is all on the other side. side but on the the first one after it&#39;s like okay we&#39;re gonna have to work with this government you know maybe they didn&#39;t think that person would be government maybe they don&#39;t have any kind of connections over there maybe they&#39;re more associated with the other side imagine for example you&#39;re the calgary chamber of commerce and you were somewhat critical of the government maybe you&#39;re trying to walk that back a little and making it clear you&#39;ll work with anybody and listen i don&#39;t think the chamber crossed</span>

We&#39;re going to have to follow up on that. I want to make sure that I&#39;m really... Steven, take a note. Steven, did you get that? You&#39;ve got his contact information, right? Let&#39;s make sure that we set something up in the next two to three weeks, knowing that person&#39;s gone on vacation in the next two to three weeks. We know that that person&#39;s not going to be available. Well, we&#39;re going to be putting something together because that person&#39;s offering us something very interesting that we need to listen to or whatever. But the staffer is moving so hard. especially the primary body person, that staffer is working to gather all the information, remember what matters, prioritize it afterwards, and then make sure that all the follow-up happens. And we are literally talking about, you could be dealing with a thousand contacts, each one of which is going to have to be prioritized and followed up upon.</span>

And it&#39;s Joe Clark saying, Joe Clark&#39;s playing his part. He&#39;s saying, oh, I would love to meet with you, Stephen. Get that information.

But Corey&#39;s on this topic. Let&#39;s talk about this. Carter, how do you have a meaningful interaction with a minister or a premier or someone you need as an organization or as someone who wants to get another follow-up conversation or a meeting? And more so, I kind of ask, how do you do it and not being annoying? Because it&#39;s not just one meeting. You&#39;re trying to bump into this person multiple times over the course of 10 days. in fact it&#39;s part of your strategy to be like hey you again right full well knowing that the only reason you&#39;re there is to bump into that minister or one of the few people that you wanted to talk yeah right and so you know that they might know that if they&#39;re savvy if they know what your file is they know that so then how do you do it carter that&#39;s that tries to add as much meaning and that tries to not make you just on an interpersonal level annoying as fucking shit because i imagine they have thousands of conversations five of them with the same person starts to get pretty annoying if they&#39;re annoying they&#39;re</span>

How much of a risk should someone take to stand out, Carter? If you were giving a client advice, let&#39;s say they&#39;re asked tomorrow what was a particular minister. To stand out, let&#39;s just say they&#39;re like, you know, they&#39;re like, yeah, how much of a risk should they take if this is like their first and only sort of first foot forward with a new minister that could be on their file for two, three, four years?

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">but public relations doesn&#39;t necessarily equal equal, um, government relations. And the, just because the government is making sure that they are hearing everybody that&#39;s around doesn&#39;t make, doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re listening to anyone. So my, you know, the, the hearing versus listening discussion would be really difficult. If I was advising a client for this, I mean, fuck, you know what I do? I try and get the fuck out of Dodge. I don&#39;t want to be here. I don&#39;t want to be the guy who even appears to be the one looking for the minister&#39;s, uh, ear. I don&#39;t want to be the person who even looks like i need something from these guys i want to appear like i am above all of this and maybe that&#39;s the risk that i would take is really i am so like i am such i am so much better than this opportunity is something that i would love to be able to message</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">my take is that the reason the relationship at stampede doesn&#39;t work as well as you want is that asymmetry we talked about yeah there&#39;s this allusion to porter&#39;s five forces i was talking about you know where you have too many suppliers and only one buyer right so</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so you&#39;ve got to look for different relationships there and there&#39;s a very obvious one at stampede and i think it&#39;s a great in if you have both the right personality if you&#39;re at the right level all of that work the staff you know the staff are often especially if there&#39;s more than one person and going with the minister there&#39;s probably the body person and then there&#39;s probably a couple of hangers on or people around who you know often don&#39;t have that profile don&#39;t have people coming up to them all the time but do do get the minister&#39;s ear and it is an interesting avenue in in my opinion a lot of the time and and so make sure you know who the people around the minister are too think about this in terms of concentric circles yes the minister&#39;s at the center who are the people the minister listens to that are going with the minister to these events that are around the minister and quite often can i tell you in my experience going to many events they&#39;re often standing alone they&#39;re often watching the opposite the stuff from across the way i&#39;ll often at events especially events that like my employer is hosting if i see someone standing alone you know because you want them to have a good time i&#39;ll go up i&#39;ll introduce myself i&#39;ll talk to them i</span>

Do we host something or do we just keep going around the block? What do we do here? I find that interesting in the sense of organizations that have something and maybe even have a bit of resources.

Yeah, he was like leading in the polls. So yeah, I had a similar reaction to Stephen, not nearly as harsh, more like, oh boy, they don&#39;t know how to network at all, right? Like, they&#39;ve got some pretty foundational political skills that they need to develop. Like, we talk about ministers. My God, like these people don&#39;t know how to be candidates, let alone MLAs, right? And I think that&#39;s what I want to underline. It was such an extraordinary election.

I&#39;m sure your province has an example wherever you are listening to this, but that&#39;s a bit of an extreme one. The reality is the risk should not be for somebody who&#39;s been a candidate and has gone door to door and has gone to a ton of events that they come off like a totally unapproachable</span>

            <span class="text">unapproachable dumbass. That should not be the risk. They should have some of those foundational networking, glad-handing skills by this point. The risk should be more, what have they committed to? Have they optimized this? Have they captured any data? Are they any good at that? And those are the skills that I think you can build in those 10 days. Like at the end of the first day, if you look back and you&#39;re like, I don&#39;t know who I met and I have no notes and I didn&#39;t interact with anyone, they probably still feel okay with it.</span>

We&#39;re not going to pre-train you for having these conversations.

And I do want to get back to this notion of like the drunk on power, actually drunk MLAs, right? Like you have to say, like the bigger risk for me is like they start to really feel themselves. They just got elected. They think they can conquer the fucking world. Can I tell you as a former bureaucrat what&#39;s annoying about new governments? They think they can conquer the fucking world. And then, you know, a year later, they&#39;re the exact opposite. Like they&#39;re afraid of their own shadows. They&#39;re in total bunker mode, right? This is the arc of every new government, and there are such hazards with that first step, but it&#39;s all ego-driven. It&#39;s all attitudinal. And as the leader, as</span>

And let&#39;s just expand it to every corner of this country over the barbecue circuit over summer, right? What would you advise people in terms of making their retail robust, in terms of making it memorable so that they&#39;re not just there for the transaction, action that they can hopefully in three years from now count on some of people, some of these folks that they&#39;ve interacted with to be their friends. You&#39;ve got Corey&#39;s challenge of not over committing or not narrowly committing in certain cases, right? You&#39;ve got your sort of scheduling sort of opportunities, but people want to get to know you. How do you, in the most macro sense, roll that up three years from now in terms of them being there for you? Because that&#39;s ultimately what you&#39;re in the business for. As much as it&#39;s getting shit done, it&#39;s also that. So talk to me on the macro as we finish off this topic. As a politician&#39;s goal, their firehose that is Stampede, their firehose that is this summer for many of them. How do, in the Alberta case, three years from now, these folks, whether they&#39;re on the opposition or government side, count on the folks that they interact with to be there for them? Learn</span>

Here&#39;s who you&#39;re going to see. If you see this person, remember that&#39;s Ed, remember that&#39;s John, remember that&#39;s Joanne, remember that&#39;s Zane. And these are the stakeholders that reach out to us most frequently. How would you coach that? I&#39;m just now actually tactically curious more so than strategically curious in that regard, Carter.</span>

Right, because at the end of the day, there is a transaction that is to be had, but that transaction can be coded in friendship And I put friendship in air quotes for those that can&#39;t see. Or it could be actual true. What is the best way to get your shit done? Is friendship what people are looking for in a certain way? And I know it&#39;s a weird question, but I think it&#39;s an appropriate one given what we&#39;re trying to do. You interact with someone multiple times over a week, you might be able to call them a friend by the time two Sundays from now sort of thing. So I guess that is my question. Is that one of the sub-objectives, so to speak, on either side of the equation? And I&#39;m curious because I know that is some people&#39;s strategy in that regard. I</span>

Anyways, hope you&#39;re doing really well. Take care. If you have any questions at all, you be sure to give me a call, right? Hangs up. He says to me, really great advice. I remember it. He&#39;s like, you know, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s going to stop punching me, but maybe he&#39;ll punch me a little lighter next time. And so there was this idea that just by creating that friendly relationship, you made it a little harder for the punch to land hard. And so that&#39;s useful. That&#39;s useful for a politician. That&#39;s useful for somebody who is trying to get something out of a politician. And so, yeah, you should aim for friendly. But know that friendly is a tactic. And know they&#39;re not your actual friends. My God. I mean, how many actual friends can a human being, an adult human being have? I</span>

            <span class="text">this. Yeah, like, listen, in some ways, it&#39;s Stephen Carter&#39;s advice about, like, his client, do I go to the event or do I hold my own event writ large? Do I try to get everybody to K-Days or Expo, whatever Edmonton&#39;s calling their thing now? Or do I go to the Calgary Stampede, the greatest outdoor show on earth where literally everybody already is? It</span>

            <span class="text">kind of makes sense. Like, I don&#39;t know. I mean, like, as an Edmontonian, my ego might be a little bruised to have to come to the Calgary Stampede, but it makes a ton of</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s a fair Fair point. So Carter, final question for you. Advice for the federal parties heading into Stampede. Generic advice. You can get specific if you&#39;d like, if you want to tease it out for the liberals. They&#39;re in a different sort of election cycle, but this might be the Stampede before an election. We never know, right? But it&#39;s also Alberta, so there&#39;s also a different dynamic here when you&#39;re looking at the entire map. But any advice you&#39;d give them? Are you loaning some of Corey&#39;s advice and saying, bring your MPs out here, make this a sandbox for retail politics that you can use at the doors are you what do you what do you kind of think enough if you&#39;re giving advice to the federal parties heading you know heading into stampede season starting in a couple of days</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">days i mean i think that everybody has to come out and do their thing but i don&#39;t think that like if i&#39;m the ndp i&#39;m not thinking you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know this is this is the time that we&#39;re going to turn it all around like have reasonable expectations for what it is that you think you&#39;re going to be able to do and and just focus on those reasonable expectations it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mandatory but it is not expected that you&#39;re going to change your entire future uh just because you attend the the calgary stampede like don&#39;t give away your your principles just come out have a good time stay</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">final word to you advice for the federal federal parties as they head into calgary stampede season well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i think really just having clarity as to what you want out of it the interactions you want to have the people you want to meet if you&#39;re the ndp is it a chance to get all of like the ndp organizers who are going to naturally begin meeting because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because of the their provincial strength and try to get your claws into them if you&#39;re the federal party is that your strategy if you&#39;re the liberals is it to build connections with power brokers in downtown calgary or that&#39;s going to dictate what events you go to uh you know where you&#39;re seeing and what you do just having clear intentions and building your agenda around them rather than just treating it as like well i gotta go to stampede i gotta check that box or we gotta send somebody to stampede so they&#39;re gonna go to stampede and knowing what you&#39;re trying to do will dictate a lot of what follows the problem with any major event like this which becomes like this calendar tent pole where everybody has to go is it becomes an objective in its own right and people forget why it was an objective in the first place like why they bothered to go to these events so refocusing on on outcomes, being really strong with yourself as to metrics, the things you&#39;re going to get done, the people you&#39;re going to meet, the volume of activity. That&#39;s my advice to federal parties.</span>
