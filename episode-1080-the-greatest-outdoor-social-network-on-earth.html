        <div class="desc"><p>After a brief detour onto Twitter's continued implosion, the gang spend the hour diving deep into the politics of the Calgary Stampede: how to get attention, how to give it, the value to politicians and the possibilities for those trying to get politicians' ears.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the politics of the Calgary Stampede - how much it matters (or doesn't) and how politicians and those looking to rub elbows with politicians get the most out of it. How does a newly appointed Minister build meaningful political capital? How does a group lobbying the government have their message break through and stand out from the crowd? And how many tweets are in Stephen Carter's draft folder about his love for his Twitter community? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

We do know what Elon Musk said, which is too many people are scraping Twitter. So this is like an emergency measure. So us normal people, we get 600 tweets.

But Corey, you were saying that this is the we don&#39;t really have a good understanding of the context, the rationale of a founder who bought a platform is trying to make it financially viable and is perhaps implementing a strategy for you to be on it less.

Like, should we just let Twitter die at death because, you know, and of course, there&#39;s going to be startups and other companies trying to replicate it as it leaves a whole. But give me your dispassionate perspective as a communicator, as a strategist, as a lover of sort of democracy and information. Do you feel like this form of interaction should not be recreated in that sense? I don&#39;t want you to give me your business take and see if there&#39;s an opportunity. I want to give me your communications, political strategy, democracy take, because I I think that&#39;s the most interesting conversation to me right now.</div>

          <div class="said">now. Well, I think that this is the second or third iteration of this actual platform being created and used, because I would argue that Facebook kind of started like this as well. It was more of a text-based update type of thing. We&#39;re sharing information and sharing other links and things you might find interesting. This is a cute cat video. You should look at this cute cat video or whatever it might have been. in. That sharing was easy and it was entertaining. There&#39;s lots of things that we posted. And then it became more and more and more and more. And it became photos. It wanted to be Instagram. It wanted to be scheduling. It wanted to create events. It became the everything app.</div>

I&#39;ve heard the same thing said about every workplace I&#39;ve ever worked in. You could say that about community writ large. I think that fundamentally, these are all poking at different ways that people connect with each other. And there&#39;s a desire to connect. And of course, we&#39;re all rooted in our phones. And having our phones be a portal to connection is a pretty natural bandaid that people have figured out, whether whether that be Facebook, or Twitter, or Insta, or TikTok now, or you name it. But like, this is a constantly evolving space. And, and some of us just sort of die hard on different platforms. But the reality is Twitter was struggling with, you know, daily average users to begin with you had, Facebook&#39;s got the same challenge, this space just evolves, it moves on. And, you know, some people will take what works. And some people will say, you know, we&#39;re not gonna do that anymore. And, you know, you think about Snapchat, for example, well, Instagram swooped in, stole some features they thought worked well and and there you go and they&#39;re all chasing each other and they&#39;re all doing that and you&#39;re going to have people like blue sky say well look i mean twitter had a foundational core of tens of millions of users who used it for for news and if their big problem with twitter is just that it&#39;s twitter well we can you know we can call it distributed and we can shine it up in this particular way and there you go you can still have your twitter and and if they manage to recreate that network and get a critical mass then yeah i&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be a bunch of people who are using a tool like twitter going forward it here but you</div>

I talk about this every year, and I love to talk about it. Carter, it&#39;s the Calgary Stampede. It is here, and I want to talk about it very quickly from the perspective of what it means to the politics of our province. We&#39;re on the heels of an election. The question I have to you, Carter, is does the Stampede matter at all on the heels of a provincial election? It is a time where we&#39;ve called it the political petting zoo. Federal politicians from all over come to see it. You see politicians glad-handing, attending GR events, events, attending community events. The question I have fundamentally is, does the stampede matter at all after an election, or is it just a real advantageous petting zoo prior to an election? Talk to me about this.</div>

But I would go a little bit harder if I was Rachel Notley or Danielle Smith and give some targets here, especially to the Calgary MLAs. I like what Carter said about hosting events. I would say, you&#39;ve got 10 days, host three events, have a donor event, have a public event, have a stakeholder event, go, right? I expect to see some good turnout at all of these events. I expect you to attend four events a day. I expect you at those events to have 10 meaningful interactions an hour that your EA is logging and identifying or your constituency manager. That&#39;s somebody that I&#39;ve now got on a Rolodex card, not literally folks, you know, in a computer is fine. But like, that&#39;s a connection that I have now made. And that should result in 10 follow up meetings that you offer. Most will fall through, most will not happen. But at least they know you&#39;ve made a connection and you&#39;ve attempted to get them somewhere on the calendar. And by the way, one final rule I would give if I was Danielle Smith or Rachel Notley to a bunch of people who are newly drunk on power,</div>

          <div class="said">like the last point Corey brought up, Carter. I want your reaction to that. But I want to get into now the nitty gritty of Stampede because Corey&#39;s brought up one of those points. Politicians have rules around consumption, around consumption of alcohol, Corey just mentioned, but also consumption of food. Many just say we&#39;re not eating. We&#39;re flipping the pancakes. We&#39;re never going to eat them. You never get caught eating, right? Right. Right.</div>

          <div class="said">You never get caught eating as like we&#39;ve talked about as from a political imagery perspective, but also you never get caught eating in the sense that you&#39;ve got another thing to go to. You&#39;re eating in the car. You&#39;re doing your own granola bars and cliff bars the whole time. So, Carter, react to what Corey said here. And then I want to get into I want to clarify a point with Corey before I kind of get into my next sort of topic on the stampede here. But your reaction to it is</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">is totally right, especially like the drinking one. I mean, there have been so many politicians that have a tendency to get a little inebriated and view the stampede primarily as an opportunity to drink, party and get and use their their newly found gravitas to get into all these special parties where, you know, oh, man, we get into the VIP sections. We don&#39;t even have to stand in line. Yeah, there&#39;s a cost to that. The cost may not be monetary, but every single one of those people that&#39;s letting you into those events is going to call come a calling for something from you later. So don&#39;t be running in. Don&#39;t be running up your tab on on their alcohol. Don&#39;t be you know, don&#39;t be behaving like buffoons. And so many of them do. do i&#39;m i mean i&#39;ve made the calls to politicians and that i&#39;ve had to say you&#39;re gonna have to explain to me what the fuck you were thinking when you were getting hammered at this event</div>

We&#39;re going to have to follow up on that. I want to make sure that I&#39;m really... Steven, take a note. Steven, did you get that? You&#39;ve got his contact information, right? Let&#39;s make sure that we set something up in the next two to three weeks, knowing that person&#39;s gone on vacation in the next two to three weeks. We know that that person&#39;s not going to be available. Well, we&#39;re going to be putting something together because that person&#39;s offering us something very interesting that we need to listen to or whatever. But the staffer is moving so hard. especially the primary body person, that staffer is working to gather all the information, remember what matters, prioritize it afterwards, and then make sure that all the follow-up happens. And we are literally talking about, you could be dealing with a thousand contacts, each one of which is going to have to be prioritized and followed up upon.</div>

Let&#39;s talk about this. Carter, how do you have a meaningful interaction with a minister or a premier or someone you need as an organization or as someone who wants to get another follow-up conversation or a meeting? And more so, I kind of ask, how do you do it and not being annoying? Because it&#39;s not just one meeting. You&#39;re trying to bump into this person multiple times over the course of 10 days. in fact it&#39;s part of your strategy to be like hey you again right full well knowing that the only reason you&#39;re there is to bump into that minister or one of the few people that you wanted to talk yeah right and so you know that they might know that if they&#39;re savvy if they know what your file is they know that so then how do you do it carter that&#39;s that tries to add as much meaning and that tries to not make you just on an interpersonal level annoying as fucking shit because i imagine they have thousands of conversations five of them with the same person starts to get pretty annoying if they&#39;re annoying they&#39;re</div>

I don&#39;t want to be here. I don&#39;t want to be the guy who even appears to be the one looking for the minister&#39;s, uh, ear. I don&#39;t want to be the person who even looks like i need something from these guys i want to appear like i am above all of this and maybe that&#39;s the risk that i would take is really i am so like i am such i am so much better than this opportunity is something that i would love to be able to message</div>

          <div class="said">my take is that the reason the relationship at stampede doesn&#39;t work as well as you want is that asymmetry we talked about yeah there&#39;s this allusion to porter&#39;s five forces i was talking about you know where you have too many suppliers and only one buyer right so</div>

          <div class="said">so you&#39;ve got to look for different relationships there and there&#39;s a very obvious one at stampede and i think it&#39;s a great in if you have both the right personality if you&#39;re at the right level all of that work the staff you know the staff are often especially if there&#39;s more than one person and going with the minister there&#39;s probably the body person and then there&#39;s probably a couple of hangers on or people around who you know often don&#39;t have that profile don&#39;t have people coming up to them all the time but do do get the minister&#39;s ear and it is an interesting avenue in in my opinion a lot of the time and and so make sure you know who the people around the minister are too think about this in terms of concentric circles yes the minister&#39;s at the center who are the people the minister listens to that are going with the minister to these events that are around the minister and quite often can i tell you in my experience going to many events they&#39;re often standing alone they&#39;re often watching the opposite the stuff from across the way i&#39;ll often at events especially events that like my employer is hosting if i see someone standing alone you know because you want them to have a good time i&#39;ll go up i&#39;ll introduce myself i&#39;ll talk to them i</div>

Do I need to host something? I&#39;ve got an ask. I&#39;ve maybe got a bit of money. I can probably pull together a couple hundred of my concentric circles to fill a room and we can invite folks. Do we host something or do we just keep going around the block? What do we do here? I find that interesting in the sense of organizations that have something and maybe even have a bit of resources. Would you you suggest that they just be seen everywhere or do they expand their circle expand their network to try to bring the minister in sort of that&#39;s interesting</div>

The risk should be more, what have they committed to? Have they optimized this? Have they captured any data? Are they any good at that? And those are the skills that I think you can build in those 10 days.

What would you advise people in terms of making their retail robust, in terms of making it memorable so that they&#39;re not just there for the transaction, action that they can hopefully in three years from now count on some of people, some of these folks that they&#39;ve interacted with to be their friends. You&#39;ve got Corey&#39;s challenge of not over committing or not narrowly committing in certain cases, right? You&#39;ve got your sort of scheduling sort of opportunities, but people want to get to know you. How do you, in the most macro sense, roll that up three years from now in terms of them being there for you? Because that&#39;s ultimately what you&#39;re in the business for. As much as it&#39;s getting shit done, it&#39;s also that. So talk to me on the macro as we finish off this topic. As a politician&#39;s goal, their firehose that is Stampede, their firehose that is this summer for many of them.

Or it could be actual true. What is the best way to get your shit done? Is friendship what people are looking for in a certain way? And I know it&#39;s a weird question, but I think it&#39;s an appropriate one given what we&#39;re trying to do. You interact with someone multiple times over a week, you might be able to call them a friend by the time two Sundays from now sort of thing. So I guess that is my question. Is that one of the sub-objectives, so to speak, on either side of the equation? And I&#39;m curious because I know that is some people&#39;s strategy in that regard. I</div>

He&#39;s like, you know, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s going to stop punching me, but maybe he&#39;ll punch me a little lighter next time.

          <div class="said">that&#39;s a fair Fair point. So Carter, final question for you. Advice for the federal parties heading into Stampede. Generic advice. You can get specific if you&#39;d like, if you want to tease it out for the liberals. They&#39;re in a different sort of election cycle, but this might be the Stampede before an election. We never know, right? But it&#39;s also Alberta, so there&#39;s also a different dynamic here when you&#39;re looking at the entire map. But any advice you&#39;d give them? Are you loaning some of Corey&#39;s advice and saying, bring your MPs out here, make this a sandbox for retail politics that you can use at the doors are you what do you what do you kind of think enough if you&#39;re giving advice to the federal parties heading you know heading into stampede season starting in a couple of days</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">because of the their provincial strength and try to get your claws into them if you&#39;re the federal party is that your strategy if you&#39;re the liberals is it to build connections with power brokers in downtown calgary or that&#39;s going to dictate what events you go to uh you know where you&#39;re seeing and what you do just having clear intentions and building your agenda around them rather than just treating it as like well i gotta go to stampede i gotta check that box or we gotta send somebody to stampede so they&#39;re gonna go to stampede and knowing what you&#39;re trying to do will dictate a lot of what follows the problem with any major event like this which becomes like this calendar tent pole where everybody has to go is it becomes an objective in its own right and people forget why it was an objective in the first place like why they bothered to go to these events so refocusing on on outcomes, being really strong with yourself as to metrics, the things you&#39;re going to get done, the people you&#39;re going to meet, the volume of activity. That&#39;s my advice to federal parties.</div>
