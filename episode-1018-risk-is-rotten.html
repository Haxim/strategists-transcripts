        <p>Zain Velji returns to ask Stephen and Corey how the first 24 hours after the introduction of the Alberta Sovereignty Act are going. Stephen Carter brings out his best "NOT GREAT, BOB" memes.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Alberta Sovereignty Act - the first 24 hours of reaction, how the government ended up, what else they could have done and how everyone from the NDP opposition to Alberta Premier Smith's former leadership opponents could react. Were the new cabinet authorities a complete accident? Should Justin Trudeau jump in or lean out? And when did Saskatchewan become the responsible province? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Like this is this is now Danielle Smith doubling down on an act that I&#39;m not sure Albertans wanted and I&#39;m not sure Albertans understand the implication. And she&#39;s given the NDP and the media all kinds of runway to define this act in ways that her and her minister, Tyler Shandro, couldn&#39;t actually do yesterday. They certainly couldn&#39;t define it. So the media have had a field day today defining it. And that&#39;s what Danielle Smith is pushing back against.</div>

Talk to me about this concept of a box-checking exercise, where in politics, I think people might be surprised that there are certain moments where strategy is secondary, that just based on the HR, the people dynamics, the sheer momentum, that strategy actually has to be parked, that it actually can&#39;t be the compass that makes the decisions, that there are things like box checking exercises, or we just have to do something to show that we&#39;re moving in a direction. Talk to me about, do you see the Sovereignty Act as it was presented yesterday? If it wasn&#39;t strategy that either of you could pluck out and say, here&#39;s the through line, here&#39;s what I see. Was this a political box checking exercise? And expand on that. Have you, when you were chief of staff to the premier, had to do any of these in the past yourself?</div>

Like, maybe either give me your theory of what happened or bridge that gap for me between how this could have become a box checking exercise, but also selling it as aggressively because you&#39;d expect the box checking exercise, even if it was your signature piece of policy, you find ways to downgrade it, you found ways to take the teeth out of it, you&#39;d kind of shove it under the rug. you can do various things with timing cadence etc even the policy itself which you guys talked about extensively yesterday but</div>

But I was elected to stand up for Albertans, our caucuses behind this. We know we need some more tools in our toolkit here. Yeah, I&#39;m absolutely open to finding different ways we can do this, but it&#39;s non-negotiable to me that we&#39;re going to stand up to the Notley-Trudeau-Singh Alliance.
