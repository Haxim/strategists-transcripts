          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk Alberta's war on Cartoon Bigfoot, the upcoming WE testimony, the last five months of polling in Alberta. What is the Energy War Room's goal in attacking a children's cartoon? Can the Liberals keep the WE scandal from being about them? And are Albertans conservatives, or just cosplaying as conservatives? Zain Velji, as he does every year, picks the headlines and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

This petition letter, which I should have the website in front of me, I&#39;ll find it while you guys rant and rave about this, it ultimately tells the head of communications at Netflix that you really don&#39;t understand the energy sector. This is a misrepresentation of the excellent work of the energy sector. A movie about Bigfoot is what our jewel</div>

Stephen Carter, you&#39;ve been shaking your head. What are you shaking your head at? The fact that—well, maybe I&#39;ll ask you a question, actually, here, which is they must know that these are own goals, right? Like, they must know that they&#39;re trying the strategy you&#39;d mentioned about trying to get attention and garner, almost using trolly behavior, some earned media or some support from their base. Do you do not suspect that even if that&#39;s not their execution, that that&#39;s their strategy? Because I do want to dig into them because we could we could dunk on them, you know, episode after episode, which would be a lot of fun.

            <div class="said">because what they&#39;re trying to do is communicate with people who identify with oil and gas industry, the people who support the oil and gas industry. Because I don&#39;t think that they are communicating with anybody that was sitting on the fence, right? I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anybody in the middle. So when we used to do these types of communications, we used to talk about, you know, we had a Likert scale. And you put people at one end of the Likert scale who were kind of environmentalists, very pro-environmentalists. And then you put people at the other end of the scale who were very pro-oil and gas industry. And then the people in the middle were the people you wanted to communicate with. And that&#39;s what I thought the Canadian Energy Centre was being designed to do. Because all CAP has been doing, you know, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, all CAP has been doing is communicating with the people who already love them, right?

Would you actually show some value here for the money that we are giving you? Because this is the tactic of somebody who is desperate to do something. I can find no strategy nor any tactic value in it otherwise, right? Like they have mistaken action for direction. They need to do something. So they did something. But it turns out that something was pretty fucking stupid because otherwise I can&#39;t fathom this.

The energy war room didn&#39;t do what it was supposed to do. We couldn&#39;t get access to markets. Our steam continued to drop. Jobs were not created. Wealth was not created. It was a total failure. However, the energy war room may just get lost in the shuffle and not look so bad if the oil industry has $80 oil, $90 oil. If all of a sudden there&#39;s this rebound effect, if downtown Calgary is humming again, then even though there&#39;s nothing causal about it, people will point to it and say, well, you know, we had the energy war room, it was pretty embarrassing, but now the oil industry is looking better and we have all these market access issues largely resolved.

We may not get that capital investment we have in years past as people start worrying more that that will be stranded assets. But wealth will be created. Revenue will be created if there is an oil boom. And that will smooth over some things. It will make government finances look better. It will mean there&#39;s more money splashing around in Lamborghini dealerships downtown Calgary. But, you know, that money, I&#39;m not a believer in trickle-down, but there will be money splashed around this city. People will develop big homes.

The second story I want to talk about, just so you keep in the back of your mind, is the upcoming poll, not the upcoming, the recent polls in Alberta, at least three of them, guys, I might be wrong, two of them that I&#39;ve seen, maybe three, and then the top line numbers, is one of two things. Either the NDP are significantly up in one of those polls, or the NDP are leading with a sliver. But regardless, the NDP are up. So I want to talk about both of those things, strategy on both of those things, meaningfulness. But let&#39;s start with the leadership review. Corey Hogan, the fact that the UCP have decided their leadership review, is this just pedestrian what a party does? Or is this a symbol, a sign, a message being sent to Jason Kenney and the fact that he currently is, and perhaps tying the two things I want to talk about, quite low in the poll numbers, so to speak, and his leadership is leaving, you know, a lot to be desired for many people, even if they consider themselves UCP members.

            <div class="said">It happens, though. So that&#39;s what makes it an interesting game of chicken. There has been many instances where people have dropped their leader that close to an election. Britain is full of them. Spills in Australia are very common that this would occur right before an election. Leadership spills are a fun thing, by the way. We should talk about them at some point. And even here in Canada, we&#39;ve seen leadership changes at the last minute before an election. Sometimes it was the leader&#39;s decision. Sometimes it was not the leader&#39;s decision. It occurs all the time. So I think that Jason Kenney, if his plan is October 2022, it&#39;s too late to get rid of me. I think that&#39;s a mistake. I believe that actually, if you&#39;re staring down certain electoral defeat with six months to go, you might be really tempted to drop your leader and try to clean the slate. So I think this might be one of those solutions that&#39;s too clever by half or be careful what you wish for. But I also believe it was dropped on a Friday evening to satisfy demands for people saying, hey, we should have some leadership review before the next election.</div>

If I&#39;m some of the people that is circling around Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership, leadership. Maybe I have an agenda of defeating him. Maybe I have an agenda of myself wanting to be a leader, Brian Jean, or others, right? You know, what am I doing right now? I now know the date.

The reason why there were sharp holdings of breath, I am sure in the UCP party office and in the leader&#39;s office when this was dropped on a Friday night, dropped on a Friday night, because he didn&#39;t necessarily want to make a big play of it was he wanted to see if the constituency associations thought that was enough. Or if they thought, no, we&#39;ve got to have a leadership review now. We need to understand where the leader is now. So if I am looking to push the premier out of his seat, and I actually don&#39;t think there are too, too many people who are openly trying to do that. I think we&#39;re still in a phase where it&#39;s like, you know, I like Jason, but that&#39;s always the first stage in a bit of a leadership push here. But what you are doing is you&#39;re working the phones and saying like, yeah, I mean, I mean, we all see what he&#39;s trying to do here. I think we – look, we&#39;re in a real jam. These numbers could get really locked. Look at the NDP. Look at their leads right now. We need a leadership review now. And again, because we&#39;re still in that, I like the guy. But if only to get everybody a lot more serious about what needs to be done, right?

I think, and what I&#39;ll be watching for, is the break between north rural and south rural. And if we had a pool, like if I was to do a pool right now, I&#39;d probably do a pool with a much larger sample size, and then oversample rural Alberta to see what&#39;s going on.

Win back Calgary is a challenge. But trying to win back Calgary while not losing north rural is – especially the donut ridings around Edmonton. um then you really got a trade-off and this is where part this is where governments really get into trouble not when they&#39;re fighting a single front uh but when they&#39;re fighting two fronts and you know that&#39;s kind of where christy clark was in bc um you know when when doug ford wins in in uh in ontario he was able to open up multiple fronts multiple places that he could start to win and i and arguably that&#39;s where um aaron o&#39;toole faces the biggest challenge he He hasn&#39;t opened any fronts, right?

And so how do you, if you&#39;re the NDP, play this? Maybe that&#39;s my top line question. The first part is probably my editorial thought that I&#39;m inserting as a question. But if you&#39;re the NDP, how do you want to play this? Do you want to own the fact that you&#39;re leading? Do you want to kind of be like, oh, polls don&#39;t matter and only use it to fundraise? Like, what&#39;s your strategic guardrails and Balancing Act that you&#39;re looking at almost like to the date, two years now, to election day, right? Like we&#39;re sitting in March, we&#39;re probably gonna have this election writ period probably in and around this week in two years. So like, Corey, what are you doing if you&#39;re the NDP? What are sort of the guardrails or principles you&#39;re considering when you&#39;re talking about consistent poll results putting you ahead, but you&#39;re still the opposition party?</div>

That&#39;s one of those things that we just hear too much in alberta can&#39;t despite the fact they were the last fucking government it just it blows my mind how many people who think like oh the ndp can&#39;t win in alberta you need people to know that the ndp can win in alberta uh so own your lead but also own the fact that it&#39;s a snapshot that things can change over the next couple years we&#39;ve got to keep the pressure up we got to do uh you know we got to keep moving towards this goal also own the regional disparity that steven talked about yes we have a lead in the polls but you&#39;ve got to know that It&#39;s a bit uneven.

And you said something like, and paraphrasing once again, Carter, so correct me if I&#39;m wrong, if you remember, use it to fundraise, use it to create the organizing class, use it to incubate candidates and political organizers, use the big momentum to say that you&#39;re the only choice, and that drive it with outcomes, people, time, money, get those commitments in the can. We&#39;re now four or five months away from that, two years to an election. interaction is the advice the same is the advice different and and the top line question are you are you owning the lead are you shying away from it a bit i&#39;m</div>

            <div class="said">So two days before the 2015 Alberta election, I was on a CBC panel with a pollster and a pundit, and we were asked to predict what was going to happen. And it was funny because the pollster had the NDP up by, I think, 15 points in his own poll, and he predicted a PC majority, right? I mean, that was sort of the mentality that people had. That is Alberta. Alberta goes PC. The guy didn&#39;t even believe his own poll. And I said NDP majority and they immediately jumped on me, my other two panelists, and they said, well, where are these seats coming from? Very similar to what Stephen said about, yeah,</div>

            <div class="said">yeah, but there&#39;s regions and we&#39;ve got to think about that. Well, the reality is if you&#39;re up by that much, the answer is everywhere. The seats will come from everywhere. That is a huge majority. uh and we are kind of if these polls are sort of borne out in the next couple like the reality is the ndp are are back in the game in basically every region in this province and so that has got to scare the pants off jason kenney but the reason i mentioned all of this is that</div>

            <div class="said">Let me tell you a tale of Alberta. And it&#39;s a different tale than the tale that Albertans tell themselves even. You know, this is not this small province of Western free ideals that people often pretend we are. Even people here in this province, people like the government, both the current and And the previous would say things like, well, Albertans want X or Albertans want Y. And they would be those stereotypes of Albertans that keep government out of my face. Let&#39;s not get too</div>

            <div class="said">too involved in their business over here. Let&#39;s give them options like private education and let&#39;s not get too far into the health care business. The tale I want to tell you, though, is it is a province of four and a half million people with two major centers, each of over a million people. ethnically diverse alberta as a whole is about 25 visible minority calgary about 40 edmonton about the same and it&#39;s got the same pressures and it&#39;s got the same conversations it&#39;s got the same political arguments as all of these other places across canada in that sense too so when you strip the fairy tale out of it all and you just look at the demographics the reality is it might not have been an accidental NDP government, it might be an accidental UCP government. And the question Jason Kenney needs to ask himself now and ask himself hard is, what do you do if everything I&#39;ve just said is true? What if Alberta is far more moderate than we&#39;ve been cosplaying for the past two years? And if it is far more moderate than that, you&#39;ve got to pivot hard and you&#39;ve got to pivot now, because your problem won&#39;t just be holding your leadership, it will be holding in your premiership and holding government for the UCP writ large.</div>

And this could open up a can of worms on this podcast and otherwise, but I&#39;m happy to go here for a second. at. Just to get your initial thoughts, overblown that the NDP&#39;s coalition that they need to build their big tent of anywhere from the new, I shouldn&#39;t say the new, but the now furthermore emboldened vocal left in Alberta to the former PC center-right, can they exist under one banner?

But Carter, Carter, maybe I&#39;ll go to you first for like general thoughts about the PCs were always a big tent party, but they were the big tent party with a group of people that fell in line. Power was what they, you know, kind of, as you&#39;ve said, is calcified towards. This seems a little different, the coalition that the NDP is trying to build.
