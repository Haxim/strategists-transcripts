          <p>Stephen Carter and Zain Velji discuss just how hard it is to get attention in the summer months before discussing daddy Carney's deal deadline. Is anyone tuned in to the political scene right now? What happens if Carney doesn't get a deal by August 1? And when did Zain start letting Carter ask questions? Zain Velji, as always, picks (most of) the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

Nothing for the political signage indicates that that is on the, you know, happening here in that regard, at least in the near term future. I mean, like October of the 25 calendar year, right?

Election held tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, I predict, if it&#39;s still Trump and it&#39;s still Carney, that this is the situation where he&#39;s not going to get blamed. What is the downside risk then, knowing that, having a historical example to prove that, to not be the communicator-in-chief to let people know around what could happen? That sense of bond, unity, solidarity that was created during the election, to not keep Canadians prepared, to not have the support of the conversations around that. I don&#39;t see the risk.
