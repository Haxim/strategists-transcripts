          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">their political sort of communications and marketing over the summer is very different. It&#39;s very much centered around festival season because it&#39;s constant and everyone gravitates to the center of this main city. But I&#39;m curious, Carter, as someone who has been working on these campaigns in Alberta, what lessons have you been learning or have learned over the course of the last number of weeks as a summer campaigning practitioner?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">of them but not but not necessarily as big as the stampede yeah so i&#39;m going to come back to the stampede because that&#39;s a very big lesson um but in edmonton you have these festivals but you don&#39;t have a political culture right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so there is no culture of politicking during the summer um most people want the campaign to start sometime in early september and be done in october and that&#39;s just not the way that modern campaigning works modern campaigning is a long haul especially when you know the dates so uh and that&#39;s what we do we know what the dates in a municipal election</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so it&#39;s been a it&#39;s been a tough run trying to make people actually care in edmonton especially okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in calgary we were able to take advantage of that of that uh that festival feeling um and And target especially the kind of the 10,000 people that people talk to. Rather than trying to focus on the entire city, we were able to focus in on a smaller subset of the population and really just be everywhere that they were. And so I think it&#39;s very much like that Montreal experience that you&#39;re describing.</span>

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s focus in on your strategy. Because I think Montreal&#39;s strategy is slightly different, because what I&#39;m seeing here is a lot of third party, you know, labor, sort of FYI activism. There&#39;s no ongoing election, at least as far as I can tell. Nothing for the political signage indicates that that is on the, you know, happening here in that regard, at least in the near term future. I mean, like October of the 25 calendar year, right? The courts are going to have something very shortly with their Quebec provincials. um but</span>

What&#39;s the risk? What I would say is I agree. Our mutual friend Bozenko would say Harper was dealing with an American financial recession, and Canadians recognized that. This wasn&#39;t Harper&#39;s crisis. They gave him another mandate.</span>

Even though I initially figured that this is going to be a shorter window and he needs to deliver, and as money gripes as I have on the comms, I agree. Election held tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, I predict, if it&#39;s still Trump and it&#39;s still Carney, that this is the situation where he&#39;s not going to get blamed. What is the downside risk then, knowing that, having a historical example to prove that, to not be the communicator-in-chief to let people know around what could happen? That sense of bond, unity, solidarity that was created during the election, to not keep Canadians prepared, to not have the support of the conversations around that. I don&#39;t see the risk.
