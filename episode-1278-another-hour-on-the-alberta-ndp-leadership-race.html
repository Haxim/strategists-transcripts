Here&#39;s what I want to talk about today. I want to talk about how you guys read this video. Is it a launch video? I have to tell you, I&#39;ll be totally candid. I do not know. I do not have any inside information on this. I&#39;m genuinely curious. But almost beside the point, what makes a good launch video? what elements were missing in that regard and if it wasn&#39;t a launch video was this a soft launch video and then we&#39;ll talk about the other candidates we discussed on our on our two-hour um pod uh in terms of what they should be doing right now if anything because guys the race hasn&#39;t really even started because we still have rachel notley as leader of the alberta ndp so carter can i ask you the very simple question was this a campaign launch video by kathleen ganley greatest</span>

It&#39;s her just talking to screen, saying that, listen, she knows she&#39;s got deep roots in Calgary. I know who I am. I know why I&#39;m here. I know my colleagues stand with me. As Corey mentioned, these speaking call me whatever they want. I won&#39;t be fooled and neither will Albertans. We don&#39;t have a woke agenda. We care about what you care about. I&#39;m paraphrasing that last bit. That was pretty much the essence, right? Like, I know who I&#39;m here. i i have strong values both from the party perspective as well as i guess the roots in the city perspective and fuck the ndp right like was pretty much the vibe of this video over 55 seconds and i think the reason cory people are calling it a campaign video is that because it really wasn&#39;t talking about a day-to-day policy</span>

Like it&#39;s produced, not produced stuff. And it&#39;s just, it&#39;s so clearly not a casual, hey, I&#39;m going to react to something in the news. I&#39;m going to give you my thoughts. It&#39;s so clearly a, we&#39;re going to do this and we&#39;re going to put this out. And, uh, you know, I get broad strokes. We&#39;re just going to see where this goes. We&#39;re going to try to be the front runner. We&#39;re going to try to be the person right in there. I think it probably is pretty closely tied to a strategy of Kathleen Ganley announcing a lot of caucus support. I mean, even if you hadn&#39;t heard whispers or rumors of that, just the fact that she talks about the caucus and her colleagues standing with her, pretty fucking obvious in that sense. And it&#39;s game on. It&#39;s so clearly game on. We talked about this last time, that it was going to be the unofficial start the minute there was that Jason Markasoff article.</span>

I think that her telephone and her campaign team&#39;s telephones are all ringing today because finally someone&#39;s putting down a stake in the ground and saying, we&#39;re ready to go. Finally is ironic because the leader hasn&#39;t left yet. but it&#39;s it&#39;s an open fucking secret that uh rachel notley is going to ignore every fucking word of advice ever given to her about when she should step down and she&#39;s going to step down in january and people are going to have to campaign in the middle of fucking alberta winter where where your ass freezes just walking over to the dog park so good job rach</span>

It hammers you over the head. It&#39;s repetitive and it&#39;s supposed to be memorable in a way that other types of creative are not. And I think that&#39;s a very, very good point, Corey.

Well, I&#39;m curious what they know or what they think on the Kathleen Gambley campaign that made them talk about like, we&#39;re not woke months. Like, do they think that&#39;s what NDP leadership voters are looking for? Actually, or is that just supposed to be their hook? That&#39;s the best fucking hook they could come up with? I don&#39;t really understand the content, if I&#39;m going to be frank. I think that the presentation was basically what you would expect and want if you&#39;re doing this kind of soft launch video i don&#39;t understand the content that it&#39;s hooked to beyond just like her talking about her background i i don&#39;t i it seems really baffling and it feels like they could have gone in 12 different directions and taken 12 different approaches that would have been less leading with your chin i mean i&#39;m curious your thoughts carter but that was my first reaction yeah</span>

            <span class="text">if i&#39;m going to be entirely charitable to the video the logic of saying not woke to our previous point about it not being a particularly subtle uh game is that they knew by going first they would get the earned media that they did in the calgary herald in the conversations it would be spread into normal people populations this is not a normal people population but it&#39;s spread into normal normal people populations. And if you know one thing about Kathleen, maybe you come away with, oh, she&#39;s the not woke New Democrat, right? And maybe that&#39;s exactly where they want to be in the public. However, this is a leadership contest. And I think you need to think about where you want to be with the membership and prospective membership. And I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not entirely sure they&#39;re trying to win the right game if that was their particular strategy. I&#39;ll just be blunt on that one there. And there, you know, there are a million ways you can introduce yourself in a way that that hooks on the issues of the day you could talk to the party faith again it depends on their strategy i don&#39;t have enough line of sight on that but you could easily see saying like hey you know i&#39;m kathleen and i know after like losing an election even though it&#39;s a close one and even though we all have a lot to be proud of you</span>

So the, the content itself becomes less valuable than the brand you&#39;re creating with the content we talk about brand incessantly why do we talk about brand incessantly because brand is the thing that you actually interact with not necessarily message message can reinforce brand but message and brand are two different things and if you mix those two things up sometimes you can get a little bit off off kilter and i did i would suggest that that&#39;s happened before in canadian politics where people start thinking that the message is the brand it&#39;s</span>

As they watch today, as they watch Kathleen Ganley get a headline in the Calgary Herald, does that even matter? But she&#39;s put a video out there. She&#39;s created the conditions to hit go. Do you do the same? Do you wait? Talk to me about their individual strategy. They might be fundamentally and functionally different too. So let&#39;s spend a bit of time on that.

What I would suggest is for the next six or five or six days, you put 10 people, your top 10 lieutenants in a room, right? And you are working a list. You are working a list and you are calling calling everybody and saying, did you just see it&#39;s on? I need you. Did you just see it&#39;s on? I need you. That would, that the conversation would repeat itself over and over again. If I was either Kathleen or Racky or not Kathleen or Racky, Sarah or Racky, because Kathleen&#39;s already produced her video. Kathleen&#39;s already done her thing. Now it&#39;s time for us to do our thing. And our thing can&#39;t be the same. Shouldn&#39;t be the same.

Yeah, well, in general, I think what you do is you hook on to what&#39;s legitimate activity and also you are allowed to spend your own money buying your friends drinks and all of that.

Racky can be as loyal or not as she wants. If I were her, I would, as a foundation do that, you know, 10 people in a room calling 10 million people or whatever the numbers were that we were using there. and um i would actually be working through proxies i would be making sure my proxies felt very comfortable talking about my candidacy i would have everybody on every right away a hundred percent like you don&#39;t announce right you&#39;re being respectful yeah you&#39;re working the phones you&#39;re talking to people but i&#39;m not sad at all if people are talking about my candidacy i want to make sure every time the ndp leadership race comes up people are talking about me and they&#39;re talking about me in that initial framing i wanted to be whatever</span>

I missed you, but it is actually me. And, you know, so fire me a text back. If you want to chat, I&#39;d love to talk to you about what&#39;s going on in Alberta NDP politics. Right.</span>

            <span class="text">yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s also using those calls as an opportunity not just to get that person, but to get the next three people. Right. So who else do you think might be interested? Who are you? You&#39;re a constituency president. Who do you think are like the three most interesting people on your board or the three like up and comers that you really think like would really be great, especially if like you&#39;re getting friendly conversations with them?</span>

            <span class="text">me let me only throw one more on there guys which is i&#39;m going to revisit this question every now and again when we talk about the ndp specifically related to candidates which is the brand lanes that we&#39;ve loosely identified for each of the three candidates we have sarah hoffman as you know and you guys can correct me if i&#39;m wrong but like history of the party right like the extension of of what you got sort of thing the 2015 as i think you&#39;d cory you&#39;d alluded to and we kind of settled on some version of like that was kind of her lane calgary rachel was kathleen ganley and then racky had the most optionality almost as an like today where we&#39;re discussing uh where she could be bold um where some of her risk is really around if this is going to be a super best friends club versus being a little bit more chippy and trying to create some daylight you guys want to change any of those brands or refine them after seeing today after having some time for reflection like i said i&#39;ll keep revisiting this question around the lanes they should each hunt but i want to open up the floor on this maybe to you first cory and then to you carter uh as we round out this episode i</span>

            <span class="text">i don&#39;t necessarily know that i want to change any of the lanes i will say i listened to that pod and one of the things that i thought was funny after listening to it is that we we gave some pretty esoteric swim lanes and we somehow managed not to talk about the traditional ndp swim lanes of environment true of labor labor yeah yes and um those lanes still exist and there are still a myriad especially on the labor side of ndp stalwarts who really speak and think in that language and listen there&#39;s still a lot of memberships to be driven that way there&#39;s still a lot of risk of antagonizing the labor wing of the ndp and um people are going to need to be very mindful of the coalition as it exists as well as the coalition as they wanted to exist and every leadership is going to be a combination of existing members your membership sales their membership sales and if this thing goes multiple ballots there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of considerations and there&#39;s a lot of ways you&#39;re going to need to be able to cut it and</span>
