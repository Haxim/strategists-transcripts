          <p>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a "Let Me Introduce Myself" video from Alberta NDP leadership hopeful Kathleen Ganley to discuss the strategic considerations of running a leadership race before there's been an official start to a leadership race. What are the opportunities and risks involved in coming out early? How do you fund a campaign before you're allowed to have a campaign? And why isn't the correct strategy for all the candidates to launch at the Pork &amp; Fiddle? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

            <div class="said">that&#39;s what it kind of seems like according to a new article by harold um there is yes we&#39;re going to use that yeah oh man indeed uh kathleen ganley put out a video less than a minute long uh which had all the makings or some of the makings i should say because we can talk about what other makings there should be in terms of a launch video maybe if we go there today had the makings of what looked like a campaign video don&#39;t take it from me take it from some of the folks they interviewed in this article, Dwayne Bratt, Laurie Williams, Mount Royal University, saying that, you know, this looks like a campaign video, a launch video that is declaring her candidacy to potentially replace Rachel Notley. Here&#39;s what I want to talk about today. I want to talk about how you guys read this video. Is it a launch video? I have to tell you, I&#39;ll be totally candid. I do not know. I do not have any inside information on this. I&#39;m genuinely curious. But almost beside the point, what makes a good launch video? what elements were missing in that regard and if it wasn&#39;t a launch video was this a soft launch video and then we&#39;ll talk about the other candidates we discussed on our on our two-hour um pod uh in terms of what they should be doing right now if anything because guys the race hasn&#39;t really even started because we still have rachel notley as leader of the alberta ndp so carter can i ask you the very simple question was this a campaign launch video by kathleen ganley greatest</div>

            <div class="said">right so cory&#39;s right this is like a 50 55 second video introducing herself a vertical video just her there&#39;s no b-roll there&#39;s There&#39;s no, like, score or music to it. It&#39;s her just talking to screen, saying that, listen, she knows she&#39;s got deep roots in Calgary. I know who I am. I know why I&#39;m here. I know my colleagues stand with me. As Corey mentioned, these speaking call me whatever they want. I won&#39;t be fooled and neither will Albertans. We don&#39;t have a woke agenda. We care about what you care about. I&#39;m paraphrasing that last bit. That was pretty much the essence, right? Like, I know who I&#39;m here. i i have strong values both from the party perspective as well as i guess the roots in the city perspective and fuck the ndp right like was pretty much the vibe of this video over 55 seconds and i think the reason cory people are calling it a campaign video is that because it really wasn&#39;t talking about a day-to-day policy</div>

Like it&#39;s produced, not produced stuff. And it&#39;s just, it&#39;s so clearly not a casual, hey, I&#39;m going to react to something in the news. I&#39;m going to give you my thoughts. It&#39;s so clearly a, we&#39;re going to do this and we&#39;re going to put this out. And, uh, you know, I get broad strokes. We&#39;re just going to see where this goes. We&#39;re going to try to be the front runner. We&#39;re going to try to be the person right in there. I think it probably is pretty closely tied to a strategy of Kathleen Ganley announcing a lot of caucus support. I mean, even if you hadn&#39;t heard whispers or rumors of that, just the fact that she talks about the caucus and her colleagues standing with her, pretty fucking obvious in that sense. And it&#39;s game on. It&#39;s so clearly game on. We talked about this last time, that it was going to be the unofficial start the minute there was that Jason Markasoff article.</div>

            <div class="said">if i&#39;m going to be entirely charitable to the video the logic of saying not woke to our previous point about it not being a particularly subtle uh game is that they knew by going first they would get the earned media that they did in the calgary herald in the conversations it would be spread into normal people populations this is not a normal people population but it&#39;s spread into normal normal people populations. And if you know one thing about Kathleen, maybe you come away with, oh, she&#39;s the not woke New Democrat, right? And maybe that&#39;s exactly where they want to be in the public. However, this is a leadership contest. And I think you need to think about where you want to be with the membership and prospective membership. And I&#39;m not, I&#39;m not entirely sure they&#39;re trying to win the right game if that was their particular strategy. I&#39;ll just be blunt on that one there. And there, you know, there are a million ways you can introduce yourself in a way that that hooks on the issues of the day you could talk to the party faith again it depends on their strategy i don&#39;t have enough line of sight on that but you could easily see saying like hey you know i&#39;m kathleen and i know after like losing an election even though it&#39;s a close one and even though we all have a lot to be proud of you</div>

As they watch today, as they watch Kathleen Ganley get a headline in the Calgary Herald, does that even matter? But she&#39;s put a video out there. She&#39;s created the conditions to hit go. Do you do the same? Do you wait? Talk to me about their individual strategy. They might be fundamentally and functionally different too. So let&#39;s spend a bit of time on that.

You are working a list and you are calling calling everybody and saying, did you just see it&#39;s on? I need you. Did you just see it&#39;s on? I need you. That would, that the conversation would repeat itself over and over again. If I was either Kathleen or Racky or not Kathleen or Racky, Sarah or Racky, because Kathleen&#39;s already produced her video. Kathleen&#39;s already done her thing.
