            <span class="text">It&#39;s like a Rogan Musk episode. Let&#39;s move it on, folks. We got so much to talk about. We&#39;re going to stick it. We&#39;ll stick with our home province, and let&#39;s start with a story that may not be exactly what people are expecting, but I&#39;m going to start with our first segment, Stephen Carter, Recall, Recall.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, is it time that we recall recall legislation here in Alberta? Because, of course, I ask because Calgary&#39;s mayor, Jyoti Gondek, has been issued a recall petition. The low bar that was required to get the petition off the ground now has the impossibly high bar to succeed based on the fact that a Calgary man has now started a petition. He needs more than half a million physical signatures on said petition to successfully recall Jyoti Gondek. It is all but a foregone conclusion that that will not happen. But Stephen Carter, the campaign has already begun online. This is a in-person, physical, signatory petition. But of course, there&#39;s recallmeregondek.com or .ca. I forget which domain extension, but whichever one it isn&#39;t, I&#39;m sure we will capture and be able to do what we want with it, Corey. but carter is it time we recall recall legislation and then let me give you a bit of a track i want to talk about that and then i want to start talking about what a fight back strategy for the mayor and her allies could look like against something like this that will at least at the very least create a bit of a cloud over the next 55 some odd days so that and then we&#39;ll talk about strategy but carter your thoughts on recalling recall well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i think that recall is a is a bad I mean, we have an election every four years. Four years is a reasonable period of time for a person to determine, you know, for a person to deliver on the promises that they make. Two years may not be an appropriate amount of time. And realistically, with the bar that we&#39;ve set so high, there is no recall. There is no recall legislation. What there is, is an excuse for data collection. um you mentioned the online petition i mean i just you know it&#39;s by the way it&#39;s dot com so dot ca is available cory um but the the the ridiculous</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">ridiculous side of this is that it&#39;s it&#39;s not actually serving any purpose there is no particular reason to have this legislation uh to have this uh available because ultimately the politicians that write the rules are the politicians that don&#39;t want to be recalled.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, do we need to recall recall?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know. I am not actually that down on recall legislation as a concept. I generally do believe that you should give politicians their four-year term, and that that makes sense, and that we should judge people on a bundle of actions, and recall does seem to be triggered by individual actions, and I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s super helpful but all of that said do</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">do we not want some sort of fail-safe when a politician is so offside of the opinions of the of the jurisdiction that they represent that they can no longer reasonably be said to represent the people there and there are situations that come to mind interestingly one of the people who&#39;s not facing a recall at this moment is sean chu a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">councillor who um faced some very late breaking allegations and was re-elected but if you look at how the votes split between the advance ballots and the add day ballots would not have been elected if people were aware of it i think that it makes sense to allow recall in moments like that the bar is very high and the other part of it is you can only recall after a certain amount of time has passed both in Alberta for both our MLAs and I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I believe for our counselors, you&#39;ll correct me if I&#39;m wrong on</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">on that particular one.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So, you know, the bar is really high, but it should exist for a while. I don&#39;t think we need to recall recall, I guess is what I&#39;m saying. I think we need to recall the media thinking that somebody putting a petition forward for recall is in any way newsworthy because that doesn&#39;t matter at all. And they are never going to get 500,000 signatures on this they had like a hundred people show up at any given time at their um you know petition draw on the weekend here people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">people do not appreciate the logistics of even getting 500 000 signatures it&#39;s fucking unreal what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re requiring people to do if you just had one person sit there and take the signature of everybody one a second which couldn&#39;t happen you would be you couldn&#39;t do it you could You could not do it with the waking hours that are available, assuming that there was any kind of reasonable approach that you take. So this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this is my point. The bar is high, but I do think that having a fail-safe is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is good. We just can&#39;t have people thinking anytime any Yahoo decides they want to start a recall that it&#39;s fucking news, because it is fucking not. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, I have to say I agree with Corey&#39;s point, but there is a newsworthiness to elements of the story, and I think that&#39;s what&#39;s fascinating, right? Because I agree with Corey that this, just a random person setting</span>

However, underrated, what this could be weaponized for, hence the website, hence the data collection, hence the gathering. Talk to me about that in your mind. Like, are you, from your strategist brain, what are you gathering with some of the products that you have seen put online? Do you feel like this is for a mayoral campaign? Do you feel like it matters or doesn&#39;t? How are you reading or how are you seeing what you are seeing with the steps that thus far have been laid out with the recall campaign specific to let&#39;s say data collection branding and perhaps even like further depressing supporters of of the of the mayor well</span>

You know, those door-knocking captains, for them to be successful in the next 60 days, it&#39;s less than 60 days now, but if they were going to be successful, they&#39;d have to have something like 12,500 hours from door-knockers to do that. And it&#39;s just not going to happen. But if you targeted three or four ridings and you found out, you know, where a group of anti-Gondek supporters are, you could then mobilize that group for a councillor candidate in the next election. or if you did all 14 ridings it&#39;d be super easy to mobilize significant groups for your 14 counselors and um a mayoralty candidate so the data collection like you don&#39;t even care about the the the gen pop what you&#39;re aiming for are the people who are going to be the door knocking captains those captains are worth their money and you know they&#39;re waiting gold and you&#39;re going to to have probably,</span>

She&#39;ll keep getting columns written about. It&#39;ll hang over her. What does a, give me the constructs of like what an effective fight back strategy looks like for her. And then maybe we can even go as far as talking about some of the tactics that she could think through specific to fighting back and potentially even like jujitsu-ing some of this energy against us, against her, I should say.</span>

Calling all the fundraisers who worked with her before, making sure they&#39;re online, make sure that all the volunteers are online, that she&#39;s got a solid team and a solid group of people who are ready to go to battle. Because what this is saying, and this is, there&#39;s unintended consequences for every election, right? And the unintended consequence of the last election was the introduction kind of of tpas and uh uh that led that&#39;s leading to a much earlier start to this campaign you know that early start is going to be have to be met by this sitting mayor she&#39;s she may not have to declare her candidacy until april of 2024 or 25 i mean uh april 2025 maybe even may but she has to have she has to secure um all of the different people that are required to run a campaign and it&#39;s those people that are going to be riled up that the mayor is under threat that you got to reach out to you got to call every single person all 650 volunteers last time And then the hundreds and hundreds of people that showed up in the weeks following her election that, you know,</span>

It&#39;s us against anarchy, it&#39;s us against tyranny, it&#39;s us against Take Back Alberta. you know it&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">hurt them building lists so this is where you need to undermine their process a bit and probably even say things like you know this is really about getting on a list and you know people should think about whether they actually want to be on a craig chandler list let me tell you a little about craig chandler right and uh say hey listen honestly i know that um you know i maybe this is also maybe a great opportunity to show some humility and reset and say listen i know i i&#39;ve made some missteps as mayor i know that there are things that we need to do better there is a learning curve to any role like this i&#39;m so grateful calgarians have stuck through me with me through some of these things and yeah we&#39;re gonna do better and look Look, any politician should have a certain humility when people decide that this is the energy they want to bring to things here. But let&#39;s be really clear. This is not about me. This is about them building lists for their next crazy right-wing adventure. And if you have a problem with me as mayor, you know, this is my office phone number. This is my office email address. I want to hear from you. I want to talk to you. But I&#39;ll tell you something.</span>

That&#39;s just going to galvanize those people and say, oh, I&#39;m going to get my name double on that list. I&#39;m going to get 10 people, which is why I think the humility is a very important component of any undermining of the process that you&#39;re intending to do if you&#39;re Mayor Gondek.

Number one, should the mayor herself center herself, by which I mean, should she be a spokesperson for something like this in a fight back strategy? Does she have to kind of like come out and say some of the things, you know, that Corey has said or that you have suggested to say? And secondly, should those that want to defend the mayor invoke the mayor&#39;s name or make this about the broader cause of democracy or progressivism or those things? give me your thoughts on both of those those questions what</span>

They&#39;re still not going to succeed, just to be clear, but they&#39;re far more likely to succeed. so you could do a recall against sean true against sonja sharp against uh jennifer winus and prepare for the next election and you don&#39;t have to do them all at once you could just do them almost sequentially uh and in fact if you started the other way now that i&#39;m thinking about this and you did uh sonja sharp first and dan mclean second and then jennifer winus and then andre chabot and then sean chu by the time you got the sean chu you&#39;d probably be successful in your recall um because you&#39;d have organized so many organizers and you&#39;d be going after the greatest villain um but that would really destroy council so you know not that council&#39;s not pretty broken</span>

            <span class="text">our next segment. Our next segment, of course, is one brought to us by our sponsor, Flair Airlines. Lift off or let down. Guys, we are here. It&#39;s a Claire Airlines liftoff or a letdown. We always do this when there are campaigns that have launched. And Stephen Carter, there are campaigns that have launched. We have three Alberta NDP leadership candidates that are now officially a go. We had Kathleen Ganley, the first entrant into the field, launch on day one of possible launches. We had Racky Pancholi go on this past Thursday, if I&#39;m not mistaken. And we had Sarah Hoffman today, as we record. court. Sunday, February 11th, go earlier today with their launches. All three had similarities. All three had differences. We can tease them out, but I want to spend most of this episode talking about what they now need to do going forward. Carter, I&#39;ll give you my summary, and then you could interrupt and you could tell me how each of them played out for you, liftoff or letdown. Kathleen Ganley had a launch event. I&#39;m going to talk tactically here more so than anything. She had a launch event that included several MLAs, it included an introduction video, And it included a campaign website driving people to the standard things, donations, membership sales, etc. Really a focus on Team Ganley. Racky Pancholi, an ambitious campaign video that I think she certainly landed with. A website, no real launch event, but kind of came out with a signature policy, one might suggest, introducing that policy to potentially wedge her opponents on the consumer carbon tax. She announced that on Real Talk with Ryan Tresperson. And then you had Sarah Hoffman, who had a live stream event, a pretty nice looking website today, I would say, a solid and potentially even humorous launch to her launch, kind of taking out some of the wind on people&#39;s sails about who she is, why she&#39;s running, trying to reposition in certain ways what people would assume about her, Carter, both in terms of her policy positioning. But I&#39;d say out of the three, probably the clearest in terms of what are key areas of focus might ultimately be. Carter, run through the three campaigns, liftoff or letdown. Let&#39;s start with that. And then I want to start with the go forward. So liftoff, letdown, anything interesting you notice strategically. And then let&#39;s talk about the future state. Corey, I&#39;ll come to you in a second on the same series of questions.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">paint by numbers. Right. I think that each one of them maybe have had a little bit better element than the others. Right. I think that Sarah Hoffman&#39;s live event was was really quite good. Great visuals from it. I think that Racky Pancholi&#39;s video was the best in class and I give extra points to Kathleen Ganley for going first no one stumbled no one failed just no one&#39;s really you know there was nothing particularly interesting about the launch but I think we&#39;ve said it&#39;s super hard to have a launch that really explodes you know what would an explosion look like 600 people in a room maybe but</span>

            <span class="text">okay good yeah i&#39;m glad i feel like you&#39;re walking back my friend which which which seemed appropriate, given your history on this podcast. Corey, liftoff or letdown for each of these three? And then just tell me if there&#39;s something strategic you noticed. And then based on this, there&#39;s a few things I want to bring up before we kind of go to the future state.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so I do firmly believe launch days are overhyped. But I do also think that the three were interesting and told us interesting things about the campaigns. And certainly things that I&#39;ll be watching, some will be like, are they going to correct that? Or are they going to find their footing? and some are are they going to be able to follow up on that because that seemed pretty cool but what&#39;s that too right and so um let&#39;s start with sarah&#39;s because it was most recent i will say it was stronger than i expected on the campaign fundamentals right but it you know to carter&#39;s point maybe it was a little paint by numbers because it was like the things you expect from a campaign you know like the human wall and the speech and the rally and the website</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the rallies but it was all really well done right like from a campaign&#39;s fundamentals point of view she She did it. Like, I think it was in some ways the most generic of the launches. I think she sounded good</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But yes, absolutely. You know, she was stronger than I expected. And part of that is I&#39;d actually in the past couple of weeks started to think, oh, is this campaign actually going to launch, right? Like, it had had a bit of trouble at provincial council for the NDP as the rules were set. I mean, just losing vote after vote after vote, right? And there&#39;d been a lot of chatter about how that had antagonized some people and what the fuck are they doing and so on and so forth. but the campaign launched just just fine and it&#39;s clearly a campaign and it&#39;s clearly a serious campaign right i will say that rackies was for sure the standout for me i know carter thinks that there&#39;s kind of genericism here but if you look at how the people reacted to it like let&#39;s just talk about videos kathleen&#39;s video launched online had 27 000 views we were talking about this on the strategist discord the other day i can&#39;t remember who on the discord show like showed this this to us but you certainly caught my eye 27 000 views for kathleen&#39;s video racky&#39;s just on twitter had 475 000 you know in counting i mean like that&#39;s that&#39;s a big difference</span>

These videos, I&#39;d say, really, to me, kind of harken back on a bit of like, in some ways, you guys might say these have been standard for years, or as Park Carter might say, these are like paint-by-numbers for years. I think the recent sort of American election and cycle, the AOC-style video with a little bit of bio, a little bit of personality, a little bit of like upbringing story has started to kind of make its way a lot more. These two-minute style videos are now extremely common in many races when folks launch. Give me your take on kind of some lessons learned, now that it&#39;s in the past for at least a couple of these camps, on launch videos and what you think. And Carter, same thing for you from your strategist lens, and then we&#39;ll move on to the future state, as I mentioned.</span>

In terms of the quality, the words they&#39;re using, the phrases that they bring into it or don&#39;t bring into it, the things they avoid talking about, the things that they do talk about. And yeah, people like you, me, and Stephen can overanalyze and overinterpret these things. But at the end of the day, it&#39;s about a feeling.

            <span class="text">Does ambition get the credit it deserves? So you got one launch video that clearly had a higher level of ambition and execution. Another one that did not, although it was actually, I thought it was quite good at its own right. Does the extra mile on ambition pay off? And I want to maybe tie in Corey&#39;s last comment around feeling, or is it not actually even about like production and ambition polish? Like, give it to me like what you&#39;d kind of like classify as a secret sauce on launch video, maybe with that frame in mind around like, hey, should we spend the extra money going all across the province? Or should we just film this all across Calgary with some simple B-roll of the candidate, comparing the two? You know, like there was clearly a higher level of ambition in one between the other. And I&#39;m kind of curious if this teaches you or clarifies anything for you as a strategist, Stephen Carter, watching these two videos over the last week.</span>

When people start buying those memberships, when they finally turn around to buying the memberships in the last two weeks, we need that name recognition, and we are getting it from our viral videos.

For Racky, it&#39;s the fact that, you know, she seems to have a bit of a growth opportunity as it relates to the campaign that she&#39;s running.

She&#39;s got to come down here, not cede the territory. If you were like giving her advice, you might say that, but does it have to be true? You know what I mean?

If you think you&#39;re going to be one of the last two candidates in a roll-up ballot, that means either Racky or Kathleen will be off the ballot, and their supporters will have to go somewhere. And if you have just said, I haven&#39;t talked to them because I haven&#39;t gone down to Calgary, if there&#39;s large numbers of Calgary supporters in either case, you&#39;ve probably got a problem.

            <span class="text">that is getting into tactics. Like ultimately, this is about effort to vote. So if you can exert less effort and get votes, and you do have to think about a first, second and third ballot, but if you can exert less effort and get more votes in Edmonton, stay in Edmonton. Now, there are some things that you&#39;ll be trying to juggle at the same time. You&#39;ll be thinking about if you want to actually be leader, if you think you have a chance of being leader, you can&#39;t afford to be known as the leader who let Edmonton or Calgary burn, right?

Both her and Kathleen probably have that same problem. Sarah may not have as big a problem, but for Kathleen and Racky, they&#39;ve got to go to all of the major centers. And they&#39;ve got to at least put in a few days with the core volunteers that are there because there are core volunteers across the province. and you need to gather as many of those as possible just so you can say you did. When I was in Fort McMurray last week, Kathleen Ganley said to her Calgary audience, I said, you know, we have to remember that this is a province made up of people who work in energy, energy, energy, energy.

You might think there&#39;s another asset, but talk to me about her strategy. Does she need to double down on her assets right now?

And if she&#39;s just going to be Calgary Rachel, which I know we talked about and even pitched about, you know, the caution you have there is that might not be enough.

It doesn&#39;t have to be about Racky because in some ways, everyone&#39;s generated a level of enthusiasm for their campaign this week. And they all have that universal goal of turning it into memberships. How do you – Carter, in your mind, how have you bridged – and I&#39;ll kind of use different words here – air war into ground game? How have you bridged successful comms, successful branding, successful visuals with memberships? And have you picked up any tips or tricks in recent years that you may not have when you were running Redford, for example? I&#39;m kind of curious if you&#39;ve kind of got Stephen Carter&#39;s rulebook for turning enthusiasm and air war into a successful ground operation. or are they two completely different tracks that are left hand right hand they just need to know they&#39;re part of the same overall body i&#39;m kind of curious just to get both of your takes on this if</span>

            <span class="text">believe that air war has been a focus for some of the campaigns is that they want to look like they can take it to the next level they can take the fight to Danielle Smith, right? And so a lot of the polish and the chrome that these campaigns put on there is to say, look at me, I&#39;m going to be the one who&#39;s able to win the next election, right? Now, that&#39;s true, if that&#39;s what the membership is looking for. If the membership&#39;s not, then I think air war is of depreciated value. But ultimately, it is still about votes. And it&#39;s about, you know, locking up the people who can get those votes for you too. When you think about about those circles Stephen was talking about, the people who can sell a thousand memberships, a hundred memberships, those people, like getting them excited about it. And in the early days of a campaign, when people are looking around and saying, okay, well, who do I think, who</span>

            <span class="text">who do I think can give us a shot of winning more generally? You know, that&#39;s, that&#39;s probably what the thinking of the campaigns is. And so if they start to look credible and serious and like they could take the fight forward and to Daniel Smith, then maybe some of those people who say, hey, we&#39;re all new new Democrats here. I just think this is the new Democrat who&#39;s going to get us over the finish line. I think that&#39;s a lot of the logic. And I actually think this is an interesting race because my sense is not all new Democrats, but</span>

For those who don&#39;t know, we actually do an episode every year where our auditor looks over our books. And we do it live because it&#39;s part of our accountability. And it actually justifies the rates that we charge on the Patreon. Frankly, it justifies why we started the Patreon to begin with. But we&#39;re going to leave it there. That&#39;s a wrap on Episode 1284 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velgey. With me, as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Carter, and we&#39;ll see you next time.</span>
