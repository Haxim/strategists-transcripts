        <div class="desc"><p>The gang assemble on Superbowl Sunday to talk about the big game, which is of course the Alberta NDP leadership launch week. Launch strategies, "air war vs ground war" and more - plus recall petitions.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss recall efforts (using a petition to oust Calgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek) and leadership launches (using the Alberta NDP hopefuls). Is it time to "recall the recall"? Do air wars matter in leadership contests - or is it all about ground game? And will Kelce and Swift endorse one of the three NDP leadership hopefuls at the conclusion of Superbowl LVIII? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">Carter, is it time that we recall recall legislation here in Alberta? Because, of course, I ask because Calgary&#39;s mayor, Jyoti Gondek, has been issued a recall petition. The low bar that was required to get the petition off the ground now has the impossibly high bar to succeed based on the fact that a Calgary man has now started a petition. He needs more than half a million physical signatures on said petition to successfully recall Jyoti Gondek. It is all but a foregone conclusion that that will not happen. But Stephen Carter, the campaign has already begun online. This is a in-person, physical, signatory petition. But of course, there&#39;s recallmeregondek.com or .ca. I forget which domain extension, but whichever one it isn&#39;t, I&#39;m sure we will capture and be able to do what we want with it, Corey. but carter is it time we recall recall legislation and then let me give you a bit of a track i want to talk about that and then i want to start talking about what a fight back strategy for the mayor and her allies could look like against something like this that will at least at the very least create a bit of a cloud over the next 55 some odd days so that and then we&#39;ll talk about strategy but carter your thoughts on recalling recall well</div>

          <div class="said">well i think that recall is a is a bad I mean, we have an election every four years. Four years is a reasonable period of time for a person to determine, you know, for a person to deliver on the promises that they make. Two years may not be an appropriate amount of time. And realistically, with the bar that we&#39;ve set so high, there is no recall. There is no recall legislation. What there is, is an excuse for data collection. um you mentioned the online petition i mean i just you know it&#39;s by the way it&#39;s dot com so dot ca is available cory um but the the the ridiculous</div>

I generally do believe that you should give politicians their four-year term, and that that makes sense, and that we should judge people on a bundle of actions, and recall does seem to be triggered by individual actions, and I don&#39;t necessarily think that&#39;s super helpful but all of that said do</div>

You know, those door-knocking captains, for them to be successful in the next 60 days, it&#39;s less than 60 days now, but if they were going to be successful, they&#39;d have to have something like 12,500 hours from door-knockers to do that. And it&#39;s just not going to happen. But if you targeted three or four ridings and you found out, you know, where a group of anti-Gondek supporters are, you could then mobilize that group for a councillor candidate in the next election. or if you did all 14 ridings it&#39;d be super easy to mobilize significant groups for your 14 counselors and um a mayoralty candidate so the data collection like you don&#39;t even care about the the the gen pop what you&#39;re aiming for are the people who are going to be the door knocking captains those captains are worth their money and you know they&#39;re waiting gold and you&#39;re going to to have probably,</div>

But let&#39;s be really clear. This is not about me. This is about them building lists for their next crazy right-wing adventure. And if you have a problem with me as mayor, you know, this is my office phone number. This is my office email address. I want to hear from you. I want to talk to you.

Number one, should the mayor herself center herself, by which I mean, should she be a spokesperson for something like this in a fight back strategy? Does she have to kind of like come out and say some of the things, you know, that Corey has said or that you have suggested to say? And secondly, should those that want to defend the mayor invoke the mayor&#39;s name or make this about the broader cause of democracy or progressivism or those things? give me your thoughts on both of those those questions what</div>

          <div class="said">our next segment. Our next segment, of course, is one brought to us by our sponsor, Flair Airlines. Lift off or let down. Guys, we are here. It&#39;s a Claire Airlines liftoff or a letdown. We always do this when there are campaigns that have launched. And Stephen Carter, there are campaigns that have launched. We have three Alberta NDP leadership candidates that are now officially a go. We had Kathleen Ganley, the first entrant into the field, launch on day one of possible launches. We had Racky Pancholi go on this past Thursday, if I&#39;m not mistaken. And we had Sarah Hoffman today, as we record. court. Sunday, February 11th, go earlier today with their launches. All three had similarities. All three had differences. We can tease them out, but I want to spend most of this episode talking about what they now need to do going forward. Carter, I&#39;ll give you my summary, and then you could interrupt and you could tell me how each of them played out for you, liftoff or letdown. Kathleen Ganley had a launch event. I&#39;m going to talk tactically here more so than anything. She had a launch event that included several MLAs, it included an introduction video, And it included a campaign website driving people to the standard things, donations, membership sales, etc. Really a focus on Team Ganley. Racky Pancholi, an ambitious campaign video that I think she certainly landed with. A website, no real launch event, but kind of came out with a signature policy, one might suggest, introducing that policy to potentially wedge her opponents on the consumer carbon tax. She announced that on Real Talk with Ryan Tresperson. And then you had Sarah Hoffman, who had a live stream event, a pretty nice looking website today, I would say, a solid and potentially even humorous launch to her launch, kind of taking out some of the wind on people&#39;s sails about who she is, why she&#39;s running, trying to reposition in certain ways what people would assume about her, Carter, both in terms of her policy positioning. But I&#39;d say out of the three, probably the clearest in terms of what are key areas of focus might ultimately be. Carter, run through the three campaigns, liftoff or letdown. Let&#39;s start with that. And then I want to start with the go forward. So liftoff, letdown, anything interesting you notice strategically. And then let&#39;s talk about the future state. Corey, I&#39;ll come to you in a second on the same series of questions.</div>

          <div class="said">paint by numbers. Right. I think that each one of them maybe have had a little bit better element than the others. Right. I think that Sarah Hoffman&#39;s live event was was really quite good. Great visuals from it. I think that Racky Pancholi&#39;s video was the best in class and I give extra points to Kathleen Ganley for going first no one stumbled no one failed just no one&#39;s really you know there was nothing particularly interesting about the launch but I think we&#39;ve said it&#39;s super hard to have a launch that really explodes you know what would an explosion look like 600 people in a room maybe but</div>

Corey, liftoff or letdown for each of these three? And then just tell me if there&#39;s something strategic you noticed. And then based on this, there&#39;s a few things I want to bring up before we kind of go to the future state.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, so I do firmly believe launch days are overhyped. But I do also think that the three were interesting and told us interesting things about the campaigns. And certainly things that I&#39;ll be watching, some will be like, are they going to correct that? Or are they going to find their footing? and some are are they going to be able to follow up on that because that seemed pretty cool but what&#39;s that too right and so um let&#39;s start with sarah&#39;s because it was most recent i will say it was stronger than i expected on the campaign fundamentals right but it you know to carter&#39;s point maybe it was a little paint by numbers because it was like the things you expect from a campaign you know like the human wall and the speech and the rally and the website</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">the rallies but it was all really well done right like from a campaign&#39;s fundamentals point of view she She did it. Like, I think it was in some ways the most generic of the launches. I think she sounded good</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="turn" data-start="1963">

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">But yes, absolutely. You know, she was stronger than I expected. And part of that is I&#39;d actually in the past couple of weeks started to think, oh, is this campaign actually going to launch, right? Like, it had had a bit of trouble at provincial council for the NDP as the rules were set. I mean, just losing vote after vote after vote, right? And there&#39;d been a lot of chatter about how that had antagonized some people and what the fuck are they doing and so on and so forth. but the campaign launched just just fine and it&#39;s clearly a campaign and it&#39;s clearly a serious campaign right i will say that rackies was for sure the standout for me i know carter thinks that there&#39;s kind of genericism here but if you look at how the people reacted to it like let&#39;s just talk about videos kathleen&#39;s video launched online had 27 000 views we were talking about this on the strategist discord the other day i can&#39;t remember who on the discord show like showed this this to us but you certainly caught my eye 27 000 views for kathleen&#39;s video racky&#39;s just on twitter had 475 000 you know in counting i mean like that&#39;s that&#39;s a big difference</div>

          <div class="said">so there was that but there was also the way that the kind of narrative was seized on the the carbon tax which now sarah hoffman has gone out and i think rather sensibly said i&#39;m not going to be the pro-carbon tax person and just said yeah maybe it&#39;s dead but i mean that was that was pretty impressive like just changed the frame got a lot of media out of it move forward kathleen&#39;s was weaker than i expected um simply because it is it&#39;s just been like it&#39;s</div>

These videos, I&#39;d say, really, to me, kind of harken back on a bit of like, in some ways, you guys might say these have been standard for years, or as Park Carter might say, these are like paint-by-numbers for years. I think the recent sort of American election and cycle, the AOC-style video with a little bit of bio, a little bit of personality, a little bit of like upbringing story has started to kind of make its way a lot more. These two-minute style videos are now extremely common in many races when folks launch. Give me your take on kind of some lessons learned, now that it&#39;s in the past for at least a couple of these camps, on launch videos and what you think. And Carter, same thing for you from your strategist lens, and then we&#39;ll move on to the future state, as I mentioned.</div>

Like, give it to me like what you&#39;d kind of like classify as a secret sauce on launch video, maybe with that frame in mind around like, hey, should we spend the extra money going all across the province? Or should we just film this all across Calgary with some simple B-roll of the candidate, comparing the two? You know, like there was clearly a higher level of ambition in one between the other.

When people start buying those memberships, when they finally turn around to buying the memberships in the last two weeks, we need that name recognition, and we are getting it from our viral videos.

If you think you&#39;re going to be one of the last two candidates in a roll-up ballot, that means either Racky or Kathleen will be off the ballot, and their supporters will have to go somewhere. And if you have just said, I haven&#39;t talked to them because I haven&#39;t gone down to Calgary, if there&#39;s large numbers of Calgary supporters in either case, you&#39;ve probably got a problem.

          <div class="said">that is getting into tactics. Like ultimately, this is about effort to vote. So if you can exert less effort and get votes, and you do have to think about a first, second and third ballot, but if you can exert less effort and get more votes in Edmonton, stay in Edmonton. Now, there are some things that you&#39;ll be trying to juggle at the same time. You&#39;ll be thinking about if you want to actually be leader, if you think you have a chance of being leader, you can&#39;t afford to be known as the leader who let Edmonton or Calgary burn, right?

It doesn&#39;t have to be about Racky because in some ways, everyone&#39;s generated a level of enthusiasm for their campaign this week. And they all have that universal goal of turning it into memberships. How do you – Carter, in your mind, how have you bridged – and I&#39;ll kind of use different words here – air war into ground game? How have you bridged successful comms, successful branding, successful visuals with memberships? And have you picked up any tips or tricks in recent years that you may not have when you were running Redford, for example? I&#39;m kind of curious if you&#39;ve kind of got Stephen Carter&#39;s rulebook for turning enthusiasm and air war into a successful ground operation. or are they two completely different tracks that are left hand right hand they just need to know they&#39;re part of the same overall body i&#39;m kind of curious just to get both of your takes on this if</div>

Now, that&#39;s true, if that&#39;s what the membership is looking for. If the membership&#39;s not, then I think air war is of depreciated value. But ultimately, it is still about votes. And it&#39;s about, you know, locking up the people who can get those votes for you too. When you think about about those circles Stephen was talking about, the people who can sell a thousand memberships, a hundred memberships, those people, like getting them excited about it. And in the early days of a campaign, when people are looking around and saying, okay, well, who do I think, who</div>

For those who don&#39;t know, we actually do an episode every year where our auditor looks over our books. And we do it live because it&#39;s part of our accountability.
