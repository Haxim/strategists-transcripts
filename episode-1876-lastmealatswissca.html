We&#39;re seeing more stride in opposition from a former cabinet minister than Nenshi. Okay. There&#39;s that statement. But then the question is, what can opposition forces beyond the NDP do? And maybe we can start there and work back to the NDP because it is by-election night. Is that fair? So why does it seem like that forces beyond the official opposition and others are also having an issue? And maybe I can expand the scope. Why does it feel like this seems to be a thing beyond Alberta as well, Carter, that we&#39;re having a tough time opposing conservatives?

But for the secondary and the tertiary class of Calgary citizens, it&#39;s a rematch again where conservatism is in favor and he holds the mantle there.

            <span class="text">thought process. You understand this more intimately. You probably know the dynamics between first, second, third, what percentage it takes to win. I also believe this will be one of those elections where the winner may have 29% to 36% in terms of what they get in terms of vote share to win, because that&#39;s going to be a few people who can carve out 12% to 15% homes.</span>

And then I think he takes advantage of the fact that many of the people in the second and third ring still feel like he&#39;s a conservative or, if branded with a bit more negativity, conservative enough. That&#39;s how I look at it. I don&#39;t have the numbers you have. I don&#39;t have any of the poll, but it becomes a realtor election. The second and third ring know Jeremy Farkas, and the one name I haven&#39;t mentioned is our sitting Mayor Jyoti Gondek, who I&#39;ve got a lot of time and respect for, but it seems like from at least some of the polling, is going to be competitive enough, but might not have the same chance that she did last time.</span>
