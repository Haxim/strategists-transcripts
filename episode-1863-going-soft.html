          <p>Zain Velji and Stephen Carter talk political ads, platforms, and predictions. With more unsolicited advice for the campaigns than you can shake a Kory Teneycke at. Are party platforms still relevant? Why are everyone's ads so bad right now? And should you contact your doctor if the urge to vote conservative lasts more than 4 hours? Annalise does her best, but Zain and Carter have other ideas.</p>

            <div class="said">you could cut that shit together put some nice music on it um less easy for carney the rooms are not as full the rallies are more technocratic um i&#39;m not saying he&#39;s human and Valium, but like, you know, he&#39;s a different type of political speaker. So you as a campaign need to engineer momentum. So whether that is showing B-roll, and as I get specific on this particular spot, B-roll of him meeting with people, engaging in community, doing what Carney does well, listening, delivering from a podium, being prime minister, like just do fast cuts. If the guy isn&#39;t quick, you make the cuts quick, right? So you do like a bunch of quick cuts to kind of show momentum energy do a recap of the campaign where we&#39;ve been where it&#39;s what it&#39;s looking like so even if he&#39;s not moving quick with his words which he doesn&#39;t even if he&#39;s not moving quick with his body which he doesn&#39;t you make the cuts extremely quick so it shows it shows momentum in that way you make the music that way so it kind of shows something so that&#39;s the sort of anthemic aspect of it the content of it has to do two things in my mind carney&#39;s got to tell a story for fucking and sake he can&#39;t just show up um to these rallies and start speaking with a bunch of policy solutions</div>

But it needs to be, for Carney&#39;s particular sake, it needs to be a story. Tell me what an imagined future looks like in Canada with you as leader, right? It&#39;s a Sunday, right? You are doing what? You&#39;re safe because of X. Your wallet&#39;s full. You&#39;re living life. You&#39;re doing whatever. You&#39;re enjoying things. Tell me a story, whatever that looks like. I have not heard that from Carney. I know it&#39;s not a strength from Carney, but we&#39;re talking about a set piece here. We&#39;re not talking about him having to fundamentally change his personality. We need something that kind of says that. And I think all that leads to like, make people feel something. Make people feel something, which kind of then leads me to saying, Carter&#39;s right that this needs to be one of the spots. The second spot though, in my mind, has to be ballot</div>

Go back to your thesis statement on that and why you&#39;re the best. so the second ad to me is almost like how do you create a prime ministerial spot you&#39;re doing one anthemic mark carney momentum spot with a story and then you&#39;re doing one spot that tries to tell the story as prime minister about the threat we face and why this guy and using the incumbency advantage i mean not with the podium and everything but you see what i&#39;m you know what i&#39;m trying to say what</div>

No one understands the fullness of government. No one understands all the inputs and outputs of a fully costed platform. I mean, that is utter and complete lunacy. What we need is a platform that is, you know, constructed around electability. and that platform needs to have maybe six or seven planks over a 35 day campaign that actually stand out i mean you you might release 35 different days of 35 different ideas but six or seven ideas are going to be the themes are going to be the things that hold it all together making canada more affordable protecting us from donald trump making sure that we&#39;ve got a safe supply of eggs and a safe supply of of milk you know that that the united states doesn&#39;t have these are things that we can start to trumpet we are actually doing a great job in and it&#39;s because of the liberals says the liberal campaign and we could do a better job says the conservative campaign but you don&#39;t need to to do a fully costed platform as though it&#39;s the but i mean how long is the federal budget zane 800</div>
