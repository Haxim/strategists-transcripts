Now, we could go down the creative aspect of it. That interests me less because we can always criticize, as you&#39;ve said, Carter, we can always criticize people&#39;s creative. But what&#39;s most interesting to me right here is, is this a strategic miss by the conservatives that they were trying to target one audience and they just failed with this spot? Or is this a strategic hit</span>

Like, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good that there&#39;s a world in which it could be for the conservatives and they could come out after Monday and explain to us in their miraculous sort of how they held Carney to a minority or how they themselves got a minority, you know, post debrief explanation. But my instinct is that they&#39;re trying to plug a hole rather than to do something offensive, like on the offense from a strategic perspective.</span>

So you as a campaign need to engineer momentum. So whether that is showing B-roll, and as I get specific on this particular spot, B-roll of him meeting with people, engaging in community, doing what Carney does well, listening, delivering from a podium, being prime minister, like just do fast cuts. If the guy isn&#39;t quick, you make the cuts quick, right? So you do like a bunch of quick cuts to kind of show momentum energy do a recap of the campaign where we&#39;ve been where it&#39;s what it&#39;s looking like so even if he&#39;s not moving quick with his words which he doesn&#39;t even if he&#39;s not moving quick with his body which he doesn&#39;t you make the cuts extremely quick so it shows it shows momentum in that way you make the music that way so it kind of shows something so that&#39;s the sort of anthemic aspect of it the content of it has to do two things in my mind carney&#39;s got to tell a story for fucking and sake he can&#39;t just show up um to these rallies and start speaking with a bunch of policy solutions</span>

But it needs to be, for Carney&#39;s particular sake, it needs to be a story. Tell me what an imagined future looks like in Canada with you as leader, right? It&#39;s a Sunday, right? You are doing what? You&#39;re safe because of X. Your wallet&#39;s full. You&#39;re living life. You&#39;re doing whatever. You&#39;re enjoying things. Tell me a story, whatever that looks like. I have not heard that from Carney. I know it&#39;s not a strength from Carney, but we&#39;re talking about a set piece here. We&#39;re not talking about him having to fundamentally change his personality. We need something that kind of says that. And I think all that leads to like, make people feel something. Make people feel something, which kind of then leads me to saying, Carter&#39;s right that this needs to be one of the spots. The second spot though, in my mind, has to be ballot</span>

Go back to your thesis statement on that and why you&#39;re the best. so the second ad to me is almost like how do you create a prime ministerial spot you&#39;re doing one anthemic mark carney momentum spot with a story and then you&#39;re doing one spot that tries to tell the story as prime minister about the threat we face and why this guy and using the incumbency advantage i mean not with the podium and everything but you see what i&#39;m you know what i&#39;m trying to say what</span>

Now, I think party status is overblown as it relates to the remaking of the NDP. My mind is already at the remaking of the NDP right now, federally, in terms of where that goes.

Is their offensive strategy going after the liberal platform? Maybe. I think releasing their own platform is going to bring a world of hurt to them because you will see how many dollars in public sector cuts they&#39;ll ultimately be proposing, and the media will be quick to hit on that. Figure out your offensive strategy in the final week. Because if Carter, one thing, you know, I don&#39;t call Jenny Byrne incompetent, but i do she</span>

No one understands the fullness of government. No one understands all the inputs and outputs of a fully costed platform. I mean, that is utter and complete lunacy. What we need is a platform that is, you know, constructed around electability. and that platform needs to have maybe six or seven planks over a 35 day campaign that actually stand out i mean you you might release 35 different days of 35 different ideas but six or seven ideas are going to be the themes are going to be the things that hold it all together making canada more affordable protecting us from donald trump making sure that we&#39;ve got a safe supply of eggs and a safe supply of of milk you know that that the united states doesn&#39;t have these are things that we can start to trumpet we are actually doing a great job in and it&#39;s because of the liberals says the liberal campaign and we could do a better job says the conservative campaign but you don&#39;t need to to do a fully costed platform as though it&#39;s the but i mean how long is the federal budget zane 800</span>

            <span class="text">yeah my mind goes towards more like like values and and stories again and like who i know the ndp tried something which i think was a bit of a failed experiment but i i think you You don&#39;t throw out the entire thing altogether. But Carter, I don&#39;t remember if this was the 21 or the 19 election where the NDP kind of said who we&#39;re in it for. And then they listed a bunch of groups, almost like tags. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">then they said, like, based on these tags, you click on these tags and you see, like, what&#39;s in it for you. And maybe that&#39;s a bit too reductive and extremely transactional. But there&#39;s a part of me that would like to see, like, how do you take a platform and distill it into who we&#39;re in it for and what we see in you or what we value in you or what we&#39;ve heard from you sort of thing.</span>

            <span class="text">hit that comes out of a policy platform, I think is better engineered through single shingle announcements on their own. They don&#39;t need to be part of a broader playbook. They&#39;re better engineered through creative that you either pay for or that is done through an endorsement class or through other organizations. I don&#39;t think putting out a set piece that&#39;s about your entire platform, which then ultimately ends up being the hit of the day, that&#39;s just like creating, engineering a solution for a problem that doesn&#39;t exist. And frankly, that might be the takeaway here. The platform might be a solution for a problem that no longer exists.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I never understood writing a platform. I liked having planks of a platform that I could spin out, but I don&#39;t like the book. I think that, you know, putting out the fully costed platform is just a waste of time and energy. um it keeps uh what 12 eggheads busy during the campaign but that doesn&#39;t solve any of your real campaigning issues okay</span>
