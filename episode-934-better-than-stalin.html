            <span class="text">is one of these things where it&#39;s very tempting for politicians to say, well, I want to see you as a partner here, or I want you involved in some way, shape, or form to try to flatter their preferred candidate into the role. But you have to be candid about what the role is and what the limits of that role is. And I think one of the problems with Payette is that there was clearly never an exchange of information, both the transmission of this is the job and then the receiving back of I understand this is the job because she took an entirely different approach to it. And it was one that ultimately got her set up at odds with the prime minister&#39;s office. And even though she resigned with a cloud about how she treated staff, the reality is that was not a productive, healthy relationship with the PMO</span>

And I suspect that, you know, they were going to be much more careful about doing the vetting this time around, making sure it&#39;s not somebody who&#39;s had workplace challenges in the past. But beyond that, there needs to be clarity on the role and clarity as to the nature of of the quote unquote partnership. And let&#39;s be clear, it&#39;s not a partnership. The prime minister is the boss. The governor general is a figurehead.</span>

This is a ceremonial job. You&#39;ll need to do these 10 things. Here&#39;s what it looks like. Here&#39;s, you know, around these times, here&#39;s exactly and tactically what you need to do. And then there&#39;s like a lot of open space, right? Then there&#39;s like the day to day where you&#39;ll engage with community or you&#39;ll do outreach. How much would you advise, if LeBlanc is giving the list of eight to 10 names, how much would you advise as part of that eight to 10 names as to what Corey said, that you include the framework of start more like crystalline defining what the job is, even in the flexible space that it once existed in?</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve tuned in. I don&#39;t want to hear any more about this. Let&#39;s move it on to our next segment. Our next segment, 1% Problems. Guys, I want to focus the attention to here in Alberta, where the Alberta&#39;s Teacher Association have lost confidence in the education of Minister Adriana Lagrange, according to a Sunday vote by association representatives. The annual representative assembly of the ATA, the Alberta Teachers Association, held virtually this year, acts as a parliamentary function to pass resolutions. It includes more than 450 teacher delegates to represent each of its, I believe, close to 60 locals. A resolution was put forward to express a loss of confidence in the Education Minister, Adrienne Lagrange, was jointly drafted by 20 of the 55 locals, so just shy of 60, and that resolution passed. Now, here&#39;s the question. The reason I called the segment 1% Problems is that, Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. The resolution passed with 99% support. Tell me something. Is this just super, super inside baseball from a group that you&#39;d expect not to, regardless of what this conservative government did, be on side? Or is this historically bad? And I&#39;m trying to get the most objective take here. I know that it&#39;s easy to pile on on Kenya. I&#39;m not going to suggest that you&#39;re about to do that. But from an objective political read of the situation, is this actually a big deal or are we overblowing it both from the standpoint, A, this was jointly drafted by 20 locals, B, that it was put forward to resolution, C, it passed with 99% support? court?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Because the reason you have school boards is to take the hit for you, right? The reason you have school boards is the school board are the ones that are screwing up your kids&#39; education, not the provincial government. But the school boards have successfully passed the problem to the province. Teachers have successfully passed the problem to the province. I mean, and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and here&#39;s my confession. When in 2011, when Alison Redford won the leadership for the Progressive Conservative Party, she does not win. She does not win that leadership without teachers and nurses. Teachers especially. We made a very public pledge to return, I think, some $120 million in funding that had been cut. In the overall scheme of things, not a significant amount of money. but it was significant to teachers and they came out in droves for us. Teachers are super important because they aren&#39;t politically left and they aren&#39;t politically right. Most of them are just happy to kind of get by and be</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">be a part of the community. And they have at their hands huge relationships with parents. So when you have teachers, you have a significant portion of of the population. When you lose teachers, you lose significant portions of the population. It&#39;s the same thing holds with nurses. Anybody who&#39;s ever had a loved one or sadly been in a hospital on their own, the nurses carry you. The nurses are the ones that get you through day to day. And if the nurses are unhappy, you&#39;re unhappy. And so having nurses on the government side, having doctors on the government side, having ATA, having school boards, this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this all adds up. And when you start to lose one after the other, the ATA is not viewed as a traditional union. The ATA is not looked at like the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees or the Canadian Union of, you know, these things, these unions that are more union-like are seen as negatives. The teachers are seen as people from your community. And so losing them is really bad. But is it not a union,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Totally. Totally union politics. I&#39;m just not sure that this, you know, that it matters to people at this particular moment. I think that the people will say teachers don&#39;t like this. And right now they&#39;re inclined to say that&#39;s bad.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">definitely think it&#39;s one of those things people will be able to point to for several months, just as we still talk about the Alberta Medical Association giving 98% non-confidence in Shandro. But to be clear, this is 99% of representatives. These are the people who are chosen. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s, you know, I mean, it&#39;s, you know, there&#39;s a filter, there&#39;s a gap in between. And the people who tend to put themselves up for representation in any organization tend to be a little more militant and often will vote strategically if they&#39;re trying to send a message. And this is potentially a good example of that. But I want to tell you a story. And that story is that in 1946, Joseph Stalin ran elections to the Supreme Soviet. And in those elections, Stalin, the Bolsheviks got 99% of the vote and 1% voted against. So non-confidence in our minister of education is as popular as Joseph Stalin in a Joseph Stalin run election right now. I mean, like the percent is pretty extreme. And I think that that&#39;s got to give the government a bit of pause because they&#39;re definitely playing for keeps, right? They&#39;re not fucking about and they&#39;re making it very clear. They&#39;re very mad about the state of the relationship between the province of Alberta and the Alberta Teachers Association.</span>

How do you as Kenny point to this, or UCP, government of the day, how do you point to this as isolated incident versus pattern?

            <span class="text">you just say it&#39;s all politics, it&#39;s all optics. And yes, I mean, we are trying to write a ship here. The teachers&#39; compensation needs to be brought in line. Albertans across the province have had to have their wages reduced to deal with this economic downturn, blah, blah, blah. You know, all of the standard UCP talking points on this matter. I think that there&#39;s going to be a pretty compelling proposition</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">proposition to an audience if you say that, too, right? The counterpoint, you mean? Yeah, for whatever reason, there&#39;s a whole lot of people in this world who, when they suffer, would be very happy if other people suffer as well. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And if my wages go down, I think your wages should go down. And to be fair, there&#39;s also people who are deeply anxious about the fiscal state of the province, given that Jason Kenney and the UCP government and allies have for many years been talking about this fiscal disaster that we have, which was part of their proposition for this is why you&#39;ve got to replace the NDP. and the deficit has just gotten worse the debt has just gotten worse things have have gotten markedly uh downhill from where they were in 2019 so if if you have managed to convince people about how bad it was then they&#39;re going to look at it now and they&#39;re going to think the sky is fucking falling and they&#39;re going to want to see reductions done to teachers salaries whatnot but this is obviously this is much bigger than although i think tied into the ongoing negotiations negotiations on everything under the sun all of the various public sector contracts we have this this uh curriculum is incredibly unpopular it&#39;s what out of 61 62 i can&#39;t remember the exact number of school boards 56 have said they will not pilot it representing vast</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">vast vast majority of the population of the population of the students that are out there um and the idea that the government would push forward with it anyways, I think really is quite offensive to teachers, and for good reason. It&#39;s like, you&#39;re just, you&#39;re going to create this in a back room, talking to quote-unquote experts, you&#39;re then going to bring it forward, school boards everywhere are going to say, whoa, no, for a bunch of reasons that we&#39;ve gone over in this show, we&#39;re not willing to do this, and then you&#39;re going to try to ram it forward anyhow. So really, when you think about it, and I don&#39;t want to get too simple about this, you&#39;ve got the labor relations side of it, and you&#39;ve got the fact that they&#39;re professionals, that side And the government of the day is kind of offending them on both fronts right now. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So it can&#39;t be that surprising to people that 99% of representatives would be opposed. Your question about Jason Kenney, though, I think he&#39;s got to kind of jujitsu it and say, well, yeah, we are trying to change things here. This is, as we all know, blah, blah, blah, like a system that was in serious need of an overhaul, our test scores were dropped, whatever they, you know, those old chestnuts they always bring forward, you know, dropping from best in the world to second best in the world or whatever that we&#39;re supposed to panic about. Yeah. And that&#39;s got to be the line. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s particularly compelling, but it&#39;s going to have resonance for some people.</span>

            <span class="text">a long time, there&#39;s a perception that the teachers, and more specifically, you know, the ATA representing the teachers, kind of has this halo effect, right? Like, you&#39;ve got teachers. Like, who can hate teachers, right? Like, they teach your kids. We always know that they&#39;re overworked. They&#39;re underpaid. Like, you know, it&#39;s not like doctors, perhaps, where you&#39;re like these rich, prick doctors, right, which is an easy sort of line. No, no. But I think for a lot of people, it&#39;s an easy escape hatch. Am I right in saying that there&#39;s like a delicacy with how the UCP might need to navigate teachers? And perhaps can you speak to your experience around teachers? I know you&#39;ve spoken to them in terms of a voting block. Can you speak to the delicacy around how to navigate with the teachers group in particular as it relates to just as perceived, maybe it&#39;s perceived because I&#39;d love to validate it, halo effect that they may have with their place and position in community?

And you&#39;ll hear a lot of complaints. Every year there&#39;s a complaint about the grade two teacher in the elementary school.

And because they&#39;re embodiments of community in perhaps demographics, etc., where they are, how they access, that their political power is less so that they have this critical job function, but more so how spread out and in community and entrenched community that they are.

And there&#39;s a lot of interpolation you can do based on some of the statistics available. Right off the bat, we do know that teachers, like doctors, are much more trusted than</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">COVID, there was a fair bit of polling that showed Canadians wanted teachers to get paid more to deal with COVID. That, to me, doesn&#39;t suggest that Canadians feel teachers are deeply overpaid. I, in the last three minutes here, did quick Googling to try to find polling on teachers&#39; pay. I couldn&#39;t find anything that would be remotely relevant besides for that particular COVID chestnut here. But I&#39;ll tell you, I think that it&#39;s not so much that the public, so it&#39;s a little nuanced though, right? Teachers and doctors have kind of different versions of this, right? People</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">People generally think that doctors are overpaid, but they like their doctor, right? With teachers, it&#39;s almost the inverse. They generally think teachers are paid well, but they might think a A certain teacher is overpaid, right? They think individual teachers can be crappy. And I think part of that is we&#39;re just exposed to Carter&#39;s point to a lot more teachers throughout our life, right? We see the good teachers. We see the bad teachers. The peaks and valleys are apparent to us. And unlike a physician, we don&#39;t really get to pick our teacher, right? Like if you&#39;ve got a bad doctor, you just go to a different doctor&#39;s office. You&#39;ve got a bad teacher, you&#39;ve got to bear it for a year. And that&#39;s really frustrating as</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as a parent, right? And so I don&#39;t think that people in general think that teachers are overpaid. But I do think that people think teachers have too many job protections, like if you were going to push and pull on that. And so I think it&#39;s an area of, you know, even teachers will complain about bad teachers, I guess is the point. And so it&#39;s an interesting area where maybe teachers don&#39;t have as much leverage. But I think what&#39;s fascinating about this fight that&#39;s going on right now between the government and the teachers is the government&#39;s not picking that ground to fight on, right?</span>

They&#39;re doing across the board cuts. They&#39;re doing a curriculum where they&#39;re writ large, picking these battles with teachers rather than picking ground that perhaps would be an easier first</span>

They seem to probably have a good weekend. They&#39;re probably celebrating, right, in the sense that, hey, listen, 99%, we sent the message we wanted to, right? Let&#39;s just say that was their goal heading into the weekend. Hey, we sent that message. We&#39;d have loved for it to be 100 to make it a true Iraqi election, but it was 99%. 100 would have been worse, by the way. Yeah, we&#39;re in totally worse.</span>

So teachers may know a tremendous amount about the curriculum and all of the challenges that are in the curriculum, but a parent may not want to know all of that. They just want to know a couple of little tidbits, a couple of tidbits that they can jump into. You know, like one of the tidbits might be that it looks like it was, you know, plagiarized off of a UK website or a US website where they were looking at year seven and they equated that to seven-year-olds. year seven being you know grade seven as we would have it so 12 year olds topics that were unintended for 12 year olds are now being taught to seven year olds that that type of stuff will drive parents batty they don&#39;t need to know the information specific to Charlemagne they just need to know that this information was gathered improperly and it was it</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, same final question for you on this segment. Advice to the teachers as they, you know, they reconcile their political power on the heels of this weekend and perhaps how to not not overplay that political power that they have and the wind behind their back, so to speak.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So 99% is an attention grabber. And to Carter&#39;s point, now what you need is when people come up and say, wow, I hear 99%. Why? Have a way that every teacher can explain why in a way that lands with parents. Make it about their kids. Make it about the curriculum. Make it about safety during COVID. Stay away from collective bargaining. Stay away from talking about yourself. Use the things Things that have been tested, ideally polled to show that 90% of parents, when they hear, for example, the curriculum says Charlemagne to eight-year-olds, they&#39;re like, what the fuck? That&#39;s crazy. Or when they hear that there&#39;s no money for fixing ventilation in classrooms through all of this COVID times and there&#39;s been no additional cleaning or anything like that, those are the kinds of things that people can grab onto. But you do want to stay away from collective bargaining, stay away from talking about yourself. So send something out Tuesday morning that basically is to all members saying 99% of representatives voted, none confidence in the minister. And here&#39;s why. And give them six bullets and just say, literally say, if anybody asks, this is basically why. This is what you can use. because, and we&#39;ve talked about this in different contexts before, Stephen and I, and all three of us used to do this kind of work in campaign consulting when we worked for Hill &amp; Knowlton.</span>

Corey, you may not have known it, but you&#39;ve properly foreshadowed our next segment. with your mention of campaign consulting. So let&#39;s look at the specific of a story here in Canada. And then I want to talk about political consulting as a craft, as a craft that exists around the world and the value of that craft domestically here in Canada. So the federal conservatives have tapped consultants who helped land a majority government for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to help Erin O&#39;Toole&#39;s political strategy. This is information learned by the the Toronto Star. In fact, when they followed up with these two consulting firms, Stack Data Strategy, which is providing, quote unquote, advanced analytics, we can unpack that a bit more if we need to, not necessarily wanting to tinge it with some other firms that have come into this country providing advanced analytics, but there we are. Alongside another firm that is helping in digital strategy, both firms have helped, as I mentioned earlier, UK Prime Minister Mr. Boris Johnson, win his election. This other firm called Tofam Guerin, I believe, if I&#39;m pronouncing that correctly, is a digital consultancy with offices in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and is on the ground here, so to speak, to help Aaron O&#39;Toole and the Conservative Party help boost the social media presence. Okay, I want to start here. Carter, let&#39;s talk about the specific story, and then let&#39;s get into the general. What are you shaking your head about? No,</span>

I think that it&#39;s one of the least appealing things about Canadian identity that we get so parochial about these and we start feeling so defensive, of like, whoa, how dare you get somebody from the UK or New Zealand or Australia? By the way, New Zealand and Australia are smaller than Canada. So calm down, Canada, we can still feel pretty good about ourselves in the morning. And it&#39;s just, it&#39;s, it&#39;s okay. Like, I think one of the cool things about this country is how connected we are to all of these other countries out there. So this is a tempest in a teapot for me. Makes sense.

Boris Johnson&#39;s guise and the divisiveness that has been sowed there and the and the long term consequences, you know, of Scotland wanting to leave and the Irish issues that are flaring up under the wonderful leadership of Boris Johnson, all because not because Boris Johnson&#39;s a horrible person, although he is. It&#39;s all because of the divisive types of politics that have been used there, including the selling of Brexit as though it was some sort of of opportunity because you could appeal to xenophobic voters. And that&#39;s what these people have been doing is appealing to xenophobic voters. And I&#39;m going to tell you something, Corey, we have our own xenophobic voters here in Canada, and they will be appealed to by now this campaign coming from across the pond. I think it&#39;s terrible. I think that if you&#39;re going to do this type of work, at least do it with the local understanding of and the local history of the issues that are facing our country, because you don&#39;t want to unintentionally flare up a Quebec separation issue. You don&#39;t want to unintentionally flare up an Alberta separation issue.

And, yes, it&#39;s as though Carter ignored the entire thing where I said it had to be married with experts in the geography. And this is obviously a team that&#39;s got a good sense of analytics. One of the things I saw in some of the reporting here was this kind of shock by people, like, oh, my goodness. What if they think that working class voters in Nova Scotia are the same as working class voters in B.C.? Yeah, you&#39;re telling me that a professional analytics firm, when they&#39;re looking at the variables available to them, are not going to try to partition based on geography, like one of the most obvious indicators there is? Like, listen, they&#39;re going to get this. They can figure this out. But the idea is they&#39;re using these tools to cut this data in interesting ways and say what is actually meaningful in determining how votes are. That&#39;s what an analytics company does there.

And he&#39;s saying, hey, I&#39;d like to see if there&#39;s a Canadian version of that. Again, you&#39;re going to have to tie it with local experts, experts in the geography there.

And maybe before I go there, you know, one of the reasons why I brought this onto today&#39;s agenda was when we&#39;ve heard of external consultants come into, let me be clear, the conservative party in the past. I look back at that 2015 example of the – is it Linton Crosby, right? The dead cat on the table guy who was responsible for that strategy, which its practical ramification, if I&#39;m not mistaken, was doubling down on the niqab ban and was the barbaric cultural practices hotline, which I know may have just been a convenient, oh, that was Linton&#39;s idea, right? Right. Easy thing to say for folks. So I&#39;m not necessarily sure if that was attributable to him, but it kind of brought that flavor of divisiveness that has kind of left a sour taste in my mouth. Am I wrong to be skeptical of foreign sort of, especially on the conservative side, foreign strategy and consulting firms to kind of jump in? Tell me. me yeah absolutely</span>

And they&#39;ll talk to people who have understanding of those local differences as well.

Because, okay, you know, we talk about this concept of scaffolding them with folks that are domestic, that have the domestic interest. You can also position consultants in a way that&#39;s harmful to your campaign. So from your past experiences and how you&#39;ve used consultants, I&#39;d say within but even perhaps outside of the campaign structure, we&#39;ve done this sort of work, perhaps not necessarily for political entities outside of the country, but we&#39;re familiar with these things. What advice or what would you want to elucidate to our listeners in terms of the placement of these consultants in a general org chart or pecking order as it relates to a campaign and maybe even including that concept of accountability that I introduced in some way? Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, it really depends on what you have and what you don&#39;t have. Because why do people hire consultants? They hire them for basically one of three reasons. They have an expertise you don&#39;t have, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right? So, hey, I need a senior strategist. I don&#39;t have any that I believe can do this. And so then you&#39;re going to make them the senior strategist, right? Or, hey, I need somebody who can do analytics work. We don&#39;t have anybody to do that. So you&#39;re going to make them the analytics people, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s one expertise you don&#39;t have. have. Two is a dispassionate outside view. They&#39;re not caught up in your bullshit. They don&#39;t just have the same assumptions that you have baked on from 20 years in the game, only seeing things myopically through your lens. And the third is to give you cover to do the thing you want to do anyways. Those are basically the three reasons people hire consultants, right? Capacity, outside view, cover. And I think in this case, it&#39;s not cover, right? I don&#39;t think they&#39;re just saying, saying, hey, once we hire somebody from the UK, that&#39;ll give us the excuse to do it. I think it&#39;s probably expertise they don&#39;t have. And so in that case, you would slot it in wherever you have the vacancies and expertise. You would slot them into your social media team. You would slot them into your analytics team. Now, again, it depends on whether it&#39;s more strategic or tactical what you&#39;re hiring them to do. That&#39;s where you&#39;d put them into the org chart.

So if you&#39;re going to be a hired gun, I&#39;m keeping you away from X, Y, and Z. I&#39;m not letting you do A, B, and C.

And honestly, like if you sort of game this thing out and you think okay well if justin and justin trudeau if jason kenny uh were to uh to replace the education minister right now that would be chaos uh in terms of the curriculum or whatnot like there would have to it would have to be like okay we surrender on the curriculum we&#39;re going to go back it</span>
