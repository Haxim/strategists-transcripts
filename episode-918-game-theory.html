          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s let&#39;s not wait then let&#39;s move it on to our first segment say the word guys i want to talk about the word that is occupying ottawa today that is the word genocide, because we are now in a very interesting political situation where members of parliament voted today, when we record on Monday, to label China&#39;s treatment of the Uyghur Muslims a genocide and to call on the federal government to formally adopt that position. All of this, of course, without the support of the Liberal cabinet. That&#39;s right, the Liberal cabinet entirely entirely abstaining from this conservative motion. There&#39;s many things to unpack here, but let&#39;s start with the actual motion and the mechanics and the political strategy today. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start with you. The Liberals, not abstaining overall, allowing a free vote. So the Liberals that were there voted, and all of them voted yes, but Cabinet abstained from voting, including the Prime Minister. Mark Garneau was there as, of course, foreign affairs minister and issued a kind of statement, so to speak, saying, I abstain on behalf of the government of Canada. What do you think of this strategy, Carter? Was this what the Trudeau government had to do? Do you feel like this strategy might have some negative repercussions? What do you make of this particular political play?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that this is an interesting opportunity to have a civics lesson. I&#39;m not sure that the target of this civics lesson should be be the government of China, because I don&#39;t think they will care. But you know, this is a non binding motion brought by the conservatives, the people who voted for it, were free to do so without impacting the government in any way. And it is important to note, and this is, again, maybe where the distinction becomes a little bit difficult for some, you know, the House of Commons is not the government, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? The government is the cabinet and the prime minister. Now, correct. Correct. That is one of those distinctions without difference, perhaps to to those impacted. And I think the foreign</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">foreign minister, Mark Garneau, is not going to be able to go to China and explain this way because don&#39;t worry, the government abstained.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But it&#39;s still going to be a problem. But it is something that Trudeau,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Trudeau, I don&#39;t think, had a tremendous choice in. I think that he would have lost this and they would have lost it badly being in a minority parliament anyways. So not offering the opportunity to his MPs to vote on it would have been a significant problem. But now he&#39;s got a different significant problem. And the different significant problem is his relationship with China and Canada&#39;s relationship with China, which is in real turmoil and certainly didn&#39;t get help today. Corey,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you know, you think that the Trudeau government&#39;s purpose of having the prime minister and cabinet abstain was to not wear this, was to kind of declare formally and through a comms perspective that we don&#39;t support what&#39;s about to happen here. Do you think they&#39;re successful in doing that today? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s pretty tough when every liberal that was present voted for it for the liberal government to then say, no, no, that&#39;s not our position. A little too cute by half. I can understand that diplomacy is a subtle language and that the government of Canada is trying to provide themselves some sort of frame through which they can continue to talk to China about this issue without getting just the wrath of a large</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to work um this is an interesting one abstaining on behalf of a government in a responsible government where the government is responsible to the parliamentary branch that has voted unanimously at least all of those who voted correct it&#39;s just a weird one and i just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">create the distance that um that they are attempting to create although i also don&#39;t know if them all voting for it was a better alternative.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so this is what I want to talk about is alternatives. Carter, what would you have suggested here today? Do you feel like this strategy, PM, cabinet, abstain, rest of your liberal caucus allowed to free vote, in this case, all voting yes? Was that the right move here? Or would you have recommended something else if your goal is to not upset China, which it seems quite nakedly obvious to us that is the Trudeau government&#39;s goal here in many ways?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think that if you&#39;re trying not to upset China, then you don&#39;t want this motion at all. If you had the power to say no and to stop it, then probably you would have. But I suspect there just wasn&#39;t enough votes within caucus. And so sometimes it is easier to lose this particular battle and fight a different war, you know, on a different front. And literally that&#39;s, well, not literally, it&#39;s not going to be a war, but there&#39;s going to be a significant price to be paid by Canada with the passage of this motion. I mean, right now, I think everybody recognizes this is a genocide. The United States, ironically, under Donald Trump, was</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">was probably the, I don&#39;t know if they were the first, but certainly the most significant power to declare it a genocide just before Trump left office. us. And Biden&#39;s administration is picking up where that left off. So the United States is at least on our side with this. But I think that it would be better for Canada if, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know, everybody came out together and did this together, because... And</span>

            <span class="text">The Western European states, I mean, the South American states, obviously, China has tremendous influence around the world. So you&#39;re not going to get a, you know, 200 nation unanimous vote or or anything along those lines, but our core allies and the NATO allies would be the ones that you&#39;d be looking for probably first. Condemning this together would certainly be a,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well, it would be stronger than standing on our own, which is where I feel like we are right now, because the United States doesn&#39;t seem to be standing with us yet.

You know, is O&#39;Toole going to pick up on every genocide, on every issue? I mean, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, there&#39;s a lot of international relationships that aren&#39;t good right now. The government of Hungary is imposing opposing kind of a totalitarian regime. Are we going to stand up? Is Aaron O&#39;Toole essentially saying that he wants Canada to become an activist nation?

You can also be a little more creative. Yes, income tax going up, that&#39;s an option. You could also choose to raise it specifically on higher incomes. You could bring in a wealth tax. You could create a luxury tax of some sorts where only very expensive goods, say automobiles that are 200% the average price or in jewelry that is in the same band or something like that, boats, RVs, maybe only these get hit with a sales tax. So there are policy choices out there that may make the tax more complicated, but may also make the tax more digestible.</span>

It gives discretion back to judges, and they can look at the particulars of the case, and they can say this is what is required. Ultimately, our entire justice system is based on the common law, and it&#39;s based on looking at the various matters at hand and trying to determine what you&#39;re supposed to do.

Heritage Minister Stephen Gilboa, who&#39;s in charge of crafting this legislation here in Canada, said Facebook is condemned, and Canada would not be deterred in passing similar legislation as Australia.

The reason is that Facebook&#39;s reaction to what Australia did to just pull, I mean, essentially the nuclear option and shut down their service to all news providers providers, that was an overreaction, but basically just dared the rest of Western governments to do the exact same thing to them. I mean, whoever&#39;s in charge of government relations at Facebook, they made some really bad choices over the last couple of weeks. And now it&#39;s going to result in this type of legislation popping up across the Western world, if you will. And I think it&#39;s going to be fabulous. Now, is this the right piece of legislation? Maybe not. I mean, I think that we could have a long conversation about the problems and pitfalls of of facebook um but i think that this sends a message to facebook that regulation&#39;s coming um and i do think that they need to be regulated the the the growth of fake news is 100 related to um the the growth of facebook uh so those things are tied together and they have been choking out uh real news by essentially forcing the bankruptcy of uh you</span>

Yes, the AABBA form of poetry. And we will be having Stephen and Corey develop one of their own in real time. Here&#39;s how it works. I&#39;ve got seven items on a list. They give me a number between one and seven. I give them their item. And on the fly, they develop their limerick, AABBA structure. Of course, Corey, I want you to go first. Give me your number between 1 and 7. I&#39;ll give you your topic. Carter, you can&#39;t choose the same number, but have yours in mind, and I&#39;ll give you your topic. And then I&#39;ll give you 30 seconds to construct your limerick. I will try to fill time somehow. We&#39;ll figure that out. But, Corey, give me your number between 1 and 7. Give me 2.</span>
