          <div class="said">that was much fun you missed all the texture they did they did miss all the texture absolutely okay let&#39;s get into our first segment there&#39;s a lot to talk about our first segment today the signal and the noise and the bell i want to go over what what was considered to be and we talked about this on stage in our in our last episode the live show uh the debate but i think there&#39;s more commentary that&#39;s come out there&#39;s more analysis that&#39;s come Corey, you at one point, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on this podcast or otherwise, said that this debate&#39;s going to really be about the analysis of the analysis. So I want to go dig into that a little bit more. So give me your take. We&#39;re a few days removed from the debate. What do you think right now? What are you feeling right now about this debate and the analysis that&#39;s come from it? Corey?</div>

          <div class="said">And this time around, depending on whose statistics you want to use, it had somewhere between 60,000 and 300,000 viewers. But there&#39;s just as many words being written about it. There&#39;s just as many pundits sounding off about it. Exhibit A right here, us talking about it. so amazingly this more than any debate that&#39;s come since including the mclean&#39;s debate which had higher viewership it was on television at least that&#39;s</div>

So before we kind of get into it, into those specifics, Carter, how about you give us like a 101 on what wedge issues are, how they kind of emerge, and when do you use them?

Corey, how about you help me answer, what does the applicability of a wedge look like? How do you know it&#39;s time to use it? Do you use it early and often? Is it something that we do in the tail end? The reason I&#39;m bringing this topic up is because we&#39;re going to see the term a lot more over the next 25, 26 days that we have left. We&#39;re hearing about it a lot more, and the wedge politics issues are going to become a lot more apparent. But when do you use it, and how do you use it? Well,</div>

I know that when we were constructing the platform provincially for the liberals in 2012, 12 it was a lot of polling because we&#39;ve talked about wedges as though there was only one issue in an election and of course we&#39;ve talked at other times about ballot box questions and you&#39;re trying to get it down to one issue for correct correct the fact of the matter is you&#39;re stacking wedge upon wedge upon wedge and you need to make sure that your wedges aren&#39;t splitting half of your people one way and the other way at any right so that you&#39;re</div>

This is a race between Justin Trudeau and Tom Mulcair. As it stands today, there are competing polls coming out that one is ahead of the other. And I want to talk very quickly in this segment about how you guys, if you&#39;re in the position, would start making the case that we are going to be the party of change. Because they need to start doing it now so that it ultimately ends up 26, 25 days from today that they&#39;re going to be the party of change. Okay, so how do you start making that case today?

And there&#39;s two big caveats I want to put on it. One, as we&#39;ve put on before, is that because the undecided seem to be wavering between the liberals and the New Democrats, the conservative number is actually probably a little lower than reported. The other really big caveat I want to put on, and you knew it was coming, is seats are not necessarily given out in the same proportion as percent of the vote. And I&#39;ve run a lot of seat projections in the past week. and the liberals have to win by like six points over either the new democrats or the conservatives to win uh a government right there&#39;s just so many their vote is not very efficient at all at this point and and maybe six is an exaggeration but it&#39;s probably four or five points we could very easily have a situation right now where the liberals end up with four points more than the next party and end up in third place it&#39;s possible yeah</div>
