            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and the spidey sense that at least you and many of the Twitterati had that this thing was being dragged out for a specific reason, That it was being delayed, that it was being pushed, that it was being, you know,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And that seemed to bear itself out, because this seemed like a jump ball decision, because the result may have been clear with 51%. But Corey, the decision isn&#39;t really clear for a leader, right? Like, we could have seen that speech go either way. And it went the other way. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we thought the speech was going to go the, I&#39;m staying around, I&#39;m not going anywhere, Wolf of Wall Street style, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But it didn&#39;t. He kind of surprised us all. But that was an early indication that something was amiss. I said this on CBC and I&#39;ll say it here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">When the results were supposed to become between four and six, that&#39;s pretty healthy buffer. And you give that kind of buffer because it allows you to deal with when things go wrong. so when you&#39;re outside of that things</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">things are really wrong right something has gone awry somewhere in some way shape or form now it can be mundane it could have been technical but now the suspicion has to be that result came in and everyone said shit what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what what do we do what does this mean how do we proceed from this point and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and uh you know i&#39;m sure there were conversations to be had with people who needed to know i&#39;m sure there were updates</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so here i</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">some of those conversations were like okay man like i know you said 50 plus one but fuck you that&#39;s not a real thing right or even him saying i know i said 50 plus one but fuck me that&#39;s not a real thing yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i think that&#39;s pretty much where he arrives like that&#39;s the summary of that speech being like listen i know what i said i said what i said i meant what i said but you know i can&#39;t stay and he was right like i think I think he was probably... Actually, you know what? That&#39;s a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a question, Corey. Was he right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think he was right. We were saying just before it, wow, it&#39;s going to be impossible to stay with this result. And then he didn&#39;t stay with this result. So I think that&#39;s kind of common analysis. 51% is not enough to hold a party together.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And especially when you consider all the advantages he was given in getting this leadership vote to the finish line. He</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">He got to choose the way the votes were counted. He moved it from in-person to a remote vote. vote. He obviously had a bit of foreknowledge that that was going to occur. So he could have sold memberships before the deadline to that effect.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And there are just so many other things you have in your control when you&#39;re the leader. You have things that are big, such as the rule changes we were talking about. You have things that are quasi big, such as having an army of staffers who you can say, it&#39;s time for you to go on vacation and put some hours in here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then you have things that are small, which is people will always want to talk to the leader, even if if they&#39;re pissed at them. So you always have an opportunity to make your case to the angry people of the party. And that means something. But given all of that, to get 51%, especially when you consider some of the allegations around bulk vote buying,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what do you do? Like just paint a scenario here, 51.4%. I wrote the numbers down. They&#39;re in my notes, but they were close, right? Like a thousand votes separated them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There is a suggestion, 4,000 votes were purchased on eight credit cards so if that conversation just continues if elections alberta comes out and says we are investigating that because we think it was an illegal contribution or something you</span>

And that to me speaks to people kind of processing something in the moment, something that they hadn&#39;t seriously considered before. And so this was shocking. This was definitely something that was not foreseen by a lot of people that were directly around Jason Kenney. I don&#39;t think it was an act, is what I&#39;m saying. The other thing I would say is, once the ballots are in,</span>

He was delusional the last week that he was running around. So I really do truly believe they were surprised.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, and I think we were too. What did you make of the construction of that Spearcombs, Carter? I&#39;m curious what you made of the construction of that speech, which was a bit of an emotional roller coaster. Hey, what up, Carter? We&#39;re going to start the official business in a second, but I&#39;m asking Corey about what he made of the construction of Kenny&#39;s speech.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that it was my theory. My theory is he had a speech. He had the I win speech and he didn&#39;t want to throw away all of it. Right. So like the first start was the I win speech, like the membership has spoken. I have gotten a majority. And then he said, okay, but let&#39;s change pages two through six into, but I&#39;m out of here. Right. Because it did seem to be, I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, here&#39;s the reality people need to realize when you&#39;re preparing for these situations. You sit down and you say, what speeches do I need? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I need the victory speech. I need the concession speech. And there may be those flavors in there of like, I need the close victory or I need the close loss speech. But maybe you don&#39;t get there. Maybe not. Maybe you do the thing that we all do in our jobs, which says, we just don&#39;t know. We know we&#39;re going to have to tailor it to the moment anyhow. So let&#39;s just start with these two core speeches and we&#39;ll modify from there. And then all of a sudden it&#39;s 415, let&#39;s say, and you&#39;re informed, excuse me, Premier Kenney, so the ballots are counted and you have 51.4% of the vote.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We thought it was going to be larger. What? But you have to process it. Maybe you make some protestations. Maybe you ask how this could be the case. Maybe you had some concern with some things that were validated later that now it matters and you didn&#39;t think it was mattering later. But now you also have the two speech problem and you&#39;ve got to turn out the real speech if these results are correct. And so what you do in that case is you take the speech that&#39;s closest to the speech you&#39;re going to give and you start making modifications. And if you won, you start with the victory speech, even if you&#39;re going to resign. I can see the logic of that and I can see how that speech went there. But yeah, it was like an M. Night Shyamalan movie there. There was just this twist partway through where you&#39;re like, oh, that&#39;s</span>

No, this is it&#39;s a pretty bad election election. But yeah, no, our elections are not nearly as exciting as yours, despite the fact you&#39;ve only had, I think, two parties governing the province for the last century or something like</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, we change parties very infrequently. We&#39;ve had a few. So the Liberals were in power until the early 20s. And then the Liberal leader hated the Liberals so much he campaigned against the Liberals. And then we had the United Farmers of Alberta, because an agricultural cooperative where you buy potato sacks is who you want to govern your province. And so we did that for about 20 years. To be fair, so did Ontario. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s a thing. Then we brought in social credit. We wanted to print our own money. The fucking Easterners wouldn&#39;t let us do that. But we stuck with the social credit party anyhow. And then the PCs. And of course, we know the last couple of years have been a little bit more topsy-turvy.

What do you think this kind of means from the perspective of conservatism in this country? We were talking about Kenny coming in as a harder right candidate in Alberta.

            <span class="text">Sure. And yeah, there was some logic to that relative to what the PCs had been in the past. He certainly was more conservative socially than the last couple of PC leaders, those being Prentice and Redford and Stelmack. And he was certainly a truer believer of conservative philosophy than all of them as well, taking a lot more of his cues from kind of academic conservatism, you know, the Heritage Foundation group.</span>
