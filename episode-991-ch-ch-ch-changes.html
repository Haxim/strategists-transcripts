And then he said, okay, but let&#39;s change pages two through six into, but I&#39;m out of here. Right. Because it did seem to be, I</div>

So let&#39;s just start with these two core speeches and we&#39;ll modify from there.

Maybe you had some concern with some things that were validated later that now it matters and you didn&#39;t think it was mattering later. But now you also have the two speech problem and you&#39;ve got to turn out the real speech if these results are correct. And so what you do in that case is you take the speech that&#39;s closest to the speech you&#39;re going to give and you start making modifications. And if you won, you start with the victory speech, even if you&#39;re going to resign. I can see the logic of that and I can see how that speech went there. But yeah, it was like an M.
