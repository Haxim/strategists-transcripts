And on the fourth day, when Donald Trump accepts the nomination for the Republican Party, and those words still send a chill down my spine, that by then is when we&#39;re going to be determining whether or not this has been a successful convention.

But I also believe that many of those people are Republicans in the first place because they have some passion that the ideas will carry the day, that their small government ideals or whatnot. Or even if you don&#39;t want to look at it so positively, this notion that Hillary Clinton is so terrible that the Republicans couldn&#39;t possibly imagine the American public putting her into office.</span>

No, I think it&#39;s when you put a convention together, it&#39;s a bit like writing an essay and you are going to have your strongest arguments in your bookends. People will tune in.

However unlikely that was, the fact of the matter was, on day one, there was still business to take care of. There is now no business to take care of. The vote is just perfunctory. It is pro forma. It is just going to end with Donald Trump being elected. There are very few opportunities for him to get additional black eyes on a process standpoint. So when you think about day one for Donald Trump, day one was, I&#39;m safe. I&#39;m Republican. And those messages certainly reflected that. Carter,</span>

I think it&#39;s 106 people are on that committee for some reason. That number is sticking in my head. It doesn&#39;t matter. The point is they</span>

And I think that that&#39;s one of the main reasons he was brought out for that security thing. The more cynical answer is, frankly, it was security night, and they had to go through the list, and serious people were saying no, and Rudy Giuliani hadn&#39;t said no. I think that&#39;s</span>

And they&#39;re going to do it on Friday. They&#39;re going to do it just unless, by the way, the only reason they might not do it is if it&#39;s such a flaming disaster of a speech that they&#39;re just like, well, let&#39;s just see how this lands over the weekend.
