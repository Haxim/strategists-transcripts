            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">patreon episode but there&#39;s been there&#39;s an update and i&#39;ve got questions and uh zane wasn&#39;t there so let&#39;s talk about it so saturday a couple days ago on her radio show premier daniel smith said one of the reasons for this pause is justin trudeau you know it&#39;s ottawa&#39;s fault she said the federal government is preventing development of backup generation for renewable energy and that backup plants powered by natural gas are needed for when the wind isn&#39;t blowing or the sun isn&#39;t shining. Experts have said that doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense because there&#39;s no requirement for 24-7 power from wind and solar. So I want to get your take here. Zane, let&#39;s start with you. What do you make of this reasoning? Is it a good strategy to blame the feds? Is it a consistent strategy? What do you make of the latest development?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I haven&#39;t heard what cory and stephen have had to say i suspect it was a load of that you can pay six dollars to hear um but don&#39;t worry we&#39;re gonna do a better job here i i think you know when analyzing the story to begin with it&#39;s a really confusing one is that fair to say i haven&#39;t listened to your episode but i assume it&#39;s you guys were probably losing your and it starts with what the right because it seems like on the on the baseline that to stop renewable energy projects some 90 projects in in their tracks, potentially, has so many downstream ramifications, all of which are negative, that it just doesn&#39;t compute for me from a political strategy perspective. And I&#39;ll get to answering your question in a second, Annalise. But to me, this seems like finding a rationalization</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">rationalization after a bit of blowback, and scrambling for a rationalization after a bit of blowback. And I think the federal blame argument is always available, frankly, to any Alberta premier, regardless of jersey color. But I think it has like a natural ceiling, it has a natural limit, there&#39;s diminishing returns. And Daniel Smith has to be really careful, because when you are choosing a file like this, based on perhaps a bit of mythology of your own, around</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">around what you feel like Alberta is versus what it actually is. And what I mean by that is, who&#39;s running a lot of these renewable energy projects? If you look at the heart of it, you know, many of them are these enterprising startups, significant amounts have funding and investment capital from outside of this province, let alone outside of this country. But there&#39;s also another major player in a lot of these renewable projects. There&#39;s municipalities, and of course, there&#39;s the energy companies, the oil companies themselves. And so Danielle Smith&#39;s entire fact base here might be tainted with a bit of mythology. And this is a sin previous premiers and leaders in this province have committed on what they think this province is versus what it actually is. And to me, when she has that rationalization on a radio show on Saturday, it&#39;s pretty poetic in two ways. Number one, it&#39;s poetic because it&#39;s the same thing she&#39;d always say. It&#39;d be Justin Trudeau&#39;s fault, his lack of doing something, her lack of depth and understanding about what argument she&#39;s making, an argument that&#39;s easily swatted away, being like, we don&#39;t need this shit for 24 hours a day. That&#39;s never how it was supposed to work. That&#39;s never how we expected it to work. That&#39;s never how it was right-sized by folks in market conditions. And poetic in a second way, that to me, this entire idea seems like an idea that would be thrown in a radio segment six minutes at a time, being like, you know what, should we maybe perhaps have a moratorium on renewable projects? More after the break, I&#39;ll take your calls and texts. And it sounds exactly like that type of Danielle Smith idea. And she&#39;s done this before. She&#39;s got a history of like throwing out and floating out things she kind of understands, barely understands, has like a top line attraction to, but does not have the depth or frankly, the level of knowledge required to kind of carry the conversation beyond a couple of minutes. And so I find it quite illuminating or quite interesting that it kind of ends up that way. Long story short, it&#39;s a rationalization, a scramble for rationalization. And why not go something to something that you&#39;ve used before, but there&#39;s a natural limit. And I want to maybe talk about that a bit more.</span>

            <span class="text">i i think i can understand why zane thinks this feels like feeling a way to an answer that works um obviously she has a bit of a history of doing that obviously this is something that it&#39;s on its surface is fairly challenging to understand but i i think the answer is a little simpler than that and i also think they&#39;ve</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they&#39;ve clearly been planning to do this for a little bit so you want you want a bit of a teaser one of the things we talked about on the patreon episode was Because she&#39;s kind of left breadcrumbs to this for a while. And with the benefit of hindsight, you can go back and say, oh, yeah, her complaining about all of that agricultural land having solar panels on it in southern Alberta, that musings in the spring. Well, that, you know, that seems like a bit of an indicator that perhaps action like this was going. And certainly she&#39;s talked about, you know, the intermittent nature of renewables. And this seems fairly consistent with that. In fact, I think her answer on Saturday was a lot closer to the truth than her comments on Thursday. You know, so Thursday when this comes out, there&#39;s like this real potpourri of reasons why she&#39;s doing this from, I can&#39;t see the mountains as one of them, literally one of the things that was put on there, to, you know, to, you know, concerns about how we&#39;re going to recycle and reclaim solar panels to the property rights. It&#39;s like, again, real effing grab bag of things, most of which can be batted down pretty quickly. And, you know, it&#39;s been observed by many people, for example, like, yeah, that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s true that solar doesn&#39;t work as well in the winter, but neither do crops, you know, if we&#39;re going to use that as the comp. True.</span>

            <span class="text">Let me tell you something. A lot of people, pretty supportive of what the Premier did. I think they&#39;re a small minority of the province, and we got to get back to that. But a lot of people online, pretty supportive of what the Premier did. None of them talking about sight lines. None of them really talking about recycling.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Most of them just talking about the fact that they think that solar and wind suck, right? Like, that&#39;s what it comes down to. And it&#39;s a hostility towards it relative to their preferred energy sources. resources, you know, thermal plants of gas and coal in particular, which are much more consistent in their output. And so I think on Saturday, while</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">easily see how you would get to feel into an answer that works, I think in reality, she did the classic mistake of saying what was actually kind of the truth. Like, she thinks these suck. And she wanted to, she wanted to put the screws to a federal government that&#39;s trying to force Alberta and all of Canada to use far more more renewable energy. And that&#39;s my view of it. So I, you know, I think that in many ways, we&#39;re just sort of peeling back the layers of the onion. I think that the Premier was a little bit more direct with Albertans in a funny way than Neufeld was when he was announcing these things on Thursday. And this is much closer to the truth. The simple truth of the matter is this is a province that&#39;s not particularly enthusiastic about wind and solar, you know, from a policy I think that&#39;s an absolute shame for a lot of reasons. I think that it&#39;s way offside of what Albertans want. But here we are. And I can also say this has been an issue that the Take Back Alberta group have been seized with quite some time, quite some time. So again, with the benefit of hindsight, this probably shouldn&#39;t have been as surprising as it felt on Thursday.</span>

            <span class="text">is interesting for her to spend so much political capital early on this, right? And the timeframe is also fascinating around when she does it in the summer. I actually have no insight around that other than to think, well, if you&#39;re going to make a major policy change like this or a moratorium like this, halt a lot of projects in their tracks. And if you&#39;re going to own it, if you&#39;re actually going to own it, would you not want to actually spend more time on it? Maybe do it with a little bit more fanfare? What I don&#39;t understand is, to Corey&#39;s point, I feel like the reasons he gave, the ones that the Premier gave on Thursday, The ones that were shot down immediately, and not to say her answer on Saturday was not shot down, as you mentioned, Annalise, leads me to the belief that she just like she&#39;s found a feeling and blaming the feds, especially for your base, is never a bad strategy for your base. And I think what we should be talking about is less so the base on each side, but the persuadable folks, the folks that are looking at this around a much more practical, pragmatic sense of what this place is versus what Danielle Smith wants it and wills it to be for a very small minority of people, specifically in rural Alberta.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, here&#39;s the thing. It&#39;s pretty clear to me that they knew this was going to be unpopular. They released it a Thursday before a long week. That was around the same time as we heard that the Prime Minister was getting divorced, just for some context here. You&#39;re like, this is when you, okay, dead of summer, long weekend. Of course. I mean, this is not when you do the things you think you&#39;re going to be proud of, frankly. And so, like, let&#39;s be really clear. They knew this was going to land with a thud with an awful lot of people. If they thought otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t have done it on that particular time. For me, the blaming of the feds was always going to make an appearance because this is Alberta. I don&#39;t actually believe there&#39;s diminishing returns there, Zane, because I haven&#39;t seen them yet. I&#39;ve been waiting over 40 years to see diminishing returns on blaming the feds.

Good fucking luck, right? Like, I&#39;ve got this policy. I&#39;m spending a bit of political capital. And if we agree, Corey, that it&#39;s going to be unpopular, right, regardless of who the blame game goes. goes to. It&#39;s about how active can you keep on this file, folks, right? Like, are you going to spend time, energy, and you&#39;re going to organize around it to keep this ball in the air? Are you going to let me have this one? Because I&#39;ll move on to the next story. And she&#39;s actually been quite masterful on moving on to the next story, as we&#39;ve seen over the course and leading up to that campaign. So the one thing I&#39;m looking forward to in the next little bit is to see what strategies are in play by third party groups, by advocacy organizations, and perhaps even by the opposition NDP to keep this ball in the air?

I don&#39;t believe Albertans at the end of the day are going to be particularly satisfied with any of the answers she&#39;s put forward there. I can tell you something, as the guy who ran polling for the government of Alberta for like four years, I&#39;ve never seen a poll that shows Albertans are opposed to renewable energy. Never seen anything like that. And there was quite a bit of polling that was done in the lead up to the launch of the carbon tax and during the creation of the climate plans in 2015. And obviously, you know, in an ongoing basis, those issues are checked in on here and i&#39;ll tell you something generally</span>

By the way, the phase-out of coal was very, very popular in polling for good chunks of it. Obviously, that was very variable depending on communities, much less popular in Hinton and coal mining country for obvious reasons. But people like renewable energy. People like the notion that in the future we will have a cleaner grid.</span>

Because a six month moratorium could literally not just be the shot in the foot or the shin, but could be the stab in the heart to the renewable sector for a long time. You can derail a lot of shit with a six month moratorium. And I think it starts with, and I&#39;m sure Corey&#39;s going to add to it, but it starts with the drying up some of the capital, right? You hear it all the time in the business world that like, you know, the capital will flow where there&#39;s opportunity and it moves quick. And I don&#39;t always buy into speaking of mythology.

And this is the part where I do believe a lot of the sort of business speak around it, more predictable about what is going to happen to our dollar. We may not even mind waiting a bit longer. But if we know this thing&#39;s going to happen, that we live in a stable democracy, not a knee jerk, sort of democracy or a knee jerk, six-minute segment at a time, call and text, see what you think about it, and then I may or may not reverse course style of democracy, then I think the first order effect, Annalise, in that six-month period might be the capital drying away. And then it&#39;s going to be all the other things almost kind of don&#39;t even matter. If these projects, let&#39;s say the 90-some-odd projects that have been kind of put on ice, if those stop, good luck starting another 90 or another 200 or another 300, even if we have all of the viability, the talent, the sunshine, as you mentioned in your intro segment, if the money dries up and the confidence erodes, I think that&#39;s going to take a long time to come back.</span>

            <span class="text">i actually do believe money moves very quickly i don&#39;t dispute that for a moment uh because at the end of the day if you have got an environment where there is well let me put a little nuance on that you&#39;ve got to ask yourself in the renewable space is there a shortage of capital or a shortage of opportunity and there is um you know there&#39;s some i&#39;d say early evidence that like in the in the european market for example when they put things out to tender they&#39;re actually having a lot more failed tenders now where there&#39;s not enough renewable companies investing or putting forward because these companies can&#39;t be everywhere at once. There&#39;s only so much expertise. There&#39;s only so much capacity in order to build these turbines and build these solar panels, get these things from the markets where they&#39;re constructed, and they have to choose where&#39;s the best return, right? And if we have all of a sudden moved down that list, there are other places they can go. They can pretty much go immediately. They can say, hey, China, let&#39;s not ship those things to Calgary, Alberta. Let&#39;s ship those things to Berlin. That&#39;s easy enough to do. We can reroute things there, especially in this very global market. And they&#39;re just going to move down the next few things on their spreadsheets. They&#39;re going to look at the next couple of opportunities. And here&#39;s a fundamental truth about business. It&#39;s the same reason why if you, for example, Zane, were asked, are you interested in this investment opportunity in Venezuela right now? I&#39;ve got a great opportunity for you. It&#39;s in i&#39;m in cory</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;ll just pick up on Corey&#39;s point. That&#39;s exactly where I wanted to go. The blast zone of this is not going to be limited to the sector that it happens in. And when you have large municipalities like Calgary and Edmonton fighting uphill for decades, right? Like that&#39;s not like fighting uphill for decades for a morsel of tech investment, bending over backwards to get any sort of secondary headquarters in our provinces, two major cities, right? The blast zone is going to be felt by them. It&#39;s going to be felt by young talent that&#39;s looking at, as we look at the current sort of Calgary and Edmonton housing market as being the top two most searched despite the interest rates. People are going to look at this and say, fuck, oh yeah, this is that place again. And if this happens here, what happens next? What happens to my job in tech? What happens anywhere? And then this is that sort of unpredictability, the vacuum that Daniel Smith has left, regardless of why we think she went with the federal justification. The vacuum that she has left is actually much larger. The fracture and the hole she&#39;s left is actually much larger because it&#39;s one about what does she do next on any of these files, economic or otherwise, healthcare or education. And I don&#39;t want to go back to some of the campaign narratives that we ran and, Corey, yes, we lost on. But it&#39;s elements of that, right? It&#39;s elements of unpredictability that has downstream effects and has a blast zone beyond renewables to other sectors, to the talent force, and frankly, to other even non-capitalist industries, so to speak, that could be affected by it. I think of just simply the charitable sector, right? If I&#39;m sitting there today as a non-profit in this province, I&#39;m looking at this and saying, interesting, doesn&#39;t affect me, dot, dot, dot, yet, right? And I think that&#39;s the main takeaway for a lot of people inside and out of this province. Interesting, doesn&#39;t affect me, yet. And I think that massive unpredictability, and I know Corey said there was morsels, but man, those morsels were vague, and they were not spelt out, and I still would question question that there was enough morsels that that kind of led most people saying this is going to happen in the first three months of her government like i was</span>

And let&#39;s just put it this way. I&#39;ll always say this. It always comes to story. What&#39;s the story you&#39;re trying to tell? How do you make sure you&#39;re doing this in a way that leads to the ballot box in a way that you want to get there? And yeah, it&#39;s many years. So there&#39;s a lot of opportunity to just try things. And this is not going to be the ballot box issue in 2024. Well, 2024, what am I talking about? 2027? I doubt.

Let&#39;s just throw a couple of obvious ones on the table. They could say, this is insane. We&#39;ve got a planet that&#39;s on fucking fire, and we need to be moving towards renewable sources of electricity. I will say one of the very interesting things about the conversation I had online with a bunch of people who informed me that the sun doesn&#39;t shine all the time and Germany electricity prices are up. Maybe there&#39;s some other things going on in Europe, maybe, but we can unpack that a different time. not too</span>

            <span class="text">you could make the business investment argument which i think is where they&#39;re going to end up uh for a bunch of different reasons not least of which is i think it&#39;s one that everybody can kind of just innately say like if you were going to focus group that with a lot of people Yeah, that actually seems pretty unfair. They didn&#39;t consult with the industry before they did it. They shut down projects that were going to be billions of dollars of investment. But you can take that business</span>

            <span class="text">business angle to it. You can just talk about the erraticness of Danielle Smith. You can do combinations of these. You can do something I haven&#39;t even talked about here. But my point is, you do sort of have to pick a message track and run with it. You don&#39;t actually want to do the thing we&#39;ve accused Daniel Smith of, which is just throwing spaghetti at the wall, doing a hundred different things. And, you know, if Daniel Smith manages to succeed in making this about, well, do you support Trudeau&#39;s energy targets, electricity targets? Holy cow, what a failure that will be for the NDP. so I guess the other thing you need to do as you&#39;re building out your message track is just make sure you&#39;re aware of what the counter message track is going to be and what might lead you down some dark alleys and cause you some trouble but uh it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you know, worthy of talking about. I think in this case, they have to think about what&#39;s short term and what&#39;s medium to long term. And I really only have two pieces of advice, right? Pick a lane short term, I would agree with Corey 100%. And think about how you want to link this long term with who you want to be. So we&#39;ll take the Corey&#39;s advice there. There is a question of who you want to be. Are you going to spend the next two years as the opposition party? And when does your plan ultimately then put you back into government and waiting? Are you going to be government and waiting from the get go? Those two things sound like semantics. They&#39;re not. They change what you do tactically. They change what what you do tonally. They change even who you get to present. More than likely, we&#39;re hearing that there&#39;ll be a leadership race of some sort. So take that into account. But the main piece of advice that I&#39;d have is, number one, think about how you want this to link long-term, right? Because this is a story about an unpredictable premier doing something from the hip, right? How do you want to frame that? And number two, how do you root any rationale, short-term or long-term, to Alberta. One thing that the NDP can&#39;t afford to do is to go back to the social democrat NDP roots. Now that the election is over, this has to be rooted back in that same of Alberta mentality, right? And I like what I&#39;m seeing thus far, the focus on jobs, economy, investment, that makes a lot of sense. To Corey&#39;s point, it&#39;s the most palatable, it&#39;s the easiest. But just because the election is three and a half years, four years away at this point, does not give you the opportunity and does not give you the mandate, I would say, to be like, let&#39;s just do the classic NDB thing, put all of our eggs in the climate basket. Hey, as much as I agree with you, that&#39;s not the of Alberta strategy. So that&#39;s the one sort of kind of, those are the two pieces that I kind of put on the table.</span>

And the challenge with right after an election, at a moment like this, is the base is going to want to talk about those things. It&#39;s really interesting to me. Well, look, I was at a Stampede. I was doing the circuit. I was going to all the different Stampede breakfasts. And one of the ones I went to was the NDP caucus breakfast there. I saw Rick Bell going around taking his notes. And, you know, I saw a lot of MLAs going and chatting and saying hello to people after the election. And there</span>

            <span class="text">locked in? Is the Rachel legacy locked it in yet that she has provided the blueprint for success? And the question is, how locked in is that? And I think that becomes a driver of your strategy, your messaging, and frankly, how much red meat you can throw back to the base versus how much you need to keep going in that sort of particular election lane. And the one thing I&#39;ll add, the one thing I&#39;ll add, Corey, is anytime, and you might disagree with this, but I&#39;d say anytime you run a campaign where the concept of lend us your vote becomes an explicit thing you hear from the leader&#39;s mouth, you&#39;ve got a retention, not problem, but you&#39;ve got retention work to do. That as soon as that election is over, there was a lot of people that voted for you for the first time, and the sun still came up, despite what Danielle Smith might think, right? The sun still came up the next day. And you still have work to do with those folks to lock them in. So there&#39;s really interesting work the NDP has to do, even beyond this file, and I&#39;m talking about now around directionally locking in what the party is, and ensuring that those voters that came out in record numbers and writings like Acadia and Glenmore, also see this issue as saying, here&#39;s another proof point and something that makes me comfortable about why I voted for the NDP, right? Like, lock it in. There&#39;s a lot of retention work that can be done now so that base is larger. And the leadership race, should there be one, might actually help with that. But there&#39;s work that this file offers as an opportunity for many of those folks in Calgary, as Corey, you&#39;ve alluded to, might be the battleground again today. And I say today, yes, in the next couple of weeks after these dog days of summer.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, look, so I think the retention issue is a bigger problem when you become government, because then you actually start to make promises like the one of the nice things about the lend us your vote if you&#39;re in opposition is those people can for the next four years every time danielle smith and the ucp fucks up any file be like well i didn&#39;t vote for him i lent my vote to the ndp you know and</span>

            <span class="text">that and that&#39;s actually that&#39;s a pretty great thing and that you know naturally a lot of those votes will solidify um a pretty great thing if you&#39;re the ndp i mean uh because Because like, people will be thinking like, well, you know what, I voted for them. And so I&#39;m not on the hook for any of the bad decisions a government makes, and governments do tend to get less popular. The other thing I want to say, and this is the interesting thing going into a race, like if you&#39;re a leadership candidate, and you&#39;re thinking about that base, that maybe, especially like I was talking about their base in Calgary, let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, for two reasons, I think, yes. First of all, when you&#39;re in opposition, you don&#39;t have a government, right? You don&#39;t get to call up the department and say, what&#39;s the fact base here? Tell me about it. Give me the pros and cons. I want, you know, a rundown on what people would say who think it&#39;s a good idea and what people would say who think it&#39;s a bad idea. That&#39;s a really great thing about government. Just a lot of policy experts doing that kind of stuff. You don&#39;t have that in opposition. And so when you have an expert like Najwan, then you&#39;re kind of a leg up. It&#39;s going to keep you from saying</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">on the face stupid things, which happens all the time in politics, right? Because you have to make, you&#39;re dealing with live ammo, you&#39;re shooting from the hip, you say things, turns out that somebody who has even a degree of expertise would be like, that&#39;s a bad idea. And you&#39;ve said something that&#39;s stupid. Happens all the time in opposition politics. You&#39;re not going to do that when you&#39;ve got someone like Najwan there. So that&#39;s great. And I think that&#39;s the primary value. I mean, that&#39;s the primary value. You&#39;re going to make sure that when the leader is up there, when any of the other critics</span>

            <span class="text">making sure that they are always dealing with a very durable, very thought out case. And that matters, right? The second one is obviously herself as a critic and herself as the person who can go out there and speak and and passionately deliver the issue and communicate it well. Well, she&#39;s got policy expertise, and she&#39;s got communications expertise as a politician. I think having a certain humility on both fronts and making sure you&#39;re still using those caucus resources is important.</span>

            <span class="text">When you&#39;ve got domain expertise, that&#39;s the entire point. Lean in, let the comms people scaffold it, and then find the larger story where you&#39;re going to add to this, where you&#39;re going to make the linkages, right? That really matters. I think the way you don&#39;t get into the sort of situation or sort of the cycle of having 95 different issues constantly is you think about the linkages. What are the one or two things that feed into this constantly so we can make this a case? And you might think it&#39;s early right now. It&#39;s not, because you&#39;re going to have these discrete chunks of time with potentially a leadership race the next fall, the session coming up in October as we hear. It&#39;s not going to be a lot of time before you&#39;re back to election month. Frankly, one would argue you need to be back there relatively quickly next six months. That story in three acts with the scenes all mapped out, regardless and agnostic, I would say, of leader is so helpful when you&#39;re now having to then, you know, insert different sort of chunks as they appear over time as part of that story. I would get started on that early. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, look, I&#39;d say that communications obviously matters more when people are paying attention, but it&#39;s easier to win an election in four years than in four months. And so use this time well, don&#39;t just sort of sit on your hands and think this is coming.</span>

            <span class="text">quick. And so that&#39;s the one thing that you&#39;ve got to sort of check yourself on whether you&#39;re Najwan or anybody who&#39;s got this expertise and when people are saying that&#39;s kind of missing the point especially your comms people make sure you&#39;re listening to them and just be mindful that that that is just a that is a risk of domain expertise we all have it by the way no it&#39;s truly want to get me on a like a random tangent on I mean I don&#39;t know like color theory or something I&#39;ll do it like I&#39;ll fucking go down that rabbit hole but it often misses the point.

            <span class="text">This is why I think good comms people listen as much as they speak and absorb and ask good questions. As we&#39;ve seen, especially working with what you call elected officials, it&#39;s really about this concept of sitting down, understanding what you know, and then making it palatable to the public and saying, well, that&#39;s actually not</span>

I know we&#39;ve now changed topics a little bit here, but I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve been sitting in a meeting and my value has been like realizing, oh, there&#39;s a tension attention on that particular point. Or, oh, they&#39;re a little hung up. Or, oh, they just spent 30 minutes talking about this topic. And while I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be the public topic, we&#39;re going to need to make sure there&#39;s questions for it.

By the way, when you only do one big cabinet shuffle in eight years, that actually makes it an even bigger deal than if you&#39;re just doing a big cabinet shuffle every two years. So, I mean, this just goes back to the point. I just want to underline that we said, okay, this is a strategy that you can use. It is going to up the internal pressure. We said this, right? And this is a good example of that. This is what happens because now there are people who just feel way on the outs and they&#39;re they&#39;re now talking to the hill times using pretty colorful language by the way it&#39;s an interesting read i recommend anyone kind of go and look at it and um yeah i mean it it&#39;s not showing a bunch of happy campers and maybe it&#39;s only six unhappy people six</span>

This is not some sort of like, you reach this bar and we give this to you. Circumstances change. We have many factors. I&#39;d say one we haven&#39;t talked about enough is fucking loyalty and gratitude. I think a lot of the folks that he gave these roles to will probably be grateful and by extension loyal or already loyal and ergo grateful, whatever ordering sequence you want to put there. But loyalty is a big fucking one. But to Corey&#39;s point, when</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and while producing a massive fucking show, like, what are you doing? Right? And I think he&#39;s caught in this position where he does not want to admit that something needed to change, and then makes this big change, and then goes on to say, nothing needed to change, but I made this big change. And when you don&#39;t have an external rationalization that becomes an internal sort of rallying cry that people are like, you know what, PM, I&#39;m fucking bought into that. We&#39;re down 10 points in the polls, but I get every single move. And, you know, there are pieces that we are now discerning or we&#39;re adding narrative to because he hasn&#39;t given us one that we&#39;re adding narrative to that if I was in that liberal caucus, regardless of the names and the folks that got promoted, could kind of jazz me up, right? Right. Like, you know, we&#39;re building a firewall around the GTA. Everyone I&#39;ve selected is going to be someone who won their seat by 10 points or less. Oh, and guess what? We know that Pierre Polyev is going to try to make a play for multicultural communities. So what we&#39;re going to do, we&#39;re going to find the most fucking talented person from some of these key communities. We&#39;re going to make sure that they&#39;re not just going to win their riding. They&#39;re going to be an ambassador and an ally in your riding. So if you feel like you&#39;re on the edge, don&#39;t worry. Arf Ron is here because he&#39;s got a lot more sway than being justice minister. He can actually make these gains. We&#39;ve got our first minister from this community. We&#39;ve got our first minister from that community. You put that story together. It&#39;s not there yet, from what I&#39;m saying, right? But you put the story together, and</span>

And when you don&#39;t even have a rationalization externally, good luck trying to make that an internal rallying cry for people to get around, because we&#39;re trying to fill in the gaps. And the biggest thing I&#39;ve learned from in the story, is so are a bunch of people inside the Liverpool dockets.</span>

I was going to go exactly where Corey is. There&#39;s a tendency, and it goes back to the Daniel Smith thing in some way, where you can do away with the fact base, you can do away with the reality. I&#39;m a master at fucking explaining things away. Rhetoric trumps all. And there&#39;s folks that just feel like they have that superpower. And mainly because they&#39;ve gotten away with it before, right? They&#39;ve gotten away with it so much. They&#39;re like, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be behind the podium. I&#39;ll give them a story. I&#39;m fucking, I&#39;ve done this, right? And they may not speak so arrogantly, to be totally clear, but they&#39;d be like, don&#39;t worry about it. Or someone or more senior might be like, PM is coached. Premier is coached. Don&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;ve got this. They&#39;re briefed. They&#39;ve got it. Often, as junior staffers or even middle staffers, Corey, that&#39;s all you really get when you&#39;re pitching these ideas and throwing things like, oh, big time. They&#39;re briefed. They&#39;re done. You&#39;re good. We&#39;re good. We&#39;ve got it on lock. We did the session. Probably didn&#39;t do the session, but we&#39;ve done. They&#39;re good and the more years they have under your belt at least you answer the question right the the more often you kind of see things like this where you&#39;re like it sounded great it had the trudeau cadence the shot had the same arc but like nothing but you know rim right like really because at the end of the day um they they may may actually lose a step rather than gain a step by playing so many many years to to to kind of mix metaphors a bit yeah</span>

            <span class="text">right and and i wonder like if they had the um perhaps the discipline and maybe even they had their own strategy straight in the pmo around what they wanted to do they could have made some of those calls in advance around folks getting them in line understanding who was not going to get a gig you know talk to them about future opportunities like parliamentary secretary which if i&#39;m not mistaken at least has not been announced yet right other opportunities to get involved other other opportunities to take down the evil that is pure polyev and the current incarnation of the conservative party they would have had an opportunity but it seemed like they were also in a bit of what the fuck are we doing because you would expect as they have done like i&#39;ve said i think they&#39;re they&#39;re sort of lead up and symbolic comms have been pretty solid over the years you&#39;d expect a bit more around what we&#39;re going to see prior to seeing it and i wonder for a second if they were actually themselves not entirely sure of that yeah</span>

But, you know, actually the comms, maybe I&#39;ll argue the other side, the comms makes me think almost the opposite. Like maybe they thought it was going to be bigger, right? Maybe there were going to be changes to the economic portfolios. And then that&#39;s the story the same yeah that&#39;s my point you know like i just don&#39;t know and none of us will know well</span>

But Corey&#39;s right. Like you probably would have seen these voices regardless. I don&#39;t know about you, Corey, but I had a few folks outside of Alberta, to be absolutely clear. Members of Parliament, the liberal side texted me being like, what are you hearing? I&#39;m like, what the fuck do you mean? What am I hearing? I stay here in Calgary, not like a liberal sort of like hotspot for gossip, right? Like you&#39;re the one in Ottawa circles. I&#39;m not hearing jack shit.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right for my benefit right and i know it&#39;s an act of you. And maybe along the way, it will help you clarify your thinking, it will crystallize a few things, it will round out some of the edges that you actually haven&#39;t even gotten to internally in your mind, and you&#39;re going to work out on stage, or you&#39;re going to work out behind the podium or in this written statement or whatever. But help me get it, I think is one of the best ways to do it. Because as much as it may present like an act of selfishness, if you&#39;re actually in a conversation, rather than help me get it and taking notes the whole time being like, oh, thank thank you. Let them go in a monologue. Be like, how about this part? Would you actually phrase it that way in the speech? Or would you be like, oh, that&#39;s an interesting part. You engage it with it as a conversation. I&#39;ve found that to be one of the best ways that I personally, I&#39;ll just give you personal advice, have been able to learn from folks and frankly, steal their ideas and repeat them on CBC for a paycheck.

            <span class="text">oh totally agree like yeah that that is adding absolutely no value you&#39;re just a stenographer at that point. Like you&#39;ve got to be able to challenge them on fundamental things. But if you&#39;re going to challenge, you need to be super clear with yourself where you think the problems are. I think one of the best skills you can develop as a communicator is understanding why you don&#39;t like something. Because nothing is less helpful than saying like, I don&#39;t know about that. Like that just doesn&#39;t feel right to me. Like you&#39;ve got to be able to articulate the thing fundamentally that puts it at odds with the strategy as it&#39;s been built out there so you know really really get clear with yourself why you don&#39;t like something and this goes by the way for like writing like a phrase like why you don&#39;t like it to like a bigger thrust like a tactic that you&#39;re trying to pull through a strategy understand why then you can have an actual conversation with somebody but if your conversation is like i don&#39;t know that just doesn&#39;t feel right and they&#39;re gonna be like well</span>
