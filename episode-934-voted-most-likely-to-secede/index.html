        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk Trudeau's childcare plan, bad press for the O'Toole Conservatives and the Green Party's ongoing implosion.

And what does Chatelaine know about bread anyways? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.

And like they had a million people sign up for vaccines within 24 hours. It was – it just – you know, the line was it destroyed vaccine hesitancy with one action. It got me thinking, well, maybe we&#39;ve got to play with disincentives instead of incentives. So maybe we put everybody who&#39;s not vaccinated and eligible into a lottery and one person gets chosen and has to pay $1 million. Maybe that would resolve all of our problems right now.

And it&#39;s obviously a reasonable hypothesis that it&#39;s vaccine hesitancy. But also, there&#39;s less COVID in a lot of these areas. It probably seems less urgent.

          <div class="said">So I read that article. And there&#39;s two interesting, there&#39;s a lot of interesting things in that article, actually. One of them is that so many people within it just take it as a given that he&#39;s going to run, but he&#39;s not going to announce until the writ is dropped because as soon as he announces, he has to leave his job. And there was a suggestion that if for whatever reason the writ drop is pushed off, well, that would be kind of a drag for him. And, you know, there&#39;s things you can say about that, like if it seems like it would be proper for him to step down when the writ gets dropped, if everything&#39;s just sort of a given, wouldn&#39;t it be proper for him to step down right now? Now, the other is that it mentioned a couple of alternative ridings that were open to him, potentially. The Ottawa South was in there as well as Ottawa Centre. Kanata Carlton we&#39;re already talking about. Obviously, everyone&#39;s talking about Edmonton Centre as a possible rumour.</div>

And letting them do the coastal sort of, yeah, yeah. Exactly. So it suggested a bunch of different regions and said like, hey, would you be interested in seceding into this region? And you found that Democrats wanted to secede if they were in Democratic regions and Republicans wanted to secede if they were in Republican regions. Now, nowhere was as extreme as the South.

That&#39;s okay. It worked itself out. In the United States, it&#39;s now based on religiosity, kind of what I would characterize as Christian extremism, and it&#39;s also being injected into the youth through the education system. so there&#39;s an indoctrination element uh that is very concerning um and</div>

The group people who are part of the Reform Party were unable to work within the Progressive Conservative Party and had to form their own group so that they could have things happen. The Green Party believed so strongly in their ideals that they formed their own party to carry those ideals. Now, it wasn&#39;t a unique idea. It didn&#39;t just start in Canada. It was an idea stolen from other regions and perhaps implemented the worst here. It&#39;s always been a backwards party. It&#39;s always been a party that didn&#39;t understand politics. It professed, really, not to care about politics. It didn&#39;t want to be a political party. It wanted to be above that. It wanted to express its ideals it wanted to get the ideas of of environmentalism to the forefront um in a you know in a fiscally conservative way because it always tried to balance off that fiscally conservative element and</div>

She should be standing up right now for Anna Mae Paul and standing up against the executive. And the fact that she hasn&#39;t and she&#39;s willing to let this party destroy itself immediately after she&#39;s left just says to me that she doesn&#39;t care about the actual party itself at all.

Is there anything you can do, maybe even taking the election out of mind for a second, from a pure strategy perspective, to use the FOMO of BC and try to port it to Alberta? What would you try to do to try to push the hand or box Kenny in? Is there any strategies that you&#39;d have with perhaps the most conservative and least likely to play ball premier in Alberta if you&#39;re Team Trudeau on this fall? And then I want to talk to you about, just so I can preview it with you guys, what the Trudeau endgame looks like on child care before the election, because he&#39;s not going to sign up every province. So I want to talk about both of those things in succession. But talk to me about Alberta first, Corey. I see you making facial expressions that I cannot decode.

What do you kind of make of perhaps, like, let&#39;s zoom out for a second. What I&#39;ve called this week of, like, you know, problem definition for O&#39;Toole.

You know, Carter, let&#39;s talk about this a bit, because you know, I want to give credit to these columns and these pieces of analysis, but I don&#39;t think any of them are saying anything that hasn&#39;t been said before, right? Party historically has a low low ceiling. They come across as a little bit downtrodden in their temperaments, maybe not like the most enthusiastic and isn&#39;t meeting the moment. You know, they&#39;ve built a supporter base based on small dollar donors, which is just, you know, fueled by anger and rage. And therefore, that kind of sets the impression of the party. And so I&#39;m paraphrasing and simplifying and perhaps even editorializing, adding my own to the mix. But maybe I&#39;ll kind of ask you, what do you kind kind of think of the sweet or the cocktail of analysis that&#39;s being offered on problem definition for O&#39;Toole right now, before I ask you guys to put on strategy hats for Team O&#39;Toole and let&#39;s dig out of this sort of this ditch that we&#39;re in, so to speak.

          <div class="said">most of the analysis starts in the idea that Aaron O&#39;Toole is doing something wrong, or Andrew Scheer did something wrong, or Joe Clark did something wrong, or Brian Mulroney did something wrong. The truth is that you kind of have to look at the history of the Conservative Party over a long period of time. And the fact is, it&#39;s not a single party. It is a party that comes together from time to time and for a long enough period to govern for a while. But then it breaks apart because ultimately, it doesn&#39;t share. It has too many values to try and share. Right. It has too many things that it cares about and not enough things that it&#39;s willing to compromise on. And so sometimes they&#39;re prepared to compromise or they&#39;re prepared to stick together under a leader. We see that in Jason Kenney when he brings together the two halves of the Wild Rose and the Progressive Conservative Party in Alberta. We see that in Stephen Harper when he brings together, at that moment, the crap party and the old PC party. And</div>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same as when Michael Ignatieff hands off to Stéphane Dion and it&#39;s weak leadership or it&#39;s just not a moment or it happens to correlate to a period when the Conservatives are strong. I think that the Conservatives were strong in those moments and therefore the Liberals were weak.

We&#39;re having one this weekend. The three of us are putting the agenda together. Carter, what&#39;s a couple of things, high-level items that you&#39;re adding to that agenda? And Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you to do the same and then let&#39;s try to mold this thing into what that weekend looks like to perhaps reshape the campaign, the party, the leader, the message, the story, whatever it needs to be, perhaps all of it. But Carter, let&#39;s start with you. Give me a few items that you&#39;re adding to the agenda with all the senior campaign folks, including the leader. We&#39;re meeting in some, you know, it&#39;s going to be in Alberta, right on the heels of the Stampede. We&#39;re meeting in Canmore. We&#39;ve rented a house.

It&#39;s fine that the conservative accessible vote is lower if it&#39;s kind of a mutually exclusive pool and they&#39;re the only option, if that makes any sense. Like the thing is, the NDP and the liberal vote we know is more fluid. People are more likely to go between them. The same with the Green Party and those two parties. And so their accessible vote always appears a fair bit higher. It&#39;s a bit of a mirage in Canadian politics. But what you find with conservative voters is they will often say, I have no second choice. So the</div>

I certainly have been involved in one of these or a couple of these in the past where we&#39;ve had to, you know, do a little bit of a pivot or a reset or just a recalibration on certain things and just get everyone on the same page.

          <div class="said">um i think it&#39;s probably underrated because i think the rest of the world&#39;s going to be asking for something vaguely resembling a vaccine passport um it depends entirely what we&#39;re talking about when we&#39;re talking about vaccination passports if we&#39;re going to be traveling to the united states we&#39;re probably not going to need one uh but for those of us that the view the world is actually you know round and has more than just land borders um going to europe or going to other countries um on other continents even uh it may require us to have a vaccine passport. So I&#39;m a little disappointed that Trudeau is not stepping up, but I think he had no choice than to hand it back to the provinces. And ultimately, the provinces are going to be doing a vaccine passport. They&#39;re just not going to call it such.</div>
