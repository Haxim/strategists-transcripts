            <div class="said">I think that Pierre has really good membership sales, but he doesn&#39;t have great membership sales across the country. These sales are, are, you know, they differ by region. Alberta&#39;s got 71,000 or something along those lines. That&#39;s 2,000 people per riding. Ontario has approximately 1,000 people or less than 1,000 people per riding. Quebec has about 25,000 people, so about 350 people per riding. So each one of those things, you know, if this is true, and again, I&#39;m not necessarily saying that these are all true. But the first step is that because it&#39;s a point system, you&#39;ve got differences in each riding. So that could matter. You could be seeing significant numbers in one Quebec riding or 10 Quebec ridings to generate 25,000 memberships. The same could be holding true if you&#39;re looking at British Columbia, where you have 50,000 memberships, but you could be literally looking at 25 000 of those memberships coming out of surrey alone right like there&#39;s significant questions of where are all of these things spread and i think that the fact that this campaign showed us the detail of this is what we&#39;re seeing per per province is actually something we should look at and say what</div>

You don&#39;t win on memberships. You win on points. And when you&#39;re playing those types of games, you have to focus on that.

I mean, we&#39;re looking at eight or nine different candidates that are going to be coming out of this. So the idea that you&#39;re going to get 50% and seven other candidates are going to get are going to share the less than other, you know, less than 50% there.

This party was supposed to be about our members. And I think that you could win if you came from a from a this party was supposed to be about serving our members. This party is about supposed to be serving Albertans and going back to what Albertans actually want. Finding a government that they want, not one that they pretend to want when they&#39;re asked, you know, are you a conservative? Are you a liberal? And they say and everybody knows in Alberta, you don&#39;t say you&#39;re a liberal. So they pretend to be conservatives, but our values are all aligned with liberalism. And there is a path to be won by going up a different conservative party. And that path would be really interesting. I see Sonny starting to look at that. I think that an outsider could come in and look at that path. I think that Rebecca Schultz could look at that path. There are a number of different candidates that could look at them. And more important, when this thing starts to roll up, Brian Jean and Danielle Smith votes, they&#39;re going to get two marks in their ballot. They&#39;re going to get Brian Jean.

You have to get above 43, 44, 45% on the first ballot in order to pick up anybody else&#39;s ballots because there&#39;s a reason they didn&#39;t choose you the first time. There&#39;s a reason that 57, 58, 58, 59% of the population said, nah, I don&#39;t like them. And they never ever get past that first reason that the psychology of it is really hard. It&#39;s like going and saying, well, you know, I don&#39;t like tide, but I&#39;ll pick tide the next time. It doesn&#39;t happen.

Instead, they want to upend our entire system and go to a proportional representation, which they use the wrong data to support. They use the provincial data. They use the federal data when really what they should be doing is looking at the local levels and saying, How much would we actually change? And the answer is not nearly as much as you think. And these two parties aren&#39;t the same. They just happen to be led in the same fashion. The Liberals and the NDP had the worst campaigns.
