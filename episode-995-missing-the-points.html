            <span class="text">I think that Pierre has really good membership sales, but he doesn&#39;t have great membership sales across the country. These sales are, are, you know, they differ by region. Alberta&#39;s got 71,000 or something along those lines. That&#39;s 2,000 people per riding. Ontario has approximately 1,000 people or less than 1,000 people per riding. Quebec has about 25,000 people, so about 350 people per riding. So each one of those things, you know, if this is true, and again, I&#39;m not necessarily saying that these are all true. But the first step is that because it&#39;s a point system, you&#39;ve got differences in each riding. So that could matter. You could be seeing significant numbers in one Quebec riding or 10 Quebec ridings to generate 25,000 memberships. The same could be holding true if you&#39;re looking at British Columbia, where you have 50,000 memberships, but you could be literally looking at 25 000 of those memberships coming out of surrey alone right like there&#39;s significant questions of where are all of these things spread and i think that the fact that this campaign showed us the detail of this is what we&#39;re seeing per per province is actually something we should look at and say what</span>

The people who signed up on day one, we went through this with Kenny, the people who had one bought for them by their boss, less hyper-engaged.

Um, there&#39;d be an event. So I would do a direct mail campaign structure. I do an event campaign structure and I&#39;d have a media relations campaign structure. And all three of those things can in fact be linked. You know, you have a big event, your, your charade. If you&#39;ve outperformed in Calgary, then we expect to see you at the Calgary stampede.

And the way to do that would probably be to talk a lot about the dominance, right? I think that Pierre has to go for the dominant strategy. You know, frankly, anything, it really depends on where Lewis is. We didn&#39;t hear very much about where Leslyn Lewis is, but assuming that she&#39;s in fourth place.

Andrew Wilkinson&#39;s campaign, which Katie Merrifield ran, Katie&#39;s involved with Pierre, it was very focused on points because points matter. You don&#39;t win on votes. You don&#39;t win on memberships. You win on points. And when you&#39;re playing those types of games, you have to focus on that. And I think that Pierre&#39;s campaign can&#39;t get lost in 312,000 members.

Let&#39;s assume that it takes a very similar format to the CPC race with the notable exception that it&#39;s probably not going to be a points race. it will most likely be a one-member, one-vote race.</span>

            <span class="text">Because if you&#39;re going to be in first place, you have to win on the first ballot. Winning on this, you know, it is very hard. Kevin Falcon was able to do it in British Columbia. But winning from the first ballot is super hard. And I just don&#39;t see Taves, given the number of rumored candidates. I mean, we&#39;re looking at eight or nine different candidates that are going to be coming out of this. So the idea that you&#39;re going to get 50% and seven other candidates are going to get are going to share the less than other, you know, less than 50% there. That seems to me to be a really far stretch. And why would you want to pick up all the baggage? Like you&#39;ve got a caucus that is broken. I wouldn&#39;t be worried about endorsements at all.

It doesn&#39;t matter if you have all of the endorsements. What matters is that you&#39;re able to sell the memberships, especially in a one-member, one-vote. And Travis Taves is going to be really challenged by that because it turns out all these caucus endorsements, every caucus endorsement in general tends to have fewer membership sales. You do not get the performance out of your caucus mates, especially if they&#39;re in cabinet.</span>

This party was supposed to be about our members. And I think that you could win if you came from a from a this party was supposed to be about serving our members. This party is about supposed to be serving Albertans and going back to what Albertans actually want. Finding a government that they want, not one that they pretend to want when they&#39;re asked, you know, are you a conservative? Are you a liberal? And they say and everybody knows in Alberta, you don&#39;t say you&#39;re a liberal. So they pretend to be conservatives, but our values are all aligned with liberalism. And there is a path to be won by going up a different conservative party. And that path would be really interesting. I see Sonny starting to look at that. I think that an outsider could come in and look at that path. I think that Rebecca Schultz could look at that path. There are a number of different candidates that could look at them. And more important, when this thing starts to roll up, Brian Jean and Danielle Smith votes, they&#39;re going to get two marks in their ballot. They&#39;re going to get Brian Jean.

There&#39;s a psychology that if you don&#39;t, if there is a presumptive first ballot victor, or there is someone who is running away way with this, then when you mark your ballot for someone else, the odds of you marking your ballot for that person, the person that was going to win the first place ballot diminished dramatically. You have to get above 43, 44, 45% on the first ballot in order to pick up anybody else&#39;s ballots because there&#39;s a reason they didn&#39;t choose you the first time. There&#39;s a reason that 57, 58, 58, 59% of the population said, nah, I don&#39;t like them. And they never ever get past that first reason that the psychology of it is really hard. It&#39;s like going and saying, well, you know, I don&#39;t like tide, but I&#39;ll pick tide the next time. It doesn&#39;t happen. If you&#39;ve chosen that you don&#39;t like tide, you will pick another type of dishwasher detergent or whatever laundry detergent before you&#39;ll ever pick a fucking time.

Well, I&#39;ll tell you something. Here&#39;s the thing. You slap the brand on yourself, and you&#39;re a conservative, right? Conservatives have looked very dissimilar over the course of the decades, right? Conservatism in 1990 didn&#39;t look the same, or 1995 didn&#39;t look the same as conservatism in 1983. These were very different ideas, and each decade they jump and they become different. Doug Ford conservatism is the only one that seems to have the staying power to get through the challenges that government brings. That could change. And I think that Legault also fits into this category as well. A conservative that shifts to be where the people need them to be. Right. And that is the conservatism that has actual staying power.
