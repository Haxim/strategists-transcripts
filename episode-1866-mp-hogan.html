        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter face their toughest accountability session ever as they dissect the strategy behind the campaign for one Corey Hogan. They go over what worked (everything) and what didn't (nothing) and get into lessons learned along the way. Was this the perfect campaign? Is ground game truly dead? Is Carter actually good at his job? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p></div>

I heard you guys talking about it, but we talk to people for literally hundreds of hours about our views on things and talking about things. And you can&#39;t help but get to know people a little bit over that and really have a bit of an understanding. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s asymmetrical. I always feel like, oh, you&#39;ve heard me talk a lot. i i wish i could hear you talk a little bit more you know so much more it likes makes the conversation like they&#39;ve just got just so much more information but but there&#39;s no question in my mind and i kind of jumped past it because i meandered but the podcast and the podcast community was such an enormous part of the story here like an enormous part yeah hundreds of volunteers but beyond the volunteers the cred and and i like i could think of very specific doors that i was was talking to people and it was not just a couple it was a lot where it&#39;d be like oh i&#39;ve heard of you and i&#39;d be like oh you listen to the podcast oh i don&#39;t listen but my friend listens and they say you&#39;re great oh that&#39;s</div>

But the fact that people know you from a tangential perspective, that I think is an interesting insight. Carter, did that surprise you too? Because maybe I have sold not our podcast, But this impact of a community like this, let me put it that way, from a strategy perspective a bit short, were you surprised by folks behind the door, not just the ones coming alongside Corey, having name recognition and community recognition and understanding a bit of profile?</div>

How are you, you know, doing the comparisons? Are you featuring your candidate in the front row? Are you putting Mark Carney in the front row? What is it that you&#39;re actually trying to achieve here? And there was, I think, zero of that, Corey.

I&#39;m not sure who else did that. And of course, you had a unique opportunity here with Nixon as being your candidate.

And so it was really about making sure people understood that contrast. And to Stephen&#39;s point, in many ways, it was less about me and Jeremy. It was more about our two bosses, right?

          <div class="said">Corey, was this a campaign, I&#39;m going to ask the question this way, and maybe you can pick up on my intent. Was this a campaign that was meant to last four weeks? Or do you feel like if you guys had added weeks added to it, it would have only gotten stronger and stronger? And I guess the reason I&#39;m asking that is like the difference between building a campaign for short term versus slightly more midterm purposes. I&#39;m curious your observation. Well,</div>

          <div class="said">And before that, pink and fed red. And they were really successful. Like we had the most doors knocked of any liberal campaign. And then we said, let&#39;s do more, right? So we had two days where we really smashed some records where we&#39;re, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of doors, hundreds of volunteers, and we just got out there. And you can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re running for two years, right? In many ways, we use the shot of adrenaline you get from being a week late to justify the sprint. And I think it was really successful. successful if you had the same number of volunteers over a different period of time you would have paced yourself different or you should pace yourself differently i believe and um and it would have just been different that&#39;s all yeah</div>

          <div class="said">I want to pick up on this, because I think this is really interesting to me. Carter, talk to me about the fun aspect in two ways. Aspect number one is the Corey way. Like, the campaign has to have fun. But I also think there&#39;s something that I think extends from the podcast and the personality, and I&#39;d say authentic personality, that Corey is. Which is, obviously, I think everyone who listens to the show more than likely comes to the same conclusion, which is Corey&#39;s probably the brightest one on the show. Sorry, Carter. But secondly, Corey also doesn&#39;t take himself all that seriously. He joins us in the mud in that regard. I think there&#39;s something to that. Am I right or wrong there in that sense? In the sense that, you know, as funny, as able to get down, as authentic, you know, and despite like having these ambitions, which have led him to this seat and hopefully more, that there&#39;s like an element of personality and fun that compounds a campaign that has that fun. And maybe the heart of the question is, does your candidate need to be a fun person in</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">order to have a fun campaign? And that might sound like a really simple question, but I often have never thought about it that way. And I think one of the reasons, if I kind of go on a bit of a diatribe, one of the reasons the Nenshi campaigns, I think, have been so successful is that Nahid is its own version of witty and fun and sarcastic and biting. And not all these terms apply to you, Corey, but I&#39;m just kind of describing. And that&#39;s led to fun-ish campaigns. So, Carter, having experienced, I guess, both of the examples I&#39;m putting on the table, but just as examples, does your candidate need to be a fun, interesting, authentic, maybe take out authentic, because we&#39;ve talked about too many, but do they need to be a fun person in order to have a fun campaign?</div>
