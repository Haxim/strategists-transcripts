But before that moment, when there was just a bunch of people going out doing stuff, and a bunch of volunteers coming in, and a bunch of stuff that was in varying states of happening, or should have happened, or hadn&#39;t happened, I&#39;ll totally tell you, like on day two or three, if you had given me a time machine on day three, and said, you can go back in time and not run, I probably would have taken it.</span>

There were a bunch of things falling through the cracks because we didn&#39;t have a campaign manager identified there yet. And at that moment, if you had offered me that trade, I would have taken that trade. But of course, that&#39;s not how real life works. And it passed quickly. By the next day, the office is open, and all of a sudden, it&#39;s a massive hub of activity. All of a sudden, the literature has shown up. The signs are popping up all over the area.</span>

I heard you guys talking about it, but we talk to people for literally hundreds of hours about our views on things and talking about things. And you can&#39;t help but get to know people a little bit over that and really have a bit of an understanding. It&#39;s like, it&#39;s asymmetrical. I always feel like, oh, you&#39;ve heard me talk a lot. i i wish i could hear you talk a little bit more you know so much more it likes makes the conversation like they&#39;ve just got just so much more information but but there&#39;s no question in my mind and i kind of jumped past it because i meandered but the podcast and the podcast community was such an enormous part of the story here like an enormous part yeah hundreds of volunteers but beyond the volunteers the cred and and i like i could think of very specific doors that i was was talking to people and it was not just a couple it was a lot where it&#39;d be like oh i&#39;ve heard of you and i&#39;d be like oh you listen to the podcast oh i don&#39;t listen but my friend listens and they say you&#39;re great oh that&#39;s</span>

I&#39;m showing up to help that guy. That is not surprising to me. In fact, I think if any of us would have run, we would have probably had that. But the fact that people know you from a tangential perspective, that I think is an interesting insight. Carter, did that surprise you too? Because maybe I have sold not our podcast, But this impact of a community like this, let me put it that way, from a strategy perspective a bit short, were you surprised by folks behind the door, not just the ones coming alongside Corey, having name recognition and community recognition and understanding a bit of profile?</span>

It&#39;s even more surprising when we run into people who are tangentially related to the listeners, when there&#39;s people who don&#39;t listen but still know our names. That&#39;s</span>

I got to ask you, though, before I get into what else you guys did, because there&#39;s a lot I want to talk about. What surprised you in a potentially, not negative way, but what was an opportunity that didn&#39;t fully kind of come to fruition? And I fully acknowledge that for anyone who was jumping into this campaign, Payne, unless you were on this track for the last two</span>

One would have thought that there maybe would have been some note comparisons, things that are working in different ridings, things that, you know, some comparisons of, okay, how are you contrasting? How are you, you know, doing the comparisons? Are you featuring your candidate in the front row? Are you putting Mark Carney in the front row? What is it that you&#39;re actually trying to achieve here? And there was, I think, zero of that, Corey.

So the main question is, what surprised you? And then let&#39;s hit on the Confederation&#39;s What&#39;s Fighting For. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, why don&#39;t I kind of build on the coordination point? And look, I really, really want to tell you, like, there are good reasons for this. The Liberal Party of Canada has been running flat since the fall. I don&#39;t want to be shitty to anybody who&#39;s worked really, really hard. But you think about they had a leadership to run, and then they immediately ran into an election. But yeah,</span>

But if I was a different kind of candidate in a different kind of circumstance, it would actually probably make me angry. The first is the Liberal Party creates a campaign manual for each of the candidates. and it&#39;s customized like it says these are your vote targets these are the things you need really yeah yeah and</span>

There are conversations I&#39;ve had with both of you along the way, Corey, around what&#39;s been going on and how. But, Cart, didn&#39;t it some way feel like a mayoral where you were kind of—Corey was his own thing. Yeah, he had to use red, and yeah, he had to use liberal assets, but you guys were doing things that other campaigns did not to kind of speak to your incongruity. And</span>

You know, I&#39;ll mention another. other, I think you guys may have been the only campaign in Calgary that was running against Danielle Smith in some way with her being on leaflets. I&#39;m not sure who else did that. And of course, you had a unique opportunity here with Nixon as being your candidate. But Carter, did it kind of feel like because it was so short, and it was not centrally coordinated, and they didn&#39;t have months to plan it, that you were kind of just running a Merrill in a writing?</span>

            <span class="text">you know, Jeremy Nixon versus Corey Hogan. It needed to have more oomph to it.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like day two or three yeah yeah and so but you can&#39;t and so what i did at that time is i sat down and and i am a strategist and so i thought well what are the things that i think need to happen right now and i i put out a list of like four bullets of like these are the activities that i believe need to occur in order for us to like run this campaign and none of them are earth shattering but earth shattering is not the point right earth shattering is not the point the point is to make sure you&#39;ve got a clear strategy a simple strategy that everybody can do and i just pulled it up here on my computer and so number one strategy one was project a two-way race we needed people to know it was between myself and the conservative candidate so that meant we we had big groups going out instead of scattering into smaller groups we prioritized getting signs up we focused on major arteries and sign locations we took any broadcast media opportunity we could we highlighted vote projections and we tried to create a buzz we tried to get people to think okay this is a really serious really exciting campaign the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the second one and this ties into carter&#39;s last point was take the fight to nixon you know uh he is outside of the conservative mainstream it personally individually might be very nice fellow but he ran for danielle smith twice he is certainly more right wing than len weber who was the candidate and the mp that he was looking to replace and he And he works for the UCP caucus right now. And so it was really about making sure people understood that contrast. And to Stephen&#39;s point, in many ways, it was less about me and Jeremy. It was more about our two bosses, right? It was about Mark</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Mark Carney and it was about Danielle Smith. But there is this US style politics that Smith has brought in and there&#39;s this ambivalence to Canada and we wanted to make sure that it was highlighted. That goes to kind of the slogan, right? right? And number three here, and this is kind of it, there&#39;s only three and then there&#39;s a broader comment, was it&#39;s all about Carney and Canada.

And we empowered people. We just said, we don&#39;t have time to run things up the chain. Just do it. Just do it. Use your brain. Be smart about it. Just do it.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, speaking of, I&#39;m going to ask you this question then, rather than Carter, because I think it&#39;s a good point to kind of give credit across the board to those who built the campaign sort of thing, even if Stephen, you and Heather laid down the tracks.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, was this a campaign, I&#39;m going to ask the question this way, and maybe you can pick up on my intent. Was this a campaign that was meant to last four weeks? Or do you feel like if you guys had added weeks added to it, it would have only gotten stronger and stronger? And I guess the reason I&#39;m asking that is like the difference between building a campaign for short term versus slightly more midterm purposes. I&#39;m curious your observation. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, we would have built it different. I think we were, and you know this, right? We had these big days where we tried to get as many volunteers out as possible. By the red zone.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And before that, pink and fed red. And they were really successful. Like we had the most doors knocked of any liberal campaign. And then we said, let&#39;s do more, right? So we had two days where we really smashed some records where we&#39;re, you know, thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of doors, hundreds of volunteers, and we just got out there. And you can&#39;t do that if you&#39;re running for two years, right? In many ways, we use the shot of adrenaline you get from being a week late to justify the sprint. And I think it was really successful. successful if you had the same number of volunteers over a different period of time you would have paced yourself different or you should pace yourself differently i believe and um and it would have just been different that&#39;s all yeah</span>

Because the people-powered aspect of this, I think, is really impressive. Like, really, really impressive. And I think it was perhaps not unique to your campaign, Corey, but you were one of the few campaigns that was blessed with it so quickly, especially given week late and then three days of people not thinking it was real, or at least a portion.</span>

Yeah, and then all of a sudden, everybody&#39;s coming out and saying, I actually am going to volunteer. You know, what did I learn? I learned that there still is a volunteer culture. The people will volunteer if they are presented with the right opportunities. And by opportunities, I don&#39;t mean like, oh, I prefer to do policy instead of door knocking.</span>

But like the actual meaningful conversations you can have. And let&#39;s be clear, like as the candidate, I have more of an opportunity to do that because I&#39;m not speaking on behalf of the candidate. I am the candidate, right? Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">There are 35 days in a regular campaign. That means you&#39;re having 350 conversations of that level of meaningfulness as the candidate being out there every day but i think this goes to steven&#39;s point if you&#39;re out there every day and all of the volunteers come out with you every day and you have hundreds of volunteers all of a sudden you are having thousands of conversations and so i mean like volunteers are a multiplier and they make the campaign work they do a campaign does not work without volunteers because the candidate cannot possibly talk to 90 some thousand electors themselves in a campaign you know and they&#39;re not going to have uh the the conversations that they need to have at scale so again it all goes back back to that point about it&#39;s scale and you</span>

            <span class="text">well i do think that there was a little enthusiasm there was some momentum we tried to go big we tried to create a bit of a show and um and uh we also always tried to have fun you know there&#39;s that that paul wells rule like the person who&#39;s having the most fun is winning i think by that rule we there wasn&#39;t a day we lost like this was a campaign with a lot of lightness too like it It was a pretty fun campaign.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I want to pick up on this, because I think this is really interesting to me. Carter, talk to me about the fun aspect in two ways. Aspect number one is the Corey way. Like, the campaign has to have fun. But I also think there&#39;s something that I think extends from the podcast and the personality, and I&#39;d say authentic personality, that Corey is. Which is, obviously, I think everyone who listens to the show more than likely comes to the same conclusion, which is Corey&#39;s probably the brightest one on the show. Sorry, Carter. But secondly, Corey also doesn&#39;t take himself all that seriously. He joins us in the mud in that regard. I think there&#39;s something to that. Am I right or wrong there in that sense? In the sense that, you know, as funny, as able to get down, as authentic, you know, and despite like having these ambitions, which have led him to this seat and hopefully more, that there&#39;s like an element of personality and fun that compounds a campaign that has that fun. And maybe the heart of the question is, does your candidate need to be a fun person in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">order to have a fun campaign? And that might sound like a really simple question, but I often have never thought about it that way. And I think one of the reasons, if I kind of go on a bit of a diatribe, one of the reasons the Nenshi campaigns, I think, have been so successful is that Nahid is its own version of witty and fun and sarcastic and biting. And not all these terms apply to you, Corey, but I&#39;m just kind of describing. And that&#39;s led to fun-ish campaigns. So, Carter, having experienced, I guess, both of the examples I&#39;m putting on the table, but just as examples, does your candidate need to be a fun, interesting, authentic, maybe take out authentic, because we&#39;ve talked about too many, but do they need to be a fun person in order to have a fun campaign?</span>

            <span class="text">is a little bit aloof and a little bit removed doesn&#39;t get to have as much fun. um you know i think that the the really fun campaigns are the ones where the candidate&#39;s gonna laugh at your jokes right</span>

Like nobody&#39;s sitting there being like, I want to do that. Why am I not in charge of that? We&#39;re all drowning in our own separate streams of work. So, so I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a clean answer to that Zane, but I think part of why it worked with so many people at such like experienced and seasoned levels is because like,</span>

And from that, they say, these people are good. These people probably not. Don&#39;t waste your time on the probably not. The name of the game is get IDs. Let&#39;s roll.

Or unless they have already been canvassed, we&#39;re going to hit the door still. And we found so many supporters in the threes, in the fours, in the fives.

And then people would go to that voting station and vote. and in a really complicated version of it you get um you&#39;ve got uh you know bingo sheets or some sort of mechanism where you know exactly everybody who voted and that&#39;s what kara ran she ran a full data integrated sheet where every night the scrutineers would go in get photographs of the of the bingo sheets the right data would come back she all the data would be entered overnight and then we would have a new set of people to call and go door knock the next day and she didn&#39;t treat advanced polls as one advanced day of voting every day got that full treatment so that by the time that we got to running the election day we had tone you know treated</span>

            <span class="text">yeah yeah yeah and then exactly and so as we&#39;re coming through we&#39;re able to sort of assess where we are relative to expectation because the top line number tells you nothing like if all of the vote has come in from our best areas and we&#39;re winning by five we&#39;re actually pretty screwed but if all of the vote has come in from our worst areas and we&#39;re only down by five that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">that also is a hallmark of a really strong campaign it&#39;s not even something that changes the outcome but because we had that sophisticated organization that cara had created and and because we had the model that steven had created we we were pretty good and there was one poll out two polls outstanding when i went down to talk to everybody i think right and</span>

            <span class="text">and uh we just had to wait for them to come in and wait for the rest of the networks to call it because some of like uh the globe and mail called it and toronto star called it but the you know cbc hadn&#39;t called it they didn&#39;t call it till the final poll came in but the level of sophistication was again as as good as i&#39;ve ever seen and it was very very exciting it was very cool and um yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and maybe the maybe the premise is you don&#39;t like you it&#39;s a it&#39;s a very viable path to say this was purpose built for an outcome but in other ways i go back to the first question around the the convergence between the pod and the discord and the campaign and the and the and the in front of the doors and beside the doors uh and all the other things that have now been subsequently added in four weeks it started at this very different campaign between day one and day uh 35 right how</span>

            <span class="text">in literal generations so there is a moment here there&#39;s something to capture there&#39;s like some lightning that needs to be bottled and i think that the liberal party needs to do it i think that progressive calgarians need to do it whether you&#39;re capital p progressive living on the south side of the riding or you&#39;re progressive conservative living on the north side of the riding there is an opportunity here to chart a different course than we&#39;ve been on and um there are going to be so many different distractions it&#39;s such an important time for the country that&#39;s kind of why i&#39;m running or ran i guess now it&#39;s past tense um but we can&#39;t lose focus on the fact that there is a chance for a changing category to project itself differently so i don&#39;t really know the answer with clarity at this moment but i know we need to turn that moment into a movement and so</span>

And the first thing is you need to make sure that you are seen as a member of the group, right? Corey has to be seen to be part of Calgary Confederation, and part of Calgary in general, because he can&#39;t just be the Confederation MP, he&#39;s got to be the Calgary MP. And the second thing that he needs to do is build an organization that can sustain that, whether that&#39;s the staffing in his office, the staffing in Ottawa, the staffing, or the volunteer structure that needs to come to play uh it will be a significant operation um from the beginning of of the term uh you know we it&#39;s kind of been fun we&#39;ve all taken a break um and i don&#39;t mean a break break because i know that cory&#39;s been working really hard on making writing notes and doing all the things that need to be done but it&#39;s been a break but in about a</span>

Because there needs to be, like, when you have, like, Michelle Rempel-Garner, you know, has organized and created an organizational structure that was and is bigger than just her. Corey&#39;s campaign was bigger than just Corey. We were able to participate in at least two other campaigns, one of which wound up being a winner, because of Corey&#39;s unbelievable fundraising capacity. So there&#39;s a lot more for us to do.
