            <span class="text">music. Hit it. Corey, we&#39;ve been waiting for months and we finally have it here. Our governor general&#39;s special episode. we are doing seven hours uh on this episode we&#39;re gonna we&#39;re gonna uh talk about all the picks on the short list we&#39;re gonna talk about how the final decision was made uh cory kick us off here uh where where should we start</span>

            <span class="text">okay carter uh we&#39;re going to you uh cory&#39;s either refusing to go first uh or he is uh just just blown away that we&#39;re finally doing this episode.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m really excited that we have Mary Simon as the new Governor General. You know, it&#39;s fascinating to me that we are picking apart the two languages that she has in terms of her bilingualism. And, you know, I think that having a First Nations language, it speaks to the Canada that we want to become and the respect that we we want to have. And that made me excited. I was excited for her selection. It strikes me that it seemed to take a long time to wind up in a place that people</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">people could predict relatively easily. But I think it is the right place. So I&#39;m probably not going to complain too much about the process that brought us here.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, Stephen is generally good at filling time. But in this case, he did at six hours and 58 minutes of content in 45 seconds. So I now have to ask you, what do you think? What do you think of this choice as a political choice? Because it clearly was one and seemingly one that took a lot of deliberation by the committee spearheaded by Minister LeBlanc. What do you think of this choice for the Trudeau government? All</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">All Governor General picks are political choices, especially for the Liberal Party. We&#39;ve talked talked about this on the show before the the liberals in particular tend to use it as a manifestation of canada&#39;s higher ideals or what they perceive canada&#39;s higher ideals to be and they they use the the position as a bit of a showcase and a bit of a counterbalance to the prime minister right so you you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you use you have like a dedicated uh journalists more often than not it seems lately or you have an astronaut and that seemed like a good idea at the time um and and the conservatives tend to treat the position a little bit more like it&#39;s an an administrator position. And in fact, you see that in the choices they&#39;ve made for Governor General. But it doesn&#39;t surprise me that it took the time it took only</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">only because of where we were and how we got here.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The fact is, if there had been anything beyond such a crazy thorough vetting that, well, I don&#39;t even know what to say. They must have overturned every single bloody rock just</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">just to make sure that there were no accusations of any kind of abuse or anything like that of of staff or anything because anything short of that like they would have been in real trouble if they&#39;d followed down that path again but you know mary simon wonderful choice fantastic choice has had uh honorary degrees from many universities uh is including the one that i work for is um you know is well regarded in the international circuits understands an issue of of arctic sovereignty that i think like it&#39;s a nice value add i don&#39;t expect the gg to be negotiating with with the Russians or anything like that. But I think it&#39;s pretty cool. And ultimately, I think</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, yeah. And you&#39;re hearing many people actually with with very similar views. Carter, you know, you seem to be quite happy with the pick. Is there is this is this case open and shut for Trudeau politically? Is there is there any Any sort of, you know, hanging</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that this is, right now it&#39;s impossible to choose. Because right now what we&#39;ve got is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is all the positives, right? And the resume, the CV reads perfectly. People are excited by her. There&#39;s very little in the way of criticism. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a dark cloud in the sky. But sometimes it takes dark clouds a while to form, Zane. And we really won&#39;t be able to tell the success of this appointment until maybe a year or two when we find out whether or not she&#39;s been psychologically abusing her staff. That takes some time to develop. So we&#39;ll see if</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, thank you, Carter. Corey, finish us off on the governor general pick.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I talked about how the conservatives usually pick the safe pick or the pick that&#39;s more the establishment institution pick.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">those circles. So I just think it&#39;s a great pick. It&#39;s a fantastic pick. And now we can go back to forgetting</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

First one comes to us from CNET. this is transition material that you&#39;re going to appreciate. We go from very serious talk of a former diplomat and now the governor general to this. Heinz starts petition to make hot dogs and buns come in equal packs. That is right, Carter. The issue is finally getting the top shelf advocacy treatment in the form of a petition. That&#39;s right. Heinz Ketchup Canada is getting getting involved in the decades long struggle that hot dogs come in a pack of 10 and hot dog buns, Carter, come in a pack of fill in the blank. Eight and 12,</span>

When Brewing Giant Coors launched a new advertising campaign earlier this year, the format came as a surprise to many. The company was planning to infiltrate people&#39;s dreams to get them to buy and presumably drink Coors beer, which makes, you know, butt of a lot of jokes in the sense of, is this what they need to do to get people to drink Coors beer? Seems like it. Coors encouraged people to watch a short online video before bed, then play an eight-hour soundscape through the night. If successful, this targeted dream incubation would trigger refreshing dreams of Coors, according to the company. Stephen Carter, Inception in Advertising, it&#39;s here.

Amos explained at the briefing that it was part of a, quote, progressive return to his duties that had begun on June 21st. Quote, I want to be clear that while these two incidents have resulted in great embarrassment, they don&#39;t define me. These were not circumstances of ill intent or unethical gain or moral wrongdoing. He apologized once again for the two incidents, citing that he was just too busy and it was hyperactive in his multitasking, which caused the nude Zoom incidents. incidents uh carter i know you&#39;re a man of many tasks you do multiple things at once and you know occasionally you&#39;re on your phone but then back on your computer you know you&#39;re watching tv and then you like obviously piss in a can in between uh so so tell me tell</span>

Our next headline comes to us – let&#39;s spend a bit of time on this one, as we always do in our last headline. This one comes to us from the Globe and Mail. Mail, Green Party temporarily lays off staff in leader Annamie Paul&#39;s office. Let me read a bit of this, and let&#39;s get into that and the fact that recently she was muted in her meeting by her executive when she was trying to fight these staff layoffs. But the Green Party significantly diminished leader Annamie Paul&#39;s support team on Wednesday, so a couple days, actually yesterday, temporarily laying off key staff members just weeks before she faces a possible ouster. This is, of course, a July 20th vote of non-confidence for her tenure, which will be held by the executive. Two staff members in Ms. Paul&#39;s office received layoff notices on Wednesday, sources tell the Globe and Mail. They were let go as part of a broader set of layoffs the party is carrying out despite objections from the leader, sources say. say, Corey,</span>

I&#39;ve talked about this before. This seems to me that this is outside of the core of what the Green Party should be standing for. And it should be one of those places where we can say, you know what, we have a disagreement on that issue, but that&#39;s not central to our party. Because every party has people who have disagreements around issues. Every party doesn&#39;t agree or see eye to eye on everything. And this party is behaving the way I&#39;ve never seen a party behave before. And to cut off the leader like this, one has to ask, what is at the core of it? Because it&#39;s not the issue. It&#39;s not just the issue. There&#39;s something beyond that. And I can&#39;t help but wonder if it has something to do with sexism and or racism, because this is not the way that any other party has treated any other leader in my political history.

            <span class="text">She&#39;s the leader. She has the right to make questionable decisions. And she was, again, elected by the broadest swath of membership. So, you know, when I think about, Stephen talks about where you make cuts, the leader&#39;s office and fundraising last. So true. So absolutely true for the reasons he said. But even if it wasn&#39;t true, the</span>

And so it does lead to the questions that Stephen&#39;s asking. What is it about her? Is it the fact that she&#39;s a minority woman? Is it the fact that she&#39;s a woman? Why are people acting like this around her? This is not how you treat leaders of political parties. It&#39;s not.</span>

And at that point, she should walk away and talk to people that got her her to the Green Party leadership and say, do we need a new Green Party? Because the Green Party that she&#39;s leading right now has the infrastructure, but it does not, it will not have any momentum. It&#39;s going to die a horrible death here. And, you know, maybe the best thing for her to do is to resign as leader immediately following the election and then run as leader again and put in a national council that actually makes sense. Every single person on the national council, when they get annihilated should resign at the same time as the leader this party has uh has fucked itself um and</span>

Talk to me as someone who I know personally who&#39;s spent a lot of your quite literally free time trying to find candidates, you know, predominantly women to run for office at all orders of government. What is something like this, this story, getting the airtime and the oxygen due to people who are maybe kicking tires, sitting on the sidelines, saying maybe I should publicly serve, and they see something like this happening to a leader in broad daylight, so to speak? week. What do you think this kind of does to perhaps the cohort or the pipeline of candidates? And tell me if you feel like I&#39;m getting overly sentimental or overly blowing it up too much of folks that may not see themselves in political life, but see Annamie Paul and others like her and say, oh, maybe this is for me, and then see something like the past week with the Green Party as a result.

We haven&#39;t done an Alberta segment in a while. Taking the train to nowhere, of course, a literal and metaphor for two things. Number one, the Green Line LRT approved here in Alberta. Stephen Carter, you&#39;ll walk us through what that means and the politics of it as the prime minister was here visiting the premier and the mayor of Calgary. And then, of course, Jason Kenney having a quote unquote cabinet shuffle. Maybe the quote should be around shuffle. because it was more a cabinet growth than it was a shuffle, adding ministers, but removing one and packing, ensuring she packs her bags to a train of nowhere. Lila here, who had three portfolios in her ministry, now with zero. That seems to be the headline from that shuffle. Maybe you guys can tell me otherwise in terms of both the strategy and what the headline from that shuffle looks like and what Kenny&#39;s trying to get out of it. But Carter, let&#39;s start here with the green line. The prime minister was in town earlier this week, meeting with the premier, meeting with the mayor, his meeting with the premier, you know, unsurprisingly, you know, a little tense, slightly frosty, like not, you know, entirely not cordial. But, you know, it was it was two guys who don&#39;t like each other hanging out for 45 minutes. He then meets with Mayor Nenshi for a love in and then they head over to announce the green line that this new funding and just before they&#39;re about to announce it, this This is where I need you to come in because I&#39;m actually confused and I have lost track of the bouncing ball here. The province, which is not at this press conference with the prime minister and the mayor, issues a press release two minutes before they&#39;re about to go on stage saying the Green Line is approved. So first, Carter, can you demystify for me just and for our listeners what happened? Because there is some strategy here, but I don&#39;t even know where to start to ask the strategy questions. So maybe for our non-Alberta listeners and maybe for some of our Alberta listeners. But let&#39;s be clear for me. Can you lay out the terrain for what&#39;s happening here? Sure.</span>

Like when you think about the scale and the hundreds of thousands of people who go to the parade, and the over a million because of double counting that go to Stampede in a normal year, it&#39;s a major, major event in the province of Alberta.</span>

They didn&#39;t want to have a bunch of MLAs and ministers walking around not having answers on the green line, so I&#39;m sure that&#39;s part of their decision-making on when they timed it. And that&#39;s true of the prime minister, too. He didn&#39;t want his candidates, dates george shahal most notably in calgary skyview announced today to be walking around having to answer for the the federal government on this if the federal money hadn&#39;t started flowing if the province had then made their intentions clear so in some cases like you</span>

            <span class="text">So, yeah, it&#39;s an official title, Corey. So listen, Jason Kenney doing a cabinet quote unquote shuffle. You know, you guys can explain what the quote means, so to speak, because it seems like more a cabinet growth than a shuffle. But there was a shuffle in a sense. So Jason LeJuan, the MLA of Calgary Foothills, has moved from associate minister of addictions and mental health to become the new minister of community and social services. Rick McIver, who was holding multiple ministries after the municipal affairs minister was let go and consolidated into his previous ministry. So he had the dual role of transportation and municipal affairs. He lets go of transportation, keeps municipal affairs. Rajan Sani, who was the minister of community and social services, now takes on transportation. interpretation. And Mohamed Yassin, also from Calgary, like Minister Sani, leaves his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration to become the Associate Minister of Immigration and Multiculturalism. There&#39;s also some additions in cabinet, primarily in the form of associate ministerships. And remind me of that. I want to talk about the importance of associate ministers, quote unquote, as well, and why some of these aren&#39;t full-out ministers, so to speak. So Mike Ellis of Calgary West becomes the Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. Nate Horner from Drumheller-Stettler becomes the Associate Minister of Rural Economic Development. Whitney Izzik, I believe I&#39;m pronouncing that last name correctly, becomes the Associate Minister of the Status of Women, reporting directly to the Minister of Culture, who I&#39;ll get to in a second, who is Ron Orr. He becomes the Minister of Culture from Lacombe-Pinocco. Also notably, the guy who in a Facebook post said that Kenny was raised by God to be the leader of Alberta. Well, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get to that. We also have Tanya Furr, who is from Calgary Pagan, is Associate Minister of Red Tape Production, and out of cabinet, gone, two individuals, Grant Hunter, who was the aforementioned Associate Minister of Red Tape Production, and Leela Ahir, who held multiple portfolios, culture, multiculturalism, and status of women, now having none of those three, completely out. And, of course, notably, she was one of the MLAs, one of the ministers at the time, who criticized Kenney, publicly called him out to apologize after he and other senior cabinet ministers were caught breaking the government&#39;s COVID-19 restrictions at the Sky Palace. She also criticized Kenney&#39;s tone-deaf response on the Sir John A. MacDonald statue controversy as well. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s talk headlines. What&#39;s the headline? Not the one that you read and you see. What&#39;s the headline if you could write it, right? If you could write your headline from what you digested from this cabinet shuffle, this cabinet growth, if you were writing the headline for it with the political strategy brain, what would it be?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">kenny makes moves to secure caucus i i mean this is not a cabinet shuffle designed to appease albertans uh on on things they were feeling anxious about right and we should get back to that because i actually think there&#39;s reason you wouldn&#39;t want to do that right but it didn&#39;t change the minister of health didn&#39;t change the minister of education these are lightning rods uh in alberta for obvious reasons there&#39;s there&#39;s no shortage of them you could go through But instead, what it did was it removed somebody who seemed to question Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership, or at least made things very awkward for him, right, in Lila here. And it brought in a number of associate ministers, basically enlargening the cabinet. And interesting that they&#39;re all associate ministers, too. There&#39;s kind of this two-tier cabinet that&#39;s been created as a result, right? I&#39;ve never seen such a mix of minister and associate minister. minister and um and then it also it generally didn&#39;t change other things so you you brought people in you haven&#39;t antagonized any of your existing ministers by and large because you&#39;ve kept them in the positions with the exception of the person who spoke against you yeah and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and so like this to me seems very much designed to manage the caucus and and when even you look at who the associate what their associate ministers of they&#39;re not associate ministers of portfolios that I think the public would say that they&#39;re struggling in, better throw another minister in. It&#39;s not an associate minister of education, for example, right? It&#39;s associate ministers of, well, I mean, you just ran through the list. I would sort of even struggle to kind of remember half of them there. Yeah,</span>

They can&#39;t fight every front, and they have to retreat at some point. And that&#39;s what the caucus shuffle should have been, in my mind, is a retreat from incredibly unpopular positions, and then the crafting of new positions that will enable them to win in 2023, because it&#39;s going to take some time to build back from a personal popularity of 22%.</span>

Second problem is if you&#39;re going to change course, what? what? You&#39;re going to be less likely to fight with the nurses. You&#39;re going to be less tough on wages. You&#39;re going to be more willing to concede to the doctors what they want. You&#39;re going to be more willing to concede to the teachers what they want. What is that going to do for the very base that we&#39;ve just talked about potentially being a risk to you? So from both a policy point of view and the way you operate and the way you treat people point of view, those kinds of shuffles would probably have been very damaging to Jason Kenney. And do</span>

I&#39;m going to listen. I&#39;m hearing you. I&#39;m reflecting your needs. And because of that, they&#39;re saddled with four years of difficult decisions. That&#39;s what needs to happen.

Minister Sani also spoke out against Kenny. She moves, she gets shuffled into transportation. What do you think happened here?

We don&#39;t know what was happening in the halls of the legislature. And perhaps she was by far the most egregious offender here. And perhaps Jason Kenney just said, OK, enough of that. We&#39;re not going to do it. When you look at the facts from the outside, certainly her criticisms of the premier were the ones that landed the hardest in the public. And they actually forced him to apologize. And I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t like that very much. And so there&#39;s also that, right? The consequences of her acting out were higher than the acting out of the other ministers. But, you</span>

Because it&#39;s like any organization, politics, and we&#39;ve said this before, it&#39;s just like, it&#39;s a workplace in many ways, too. And people do watch how you treat people on their way out. And they think, well, how would I want to be treated? And is that fair? And is that right? So that&#39;s absolutely the appropriate way to deal with it. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the way it always happens. And, and quite often, when a minister is, is let</span>

            <span class="text">let go or moved out out or demoted. It occurs because there has been not one, but multiple events that have sort of led to that. And other people can sort of see the writing on the wall, and then they can see that the leader is not treating that minister the same way as before. And that&#39;s where it gets really messy. So the other thing, this is unsolicited advice to leaders here, but that which must be done immediately or eventually must be done immediately. If this is just not working out with a minister you get rid of the minister before it becomes a a bigger problem and it also becomes a question on your judgment and how you manage your manage your cabinet cory</span>

I mean, this is ridiculous. This is a man who&#39;s lost perspective of what the issues are to Albertans. And there wasn&#39;t a single Albertan out there saying, you know what we need is an associate minister of red tape. They&#39;re out there talking about the curriculum.

They take us for granted. I thought that was basically pitch perfect as far as like an opposition message against it, because you talked about jobs, you talked about health care, you talked about education, and as a Southern, not, I mean, Lethbridge isn&#39;t rural, but as a Southern Alberta MLA, also getting to throw in the dig of being taken for granted, like it just, it It checked</span>

This is something that he&#39;s doing to deal with a couple of problems within his cabinet, reward a couple of people and deal with at least one problem. So,</span>

But sometimes you just got to put your position on the table, right? Like that&#39;s the time you are in bargaining. And so that has to drive some of of your announcements on it and sometimes you want to create the space for a deal and so you ask for something that&#39;s much more than you&#39;re going to get both sides do this of course yes we want a seven percent increase no we want you to take a three percent cut and then they end up on zeros and they call it a day right so without there&#39;s undoubtedly strategy behind the scenes on it uh that said some of the communication within it was a bit ungainly</span>
