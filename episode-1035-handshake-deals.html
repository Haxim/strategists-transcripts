          <p>The Zain-free gang get together to talk through a grab-bag of issues from the Danielle Smith/Justin Trudeau handshake-from-hell to how the UCP and the NDP might use health care as an issue to Sumner being caned on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1850s.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about awkward handshakes, the health funding deal, Alberta polling and the American State of the Union. Is Alberta Premier Danielle Smith poised to win big on health care? Can the Alberta NDP shake voters away from their "natural resting place"? And did you know for the cost of the proposed R-Star program you could afford to give everybody in Alberta a Strategists Patreon subscription at the $20/month level for twenty years? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">Yeah, okay. Okay, we&#39;re jumping into our first segment. It&#39;s called The Handshake. Basically, Justin Trudeau and Daniel Smith, they met this week in Ottawa for the first time, and they shook hands. It went viral. Today, actually, Smith talked to reporters, and when she entered the media availability, she shook all of their hands. It was quite nice. When asked today about her handshake with the prime minister, her she said she had actually shaken his hand before media were allowed in the room and she was caught by surprise when he reached out again in front of the cameras uh let&#39;s jump into it cory first of all how many times have you watched the handshake oh</div>

How are you going to show? Like, they&#39;re all trying to hit a line of not looking like jerks, but also showing that they&#39;re not particularly pleased with the Prime Minister.

You still have to shake the person&#39;s hand, but you do not have to be happy about it.

And the way she&#39;s looking at it, you can tell that her idea of recovery was, well, now I just need to look very unhappy about this. Right. Right. And so it&#39;s almost like this overcorrection of her face to be just a downright scowl about, you know, having to shake this person&#39;s hand. Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau has this giant grin on his face and he doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not one of those like fake smiles. I wouldn&#39;t describe it that way. Like you can see it&#39;s also in his eyes a little bit, but there&#39;s a certain pain that radiates through like, oh, my God, I can&#39;t believe this is what&#39;s going on right now. So</div>

So Trudeau has pitched a 10-year deal. that increases funding to provinces and territories it&#39;s 46 billion in new funding i believe um it&#39;s a lot less than what premiers demanded and then there will be separate talks with each each of the provinces and territories to kind of work out specific agreements of what works for them um cory let&#39;s start with you what are your thoughts on this strategy from trudeau to kind of frame it that way and have each province and territory come up with their own agreement um</div>

            <div class="said">There&#39;s this immediate moment of crisis, right? This idea that healthcare is in a challenging place. The premiers were certainly elevating that argument going through. And so he gave a fairly nominal amount of money when you consider the size and scale of Canadian healthcare with no strings attached. hatched and then talked about money on the table to make deals with the premier set out a couple of foundations like it&#39;s got to be net new right we&#39;ve got to get more money into the health care system it can&#39;t be something where the feds increase the transfers in the provinces reduce in other places um and so that seems okay to me and it follows a model that was successful to him with child care right negotiate one by one pick off the provinces have the provinces that haven&#39;t made a deal yet, say, I really want that money. Why have you not gotten that money yet? Creates pressure on the premiers from their populations to get a deal with the feds. So that all kind of makes sense to me.</div>

            <div class="said">The thing that I think is potentially going to be a giant fucking challenge for him is he now has to negotiate all of these individual deals on healthcare.

And my bet, my money would be on this is worse for Trudeau, this is worse for Smith than it is for Trudeau. And Trudeau is just going to be waiting and waiting in politics. If you have the patience to wait in politics, it&#39;s often very, very powerful.

It&#39;s Danielle Smith versus Rachel Notley. You were just talking about that abacus polling that showed health care as one of the two top issues in Alberta. And it&#39;s one that voters give the NDP a huge lead on in terms of the support. most of the list that abacus pulled on the ucp has the edge now they asked about the economy in about 12 i&#39;m exaggerating but in a few different ways right yeah but we can tell that they generally trust they being albertans generally trust the new democrats on health care on education on uh trying to deal with like equity gaps and and so that to me is ground that the ndp want to be on right which ultimately means if the salience of those issues rises it assists the NDP if the salience of those issues lowers and</div>

            <div class="said">I think those numbers are totally irrelevant. And if the NDP are chasing them, they&#39;re going down a bad path. They need to be looking at what their accessible voters care about. It&#39;s not what, you know, Albertans as a whole think are the top issues. It&#39;s what the Albertans who are movable think are the top issues. And I think this is a trap that political parties fall into very, very quickly. And I&#39;m pretty sure that if you ask movable voters, you&#39;d find kind of some similar numbers. But, you know, step one is diagnose the problem in very specific terms. So you&#39;ve got a couple of swing ridings on the borders of Calgary. You&#39;ve got a couple of swing ridings in rural Alberta. You&#39;ve got to understand what their top issues are and the lenses through which they look at them. Because you&#39;re going to have a number of right-wing voters, for example, who say healthcare is, you</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">you know, we agree healthcare is a problem, but our solution, our remedy is very different. Similarly, you&#39;re going to have people say, we agree affordability is a problem, but affordability probably means something very different to somebody who&#39;s got a family income of $150,000 and they&#39;re finding that they can&#39;t get the fifth wheel they want versus somebody who is living paycheck to paycheck at $15 an hour. So you got to have a little bit more, you got to dig into the issues a lot more than that. And I actually think this is one of these things that the NDP are going to have to be very careful about the UCP2 going forward in the next couple of months, which is you are going to have people waving these polls in front of your face and saying, see, act, see this, this is what people want you to talk about. But the two filters you always have to put this through is, that&#39;s great. We&#39;re not trying to win every voter in Alberta. We&#39;re trying to win the movable voters in Alberta. Those who are with us are with us. Those against us are against us. We care about the movable voters. And that&#39;s great. But just because an issue has salience doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good to us. And we&#39;ve got to identify where we have the strongest ground. and so if i&#39;m the ndp yeah i i you know i suspect despite all those words i just said you end up in a place not dissimilar from steven health care health care health care but i certainly want to make sure that i&#39;m confirming that and i certainly want to be thinking about it almost on a riding by riding basis not in not in kind of a very blanket sense boy</div>

This is about how it goes when you go through December. The last David Coletto poll came out, I think, in October, November, somewhere in there. And it was the one that they identified the reluctant UCP voters. And those ones had watched real shit go down in October, November, and into early December with the legislature, Danielle Smith, the mistakes that were made, the real on-the-field stuff.

So if you&#39;re going to be forcing people off of that land, then you&#39;ve got to have a really good case for support. and the case for support from the ndp over the last uh couple of months has been terrible i mean we tore them apart on the just transition uh we tore the you know i i tear them apart about having a lack of focus i mean i saw that again today um you know daniel smith has planned to put 20 billion dollars into uh oil and gas um you know cleaning up oil and gas wells out of our royalties out of our royalties royalties are albertans money for the resources that live under our our soil they&#39;re giving that away back to the companies that are making record profits um and and the</div>

Are they talking about 12 issues? Or are they actually just talking about the one, but we&#39;ve seen 12. And so we get frustrated.

And there&#39;s like a lot going on that I think reasonably you might think would be a drag on Danielle Smith&#39;s popularity, but we&#39;re not really seeing that. And I&#39;ll tell you right now, like 48-46 UCP, that is not an election, like you clearly are not winning there if you&#39;re the NDP because of where the votes are and the seats are.

And then you do. And I say, oh, hey, listen up, man. I&#39;m actually willing to give you all of the money back you gave me for the car if you actually now keep the word that you&#39;ve already committed to doing. Like, it&#39;s a bit bonkers. And the scale of money is so big, I think people get lost in it. But there&#39;s got to be a way you can pull that back to your message. Like, you want to talk about education? Well, that&#39;s 200 to 1,000 schools, depending on if you&#39;re talking K-3 or like high school schools. That&#39;s an enormous amount of money, $20 billion. How many physicians is that?

Essentially, we&#39;re asking for money from the feds to pay for health care, and we&#39;re giving way more money out the back door to oil and gas companies. So what is the plan here? In some ways, I think those are the comps you need to draw, and those are the stories you need to tell. if you want to tell a story about health care and our star comes up yes i mean it it seems to me personally deeply egregious that we would pay such an unfathomable amount of money to get somebody to do something they&#39;re legally you know they have to do it like this is this is already a requirement of oil and gas companies so what&#39;s the point they also then they have record profits right now i like none of this makes any sense to me but maybe</div>
