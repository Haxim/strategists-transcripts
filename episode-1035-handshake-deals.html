            <span class="text">Yeah, okay. Okay, we&#39;re jumping into our first segment. It&#39;s called The Handshake. Basically, Justin Trudeau and Daniel Smith, they met this week in Ottawa for the first time, and they shook hands. It went viral. Today, actually, Smith talked to reporters, and when she entered the media availability, she shook all of their hands. It was quite nice. When asked today about her handshake with the prime minister, her she said she had actually shaken his hand before media were allowed in the room and she was caught by surprise when he reached out again in front of the cameras uh let&#39;s jump into it cory first of all how many times have you watched the handshake oh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">man you know and it&#39;s it&#39;s not even like it&#39;s just a conservative politician thing it&#39;s like alberta premiers feel like they can&#39;t look too eager to shake justin trudeau&#39;s hand it&#39;s just kind of the most small ball stuff And it blows my mind, the conversations that exist around the periphery, where they will say, okay, well, for cameras, what are you going to do? How are you going to show? Like, they&#39;re all trying to hit a line of not looking like jerks, but also showing that they&#39;re not particularly pleased with the Prime Minister. It&#39;s wild. wild it&#39;s one of these small things in politics that this you know budget shoe uh photo ops there&#39;s a few of these things where you&#39;re like how much effort goes into this relative to the output but you know it&#39;s an Alberta thing Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">shake the person&#39;s hand if you want to look like you&#39;re the dominant person then hold on to the handshake a little longer if you want to look like you&#39;re weak then try and get let your hand go um you know danielle put her hand forward and pulled her hand back i&#39;m not sure how catching someone off guard handshake is the is the move of politics there is a great great opening uh chapter about the political handshake in a book called primary colors by anonymous who turned out to be joe klein and it is about how a politician if you want to be successful has to master the art of the handshake and not once in that entire chapter talking about handshakes did i ever come up with with the half handshake turning into a limp fist or limp fish handshake. That was just the worst thing in the history of politics. Yeah.</span>

You had a smiling photo of Rachel Notley shaking Justin Trudeau&#39;s hand on a billboard on Highway 2 forever. Highway 2 is the highway between Calgary and Edmonton for our non-Alberta listeners here. and um of course then we saw jason kenney with his very dramatic kind of scowl before he begrudgingly reaches out hand handshake when those two first met and there was obviously some theater involved there some thought into what was going on uh</span>

And the international leader, the reluctant handshake is one of the required elements of international leadership. You still have to shake the person&#39;s hand, but you do not have to be happy about it. It&#39;s like a forced handshake between the leaders and, you know, if Joe Biden goes to see Xi in China in the next couple of weeks after the spy balloon, I&#39;ll tell you something, there would be a really cold handshake between those two.

And the end is the best one. You know, that limp hand that Stephen&#39;s talking about, it almost looks like it&#39;s like in a fist and he&#39;s holding onto her fist. And the way she&#39;s looking at it, you can tell that her idea of recovery was, well, now I just need to look very unhappy about this. Right. Right. And so it&#39;s almost like this overcorrection of her face to be just a downright scowl about, you know, having to shake this person&#39;s hand. Meanwhile, Justin Trudeau has this giant grin on his face and he doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not one of those like fake smiles. I wouldn&#39;t describe it that way. Like you can see it&#39;s also in his eyes a little bit, but there&#39;s a certain pain that radiates through like, oh, my God, I can&#39;t believe this is what&#39;s going on right now. So</span>

            <span class="text">So let&#39;s talk about why they were shaking hands. One of the reasons why they&#39;re meeting is, and let&#39;s talk about this new federal healthcare deal. So Trudeau has pitched a 10-year deal. that increases funding to provinces and territories it&#39;s 46 billion in new funding i believe um it&#39;s a lot less than what premiers demanded and then there will be separate talks with each each of the provinces and territories to kind of work out specific agreements of what works for them um cory let&#39;s start with you what are your thoughts on this strategy from trudeau to kind of frame it that way and have each province and territory come up with their own agreement um</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um you know i Part of me thinks it&#39;s not a bad strategy. Part of me thinks it&#39;s a terrible strategy. The part that thinks is, let me make the case for that. Yeah, let me take the case for it&#39;s not a bad strategy.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s this immediate moment of crisis, right? This idea that healthcare is in a challenging place. The premiers were certainly elevating that argument going through. And so he gave a fairly nominal amount of money when you consider the size and scale of Canadian healthcare with no strings attached. hatched and then talked about money on the table to make deals with the premier set out a couple of foundations like it&#39;s got to be net new right we&#39;ve got to get more money into the health care system it can&#39;t be something where the feds increase the transfers in the provinces reduce in other places um and so that seems okay to me and it follows a model that was successful to him with child care right negotiate one by one pick off the provinces have the provinces that haven&#39;t made a deal yet, say, I really want that money. Why have you not gotten that money yet? Creates pressure on the premiers from their populations to get a deal with the feds. So that all kind of makes sense to me.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The thing that I think is potentially going to be a giant fucking challenge for him is he now has to negotiate all of these individual deals on healthcare. And it&#39;s not quite like, there are some very different dynamics at play than childcare. And I&#39;m not quite sure how how they&#39;re going to play out but the reality is as much as there&#39;s rhetoric around alberta being this like right-wing health care universe that&#39;s not the case there are provinces with far more private health care than alberta top of that list is quebec right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right and so now you&#39;re going to be in a weird situation where you either strike a deal with quebec that allows a certain amount of</span>

So in the overall scheme of things, that was a very well-executed week of communications for Trudeau. Now, Corey&#39;s position is that that may buy problems</span>

What about the play here, the timing with like Alberta going into an election soon and health care being I mean, we saw new polling from Abacus today.

And my bet, my money would be on this is worse for Trudeau, this is worse for Smith than it is for Trudeau. And Trudeau is just going to be waiting and waiting in politics. If you have the patience to wait in politics, it&#39;s often very, very powerful. Personally, I&#39;ve never had the patience to wait in politics, but for those who&#39;ve tried it, I&#39;m told it&#39;s quite, quite powerful.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not really sure I do. And it&#39;s simply for two reasons. One is it&#39;s not Danielle Smith versus Justin Trudeau in May in the spring election. It&#39;s Danielle Smith versus Rachel Notley. You were just talking about that abacus polling that showed health care as one of the two top issues in Alberta. And it&#39;s one that voters give the NDP a huge lead on in terms of the support. most of the list that abacus pulled on the ucp has the edge now they asked about the economy in about 12 i&#39;m exaggerating but in a few different ways right yeah but we can tell that they generally trust they being albertans generally trust the new democrats on health care on education on uh trying to deal with like equity gaps and and so that to me is ground that the ndp want to be on right which ultimately means if the salience of those issues rises it assists the NDP if the salience of those issues lowers and</span>

And I think that Corey&#39;s point, too, is correct that, you know, this is Notley&#39;s. Well, if Notley keeps the health care pressure on, it could be very well played to Notley&#39;s strength instead of it coming actually back and hurting her. So I think that this</span>

We haven&#39;t seen any revitalization in health care what&#39;s what&#39;s actually going on and i think that that&#39;s where danielle can actually get really hung up on this health care issue she&#39;s promised significant change she&#39;s delivered exactly zero and now she can&#39;t even now she can&#39;t even get free money from the feds especially if the other provinces start delivering free money from the feds like this could be a real problem for her carter</span>

            <span class="text">I think those numbers are totally irrelevant. And if the NDP are chasing them, they&#39;re going down a bad path. They need to be looking at what their accessible voters care about. It&#39;s not what, you know, Albertans as a whole think are the top issues. It&#39;s what the Albertans who are movable think are the top issues. And I think this is a trap that political parties fall into very, very quickly. And I&#39;m pretty sure that if you ask movable voters, you&#39;d find kind of some similar numbers. But, you know, step one is diagnose the problem in very specific terms. So you&#39;ve got a couple of swing ridings on the borders of Calgary. You&#39;ve got a couple of swing ridings in rural Alberta. You&#39;ve got to understand what their top issues are and the lenses through which they look at them. Because you&#39;re going to have a number of right-wing voters, for example, who say healthcare is, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, we agree healthcare is a problem, but our solution, our remedy is very different. Similarly, you&#39;re going to have people say, we agree affordability is a problem, but affordability probably means something very different to somebody who&#39;s got a family income of $150,000 and they&#39;re finding that they can&#39;t get the fifth wheel they want versus somebody who is living paycheck to paycheck at $15 an hour. So you got to have a little bit more, you got to dig into the issues a lot more than that. And I actually think this is one of these things that the NDP are going to have to be very careful about the UCP2 going forward in the next couple of months, which is you are going to have people waving these polls in front of your face and saying, see, act, see this, this is what people want you to talk about. But the two filters you always have to put this through is, that&#39;s great. We&#39;re not trying to win every voter in Alberta. We&#39;re trying to win the movable voters in Alberta. Those who are with us are with us. Those against us are against us. We care about the movable voters. And that&#39;s great. But just because an issue has salience doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good to us. And we&#39;ve got to identify where we have the strongest ground. and so if i&#39;m the ndp yeah i i you know i suspect despite all those words i just said you end up in a place not dissimilar from steven health care health care health care but i certainly want to make sure that i&#39;m confirming that and i certainly want to be thinking about it almost on a riding by riding basis not in not in kind of a very blanket sense boy</span>

This is about how it goes when you go through December. The last David Coletto poll came out, I think, in October, November, somewhere in there. And it was the one that they identified the reluctant UCP voters. And those ones had watched real shit go down in October, November, and into early December with the legislature, Danielle Smith, the mistakes that were made, the real on-the-field stuff.

So if you&#39;re going to be forcing people off of that land, then you&#39;ve got to have a really good case for support. and the case for support from the ndp over the last uh couple of months has been terrible i mean we tore them apart on the just transition uh we tore the you know i i tear them apart about having a lack of focus i mean i saw that again today um you know daniel smith has planned to put 20 billion dollars into uh oil and gas um you know cleaning up oil and gas wells out of our royalties out of our royalties royalties are albertans money for the resources that live under our our soil they&#39;re giving that away back to the companies that are making record profits um and and the</span>

Are they talking about 12 issues? Or are they actually just talking about the one, but we&#39;ve seen 12. And so we get frustrated.

And there&#39;s like a lot going on that I think reasonably you might think would be a drag on Danielle Smith&#39;s popularity, but we&#39;re not really seeing that. And I&#39;ll tell you right now, like 48-46 UCP, that is not an election, like you clearly are not winning there if you&#39;re the NDP because of where the votes are and the seats are.

            <span class="text">for anybody who&#39;s not familiar with it because carter kind of gave a treetop version is this idea that we would give up to 20 billion dollars in royalty breaks to companies to do something they are already legally required to do which is clean up their oil wells right once they&#39;re done with them and so it does seem to be like like what&#39;s the metaphor like Like, Stephen, I sell you my car and I say, but promise me that you won&#39;t speed and drive illegally on my street. And then you do. And I say, oh, hey, listen up, man. I&#39;m actually willing to give you all of the money back you gave me for the car if you actually now keep the word that you&#39;ve already committed to doing. Like, it&#39;s a bit bonkers. And the scale of money is so big, I think people get lost in it. But there&#39;s got to be a way you can pull that back to your message. Like, you want to talk about education? Well, that&#39;s 200 to 1,000 schools, depending on if you&#39;re talking K-3 or like high school schools. That&#39;s an enormous amount of money, $20 billion. How many physicians is that?

In some ways, I think those are the comps you need to draw, and those are the stories you need to tell. if you want to tell a story about health care and our star comes up yes i mean it it seems to me personally deeply egregious that we would pay such an unfathomable amount of money to get somebody to do something they&#39;re legally you know they have to do it like this is this is already a requirement of oil and gas companies so what&#39;s the point they also then they have record profits right now i like none of this makes any sense to me but maybe</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">brilliant product idea. Forget character limits. You can tweet once an hour. So make it count. That would be a hell of a product. You&#39;d have to sit and think about it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No way, man. What you&#39;ve got to do is you&#39;ve got to adapt the be real idea, and you&#39;ve got to tweet exactly when it asks you to tweet. And it happens once a day, and you don&#39;t know when it&#39;s going to happen. It happens once a day, and you have to tweet something right then.</span>
