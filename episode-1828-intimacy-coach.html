        <p>The gang check back in on their home province to talk chemtrails and transgender legislation. You know, just another week in Alberta. </p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Alberta Premier's apparent embrace of the "chemtrail" conspiracy theory and new legislation targeted towards transgender youth in Alberta. Will Danielle Smith's comments be any more disqualifying than a dozen other so-called disqualifying comments? Is the Alberta NDP engaged in a strategy of duelling videos with the UCP government? And what's the proper price to expense for an intimacy coach, anyhow? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

You&#39;ve got this false consensus effect where you assume everybody&#39;s going to react to things the same way you are.
