That&#39;s my view of it all. But I can&#39;t blame him. What&#39;s the harm? What&#39;s the downside? He&#39;s got that super partisan, super diehard crowd.

During the town hall, in response to an audience question where a member suggested that chemtrails were being sprayed over Edmonton, she said, quote, the best I have been able to do is talk to the woman who&#39;s responsible for controlling the airspace.

You&#39;ve got this false consensus effect where you assume everybody&#39;s going to react to things the same way you are.
