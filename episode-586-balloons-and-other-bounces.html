        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the end of the DNC/#DemsInPhilly and the fallout from Trump's no-good, very bad, horrible weekend. Is Donald Trump in the middle of a meltdown? Did the DNC deliver a message durable enough to take Clinton to November? And most importantly, what did we think of the lighting? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

We talked about Michelle Obama. We talked about a lot, actually, in terms of the precursor of DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, email hacks. But now let&#39;s get into what was night, I guess, three and four. But mainly, let&#39;s reverse engineer from what ended this convention. And let&#39;s talk largely about the optics, the stagecraft, the messaging, the tone, and then we&#39;ll get into individual speakers from there. So Corey, kick us off on what you thought, comparatively, of course as it relates to the broad notion of stagecraft of dnc as opposed to rnc and we&#39;ll start there yeah</div>

So they went with kind of like a pink instead of a red, a light blue, and instead of white, it was off-white. And you may have heard this phrase, pastel patriotism. So the Republicans really laid into them because they did this to the treatment of the American flag. And, you know, the red and the white and the blue there was all watered down, which was a bad optic. right this was an example of them taking the best thinking from television and trying to move it into a political convention generally speaking if you see it at a political convention it&#39;s probably been done at a corporate convention for four years because nobody wants to make those kind of mistakes again to</div>

You can expect the conventions to give you the best of the tried, tested, and true. And that is because to a point Stephen made a few episodes ago, I&#39;m always accused of never giving him credit. But to a point a few episodes ago, this is millions of dollars of free advertising for them. This is on the networks. This is on the cable channels. This is everywhere. And they need this to look perfect. This is like the Oscars times a billion. They&#39;re making sure that they have the best people stage managing that thing. And generally speaking, they do a very good job. They have contingencies. If something screws up, it&#39;s fixed so quickly, the viewer at home is not likely to see it.</div>

Maybe answer this question first.

But they also made the messiness of the DNC with the Bernie Sanders people and all of that. And they embraced it. Right? And they said, that&#39;s democracy, baby. That&#39;s how it works. I mean, the way that they took these things that could have really be taken as big negatives and put them in the window like that was by no means a safe strategy. It was definitely gutsy. Right? You could have easily made the convention instead about trying to keep all of the Sanders negativity as far away from cameras as possible. They didn&#39;t do that. You could have easily made all of your speakers focus pretty much entirely on Donald Trump, which I have said on this podcast, I think the more you keep it on Trump, the better it&#39;s going to be for Hillary Clinton. But instead, they opened the field and they made it not just about his crazy policies, but his general approach.
