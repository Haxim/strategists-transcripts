            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">another great start court is what you wanted we start really slow we also end really badly okay so we&#39;ve discussed i guess what you&#39;d call the first night of DNC. We talked about Michelle Obama. We talked about a lot, actually, in terms of the precursor of DNC, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, email hacks. But now let&#39;s get into what was night, I guess, three and four. But mainly, let&#39;s reverse engineer from what ended this convention. And let&#39;s talk largely about the optics, the stagecraft, the messaging, the tone, and then we&#39;ll get into individual speakers from there. So Corey, kick us off on what you thought, comparatively, of course as it relates to the broad notion of stagecraft of dnc as opposed to rnc and we&#39;ll start there yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah and we should probably mention we have a little bit more the benefit of hindsight and seeing how the analysis and the analysis the analysis has gone because the convention ended on thursday we&#39;re now recording on a monday um the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the stagecraft was comparable i think in in In most of the setting senses, you know, they had the big stage. They had the animated screen behind. Yeah, actually,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">actually, I think the set could have been almost identical from my point of view. It was just so overwhelming, these kind of huge screens. So red</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">red and blue, yeah. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, and oh my goodness, flags, flags, flags.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">They did this weird thing with like this metallic pattern at the Democrats behind them, but I still prefer that to the phony American flags behind Trump&#39;s. What</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">What would make for, you know, what is the bar on stagecraft, right? At what point would your guys&#39; comments have been, that was weird or that was ridiculous? Both of you were like, eh, negligible, fine. What&#39;s kind of the bar that you&#39;re looking for? What are some of the metrics that you&#39;re looking for on StageCraft that maybe people just don&#39;t process right away but could be awkward in certain senses?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, first and foremost, if you&#39;re going to have a big digital screen behind you, you don&#39;t want it to turn off or accidentally show Triumph of the Will or anything like that. uh you want to make sure that everything is technically moving along as it should and with a few minor exceptions at the gop convention that that was the case you managed to get</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">relatively flawless technical performances i&#39;m sure during the day there were probably glitches we didn&#39;t see what for prime time they kept it together again except for one of donald trump&#39;s sons they all they&#39;re all the same to me one</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one of his sons was up there and the screen behind wasn&#39;t working but other than that they were all fine as far as like a top you know blow you out of the water yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s pretty tough to do when you&#39;re so the challenge is zane that you you want to play it pretty safe with these things because you don&#39;t want to be you know they call it the cutting edge because you might cut yourself and the problem</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">problem is political conventions don&#39;t like to to push it very far and that goes back to a couple of high profile gaffes that they&#39;ve had so in 1988 the The Democratic Convention, knowing a little bit about television and production and all that, wanted to go with a softer palette. So they went with kind of like a pink instead of a red, a light blue, and instead of white, it was off-white. And you may have heard this phrase, pastel patriotism. So the Republicans really laid into them because they did this to the treatment of the American flag. And, you know, the red and the white and the blue there was all watered down, which was a bad optic. right this was an example of them taking the best thinking from television and trying to move it into a political convention generally speaking if you see it at a political convention it&#39;s probably been done at a corporate convention for four years because nobody wants to make those kind of mistakes again to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">to to cory&#39;s point carter and i don&#39;t want to dwell too long on this but i find this personally quite interesting is stagecraft one of those things where you can only lose points for it where there&#39;s not many points to be gained for doing it i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i don&#39;t know i mean i think that really well executed stagecraft really just makes the experience a lot better yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um being what we&#39;re talking about with uh the primary speaker so so imagine yourself having two different objectives okay number one is the primary speaker needs to be able to be seen and understood in a grand context on television right on</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">which is very important yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah so so there needs to be something that is visually interesting for tv and the other one is uh the the people in the hall so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so one of the things that i think is interesting is i think that the project the production values in the united states are so much better they&#39;re using a lot better equipment like if you saw the same type of thing in canada you&#39;d generally be looking at a projection screen right so a rear projection screen would probably be the time of the the technology that we&#39;re using and and it fades it looks very weak it&#39;s very um the the color of the screen uh never really leaps i think they were using lcd projections lcd projection screens at both of these conventions and the difference is having a real television behind you or having like a projected image behind you you know like what you get off of uh one of those projectors that we do a million presentations yeah this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">was a fantastic high quality image</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">image that was being projected both both behind Trump and behind Hillary Clinton. To Corey&#39;s point, neither of them stepped very far outside of the expected. You know, the podium was center stage. The graphics were very few risks.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a couple of things that we do in Canadian politics that they don&#39;t do. Like in Canadian politics, we almost always have the screens too low. The screens are invariably cut off by the head of the primary speaker. Those are the types of things that you&#39;re at. To your</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is it losing points? Yeah, you lose points when you do that. And almost every Canadian production does that because we don&#39;t</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t spend as much money. The</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The amount of money they spend is literally in the millions. Those are custom sets that they&#39;re building in each case. You can expect the conventions to give you the best of the tried, tested, and true. And that is because to a point Stephen made a few episodes ago, I&#39;m always accused of never giving him credit. But to a point a few episodes ago, this is millions of dollars of free advertising for them. This is on the networks. This is on the cable channels. This is everywhere. And they need this to look perfect. This is like the Oscars times a billion. They&#39;re making sure that they have the best people stage managing that thing. And generally speaking, they do a very good job. They have contingencies. If something screws up, it&#39;s fixed so quickly, the viewer at home is not likely to see it.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, you know, when we discussed the RNC, we talked about this at length, and I want to get into it here for the DNC, which was the story arc. What was the story that each convention needed to tell upon its culmination of Thursday night? So we discussed night one. We discussed the precursor in the context leading into it. Maybe answer this question first. Do you feel like they nailed the story that they needed to, and more specifically, what was the story they needed to kind of hit? or what was the story they needed to tell that culminated on thursday well</span>

And I mean, I think that Hillary&#39;s speech, for example, took, you know, if you look at Hillary Clinton&#39;s speech, that risked being the entire convention, but they didn&#39;t they didn&#39;t fall into that trap. So the Hillary Clinton speech, I&#39;m a woman, I, you know, I take this.

But they also made the messiness of the DNC with the Bernie Sanders people and all of that. And they embraced it. Right? And they said, that&#39;s democracy, baby. That&#39;s how it works. I mean, the way that they took these things that could have really be taken as big negatives and put them in the window like that was by no means a safe strategy. It was definitely gutsy. Right? You could have easily made the convention instead about trying to keep all of the Sanders negativity as far away from cameras as possible. They didn&#39;t do that. You could have easily made all of your speakers focus pretty much entirely on Donald Trump, which I have said on this podcast, I think the more you keep it on Trump, the better it&#39;s going to be for Hillary Clinton. But instead, they opened the field and they made it not just about his crazy policies, but his general approach.
