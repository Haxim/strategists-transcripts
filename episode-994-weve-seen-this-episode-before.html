But we&#39;ve actually been able to go deep into the state media and get a preview of a Friday show that you&#39;re going to be appearing on.

Certainly not going to work again in Ontario. But people see things they like and they want to repurpose them. And I actually don&#39;t fault them for that. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a need to be absolutely original on every single situation.

And I hesitate to say true tactic because its success is varied. But we saw it in the last episode we recorded. Did we not talk about Hail Marys? Did we not talk about last minute, fourth and 20 Aaron Rodgers style throws? Well, OK, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d classify the leaked memo strategy, Carter. as that, but we now have two leaked memos. We have one from the Liberals, which is a memo written by their pollster or by a polling firm. I don&#39;t know if it is their pollster, our good friend Dan Arnold, in a memo indicating how the Liberals can maintain forward to a minority. It acknowledges some truths about them being double digits behind, but there&#39;s a strategic play to maintain a minority. And then Corey, the NDP leaked memo is less a leaked memo. It&#39;s more so a, if I&#39;m not not mistaken, a redux of the Mulcair campaign 2015 saying, you know, the NDP have the best opportunity to win in this riding. Here&#39;s what it looks like. It shows like a graph of red. It shows a graph of orange. If you collapse here, orange is going to take the day, that sort of thing.</div>

When you&#39;re T minus three, four days, soak time for the public is negligible unless it&#39;s a massive story. A lot of people have already voted. How do you ride the clock out effectively? I mean, I could have asked that question three weeks ago for Doug Ford because he&#39;s been doing it. But anything special to consider as you ride out the clock in, let&#39;s say, the final 72 hours, the final 100 hours of the campaign?

Like, talk to me about like scope and scale. And then I also want to talk about cost. Carter said it doesn&#39;t cost as much, but also like the entry fee in certain leadership races for example a federal one i think could be half a million dollars in certain cases so talk to me about what you feel like as it relates to what&#39;s a good visual representation for them on stage more or less and then like where would you set the entry fee for something like this so</div>

Established parties such as WestJet, of course, they would love to strangle Flair and just leave it dead on the side of the road before it can get going anywhere. Their demands are deeply unreasonable, right? Right. Meanwhile, if you&#39;re Flair, of course, you&#39;d like to be able to do what you want and break all of the regulations and play this New England Patriots. Oh, I just misinterpreted the rules bullshit. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t know that you actually meant Canadian ownership when you said Canadian ownership are bad. Right.</div>
