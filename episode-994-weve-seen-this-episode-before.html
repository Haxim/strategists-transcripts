But I do want to give a shout-out to this podcast&#39;s own Stephen Carter, who will be appearing on West of Center. And, in fact, Carter, you know, West of Center is a CBC podcast hosted by Kathleen Petty. They generally don&#39;t release previews. But we&#39;ve actually been able to go deep into the state media and get a preview of a Friday show that you&#39;re going to be appearing on. Corey, can you play that? quickly for us this is of course a quick preview of stephen carter who will be on west of center uh this week with janet brown and and david hurley uh cory go ahead please let</span>

I want to campaign on issues. And then you had just the general public trying to hide from such cringeworthy content. Pretty,</span>

The message they&#39;re trying to send is show up and debate us. What are you afraid of? Stop being so chicken to debate us. Stop not showing up to community debates, candidate X, candidate Y of the PC party. What do you make of that tactic? And it&#39;s clearly, you know, a reference to some West Wing episode, I believe, in the latter seasons, Carter. But</span>

Certainly not going to work again in Ontario. But people see things they like and they want to repurpose them. And I actually don&#39;t fault them for that. I don&#39;t think that there&#39;s a need to be absolutely original on every single situation. But what&#39;s important is you deconstruct it with enough sophistication that you say, this tactic worked for these reasons and we have all of those reasons available to us.</span>

And I hesitate to say true tactic because its success is varied. But we saw it in the last episode we recorded. Did we not talk about Hail Marys? Did we not talk about last minute, fourth and 20 Aaron Rodgers style throws? Well, OK, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d classify the leaked memo strategy, Carter. as that, but we now have two leaked memos. We have one from the Liberals, which is a memo written by their pollster or by a polling firm. I don&#39;t know if it is their pollster, our good friend Dan Arnold, in a memo indicating how the Liberals can maintain forward to a minority. It acknowledges some truths about them being double digits behind, but there&#39;s a strategic play to maintain a minority. And then Corey, the NDP leaked memo is less a leaked memo. It&#39;s more so a, if I&#39;m not not mistaken, a redux of the Mulcair campaign 2015 saying, you know, the NDP have the best opportunity to win in this riding. Here&#39;s what it looks like. It shows like a graph of red. It shows a graph of orange. If you collapse here, orange is going to take the day, that sort of thing.</span>

Like we&#39;ve got, and I don&#39;t want to get into another deep dive on strategy, but there is something to be said around strategy or lack thereof. When you&#39;re T minus three, four days, soak time for the public is negligible unless it&#39;s a massive story. A lot of people have already voted. How do you ride the clock out effectively? I mean, I could have asked that question three weeks ago for Doug Ford because he&#39;s been doing it. But anything special to consider as you ride out the clock in, let&#39;s say, the final 72 hours, the final 100 hours of the campaign? Anything you need to do as a frontrunner that any traps to not fall into or any engagements to not take as we round this out? And then, of course, I&#39;ll get you to predict Carter.</span>

            <span class="text">Right. If you don&#39;t call your general, like if you want to have an option of calling a snap after the election, you&#39;ve got to have the leadership over in early September, the end of September at the absolute latest, so that that leader can come in and say, I need a new mandate. Boom. boom, we&#39;re going to the polls. And I think that&#39;s the only way that you can keep the party together. Because if it&#39;s Danielle Smith that wins, half the party is going to want to leave, right? And that half the party that&#39;s going to leave isn&#39;t given that opportunity if you go to a snap.

Like, talk to me about like scope and scale. And then I also want to talk about cost. Carter said it doesn&#39;t cost as much, but also like the entry fee in certain leadership races for example a federal one i think could be half a million dollars in certain cases so talk to me about what you feel like as it relates to what&#39;s a good visual representation for them on stage more or less and then like where would you set the entry fee for something like this so</span>
