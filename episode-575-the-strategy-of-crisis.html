        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan reveal the review contest winners (0:00) and then jump into the politics of the Fort McMurray fire (10:30). How is a politician supposed to act in a crisis? What's the role of corporations and charities? And why do all the rules go out the window in times of disaster? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Why? look he talks the most which is entirely too much listen if you only get through four or five episodes you probably won&#39;t even know who steven and zane are look if you want to hear zane and steven you could probably get through the podcast in about four minutes listen it&#39;s a great podcast but could be a whole bit less better but still give her a download oh</div>

Say, for example, that Premier Notley had done so poorly at the start of this Fort McMurray fire that people were ignoring government recommendations, what to do. There was a sense government was lying to them. There was mistrust around there. You can&#39;t have that. And it may sound like an extreme example, but it&#39;s really not.

So if your company has fucked up, you&#39;re going to be familiar with some of these principles. Yeah, they are. Keep the doors open because otherwise people will go through the windows. They&#39;ll peer through. They may misinterpret something. Only communicate what you know for a fact. Do not speculate. Do not start going into broad conjectures and try to limit the scope of your conversation to the issue at hand. You do not want to sort of broaden it needlessly, right? right? There are more, but I think those are sort of the key ones in this context. It&#39;s very important that government is being concise, being factual, and probably goes without saying to say they need to be open. Because if people start getting the sense government&#39;s not sharing, that&#39;s when you start to get wild speculation.</div>

People rally around political leadership in times of crises and they&#39;re more willing to cut them some slack.
