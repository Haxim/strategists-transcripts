That&#39;s nice how you tugged at our heartstrings. See how I did that? The calculated, hard-hearted, no-nonsense Stephen Carter is a Canadian jewel. Nicely balanced out by the emotion-led, spineless, in a bag for the NDP drivel of comrade Corey Hogan.</span>

Why? look he talks the most which is entirely too much listen if you only get through four or five episodes you probably won&#39;t even know who steven and zane are look if you want to hear zane and steven you could probably get through the podcast in about four minutes listen it&#39;s a great podcast but could be a whole bit less better but still give her a download oh</span>

And the fact of the matter is you can make a situation worse if there&#39;s not clear lines of communication and if there&#39;s a mistrust in government. Say, for example, that Premier Notley had done so poorly at the start of this Fort McMurray fire that people were ignoring government recommendations, what to do. There was a sense government was lying to them. There was mistrust around there. You can&#39;t have that. And it may sound like an extreme example, but it&#39;s really not.

But what the political leadership has to do is ultimately stay out of the way and be that communicator in chief unless there is some sort of division between their experts and a decision has to be made. Now, you try to avoid making those decisions because, frankly, it&#39;s better that the experts make them if there is somebody in an area of expertise that can oversee that. But, look, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">These principles are pretty common, not just to crises like this, but all crisis communications. So if your company has fucked up, you&#39;re going to be familiar with some of these principles. Yeah, they are. Keep the doors open because otherwise people will go through the windows. They&#39;ll peer through. They may misinterpret something. Only communicate what you know for a fact. Do not speculate. Do not start going into broad conjectures and try to limit the scope of your conversation to the issue at hand. You do not want to sort of broaden it needlessly, right? right? There are more, but I think those are sort of the key ones in this context. It&#39;s very important that government is being concise, being factual, and probably goes without saying to say they need to be open. Because if people start getting the sense government&#39;s not sharing, that&#39;s when you start to get wild speculation.</span>

And most of the time, it seems to me that politicians understand it and they&#39;re sensitive enough to the issues that it goes in their favor. Sounds funny, but it&#39;s kind of a rallying thing. People rally around political leadership in times of crises and they&#39;re more willing to cut them some slack.
