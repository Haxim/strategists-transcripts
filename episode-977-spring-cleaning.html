Corey, whether they need a damp cloth to wipe it down, or do they need a deep clean? And you&#39;re going to tell me why, based on a cocktail of things, which includes strategy, messaging, their personnel that could be elected and and unelected, their direction, and the issues they&#39;re focused and prioritized on.

I don&#39;t disagree, but I would actually phrase it differently because it is about foundationally, what are you trying to do?

You&#39;ve got to get the cobwebs out of there, but you&#39;re not going to be able to do it with a brush alone. You&#39;re going to have to get in there with some suction action because ultimately I think that the liberals have a problem where they can&#39;t really decide – well, I&#39;ll put it this way. Why did they care so much? Why did they so desperately want this deal with the NDP, right? It&#39;s because that they&#39;re – they did the thing to get the thing. They had the election to try to get the majority and they didn&#39;t get it.

And part of it seems to be maybe exhaustion. And this is where I say they got to get the cobwebs out. They got to get, you know, some sort of deep-rooted, like, suction on everything that&#39;s going on that&#39;s somewhat holding them back and making them feel old and stale. So the Libs need to really, really kind of find their spring again in their step. And I guess my fear for them with this deal is that this deal was in many ways a victory for the Liberals and that gets them to 2025. As you mentioned, it&#39;s very popular. popular. It is very much reinforcing of what we were saying last week, which is the Conservatives saying, look at this scary coalition, probably not going to work that well, because most Canadians say, yeah, good. I mean, like, I generally support both parties or like a plurality, if not a majority. And so I&#39;m fine with this, right? But where to from here? Where to from here? Obviously, there&#39;s still a lot to do. There&#39;s an agenda to be assigned here. You can&#39;t declare victory yet. You&#39;ve got to actually deliver on these things. It is a robust policy agenda. It is a robust regulatory agenda. But it kind of feels like you&#39;re fighting for the thing you wanted last year. And it&#39;s consistent with, I think, a general malaise within the Liberal Party, which I feel so dumb saying it because it&#39;s not fair and they continue to do things.

And maybe I&#39;ll kind of tee it up with a broader sort of notion that you&#39;ve brought up in the past, which is around the fears of Pierre Polyever, you had this quote, which you said, sometimes people just get sick and tired of their government. They just get sick and tired of the current whatever it is. And I guess the question at the heart of what, or the notion at the heart of my question is, can the liberals own a different version of liberal for the next iteration, so that when the Canadian public gets tired of this leftward march, they&#39;re are also owning the center simultaneously, that they&#39;ve built up two poles at the same time in the same time? Is that idealistic? Is that crazy? How do they kind of ensure that they&#39;re not giving up the future of what you&#39;ve been saying, the gray zone of the Liberal Party or the center with this current iteration of it?</span>

And in part, it was because there were those two strong poles in the Liberal Party. And you would have a bit of a drift between them. There was always almost a party within the party in waiting that would take over the major infrastructure and then repurpose</span>

That&#39;s been true for basically three elections at this point. Arguably, in 2015, the liberals were further left than the NDP on many things.

Carter, what advice would you have, and I know this is broad, to these movements that now find themselves, hey, perhaps for the first time, have the full attention of the government? The government&#39;s got the credit card out saying, what exactly do you need? I&#39;m ready to swipe. What advice do you have for them now with this deal that&#39;s in place? How much importance, for example, should they be putting on the NDP? Is there anything they need to hold back or consider differently when they find themselves kind of in the moment in some ways? Pharmacare is finding itself in the moment, dental care. I mean, all these movements kind of weirdly, almost simultaneously are having a movement together.

That&#39;s not going to be the same situation with pharmacare and dental care, because they&#39;re going to have much larger lobby groups standing up and saying, I&#39;m sorry, but if you do this to pharmaceuticals, you are going to undermine the central premise of pharmacies and pharmaceuticals, and that is research and development and developing the next generation of drugs.

If that&#39;s the actual case, it&#39;s going to be a very, very expensive program, but it&#39;s not going to get implemented like that.

Would you be advising, if those were your clients, what would you be advising them in this mushy middle period where, let&#39;s say, two to one ratio of Canadians support this disagreement support the underlying headline principles in some way how are you kind of and this is taking us from away from the spring cleaning guys but how are you uh how</span>

Or, you know, like what we would normally get on our dental plan at work, right, or our pharmaceutical plan at work, we&#39;re going to make sure that that&#39;s covered off. And that happens. Already we have Blue Cross and a number of other programs for less affluent people, but there&#39;s a tremendous number of people caught in the middle between these programs.</span>

What advice and cautionary tales would you have for them? And then what you may kind of see in the coming weeks and months? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Carter fumbled towards my point at the end of his comments there. It&#39;s really about the size of the pie, right? Like the reason childcare was so popular with childcare operators is because it expanded the number of spaces. It expanded the pie. pie. And as a result, there was the ability to create winners across the board, right? Just more money in the system for more childcare options. People are talking about how long it&#39;s going to take to ramp up these spaces. There&#39;s an expectation there&#39;ll be far more demand for childcare. And that&#39;s great if you&#39;re an operator and you can really make that work. When you&#39;re talking about pharmacare and when you&#39;re talking about dental care, the pie ain&#39;t getting that much bigger, right? There are going to be non-government winners and losers. And if the The government is going to run a program like that. It is the things that Stephen&#39;s talked about. The government&#39;s either going to want to stick to generics and save money, and you&#39;re going to have the Pfizer&#39;s of the world furious and saying you&#39;re destroying R&amp;D, or they&#39;re not, and in which case they&#39;re going to be paying through the nose for these treatments. And either way, you&#39;re going to have people say, why isn&#39;t this novel treatment covered? Things that we put up with begrudgingly from private insurers, we would say that&#39;s an absolute injustice if it was a government insurer doing it. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And things could get a lot more expensive, a lot rockier, and it is much more fraught with peril. Like, here be dragons when it comes to pharmacare in particular. Dental care, I don&#39;t know enough about the data underneath it. I probably should, given my wife&#39;s line of work. But, you know, the possibility of expanding the pie there is probably more significant than it is on pharmacare, would be my guess.</span>

It&#39;s where they&#39;re hanging out. And it&#39;s who they&#39;re hanging out with. So the Conservative Party of Canada does fundamentally need to decide what they&#39;re going to do and where they&#39;re going to be. And of course, that&#39;s what a leadership contest is for. And so we get to see how this all plays out. But put</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re in for some weird times in this country. And it&#39;s not so much that I have a big problem with where the liberals are going, for example, but I do worry that you&#39;re going to get into a situation like in the States where they just they flip governments and they undo everything. And we got a bit of a show of what a right-wing government might do in that context in 2019 when the UCP came in and did their big repeal bills and undid effectively everything they thought they could from the preceding four years of NDP government. If that becomes the norm, and if that becomes the norm at the federal level, I mean, it&#39;s going to be tough to get a lot of things done, and it&#39;s going to be tough on citizens and the chaos of it, and you&#39;re not going to move the ball forward. And then if it flips back, you&#39;re going to have similar challenges, and you&#39;re going to lose confidence in these programs, and a child care operator is not going to want to make the investments for child care spots they think might be going away in three years and whatnot. And I think in general, societies tend to undervalue stability when they think about government and governing parties. And what we&#39;re setting up right now is a situation that basically screams instability. You&#39;re going to have situations that are going to be rough on the system as a whole. And so I think to pull back to the conservatives here, we need them to do their part in this. We need them to move back towards the center because they have gone really quite a field on the right here. or the way they play footsie with the PPC. I mean, literally, let&#39;s just again state it plainly because we get so used to it, we&#39;re like frogs in water. We had MPs literally saying the government should meet with a bunch of people occupying the Capitol demanding that an election be overturned, right? It&#39;s as simple as that. It&#39;s fucking bonkers shit. And we need everybody to kind of come back to ground here.</span>

From your perspective in terms of what you&#39;ve seen thus far, Doug Ford, today on the heels of signing a childcare agreement, what does this party need?

They&#39;ve been unable to rebuild themselves in kind of the NDP style of Alberta and British Columbia where we&#39;ve seen a kind of renaissance in the NDP. And it&#39;s in no small part because they seem to have – the NDP seem to have a loyalty to the leaders and it&#39;s on the one hand admirable. That loyalty to the leaders is a, you</span>

Either one of them needs to get the other one down on the mat, right, and just gather that support, or they need to find a way to work together. Because right now, what you&#39;ve got is a situation where you&#39;ve got perpetual governing by a minority who end up with majority of the seats because of the way the splits are going down. Yeah, so it&#39;s got to be frustrating if you&#39;re a progressive in Ontario. And so, yeah, phone a friend, figure it out, work together, try to get the big job done together.</span>

That&#39;s evidence in Jason Kenney&#39;s support numbers, obviously, some assist by Jason Kenney himself on that particular one and some of the decisions that the UCP have made. but uh you you&#39;ve torn these guys down as far as you&#39;re going to be able to tear them down and we&#39;re going to be coming into a situation of very big surpluses in alberta you&#39;re going to have</span>

I mean, ultimately, I think Albertans are a fairly aspirational people, almost to the point of delusion, if we&#39;re going to be totally blunt about it. And you need to be able to tell a story about what the economy of Alberta is going to look like in 2060, 2070, 2080. People, this is not what the NDP are offering, but you&#39;ve got to be clear that you&#39;re not offering just the managed decline of the province of Alberta as oil and gas fades away. You&#39;ve got to tell a story about the next Alberta and how we&#39;re going to continue to be an economic powerhouse in whatever future is to come. And for me, that&#39;s often what&#39;s missing for the Alberta NDP. It is telling that story about the next Alberta. And so I hope to hear more about that as we start moving towards an election here. Because ultimately, it&#39;s that marketing element, that fresh coat of paint, where you take what are, I think fundamental ideas that the NDP have about the future, and you put them in front of Albertans in a way so that when they&#39;re driving down 92nd Street, you see that big sports logo on the side, you know exactly</span>

If you are trying to be a party that is, for example, about the future, right? Do you have the right number of youth candidates? If you&#39;re trying to be a party that is about entrepreneurialism, do you have any entrepreneurial candidates? Or is it just something you say that just becomes meaningless boilerplate absent any activity on this? You want to talk about a future beyond oil and gas? Do you have people who can really speak to that? Or are you really leaning more on the oil and gas thing? and so all parties sort of struggle with this because the reality is you&#39;ve got to take what you&#39;ve got to a certain extent but there has to be a certain amount of push and you got to be thinking about how</span>

            <span class="text">here&#39;s the thing there&#39;s a lot of things we need to figure out with blockchain right and it&#39;s one of those technologies people wave around and they they can talk about um you know the proof of work that that allows us bitcoin and all</span>

            <span class="text">of the Yeah. Well, so here&#39;s the idiot&#39;s short version, grossly simplified. When you make a Bitcoin transaction, that is validated by everybody having the same chain of transactions. And you encourage people to update that chain by incentivizing them through, they do work, just kind of pointless calculations that are increasingly more complex. If you happen to do one that results in a number below a certain threshold, that threshold is ever changing, then you get a Bitcoin and that&#39;s worth a ton of money, right? So that&#39;s how it works here. But it takes a lot of energy. It&#39;s computationally very, very expensive. And so we&#39;re at a point where the technologies that people currently think about, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, they&#39;re using more power than modest sized countries already. And it&#39;s easy to say, well, look at Canada, we have so much hydropower, we use nuclear in Ontario, we have wind power and PEI, whatever it may be, and say, well, you got some clean power sources. But the reality is that&#39;s power that we could still be put into productive uses if we weren&#39;t running computers pointlessly</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">pointlessly in order to do Bitcoin transactions. Now, there are alternatives for managing blockchain that have to do with proof of stake, and we don&#39;t need to get into all of that. There are environmentally friendly ways that you can approach these challenges, but we&#39;re not sort of there yet. And to see politicians jumping on board of this thing that we know even now where it&#39;s still relatively niche is deeply unsustainable is – there&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a fundamentals thing that it just fails here. It fails on the fundamental level. This is not something that&#39;s scalable for the entire world. We will not be doing financial transactions this way, or we will all die because we will choke out this planet. So I would be a little more comfortable if I thought that there was any kind of nuance or thought about where this could be or what Canada could do besides offer quote unquote clean power, because we have clean power, right? Right. But that&#39;s power that we could be using to offset coal from Virginia or coal from Alberta, frankly, if we had the proper inner ties. So I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t like it very much, Zane, I guess is what I&#39;m going to say. But I don&#39;t like it in the same way. I don&#39;t like a lot of dumb things politicians say without them having very much knowledge of what it actually means.</span>

            <span class="text">the blockchain, it makes me nervous. It is something that exists in their economy.

I&#39;m not sure I want to follow that lead.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a fad yet. It could very well be a fad. It certainly feels a little ephemeral, right? And what are you really buying? But to your point, that&#39;s if you really want to get down to a true of a lot of things that we possess and what is the value of a diamond, for example. So just because something is digital doesn&#39;t make me discount it. But I agree with Stephen 100% on the idea of do we really want governments picking winners and losers here anyhow? I mean, let&#39;s see where this goes. If there is a market case for it, people will get there. But I also think we&#39;ve got to watch out for those externalities. If we ran our economy on Bitcoin, and listen, Bitcoin is just one thing within a kind of a broader bucket of things called blockchain solutions here. Are we prepared for the consequences of that? Are we prepared for the environmental consequences for that? Are we prepared for the regulatory consequences of that? I mean, this is still something that is used by a lot of bad actors in a lot of different ways. And then there are even kind of just sort of like efficiency and convenience ones. And look, Bitcoin tends to be thought of as like a gold alternative, right? Most of the world is not using Bitcoin for day-to-day transactions, even when we say like Ecuador is doing it.</span>

We learned today that Jason Kenney earlier this year in February was interviewed by the ICMP in the criminal probe tied to his party leadership race back in 2017. We don&#39;t know much more than that. So I&#39;m curious to get your take. Is this overrated piece of information in isolation? Or is this underrated piece of information? As we know it right now, based on all the discrete sort of pieces that have come out thus far about the ICMP investigation? Yeah,</span>

I feel it would have occurred much earlier in the investigation. But you save it for later in the investigation when you want to get everybody else&#39;s story first and you want to almost box the person in or understand or know they may be a potential suspect in this and that you might be bringing charges against them. Because, you know, some of it has to do, there&#39;s so much reported on this in the context of Trump, but are there people that you want to quote unquote flip on Jason Kenney saying, if you cooperate with us, it&#39;s all good.
