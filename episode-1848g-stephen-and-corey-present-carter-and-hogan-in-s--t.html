          <p>Neither Zain, nor Annalise nor the Liberal leadership hopefuls are available to host tonight, so Stephen and Corey take the opportunity to dive into one of the most explosive allegations to hit Alberta politics in years. Which is really saying something. Let's dive in.</p><blockquote><p><em>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the allegations of major scandal at Alberta Health Services. What's to be made of Smith's statement on the matter? What's to be made of the NDP response? Can Carter avoid "false, baseless and defamatory" commentary? Zain Velji isn't here and neither is Annalise Klingbeil. Giddy up.</em></p></blockquote>
