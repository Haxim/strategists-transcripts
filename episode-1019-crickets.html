It then is followed up. This is, by the way, a fucking train wreck, Corey. This is great. It is then, of course, followed up.

So you, of course, eulogize them. And then, of course, we play some holiday games, some holiday cheer that, of course, will be coming up whenever we decide it, so more than likely in February, whereas the strategist holiday spectacular, which will probably hold in February at some point. Corey, we&#39;ll wait for Carter, but let&#39;s just move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, lonely and not so sovereign. We have to talk about it. We have to continue talking about it, Corey, because it is the story, it is the gift that keeps on giving, the Sovereignty Act. Corey, Danielle Smith and her government are now clarifying, they&#39;re now saying that, listen, that we have shifted the rationale for introducing the Sovereignty Act, which was penned initially by opposition parties, of course, but by some key stakeholders in business, opinion leaders, by conservatives on the national stage saying this is not what conservatives do. It was characterized as being unconstitutional and overreach of its own kind on the powers that it granted cabinet ministers. Now, Danielle Smith and her UCP government are going to propose amendments, which they&#39;ve already introduced as changes to the legislature to the power to direct cabinet, which is kind of being reversed now. Corey, let&#39;s talk about this saga. And let&#39;s talk about it through this concept we talk about quite often in our podcast, which is this concept of doubling down. They&#39;ve doubled down on this legislation, but they&#39;ve also kind of redirected it. And so I want to ask you from a pure strategy perspective, the play here that they had was to say, let&#39;s keep these unchecked powers, so to speak, double down on this 100%. Let&#39;s just go down the road. The other thing was a full sort of reversal. Sorry, we&#39;re going to do a reversal on a few things. But they&#39;ve chosen this middle ground, Corey. They&#39;ve doubled down on the cadence, the tone, the assertiveness. They&#39;ve taken out an ad campaign. They&#39;re defending the Sovereignty Act. They&#39;re going hard in the paint on it while still proposing these amendments. Talk to me about the strategy you see? And is this strategy, is this the strategy you would have chosen after the week Daniel Smith had upon introducing this legislation to the province and to the country by large?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it&#39;s like Daniel Smith is kind of, you know, the wint tweet, like, I&#39;m not owned, I&#39;m not owned, he said, you know, as he shriveled away.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It kind of has that energy, right? It&#39;s this idea of we&#39;re not retreating, we&#39;re going harder than ever. And they are trying to run these two strategies at the same time, the idea that there&#39;s absolutely nothing to see here, Nothing was wrong. Nothing was wrong whatsoever. But also, let&#39;s fundamentally change the way this act is presented. And so I think fair criticism of people to say, what are they actually doing here? This is ridiculous. They&#39;re trying to run a communication strategy, but they fundamentally surrendered on the main bill. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the cabinet getting those kinds of powers. I think that was never the point of the bill for them. So in</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, we remain steadfast in being aggressive to the feds. People didn&#39;t like this other part, but we didn&#39;t really care about that other part anyhow, so we&#39;re just going to pull it out. But we&#39;re not pulling the bill. And so in some ways, they&#39;re trying to fix a tactical error with tactics, but they have not fundamentally changed their strategy, which is to proceed with this particular bill. Carter,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, can you do that? Can you say, I&#39;m going to go hard in the paint on the communications, the aggressiveness, the volume that they&#39;re promoting the Sovereignty Act as the solution to all that ails Alberta, even going against Rachel Notley and the NDP, going against Trudeau, going against everyone who criticizes it while simultaneously proposing amendments? Can this work would you advise it no</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">no i mean this is bill one it is the it is not a long bill uh cory was actually able to read the whole thing without getting flummoxed or stuck on any of the big words so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so but to change it to to decide like the the two major pieces two major pieces of a a lot of four piece legislation four page piece of legislation legislation needs to be changed, is backing down quite a bit. On top of that, I mean, did you watch Tyler Shandro, Minister of Justice, tap dance his way through the press conference where he tried not to concede that it was a massive mistake to move forward with elements of this bill? I mean, come on. This is a joke. They know it&#39;s a joke. No one has the internal internal fortitude to stand up to it and now they all look like a bunch of idiots um the critique it doesn&#39;t matter how much they change it it&#39;s still going to be defined remember when we said it&#39;s going to be always called the sovereignty act it&#39;s not going to be called the sovereignty and you know your</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s i think that&#39;s That&#39;s true. I think that&#39;s true. But here&#39;s one thing. You recall kind of the conversation we had last time where I said they probably were a little concerned going into this that people thought the bill was not strong enough, right? And so they had to find a way to make it look tough, because fundamentally, it&#39;s not a bill that says anything.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">anything. Yeah, I mean, it suggests that there&#39;s the power of the legislature to determine whether something is constitutional or not. Yes, there is actually some indemnification for the actions the government may take on the regulatory side that&#39;s built into it. So it doesn&#39;t say nothing. I&#39;m not saying it says nothing, but it didn&#39;t say an awful lot. And this, to me, always struck me as them trying to find a way to say nothing, but in a way that looked very aggressive, very forceful, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, I especially unpack in terms of how much does the original problem that they have still matter now and perhaps still matter going forward? I want to get to that, but Carter, respond to this and then we&#39;ll jump into a broader conversation I want to have around, A, the messaging strategy that they have and the communication strategy that they are pushing here, and then B, to Corey&#39;s point, how do you, as opposition parties, keep alive something that this government might be changing, that this government might be shifting on, so to speak? So Carter, respond to Corey, and then we&#39;ll jump into these two topics of conversation that I want to hit on.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;ll tell you, there is no government that doesn&#39;t try and say something by not doing anything. I mean, every government tries that in some ways. Rachel Notley did it with the pipeline stuff. Alison Redford did it with the Canadian energy strategy. We had, I think, a meaningless five principles that we were going to impose upon British</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">British Columbia, which we knew couldn&#39;t be imposed. The difference here is that our stuff we put forward as a communications exercise, knowing that the power was in the initial communications, the power was in the the communication itself. And once you&#39;re done that communication, you&#39;ve almost set the tone and tenor. People will be able to point out, hey, that Canadian energy strategy that you created on this piece of paper, that&#39;s pretty fucking meaningless. Yeah, it was pretty meaningless, but we got our communication cycle. And</span>

On every single subsequent day, it&#39;s gotten worse and because of that she never gets to go back she never gets the clean bill of health that she&#39;s that that if if if time hadn&#39;t elapsed over the last 10 days or the last 15 days she wouldn&#39;t you know she might be okay and no not anymore because she&#39;s not okay because she fucked it up this</span>

This feeling right now, this convergence of media, outside stakeholders and influencers, influencers, strange bedfellows, all piling on against this government, all saying that this is wrong, this shows incompetence, this shows instability. But the challenge that you have is you have to run an election weeks from now, months from now, in certain cases, years from now. So Carter, what is your advice to bottle this feeling, this moment up? How does one do that in politics is what I&#39;m really trying to capture here. Does that make sense?</span>

You&#39;ve got to blitz, you&#39;ve got to blitz often, you&#39;ve got to make sure that you&#39;ve got pressure on that quarterback, because when you put pressure on that quarterback, that&#39;s when mistakes get made. made. Corey also made an interesting point about how, you know, most people get a honeymoon period. Alison Redford, after she won the leadership, they were talking about her winning 84 seats because her polling was so high. We went down precipitously, of course, because, you know, it was me and Alison. But nonetheless, you know, it was still, we had a honeymoon. Were you blitzing</span>

It seems like there&#39;s a 30-second ad that they&#39;ve run, which features Danielle, which features this attack against Rachel Notley and the Notley-Trudeau-Singh alliance, and then talks about how she&#39;s defending Alberta&#39;s interests against Ottawa with the Sovereignty Act. That&#39;s one thing. The</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">The other thing they&#39;re doing is trying to line up influencers, trying to line up voices that support the Sovereignty Act. But what I found really interesting, Corey, is that they&#39;re not outright endorsements. They&#39;re more defensive posture messages. So let me just read you a a couple of them, right? So President and CEO of Synovus Energy. I have not heard anything from investors worrying about that at this point, about the Sovereignty Act. That&#39;s his quote. They&#39;re pushing this out there. From Ted Morton, right? From Ted Morton, the former finance minister. There&#39;s nothing in the act that is going to undermine investor confidence in Alberta business. That&#39;s the quote. John C. Major, what&#39;s so terrible about the province saying if you want to impose something, you better make sure you&#39;re doing it constitutionally. Let me find find one more here that i&#39;m just going through her twitter page um you know constitutional expert says it&#39;s totally constitutional national lawyer says i reviewed bill one the truth is daniel smith is standing up to ottawa&#39;s anti-alberta policies that&#39;s probably the most positive but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="text">Well, my immediate instinct is it&#39;s leading with your chin, right? It&#39;s repeating the charge. It&#39;s going out there. And if you knew nothing about the Sovereignty Act, now you know some people believe it&#39;s unconstitutional on top of that. Now, maybe there&#39;s just such a universal understanding of it. Maybe they&#39;ve assessed everybody universally thinks it&#39;s unconstitutional and they need to take this approach.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">approach. Can you pause there? Do you think that&#39;s an error for them to assume that everyone has heard about this and also above and beyond that knows that they think it&#39;s unconstitutional writ large? Is that a political strategy error to assume that their world is everyone else&#39;s world? What I&#39;m trying to say, and probably too many words, Corey, is that is this a bit of Corey Hogan&#39;s false consensus effect he talks about that they might be making an error on the baseline premise?</span>

It&#39;s probably arming her supporters with lines so that they&#39;re going to slavishly follow it. Anyhow, that&#39;s the nature of politics these days. Rachel Notley supporters with her ride or die and Danielle Smith&#39;s with her ride or die. But it means that when they&#39;re having dinner with their, you know, family member who says, oh, that bill is totally unconstitutional. He says, no, you know, it&#39;s not. I saw this professor say it was totally constitutional. Right.</span>

Is there a merit in this strategy? Can you take in politics a defensive myth-busting style approach to something that you&#39;re also trying to assertively promote?

And even if they win that argument, we still haven&#39;t had the fight around whether it&#39;s good or productive or necessary. Right. Right. And so, Carter, in your mind, is there any way that by having this protracted argument on the amendments and the constitutionality that that Danielle Smith and the UCP might avoid the conversation on whether this is good? Or do you think that&#39;s just yet to come and that is going to be the ongoing saga that they&#39;ve now just bought themselves a longer media cycle to have to deal with this shitstorm? them?</span>

That is what, that is what the, the point of the exercise is making me feel like I&#39;ve got a good idea or a good product or someone working for me, something working on my behalf. half. The problem with it&#39;s constitutional is that, or I don&#39;t see any negative impact from investors, is you remove it from being about me to making it be about someone else. And I just think that this is the problem that they have right now is that they are talking about the wrong attributes for their bill. Their bill is supposed to be, we&#39;re going to fight Ottawa for Alberta. That was the beauty of the equalization argument, as fucked as it is and as stupid as it is. It works because they&#39;re taking something from me and giving it to someone else. It&#39;s about me.</span>

We move from lonely and not so sovereign to an individual, Corey and Steven, who is in Ontario and was the only candidate for her party&#39;s leadership. I want to talk about Merit Style. She&#39;s the new Ontario NDP leader and she got there, Corey, not through a leadership race that was supposed to be held in March sometime of the new year, she got there because by midnight on Tuesday, she was the only person in the race. Now, she seems like a very competent, qualified candidate. That&#39;s not necessarily what I want to discuss. I actually want to discuss what she needs to do going forward because she didn&#39;t have a leadership race and what one misses out on by not having a leadership race. And so, Corey, we know some of the standard issue things that people talk about that you miss out on is that you don&#39;t get the stress test of your ideas. You lose out on this sort of healthy debate. But talk to me. If you&#39;re in the Ontario NDP right now, Merit Stiles is your leader. Whether you&#39;re like her or not as your leader, what, in your mind, as a political operative, as a strategist, as a tactician, and a practitioner, what did the Ontario NDP miss out on by not having a full-fledged race that ended in March, instead having a leader appointed by 11.59 p.m. last night?</span>

Are you in or are you out on that sort of strategy of just day one or second one or minute one?

Keep in mind, these are deputy ministers of health that stuck around through Kenny, who most of us think didn&#39;t do a particularly great job during the pandemic. So they put up with him, but now they won&#39;t put up with her.

            <span class="text">But ultimately, from a political point of view, I think it&#39;s overrated. There&#39;s already been a replacement at the top. Danielle Smith has expressed a dissatisfaction with leadership in this area. I don&#39;t know that it hurts her. I don&#39;t know that it changes the basic calculus that anybody is doing on this. And so, well, I think we should all take note of it as Albertans. I ultimately don&#39;t think it changes the conversation in Alberta at all. Like, I don&#39;t think that if you thought like, well, it&#39;s okay. Like, I wasn&#39;t so sure about Danielle Smith, but those two deputy chief medical officers of health are still, like, no one&#39;s having that conversation, right? So I just don&#39;t think it materially changes the conversation.</span>

            <span class="text">guess he&#39;s right insofar as the battle lines are being drawn. You&#39;ve got Danielle Smith on one side saying that she&#39;s going to tackle and attack the existing health infrastructure, and there are a set of voters who will agree with her. But there is a larger subset of the population, in my mind, that are very concerned about health and the direction that it&#39;s that it&#39;s going. And the, you know, we talked about the Don Braid article talking about the Sovereignty Act as a giant miss. Well, the first third of Don Braid&#39;s article was how can we even be talking about this when children are dying at the children&#39;s hospital? We&#39;ve added a trailer to accommodate children. That is the context in which we&#39;re talking about all of this. When I say that this is underrated, this is the land that she wants to have this election on. And it is fundamentally, do we want to change the health care system? And I think that people are going to look at her solutions and say, yeah, we want to change the health care system, but not like that.</span>

My job as the leader of the official opposition is to point out what we already all know, No, which is the only reason that something like the Sovereignty Act would even be contemplated, even be introduced, is because the Trudeau government has gone completely off the rails. It is deeply into the provincial jurisdiction. And listen, I&#39;ll tell you what, I talked to other premiers. It&#39;s not just the Sovereignty Act. There is an act in Saskatchewan that is trying to assert the exact same things. There are conversations about this happening in Yukon. I&#39;ve talked to other premiers who maybe are not there right now, but they&#39;re thinking about it. They&#39;re trying to get there. And this country is being slowly eroded by the intrusion of the federal government into the provincial sphere. And it&#39;s just another way this government is trying to make us less free. And</span>
