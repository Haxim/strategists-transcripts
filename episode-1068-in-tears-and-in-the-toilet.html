        <div class="desc"><p>In 24 hours it will all be over (probably/maybe). But let's talk about what we think it will be anyways, and dive into how campaign internals and voter modelling works while we're at it.</p><blockquote><p><em>It’s the night before the Alberta election. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter do what strategists do when there’s nothing left to do: rate the campaign’s highlights and lowlights, make predictions, second guess the data, and try to figure out what it all means. Are campaigns better equipped to read a race than pollsters? Does advance voting skew left and will it result in an “orange mirage”? And why does Annalise keep asking the audience’s questions? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And they looked at how people reacted relative to expectations. And they looked at what actions had effect relative to other actions. And this was all bolstered by polling.</div>

          <div class="said">yeah i gotta say like internal campaign polls in my experience are much more sophisticated in terms of determining who likely voters are. And the questions you would have to ask, it was ever evolving. It&#39;s like anything else in this space. Something works for a while and then it doesn&#39;t and you have to switch it out. But it would be, you don&#39;t ask, are you planning to vote? Because everyone knows they&#39;re supposed to vote. So</div>

          <div class="said">right because we do know that having a plan to vote is a big determinant of whether you show up and vote it&#39;s part of why you&#39;ve probably seen if you have engaged with either of these campaigns in any material way they&#39;re texting you saying hey make a plan to vote they want you to kind of put in your mind and your calendar where you&#39;re going to vote when you&#39;re going to vote how you&#39;re going to vote and and so campaigns have more of that information and have a better sense of who&#39;s actually going to show up on that day i did want to say though before we jump off this because yes 2012 was a big polling mess but</div>

          <div class="said">but there was a real come to jesus moment in the polling industry overall around that time this this was an era that i will call the end of the easy probabilistic poll so for a while you had really rigorous pollsters who would go in and they would use live callers and they would get you know if they didn&#39;t get a hold of you right away they would try 10 more times effectively what janet brown does still to this day right although you know with cell phones and whatnot and it&#39;s really truly saying i randomly pick numbers now i&#39;m randomly going to try to get people there and if that&#39;s done perfectly you don&#39;t even need to wait things right because you&#39;ve just got a probabilistic sample but what happened in the 2000s is ivr became very cheap and a lot of very low quality pollsters came around and all of a sudden the high quality ones even had to deal with these low quality ones undercutting them so everybody kind kind of wrecked their standard a bit and started doing things quick and dirty because it seemed to work okay.</div>

          <div class="said">And you saw through 2008 to 2012 in the United States as well, with the rise of the Tea Party, a number of other things people didn&#39;t necessarily see. Polling kind of broke. And in 2012 in Alberta, polling was pretty broken. But there has been a bit of a return to that higher quality standard for some pollsters. There&#39;s been increased weight, use of weighting and and understanding of how missing certain demographics can entirely break things, and that if you&#39;re going to do that lower quality thing, you&#39;ve got to do a little bit of weighting because you&#39;re not going to get that probabilistic sample the way you used to be able to do it, and polling got better. And we haven&#39;t had a truly horrific polling miss on the provincial level since then, and I want to put that on the table because I think a lot of people are also searching for serious amounts of hope where there&#39;s maybe modest amounts of hope in terms of the numbers.</div>

One of the things that ECOS came out with, Frank Graves, was a very interesting kind of look at misinformation. And misinformation was guiding a large percentage of the UCP voters, whereas it was exactly inverted for the NDP. we are as is happening in the united states and and uh even elsewhere in canada we are moving more and more towards a polarized society with two different realities and it&#39;s not that we look at the same facts necessarily and draw different conclusions it&#39;s that we&#39;re looking at different facts right so because we&#39;re looking at different fact sets it allows our values to be markedly different where in the past we&#39;ve seen kind of our values come uh</div>

So campaigns aren&#39;t generally bombarding us on either side, right? The other is I have a community mailbox. So it&#39;s very easy for me just to eliminate that kind of stuff before I even see it.

So even if you don&#39;t have photo ID, you can go with somebody in your poll and you can vote. You can do an attestation. You can vote. There are ways to vote. it is still generally easier with photo id so by all means if you have photo id go and vote but go and vote like don&#39;t be dissuaded i think actually my concern with elections alberta the id thing was annoying to me but the one that really bothered me was this implication that you should register to vote in advance and yes that no doubt makes it easier for the the whole system and everything smoother on election day you can show up as long as you meet the eligibility requirements you can just show up and you can vote and i can&#39;t imagine you&#39;re listening to this podcast and you don&#39;t already know that but</div>

But I think for the average voter, he&#39;s still Stephen Harper, middle of the road prime minister, a guy who looked like he was like from a British drama about a Canadian government, you know, like, it&#39;s just like, he just was like kind of this boring state looking guy.

          <div class="said">Yeah. Well, when I think about the advice that I gave to the UCP, honestly i think it holds up pretty well they probably didn&#39;t do as much of a job or as clear of a job as i would have recommended to them about tying um you know all of the unpopular actions they have had to take to that ndp term certainly they said an awful lot about how bad they perceived 2015 to 2019 to be but for me that missing piece of the argument was to say and that&#39;s That&#39;s why we had to do all of that shit you didn&#39;t like with health care, with education. And I think that was an important part of the argument that they didn&#39;t put on the table as strongly as they should have.</div>
