Yes or no. Donald Trump wins like 52 to 48, like kind of Jason Kenney leadership review numbers, not super strong. You would think maybe it would give you pause still. And then he just brings the guy back.</span>

Gone are the people who were trying to battle back against a different culture. I mean, freedom of speech, and we went through this when we were with H&amp;K, because H&amp;K was an American company.

And I think that we can now see the results of that action is that it is too far in this freedom of speech without responsibility. We always used to have freedom of speech. We used to write letters to the editor of the newspaper. And if they were deemed inappropriate by the editor, they weren&#39;t posted.</span>

            <span class="text">that there are complexities involved with these big organizations and these big operations that you don&#39;t really sort of consider. So on a certain level, like let&#39;s, let&#39;s talk, let&#39;s draw the parallel with Twitter here. Like on one level with Twitter&#39;s doing is pretty fucking basic, right? You are, you are putting things up and somebody else can read those things. And</span>

            <span class="text">And yes, there&#39;s like, there&#39;s the way that it shows you and there&#39;s the algorithm behind it, but the complication comes from scale, right? All of a sudden it&#39;s one thing to say, yeah, I want to, I want to sort a million posts, But what do you do about sorting a billion posts? That&#39;s a thousand times as complicated. How are you going to do that at speed? How is this going to work? How are you going to get relevant content and make sure you&#39;re not throwing it to somebody else? That&#39;s one source of complication. The other source of complication, though, is the way it butts up with other organizations. So when we were talking about ArriveCam, we&#39;re like, oh, my God, you&#39;re going to have to work with all of those government departments. Yeah, maybe it shouldn&#39;t be as expensive as it was, but you couldn&#39;t code it in your basement because it&#39;s the meetings, it&#39;s the conversations.</span>

We&#39;ve got to get a bit more of a killer edge around here where we&#39;re trying to move features through faster. And then rather than having an email, do you like me? Yes. No. Right. There are ways that he could have put together events, you know, town halls, forums, seeing who&#39;s engaged, tracked who&#39;s engaged, even if he wants to be a little bit more about that and started to understand the people before he started making decisions about them.</span>
