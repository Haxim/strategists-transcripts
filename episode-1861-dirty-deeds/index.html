        <p>Zain Velji and Stephen Carter discuss "Buttongate" and how the parties should handle it. Then it's on to talking about recent polling developments before ending off on debate prep for the leaders. Are campaign "War Rooms" still relevant? How excited should people get if the polls tighten? And what skulduggery is Carter saving for his memoirs? Corey Hogan is out knocking on doors in the dead of night. Zain and Stephen feed the content machine as best they can.</p>

Funny, cheeky, and maybe that&#39;s not a great example of the point I&#39;m trying to make, but they&#39;re responding to everything. These accounts are so good. These people are so nimble. They&#39;re so online. line they&#39;re so so gen z they&#39;re so with it that at some point that upside of being like everything the other side puts out we squash back may have a cost to it and i and i&#39;m not saying the button idea is a direct linkage to this but i think it comes from that culture of like oh yeah like they&#39;re actually like the people have shirt sweatshirts that are doing this and then this is going on and yes that&#39;s a media story but it&#39;s not something that people have already heard There&#39;s not enough soak time. There&#39;s still more runway available for people to see the conservatives torturing themselves. There&#39;s days left on that story because it hasn&#39;t gotten to the normal person.

Do you feel like we&#39;re in a campaign world, Carter, that that matters anymore, how the story comes out? Because there could also be a case around how modern day campaign media relations has done, especially from the oppo side, which is, do you feel like we&#39;re in a new reality where I could just put this story out myself with my partisan tinge, and it might have just as much mileage as a long, lengthy investigative piece put out by the CBC or Global News, for example?</div>
