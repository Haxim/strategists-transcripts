        <p>The BC election kicks off with the "Rustad Rebate" and leaked podcasts of vaccine conspiracy, federal politics floats through a not-quite-dead-but-not-feeling-so-alive state and Jagmeet Singh finds a winning (*/?) new persona.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Jagmeet Singh's "come at me" flex, the start of the BC election, the upcoming confidence vote that will barely be and irregular media circuits that see the Prime Minister on Colbert and Alberta Premier at a Rebel News conference. Are voters going to end up annoyed by the fine print on the Rustad rebate? Were the Bloc and NDP smart to diffuse the confidence motion so quickly? And how badly would Singh "Ivan Drago" Hogan? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

And you know, it could lead to some weird situations down the road because some people are just going to look for that. And it&#39;s not too hard for me to imagine a situation where some loser comes, does the same thing to Jagmeet Singh. Jagmeet Singh takes the the exact same approach, the guy swings at him. And all of a sudden, we&#39;re having a discussion about whether he brought this on by taunting him or saying he wanted to fight him, right? And ultimately, this is just not how we&#39;re supposed to settle differences in this country. This is not how we&#39;re supposed to settle differences in politics.

Can we give a quick sort of strategy ranking in analysis, Carter and Corey, on each of the players involved? Let&#39;s remove the liberals for a second. Conservatives, Carter, did they overcorrect or do they have to do this? And now have they set a precedent? And then the block and the NDP coming in very, very quickly, taking out all of the pretense, the drama, not waiting until tomorrow. We know what&#39;s going to happen. They&#39;ve both committed to it. Give me their sort of strategic markings on how they&#39;ve dealt with things, what they&#39;ve done by kind of deflating this motion.

In terms of the Bloc Québécois, I give them an 8 out of 10 as well. I think that they were told that this was going to happen, and it doesn&#39;t serve their advantage at all. And they&#39;re happy to support Trudeau at this moment in time. The NDP is the one that strikes me as weird. They didn&#39;t need to shift over to protecting the liberals. liberals.

You desperately need us in opposition. And that&#39;s just a historical threat that the NDP have had to deal with forever. One of the interesting things about polling is the NDP have not gained at the liberal decline, right? Yes. And under the surface, we don&#39;t know if there&#39;s votes shifting around like liberal to NDP, other NDP just disappearing or going to PPC or whatever, right? I don&#39;t have that level of sophistication to the polling I&#39;ve got. although i suspect it&#39;s just the ndp are holding on to their people and the liberals are losing theirs to the conservatives right but</div>

Let&#39;s find a way we can bring them down on an issue that matters to Quebec and let&#39;s go. And for the conservatives, I think that the risk becomes that the liberals actually do manage to find their footing over this next bit with the block and the NDP tying themselves in knots to not bring them down, right? Like all of the drama moves from what the fuck&#39;s going on with Trudeau&#39;s liberals to holy cow, the opposition continues to say they don&#39;t support him, but they&#39;re supporting him. And while I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be enough to cost the conservatives the election, I think that that would just be an irritation to them that they don&#39;t necessarily want. We&#39;re</div>

The BC election is on. We&#39;re on day three already, Stephen Carter. And the conservatives are leaning policy heavy. heavy there&#39;s two interesting things happening right now in in the bc election and and uh and this is i don&#39;t mean to kind of give a story of the day update but i find both of these to be potentially impactful and they have strategic questions associated with them thing number one stephen carter the bc conservatives and john rustad their leader are proposing a three thousand dollar a month rustad rebate named after himself that&#39;s what the the sign says at the podium On rent and mortgages, this is a $1,500 a month tax rebate on your provincial taxes starting in January of 26, I should say, and then increasing by $500 a month, so $2,000, $2,500, $3,000, up to a maximum of $3,000 a month. the BC rent and mortgage rebate would apply to both renters and homeowners and would be administered as a tax credit worth 5.06% of eligible housing costs equivalent to the rate of BC&#39;s base tax bracket in the conservative set in a press release.</div>

I read some of the coverage of it, but to me, I&#39;m not at all clear how much money the average person is actually going to see. I guess if I interpret it one way, it&#39;s 5.06% or whatever you were saying of your mortgage. Let&#39;s say your mortgage was $5,000 a month. So it&#39;s 5% of $5,000 a month.

Because the big splashy number here that we&#39;ve repeated a few times is 3,000. And what the conservatives are doing is putting it up against the smaller, less flashy number that the NDP are promising, which is 400, a $400 rent rebate for all renters. Now, this is a previous 2017 policy. The NDP haven&#39;t come up with their housing number. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re going down the same path, if they&#39;re proposing something different. But it&#39;s a tough $3,000 to ultimately read, but a clear number and a $400. And of course, these are not apples to apples. These are apples to oranges. But Carter, from a branding perspective, from a voter sort of absorption perspective, does that even matter? Your take on that question as well as what the conservatives are putting in the window with this policy? Well,</div>

This was a video that is resurfaced of Rustead, I believe in June of this calendar year of 24, speaking to a group of individuals on a Zoom call saying he regrets taking the so-called vaccine against COVID-19. He had many comments around, you know, herd immunity and what they&#39;re actually trying to do, etc. The NDP packaging on this is that this is a guy that doesn&#39;t believe in healthcare and this guy doesn&#39;t believe in health policy. It&#39;s conspiracy theories from the internet. I&#39;m paraphrasing EB, but he said something like that today.</div>

I find this really interesting how they make strategic calculations. Thing number one, tonight we record on Monday. Justin Trudeau is going to be on Stephen Colbert. Thing number two, Daniel Smith is attending the Rebel News Live conference in Calgary alongside some of the hosts from Rebel News, Tamara Lisch from The Convoy. Really interesting. And for two of them, they&#39;re not equivalent in some ways. They are in others. others. Carter, I want to get your initial reactions, strategic reactions to good strategy, bad strategy on both of those questions for each of those politicians. What do you think for each of them? And then I want to have a broader discussion on has the strategic sort of decision-making shifted in our modern politics around what politicians do and how they do it from a media and events perspective?

What do you think of that as it kind of relates to a media relations strategy of politicians? If you&#39;re big enough, might as well use the airwaves where the majority of Canadians might be tuning in in some real way. I know Corey&#39;s argument is smart, makes sense around maybe not the best use of time, but where are you at with this? Is there any new set of rules or new paradigm we&#39;ve entered that Trudeau might be representing?</div>
