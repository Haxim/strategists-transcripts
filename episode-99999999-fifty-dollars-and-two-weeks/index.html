        <p>The gang checks in on Stephen Carter's pain medication levels, spends twenty minutes talking about the politics of hair and then gets down to business in this summertime special that looks into the "sneak attacks" the major federal and Alberta political parties should be worried about.</p><blockquote><p><em>It's time for the "Summer Sneak Attack Special"! Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the things the federal Liberals, Conservatives and NDP - plus the Alberta UCP and NDP - should be watching out for in these dog days. Could the Conservatives be seduced by their own early election narrative? Do Singh's NDP have a relevancy problem? And should Justin Trudeau be allowed to get a haircut unsupervised? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>
