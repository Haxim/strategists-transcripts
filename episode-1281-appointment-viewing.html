        <p>It's the return of "Fine, Fabulous, or F--ked"! The gang unpack strategy. Zain learns how to use quotes.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the role of strategy in getting a Senate appointment, before a cross Canada checkup through "Fine, Fabulous, or F--ked". Was it a mistake for Danielle Smith to take the stage with Tucker Carlson? How are members of the Prime Minister's Office supposed to act online? And who's the Joey Chestnut of the Alberta NDP leadership hopefuls? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Corey, let me, before I get to the word on the street, I find this really interesting. The Senate appointment, we&#39;re actually doing this, is an application-based. Now, if I were, if I would have done any planning, I would have found out what&#39;s entitled or entailed in that application. I don&#39;t give a shit. It&#39;s an application. You apply, you get chosen, right? But Corey, what we&#39;ve heard that&#39;s happening here in Alberta, specifically coming out of Justin Trudeau&#39;s and the government&#39;s sort of appointments bureau, whether that&#39;s a division of PMO or elsewhere. Once again, no research has been done. So let&#39;s just assume it sits somewhere within government. All right. Loving it. Calls have been made to people. And these are the classic sort of HR calls that we have either done ourselves or experienced. Let me give you the breakdown. The calls are made to relatively qualified people in the broader sort of Alberta community. And they are asked to provide their names for people they think should become senators. And then at the end of that call, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. Carter, sometimes even 30 minutes. They&#39;re asked, oh, you wouldn&#39;t be interested, by the way, right? And sometimes people say yes, and sometimes they say no. It&#39;s like, if you&#39;d be interested, well, please don&#39;t send me the names. Let&#39;s have another follow-up conversation on that. Those calls, Carter, a version of which we have either participated in or been on the receiving end of, you probably less so than Corey and I, I would imagine, on the receiving side. Yeah, for sure.</div>

If someone tells you, hey, if you&#39;re interested in this, apply, and A to B equals C, is there any world where the hats that we put on on this show, where we try to gamify certain things, think through the ups and downs, talk about lobbying individuals that might be on advisory boards, that&#39;s a real thing. Talk about maybe even calling up the person who&#39;s in charge of appointments. The things that we talk about, the tactics, the strategies we talk about. Carter, my basic question to you, and you could kill this entire segment with a no to this answer, is, is there any room for strategist-level thinking when there&#39;s an application-based system?</div>

So like, how are you making sure that you are in the mix and you are hitting the criteria? And I mean, small p political at this point, right? That would allow you to be considered and put forward by these candidates. And then there is, okay, how do I make the prime minister&#39;s office excited about me?

So if I&#39;m sitting there as Danielle Smith, why the hell wouldn&#39;t I sit and cozy up with the far right? Why wouldn&#39;t I? Where&#39;s my threat? Is my threat at the ballot box? No, because as long as I start acting like a normal person three months before the election, everyone&#39;s going to forget and forgive. However, if I slip up even for a minute with the far right of the party, they&#39;re going to start sharpening the knives. So yeah, fucking bring it on. I&#39;ll I&#39;ll get involved with every crazy right-wing cause. I&#39;ll be their champion for as long as I need to be because that&#39;s how you survive as a premier in Alberta. You don&#39;t survive by being popular. You survive by making sure the far right of the province is on side with you. And that&#39;s kind of a downer, I guess, if you&#39;re not in the far right of the province. But hey, that&#39;s a reality I think we&#39;ve seen play out time and time and time and time again in the past 10 years here.</div>

          <div class="said">alberta ndp they have a new set of rules that allow a new leader to be named june 22nd that&#39;s what they&#39;re looking at It is a June 22nd leadership announcement. They have the race commencing in the next week or so, February 5th. There&#39;s a vetting period. I won&#39;t bore people with that. But ultimately, February 5th to April 22nd, that is the day that you have to have all your memberships sold for new members to effectively be able to vote. And then there&#39;s a bunch of dates in between. But there&#39;s kind of a bit of a dead period, I guess, if I&#39;d call it that, between April 22nd and June 22nd as it relates to new membership sales. I&#39;m sure the party will organize events and debates and contests to, you know, do other things, hot dog eating contests and others in between to keep it lively. But Carter, overall on the rules, fine, fabulous, or fucked for the Alberta NDP as they seek to replace Rachel Notley?</div>

          <div class="said">Fine, fuck it. We&#39;re going to move it on to our final rounder over under our lightning round, Stephen Carter. Carter, let&#39;s talk about the by-election that has now been announced to replace Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s vacant seat in Durham, Ontario. There was an interesting development over the weekend where this – it was a very online development, but I found this fascinating. Where Justin Trudeau referred to the conservative candidate in Durham as a twofer, both an insider and an ideologue. The candidate then kind of, you know, took this term of twofer without the context of Trudeau explaining what twofer meant and said, you know, how dare the prime minister call me names and then went on a four minute sort of biographical epic about who he is and how he deserves to be running in this race, etc. et cetera. What do you kind of think of PM&#39;s use of language here? Are you in or out of him trying to drive political attacks? And this would potentially be called punching down, so to speak, in some ways, going after an MP. Are you in or out on what the PM had to say here? Of course, what this candidate did was pretty predictable and took a clip out of context. In or out on the PM, though are</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, I get what Carter&#39;s saying, but I&#39;m kind of curious your thoughts on the prime minister&#39;s use of language here. Because there could be a world where this candidate, who I know personally, Jamil Javani, could just lean into this, be like, you know, be like twofer, could be like part of his campaign. Like, it could just be like, you know, yeah, call me that, right? And we&#39;ve seen that in politics, right? Where someone tries to do something from a negative sort of stance or an attack mode, and they&#39;re like, you know what? Fuck yeah, that is exactly what I am. Basket of deplorables is a good version of it, right? Where people kind of took the attack and made it their own sort of thing. And I know this is one candidate in a by-election, but there is something really fascinating to me about, like, language jujitsu, but also language that is kind of known, but not really known, and allows this room for leaving out context.

So on the heels of this video, like I said, this is a very deeply online thing, but there&#39;s some interesting strategy lessons to be learned here. The newest hire to the PMO, Superior DeVetti, who&#39;s been a commentator, radio host, been on PNP for years. She wrote a beautiful Toronto</div>

          <div class="said">Star article about why she&#39;s taking this gig. This was about a couple of weeks ago in the PMO was was sort of named by conservative commentators around, you know, a response. She kind of went back and forth with them and then got into a very heated sort of conversation and debate. If you can call it that lightly, Corey, with Canada Proud, you know, just going back and forth, like, you know, explicit language, all like pretty witty, pretty funny if you&#39;re on her side sort of thing. But like, okay, that&#39;s like surprising language coming from someone in the PMO. Two ways to look at this, I guess. Number one, like, hey, go ham, attack hard. Who gives a shit now that you&#39;re in the PMO? Just be who you are. That&#39;s why they hired you. Number two, holy shit, you&#39;re in the PMO. You know, calm the fuck down. Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you, are you in or out on her behavior? And I can&#39;t give you all of the language in the back and forth right now. So people can look it up because it&#39;s still not been deleted. And I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll become a bit of a side sort of internet story in that sense.</div>

          <div class="said">mean i think carter and i it&#39;ll be an interesting conversation with carter i&#39;m out i when i was in government i think i tweeted less than a handful of things over the entire time and absolutely nothing was controversial or political it was like oh i broke my favorite mug you know it was like really anodyne shit because i i just generally don&#39;t know that you need to become the story at moments like this you know and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll let carter argue the counterpoint there is an obvious counterpoint which is that you have other personalities that that can get mixed into it. But the bottom line for me is, when you have a job like that, it doesn&#39;t work to just say, these are my own opinions in your Twitter bio or anything. And I don&#39;t even think she had that. But it comes off as being the prime minister&#39;s office. And do we need our PMO? This actually ties pretty well to the last point. Do we need our PMOs to be mean and funny? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually what anybody&#39;s looking for. Especially as governments age we want them to be we we want them not to be witty generally speaking we we don&#39;t credit them very highly for funny or witty when they get long in the tooth and yes she might be new there but to canadians this is an old pmo this is an old and established pmo and the same things that come off as scrappy and upstart when you are say 2014 and you&#39;re trying to get into office</div>

          <div class="said">how else you take on Canada Proud, right? How else do you take them on? I mean, the liberals are getting the shit kicked out of them. I think that using a staffer as an account, an attack dog is probably less effective than using an MP as an attack dog. I think that you&#39;ve got other people with the skill set in your cabinet that might be able to do it. And if you don&#39;t have someone in your cabinet, you should probably put someone in who&#39;s got the attack dog fighter instinct. i&#39;m not sure that coming from the pmo is necessarily the best uh the best play i played some of that role right we&#39;ve seen some of those roles being played by jason kenney staffers um i don&#39;t think i ever did it like this but i don&#39;t think i&#39;m in a position to throw rocks from my glass house uh so i&#39;m gonna say this is fabulous that was another segment well</div>
