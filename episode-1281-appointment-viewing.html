Well, actually, here&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I put quotes around random stuff just to see if people pick up on it. And Corey, it&#39;s usually for the audience, not upon you, but you will see throughout the history of this show, I put quotes around things that do not deserve quotes. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So this is basically the first time I&#39;ve shown any interest in your question. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">first time you&#39;ve actually listened alongside, quote unquote, Stephen Carter. Carter.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Jesus, you put a V in there, I can tell. That&#39;s a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">a callback. That is a callback. Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. Because you can do it with a V. That&#39;s nice. Because you can do it with a V. Corey, let me, before I get to the word on the street, I find this really interesting. The Senate appointment, we&#39;re actually doing this, is an application-based. Now, if I were, if I would have done any planning, I would have found out what&#39;s entitled or entailed in that application. I don&#39;t give a shit. It&#39;s an application. You apply, you get chosen, right? But Corey, what we&#39;ve heard that&#39;s happening here in Alberta, specifically coming out of Justin Trudeau&#39;s and the government&#39;s sort of appointments bureau, whether that&#39;s a division of PMO or elsewhere. Once again, no research has been done. So let&#39;s just assume it sits somewhere within government. All right. Loving it. Calls have been made to people. And these are the classic sort of HR calls that we have either done ourselves or experienced. Let me give you the breakdown. The calls are made to relatively qualified people in the broader sort of Alberta community. And they are asked to provide their names for people they think should become senators. And then at the end of that call, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. Carter, sometimes even 30 minutes. They&#39;re asked, oh, you wouldn&#39;t be interested, by the way, right? And sometimes people say yes, and sometimes they say no. It&#39;s like, if you&#39;d be interested, well, please don&#39;t send me the names. Let&#39;s have another follow-up conversation on that. Those calls, Carter, a version of which we have either participated in or been on the receiving end of, you probably less so than Corey and I, I would imagine, on the receiving side. Yeah, for sure.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">have been happening. And the ask has has been, well, if you are interested, make sure you apply. And Carter, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s any room for strategist thinking in that world. That&#39;s probably my basic question. If someone tells you, hey, if you&#39;re interested in this, apply, and A to B equals C, is there any world where the hats that we put on on this show, where we try to gamify certain things, think through the ups and downs, talk about lobbying individuals that might be on advisory boards, that&#39;s a real thing. Talk about maybe even calling up the person who&#39;s in charge of appointments. The things that we talk about, the tactics, the strategies we talk about. Carter, my basic question to you, and you could kill this entire segment with a no to this answer, is, is there any room for strategist-level thinking when there&#39;s an application-based system?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, obviously there is, because now I don&#39;t need to put the finishing touches on my application anymore. more uh i was just about done uh i did not get a phone call like the one you&#39;re describing and so basically to be clear neither i am</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">why would i even hand in my application um frankly i was looking at this as a nice soft landing uh i&#39;m told they&#39;re for life right the appointments um uh</span>

There is a committee that has a couple of members for each province and then some general members, right? And I think one of the main members is Melissa Blake, a former mayor of Fort McMurray, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Oh, I remember her, sure. But yeah, they&#39;re generally not politicians.

But then Justin Trudeau is going to say, oh, I like that one. Bingo, bango, right? And so there are two really important ways you can influence that process politically, even in this nonpartisan process. One is on the way in, right? So like, how are you making sure that you are in the mix and you are hitting the criteria? And I mean, small p political at this point, right? That would allow you to be considered and put forward by these candidates. And then there is, okay, how do I make the prime minister&#39;s office excited about me? And how do I make it so the prime minister is interested in me being a candidate? date and i think the reality of most of these appointment processes is even</span>

That&#39;s one extreme, all the way to, you know, a perhaps more casual way of having other people influence your application. Should you do that? Should you not do that? If someone came to you, like, seriously, being like, Carter, I&#39;m actually thinking of Senate, what would you advise them? And if they said, you know, I actually have some connections that might actually have direct access to the PMO, the chief of staff, the prime minister himself, and I hear he&#39;s picking it. What would you say to them, Carter?</span>

Where else would you kind of draw the line around risk? Because you&#39;ve talked about, you know, some of this might even be necessary. You just start to push yourself, your thoughts on others pushing for you, first and foremost, and then where you kind of think some of the traps are around personal advocacy for one&#39;s application, especially when it&#39;s like not in your sort of character and you&#39;re looking to kind of like serve. It&#39;s a lot of people feel that tension, and it&#39;s uncomfortable for them in that way.</span>

This came in with Justin Trudeau, this idea of independent senators. And certainly, especially at the start, there was this sense that there was no politics to be involved in it, right? And so, So I think in particular, in those early days, you would likely have created, I think some squeamishness would be putting it in an understated way. If you started lobbying the prime minister&#39;s office saying like, oh, no, I&#39;m your person. I&#39;m exactly who you want for that particular role.</span>

And now it&#39;s going to be only conservatives for the next bit. Maybe we should be thinking a little bit about that. All to say, where is the line of propriety, Zane? I don&#39;t know, and I suspect it&#39;s evolving, and it certainly hasn&#39;t existed long enough to be established.

            <span class="text">But there&#39;s another thing I know if I&#39;m a conservative premier in Alberta, and that&#39;s that conservative premiers in Alberta tend to have a pretty short shelf life because the right wing of the party comes after them and kills them. So if I&#39;m sitting there as Danielle Smith, why the hell wouldn&#39;t I sit and cozy up with the far right? Why wouldn&#39;t I? Where&#39;s my threat? Is my threat at the ballot box? No, because as long as I start acting like a normal person three months before the election, everyone&#39;s going to forget and forgive. However, if I slip up even for a minute with the far right of the party, they&#39;re going to start sharpening the knives. So yeah, fucking bring it on. I&#39;ll I&#39;ll get involved with every crazy right-wing cause. I&#39;ll be their champion for as long as I need to be because that&#39;s how you survive as a premier in Alberta. You don&#39;t survive by being popular. You survive by making sure the far right of the province is on side with you. And that&#39;s kind of a downer, I guess, if you&#39;re not in the far right of the province. But hey, that&#39;s a reality I think we&#39;ve seen play out time and time and time and time again in the past 10 years here.</span>

I think I mentioned on this pod, you know, it wasn&#39;t so long ago, she was tweeting at Elon Musk saying good things about Alberta, you know, and what was going on with Alberta conservatism back in the day. I mean, she is that person. And I think that she sincerely does think you should be able to have these conversations and have these, you know, challenging debates and discourses.

If somebody says, hey, do you want to be on the stage with Tucker Carlson? And she says, no, well, then that becomes the thing they&#39;re pissed off about in right wing land, right? So she just says, yeah, sure, why not? And so I think the combination of those two things where she&#39;s like, yeah, look, I&#39;ve always been a fan of public discourse. And yeah, I&#39;ve always liked big stages. And yeah, I&#39;m going to get hit in the head if I don&#39;t accept this invite or don&#39;t agree to do this thing.

But Corey, I don&#39;t want to ask the PMO perspective. I want to ask the perspective of this MP from Avalon. Is this fine, fabulous, or fucked for his political future? What do you think? He said it, and this is the same MP, just to remind folks that pre-carve out of the carbon tax for Atlantic Canada, he was the one advocating for it on political shows and such.

What PMO in their right fucking mind would give this guy any authority with which he could then turn around and hit them? It would be a crazy thing to do.

So if you&#39;re starting to flip and take the other side, your best bet is to find new political ground. But even then, I think you&#39;re done in politics. And this is the problem. right now when you&#39;ve got your party and your party&#39;s not doing well and your leader&#39;s polling even below the party that gives you a real problem because you want to do something to save your own skin but the thing you cannot do is just shit on the leader because the leader still gets 90 of the votes 95 of the votes in your riding and you get like fuck all because you&#39;re most of us don&#39;t know the names of the of our own members of parliament well not most of us i mean mean we&#39;re pretty amazing we know every name</span>

They have the race commencing in the next week or so, February 5th. There&#39;s a vetting period. I won&#39;t bore people with that. But ultimately, February 5th to April 22nd, that is the day that you have to have all your memberships sold for new members to effectively be able to vote. And then there&#39;s a bunch of dates in between. But there&#39;s kind of a bit of a dead period, I guess, if I&#39;d call it that, between April 22nd and June 22nd as it relates to new membership sales. I&#39;m sure the party will organize events and debates and contests to, you know, do other things, hot dog eating contests and others in between to keep it lively. But Carter, overall on the rules, fine, fabulous, or fucked for the Alberta NDP as they seek to replace Rachel Notley?</span>

And no matter where you live in the country in this provincial contest, you&#39;ll be able to get your ballot and you&#39;ll be able to muse about it for two weeks. And then you&#39;ll be able to send it back no matter where you are in this country on this provincial contest, and everything will be nice and good.

            <span class="text">Fine, fuck it. We&#39;re going to move it on to our final rounder over under our lightning round, Stephen Carter. Carter, let&#39;s talk about the by-election that has now been announced to replace Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s vacant seat in Durham, Ontario. There was an interesting development over the weekend where this – it was a very online development, but I found this fascinating. Where Justin Trudeau referred to the conservative candidate in Durham as a twofer, both an insider and an ideologue. The candidate then kind of, you know, took this term of twofer without the context of Trudeau explaining what twofer meant and said, you know, how dare the prime minister call me names and then went on a four minute sort of biographical epic about who he is and how he deserves to be running in this race, etc. et cetera. What do you kind of think of PM&#39;s use of language here? Are you in or out of him trying to drive political attacks? And this would potentially be called punching down, so to speak, in some ways, going after an MP. Are you in or out on what the PM had to say here? Of course, what this candidate did was pretty predictable and took a clip out of context. In or out on the PM, though are</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you suggesting that the the conservative party of canada potentially something out of context and then spun it into some sort of media and fundraising initiative is that what you&#39;re suggesting zane it doesn&#39;t matter what the prime minister says the conservative party of canada is going to take it out of context and they&#39;re going to turn it into a fundraising campaign and some other way of winning votes that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing um that&#39;s the techniques and the the tools that they have and frankly the liberals have tried to do it too and the ndp haven&#39;t tried but you know other people i mean the ndp haven&#39;t tried for years but anyways the the this whole thing is is a joke it doesn&#39;t matter that he said twofer it would have been if he if he&#39;d said this is a candidate that that i don&#39;t think has the skill set then</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">then they would have been running a a series of, you know, ads that say the prime minister doesn&#39;t think that this type of person has the skill set. I mean, it&#39;s a mugs</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I get what Carter&#39;s saying, but I&#39;m kind of curious your thoughts on the prime minister&#39;s use of language here. Because there could be a world where this candidate, who I know personally, Jamil Javani, could just lean into this, be like, you know, be like twofer, could be like part of his campaign. Like, it could just be like, you know, yeah, call me that, right? And we&#39;ve seen that in politics, right? Where someone tries to do something from a negative sort of stance or an attack mode, and they&#39;re like, you know what? Fuck yeah, that is exactly what I am. Basket of deplorables is a good version of it, right? Where people kind of took the attack and made it their own sort of thing. And I know this is one candidate in a by-election, but there is something really fascinating to me about, like, language jujitsu, but also language that is kind of known, but not really known, and allows this room for leaving out context. Your thoughts on the Prime Minister&#39;s language, in or out?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I think if you didn&#39;t watch the show 30 Rock, you wouldn&#39;t even understand what the hell the controversy is. But in the show 30 Rock, there was a character, Tuffer, who was so-called because it was described in the first episode he was in. He was a black guy and a harvard guy so he checked two boxes right the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the phrase twofer existed before that that&#39;s why the joke worked in 30 rock is the great irony here right but you know then it was taken as a racial thing because in 30 rock it was used as a racial thing and so you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know there&#39;s a lot to unpack they&#39;re very meta you could get into discourse about the evolving nature of language and all of that ultimately i think that um the prime minister there are so many times where you can be like right but you should know better right like i don&#39;t think that the prime minister necessarily meant anything i certainly don&#39;t think the prime minister meant anything racial but he literally described the two things he was saying he was a twofer on right yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but why the fuck do it like knowing that the most the most well-known version of this had racial connotations why would you do it like as a prime minister you sometimes have to know it&#39;s better not to be witty a lot of the time and and frankly it wasn&#39;t even that witty so what the hell that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">let me extend this conversation to my next question, Carter, under enlightening ground. And let me add some context here. So on the heels of this video, like I said, this is a very deeply online thing, but there&#39;s some interesting strategy lessons to be learned here. The newest hire to the PMO, Superior DeVetti, who&#39;s been a commentator, radio host, been on PNP for years. She wrote a beautiful Toronto</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Star article about why she&#39;s taking this gig. This was about a couple of weeks ago in the PMO was was sort of named by conservative commentators around, you know, a response. She kind of went back and forth with them and then got into a very heated sort of conversation and debate. If you can call it that lightly, Corey, with Canada Proud, you know, just going back and forth, like, you know, explicit language, all like pretty witty, pretty funny if you&#39;re on her side sort of thing. But like, okay, that&#39;s like surprising language coming from someone in the PMO. Two ways to look at this, I guess. Number one, like, hey, go ham, attack hard. Who gives a shit now that you&#39;re in the PMO? Just be who you are. That&#39;s why they hired you. Number two, holy shit, you&#39;re in the PMO. You know, calm the fuck down. Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you, are you in or out on her behavior? And I can&#39;t give you all of the language in the back and forth right now. So people can look it up because it&#39;s still not been deleted. And I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll become a bit of a side sort of internet story in that sense.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">mean i think carter and i it&#39;ll be an interesting conversation with carter i&#39;m out i when i was in government i think i tweeted less than a handful of things over the entire time and absolutely nothing was controversial or political it was like oh i broke my favorite mug you know it was like really anodyne shit because i i just generally don&#39;t know that you need to become the story at moments like this you know and i&#39;ll i&#39;ll let carter argue the counterpoint there is an obvious counterpoint which is that you have other personalities that that can get mixed into it. But the bottom line for me is, when you have a job like that, it doesn&#39;t work to just say, these are my own opinions in your Twitter bio or anything. And I don&#39;t even think she had that. But it comes off as being the prime minister&#39;s office. And do we need our PMO? This actually ties pretty well to the last point. Do we need our PMOs to be mean and funny? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually what anybody&#39;s looking for. Especially as governments age we want them to be we we want them not to be witty generally speaking we we don&#39;t credit them very highly for funny or witty when they get long in the tooth and yes she might be new there but to canadians this is an old pmo this is an old and established pmo and the same things that come off as scrappy and upstart when you are say 2014 and you&#39;re trying to get into office</span>

            <span class="text">think? Corey makes a lot of good points around the duration of this PMO, but she&#39;s got a personality.

            <span class="text">how else you take on Canada Proud, right? How else do you take them on? I mean, the liberals are getting the shit kicked out of them. I think that using a staffer as an account, an attack dog is probably less effective than using an MP as an attack dog. I think that you&#39;ve got other people with the skill set in your cabinet that might be able to do it. And if you don&#39;t have someone in your cabinet, you should probably put someone in who&#39;s got the attack dog fighter instinct. i&#39;m not sure that coming from the pmo is necessarily the best uh the best play i played some of that role right we&#39;ve seen some of those roles being played by jason kenney staffers um i don&#39;t think i ever did it like this but i don&#39;t think i&#39;m in a position to throw rocks from my glass house uh so i&#39;m gonna say this is fabulous that was another segment well</span>
