Who&#39;s the biggest PR loser If Air Canada flight attendants vote down this deal. So what ultimately happens is if they vote down this deal, it goes to arbitration. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s binding arbitration. Shannon, you may have a better sense of it. I&#39;m just headline reading here. And I&#39;ll admit that.

But I think there was some other polling that Abacus did on Carney&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. And, you know, obviously, his strengths, you know, super solid on like, send him out onto the world stage, negotiate with Trump, manage the economy, you know, all those sort of big files. But his one weakness was understands what people like me go through. And I think they&#39;re missing the mark. It might not actually stick to him at all. But it&#39;s for the labor movement, certainly. It&#39;s another proof point. and i wouldn&#39;t you know a lot of people would be you know oh well like qp is mostly public sector workers yada yada you know i&#39;ve heard people say stuff like that the</span>

What can the union do tonight, heading into tomorrow when the members start voting, to try to reach, to make this a successful deal? I guess the question is fundamentally, what instruments, like help the public understand, what instruments does a labor union have on their members to push through a deal? And I&#39;m not talking about like push it through ham-fistedly, but like what&#39;s their persuasion technique what tools do they have what do they normally do in this situation because it might be a bit of a black box to the public between now and when the results come in but what is the union doing tonight tomorrow heading into this voting period what do you think i</span>

So let me give you some stats because you asked a question and I&#39;ll tell you what the article said. They have 3000 people that are volunteering. They&#39;ve acknowledged the 300,000 number that they need to hit. They threw out a story saying, you know, one person in Calgary gave them 8000 signatures in a day. Right. They&#39;ve mentioned they have got 20 to 30 events per day on their website that are signature gathering events that they&#39;ve had. So the answer to your question is no, they haven&#39;t told us how many signatures they&#39;ve gotten to the 300,000. but these are some of the stats they have given. That all being said, Carter, I&#39;m going to give you the opportunity to... Because I&#39;m genuinely curious here. I&#39;m judging you a bit, but I&#39;m willing to put that aside. Give me the Stephen Carter strategist case of what happens if Thomas Lukasik doesn&#39;t hit $300,000.

Do they do their own thing? What does their universe around this question need to look like? That&#39;s question one. I do want to talk for a second about Thomas Lukaszek, because he is a person with a profile that is now getting a bigger profile a decade or or so later from what you would think was his political high watermark.

I want to talk about that for a bit. And then finally, I want to talk about the rest of Canada. What sort of PR effort needs to happen to try to broadcast this petition to the rest of Canada? We are talking about Canada at its core, as much as we&#39;re talking about Alberta. Does it matter if the rest of the country knows about this? And does Alberta operate in the same way that Canada does, which is if people outside of your four walls are talking about it, you start to notice more. So I want to talk about those four strategy questions in some way.

The base voters are different than the activist base. And the activist base is, believe me, is engaged on this in New Democrat land. I have seen them all over the groups, and I see them, and there&#39;s all these names, and I&#39;m like, yeah, of course I know that person. I know that person.

You agree with how Forever Canada, their aperture could be different than the New Democrat one. So you agree with that point. What should the NDP strategy be beyond that? Should they be starting their own campaign? Walk me through this. Should they be setting up their own sort of version of this? Should they be piggyback simply on this? Should they push the timeline, push the narrative? Should they be trying to use their muscular abilities, communications list-wise to push this? Give me some answers here. What would you be doing?
