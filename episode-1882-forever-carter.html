          <p>Shannon Phillips and Stephen Carter dive into Alberta's "Forever Canada" petition campaign. Can Thomas Lukaszuk actually collect 294,000 signatures to keep Alberta in Canada? Should opposition parties work within grassroots campaigns or build their own parallel structures? And how many signatures can one person realistically gather in a day without violating the laws of physics? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p style="text-align: left;">You can also watch this episode on YouTube.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod</a></p>

They&#39;ve acknowledged the 300,000 number that they need to hit. They threw out a story saying, you know, one person in Calgary gave them 8000 signatures in a day. Right. They&#39;ve mentioned they have got 20 to 30 events per day on their website that are signature gathering events that they&#39;ve had. So the answer to your question is no, they haven&#39;t told us how many signatures they&#39;ve gotten to the 300,000. but these are some of the stats they have given. That all being said, Carter, I&#39;m going to give you the opportunity to... Because I&#39;m genuinely curious here. I&#39;m judging you a bit, but I&#39;m willing to put that aside. Give me the Stephen Carter strategist case of what happens if Thomas Lukasik doesn&#39;t hit $300,000.

Should they be starting their own campaign? Walk me through this. Should they be setting up their own sort of version of this? Should they be piggyback simply on this?
