        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Kenny's public foe Brian Jean securing the UCP nomination for the Fort McMurray by-election and a troubled situation south of the border. Should Jason Kenney be campaigning for Brian Jean? Should Brian Jean be campaigning for Kenney's job? And are we going to have to talk about the crumbling of democracy every time Stephen gets ratioed on Twitter? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

He is a local candidate who has an election upcoming. And rather than actually being in his riding to run for his seat, he has decided to go on a tour across the province to drum up enthusiasm for, I don&#39;t know what, I guess, kicking Jason Kenney to the curb. So this is all very weird. And it&#39;s all very par for the course for Alberta. I also am getting quite a kick out of the fact that, you know, we have become a Roman mob on the issue of Jason Kenney, will he survive? Will he not survive? Went from everybody saying he will absolutely not survive to his AGM and then saying, oh, it looks like he&#39;s going to survive to all of a sudden with no real change of fundamental facts along the way here. Brian Jean, where he was an MLA and an MP and where he is a bit of a local hero after the fires, wins his nomination.

You remember saying things like, well, I&#39;m not going to stop Brian Jean from running. That was mistake one. He should have just said he should get the fuck out of town. If he wants to run against me in a leadership, well, then there&#39;s a leadership contest review where he can do that. But we&#39;re not going to do this. It&#39;s not healthy for the party to have all these proxy battles, right? It&#39;s not the Cold War. This is a political party that&#39;s supposed to have common cause and common purpose. But then he went on to say, oh, I&#39;m sure people will have many difficult questions for Mr. Gene about the fact that he didn&#39;t finish off these two terms. No, they wouldn&#39;t.</div>

For you, it&#39;s more specific perhaps to what actions in the interim or even on the very short term does Canada, Justin Trudeau, Ottawa more specifically need to think about so as to not have that populist rage that could be fueled. And we don&#39;t know what it will look like, right, if and when this happens in the United States, that that doesn&#39;t cross the border immediately or that we&#39;re weathered as best as we can in that sense.

          <div class="said">Carter, Canada struggling to make progress on getting the U.S. to back down on their rebates on electric vehicles is, of course, part of the new massive legislation in the United States that gives Americans $12,500 rebate on buying an electric vehicle as long as it&#39;s made in the U.S. by union jobs. Canada feeling like this is a violation of the USMCA. Overrated or underrated in your mind, this story where Canada&#39;s now had one of the, I&#39;d say, harshest worded letters from Christopher Freeland to U.S. senators to try to overturn this, not making much progress.

And by the way, I did want to say, and I didn&#39;t manage to jam it in, it&#39;s not super new. The idea that the federal government would enforce or not something, and to be fair, Obama decided not to enforce certain immigration laws, right?
