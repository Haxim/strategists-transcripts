Party members in the constituency of Fort McMurray-Lac-Levish gave him 68 percent in his victory on Sunday after he ran on a platform of mobilizing disgruntled party members and forming for forcing, I should say, Premier Jason Kenney to resign. The by-election will have no local candidates defending Kenney or the current UCP leadership.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know barring something really shocking happening uh a ucp mla who got elected on a platform of the leader must go and uh and that&#39;s that doesn&#39;t seem like much of a team player and the fact that he&#39;s now going on a tour across the province he&#39;s going on a tour across the the province. He is a local candidate who has an election upcoming. And rather than actually being in his riding to run for his seat, he has decided to go on a tour across the province to drum up enthusiasm for, I don&#39;t know what, I guess, kicking Jason Kenney to the curb. So this is all very weird. And it&#39;s all very par for the course for Alberta. I also am getting quite a kick out of the fact that, you know, we have become a Roman mob on the issue of Jason Kenney, will he survive? Will he not survive? Went from everybody saying he will absolutely not survive to his AGM and then saying, oh, it looks like he&#39;s going to survive to all of a sudden with no real change of fundamental facts along the way here. Brian Jean, where he was an MLA and an MP and where he is a bit of a local hero after the fires, wins his nomination. All of a sudden, people are again saying, well, maybe Jason Kenney won&#39;t survive. right so uh it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s always good to update your priors and say we&#39;ve got new data does this change our view of jason kenney&#39;s survival or not but i really do think people are going pillar to post on this here and maybe it&#39;s a good time to just sort of take stock and say what&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what&#39;s actually going on at the ucp carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">carter cory&#39;s trying to be way too calm here we need to start swinging like a crazy pendulum he was he&#39;s not going to survive that&#39;s why i&#39;m here the shittiest week of his life tell this is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">is this is the end of jason kenny uh as you know uh just because a popular ml former mla former mp wins in the spot that they&#39;ve always won uh this is in fact a harpinger of doom for uh jason kenning uh there&#39;s no question about it um no i&#39;m kind of with ken with with our good friend uh cory hogan um which is always makes me upset uh but cory is correct uh everybody should Everybody, I think, knew that Brian Jean was going to win. I mean, if you didn&#39;t know, well, what are you talking about? I mean, I think that Jason</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Jason Kenney&#39;s team knew that Brian Jean was going to win. I mean, you can hope for good things, but there&#39;s no sense in just thinking this is actually going to happen. I mean, it was never going to happen. He allowed it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So there was certainly an optics error that was run by the Kenny team and by Jason Kenny himself here in that he raised expectations for his own proxy candidates performance. You remember saying things like, well, I&#39;m not going to stop Brian Jean from running. That was mistake one. He should have just said he should get the fuck out of town. If he wants to run against me in a leadership, well, then there&#39;s a leadership contest review where he can do that. But we&#39;re not going to do this. It&#39;s not healthy for the party to have all these proxy battles, right? It&#39;s not the Cold War. This is a political party that&#39;s supposed to have common cause and common purpose. But then he went on to say, oh, I&#39;m sure people will have many difficult questions for Mr. Gene about the fact that he didn&#39;t finish off these two terms. No, they wouldn&#39;t.</span>

The whole point is to let everybody into the big tent. He&#39;s coming into the big tent. People love him in this area. And I look forward to having him serve alongside the other, I can&#39;t remember how many MLAs he has, but let&#39;s say 60-some-odd MLAs. We&#39;re all going to surf together because that&#39;s the whole point. We&#39;re not going to backstab each other.

And this, again, I mean, I hate – I feel like I just bang on this drum too much. But he set himself up a future problem with his actions there. He won the day. He got the dig in on Brian Jean, right?

            <span class="text">brian gene comparing to Jason Kenney. Again, you know, have you seen a Jason Kenney speech recently? He&#39;s ramped up on the economy. He has got the economic speech in the can. I think that he&#39;s gone too far. I think that he&#39;s he&#39;s left behind the nine percent or nine and a half percent of Albertans that are still looking for work and another significant percentage that&#39;s underemployed. But it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">doesn&#39;t matter. His speeches bang on and people wanting to believe that will believe it. So I think that Jason Kenney versus Brian Jean is actually a fairly decent comparison.</span>

            <span class="text">capture tonight&#39;s victory? And maybe even, and I&#39;m going to try to impose this a bit, the 68%, like I think the percent is interesting to to me, especially with the leadership review in the coming days. I know you can&#39;t volley 68% until April, but I&#39;m kind of curious, like it&#39;s a sizable chunk that voted for this anti-Kenny agenda, if he calls it that. How does he leverage that in the coming days? How does he keep this going, this momentum alive and maybe turn the tide against the good weeks that Kenny&#39;s had in the last couple of weeks? Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that there were more rank and file conservatives, maybe not current membership holders, but people who are like like recently lapsed members or would be willing to buy without very much effort at all.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We always thought there were more of them who were opposed to Jason Kenney&#39;s leadership than supportive of it. That&#39;s based on public opinion polling that&#39;s out there asking, are you a conservative supporter? How do you feel about these things, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So in many ways, that 68, I think, is reflective of that. And perhaps maybe not even a spectacularly good number, given the other conditions that we know here. One, those were old Wild Rose ridings. That was Brian Jean&#39;s riding. There were still three in 10 conservatives up there who were not particularly keen about Brian Jean coming back and being the candidate there. That to me doesn&#39;t necessarily, like</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Which, by the way, is probably something that Jason Kenney should have said instead of suggesting that there&#39;d be real problems with him out in the riding, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I don&#39;t know that the math has fundamentally changed there. They did sell a lot of memberships for that nomination contest. There&#39;s no question about that. They are all in the Fort McMurray ridings, the two that are right next to each other there. I don&#39;t know if that will translate into people showing up at this leadership review. view it seems to me like that&#39;s a pretty long drive and uh and we haven&#39;t necessarily seen that kind of translation yet uh but he&#39;ll</span>

And we don&#39;t know what it will look like, right, if and when this happens in the United States, that that doesn&#39;t cross the border immediately or that we&#39;re weathered as best as we can in that sense.

            <span class="text">Carter, Canada struggling to make progress on getting the U.S. to back down on their rebates on electric vehicles is, of course, part of the new massive legislation in the United States that gives Americans $12,500 rebate on buying an electric vehicle as long as it&#39;s made in the U.S. by union jobs. Canada feeling like this is a violation of the USMCA. Overrated or underrated in your mind, this story where Canada&#39;s now had one of the, I&#39;d say, harshest worded letters from Christopher Freeland to U.S. senators to try to overturn this, not making much progress. The story, overrated or underrated in your mind?</span>

And by the way, I did want to say, and I didn&#39;t manage to jam it in, it&#39;s not super new. The idea that the federal government would enforce or not something, and to be fair, Obama decided not to enforce certain immigration laws, right?
