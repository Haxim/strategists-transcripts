            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think my reasons are it gives you a legitimacy. It also gives you the common experience with the MLAs that are currently sitting in the legislature. It keeps you close to them. You know, keep your friends close and your enemies closer. And MLAs in your caucus are both your friends and your enemies. They tend to be the ones who take you out if things go horribly wrong. So my view would be that you want to make sure that you&#39;re in the legislature. That&#39;s where the media happens. We&#39;ve talked a little bit about dome disease and getting a little bit caught up in in the uh the the the</span>

            <span class="text">the parry and thrust of the uh of the question period stuff but i think that nowhead would be able to kind of keep things on the question of the day keep things focused on the media opportunity of the day and if he&#39;s in the legislature he&#39;s going to be able to take advantage much stronger yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah well i i agree with that i think that the the one for me that&#39;s the most important is and it can&#39;t be understated if he has a challenge going forward it&#39;s that he&#39;s He&#39;s an outsider and he&#39;s not necessarily known.</span>

Somebody who was a lifelong New Democrat, somebody who&#39;s just more naturally collegial. I think being there is important because, A, it puts you in the trenches with them. It helps them see you at your best. You&#39;re very quick on your feet. You&#39;re going to be very good in the legislature. Dome disease will be a problem, but can I tell you something about dome disease? Your ability to pop it from the outside is zero because they will just think you don&#39;t get it and you don&#39;t understand. but if you&#39;re also there with the same stimulus the same inputs you are able to say hey listen i know we&#39;re all wrapped up in this right now but this is not what&#39;s leading the polls right now this is not what we&#39;re hearing at the doorsteps this is not what&#39;s coming through our various channels you saying that from the outside not also subject to dome disease just makes</span>

The other reason is a little more prosaic. You haven&#39;t mentioned it, but like, it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">same as the premier, which would be pretty normal. I think, you know, giving top-ups to get the same as the premier from official opposition, that&#39;s about 200 grand. You&#39;re going to just take that out of the party over the next three years, that&#39;s 600 grand. You know, there&#39;d still likely be a top-up with him in the house but it would be tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands yeah</span>

And certainly for an organization like a city, that should be the case, right? You have plans for these kinds of things, but you want to be establishing those channels and making sure that they are all like of an appropriate fidelity.

So that&#39;s a bit of a challenge the other is the way that many of them have started to prioritize content based on engagement rather than recency you might not be looking at the most recent updates so be aware of the strengths and limitations of these channels and this is why you want to maybe be controlling your own sources of truth and even if you have an update always ending it with like for most up to the minute updates go to calgary.ca slash pipe burst or whatever right like it doesn&#39;t even matter but</span>

We were having an emergency one time with the city of Calgary getting a windstorm that was breaking glass and dropping it onto the streets. At that time, we left it with the minister. But it&#39;s relatively straightforward. When do you need to move it to a politician? Well, you move it to a politician when you&#39;re asking people to do something,</span>

I know you can handle two things at the same time. Carter, one thing enough for him, too much. When do you bring in a politician is question number one. What is a Corey Hogan playbook on this? And number two, I think more interestingly and perhaps even more importantly, does your politician, does your principal need to be the explainer in chief? Do they need to be the summarizer in chief? Or do you leave that to your experts? Like, what is the role they want to play, right? And I know we in Calgary have seen politicians play different roles. They stand up and then they cede the mic to others. They&#39;re just there for introductory comments. Some are more explainer-in-chief style. Others are more, hey, trust the experts. Others kind of lay down the law, being like, you fucking heard what this person said. Follow what the fucking person said. What is your model for a politician in a crisis? First, when they should come in. Secondly, what is their job, Corey?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, great question. And I think that the way I answered it just before you came on is probably the strongest answer one can give. But if I were going to recap and take, like, a second swing at this particular one, I would say politicians are the conduit. I would never tell you I didn&#39;t like it the first time, so this is how I do it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Really emphasize the point. You elect a politician, and the politician brings your views forward to government. But it&#39;s also a necessary and essential function that you sort of distill and summarize and communicate government back to the electorate as well. And obviously, and especially in these very charged times, we tend to think about that largely in terms of like torque and spin, but there is a foundational communications role to the job. So when you need to activate that role, like when you actually are asking people to do something and not just like say, oh, that&#39;s interesting that X happened, then that&#39;s the time for politicians. And what I was saying, which I better just get out here now, before you came was, we&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">we&#39;re so used to politicians doing that well and effortlessly. It&#39;s a bit shocking when politicians don&#39;t, right? Like even a bad politician is usually a great communicator, because that&#39;s how they got the job. That&#39;s how they get selected into the job.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">in times of crisis, is their job principally being the person, like the one point of contact? Or are they kind of like a head of a team that they kind of draw attention to something, that their job is to kind of be like, listen to these experts? Or do they have to indeed assume the role of quasi expert to kind of be the explainer? And this may sound like semantics, but I think this is perhaps at the heart of, you know, some basic crisis communications in terms of what the role of a politician is. What do you think from your perspective?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think you need to surround the politician with actual experts. I think that our ability to respect expertise is certainly lower today than it ever has been.

All three of us in any organization we&#39;re on would be just the spokesperson all of the time if that was the only consideration, but there are other considerations at play here. and and it&#39;s not just technical competency either it&#39;s like it&#39;s the gravitas it&#39;s the heft it&#39;s the fact that you are the person who can marshal resources and it creates confidence when you are the decider and you are telling them this as well so that matters and and one of the things that you&#39;re always trying to do in every presentation i&#39;ve said this before and i&#39;ll say it again you like you&#39;re trying to fill to the level needed for four buckets you want to make sure that you&#39;ve established your credibility on a matter you want to establish comprehension of the matter. You want to establish the relevance of the matter to you, the listener, and you want to establish urgency. You want to establish the need to act, right? That&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to do in every presentation to varying degrees. Like if you go in and you&#39;re like a professor of medicine, you probably don&#39;t need to spend a ton of time explaining that you know how the human body works, right? Credibility comes pretty full.</span>

On the other hand, if you&#39;re that same professor, but the setting changes and you&#39;re at a medical conference, You might actually need to push that credibility up a bit. So you&#39;re always sort of trying to assess where those are. And one of the things that a politician brings is, strangely,</span>

You don&#39;t need to worry that you&#39;re playing a game of telephone. phone they also have a great deal of strength with creating uh relevance and urgency and comprehension frankly like this this is their skill set so um it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of important that that you have a politician involved when it hits a certain level for a bunch of reasons not least of which is they&#39;re the boss but also because they naturally have this skill set when you talk about like the broader need to communicate though most</span>

Or is it to say, in times of crisis, I&#39;m running this show, and I run this city, right? At the end of the day, you know, I&#39;m not a domain expert on everything that goes on, but I put on the jacket and I run run this city? What is the right posture for someone in that?

I&#39;m not suggesting that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing, but I&#39;m saying generally people often judge politicians&#39; actions in that sense. But there is actually a, are we going to get through the emergency, whether or not people are happy about it, sense that we need to consider as well. So</span>

            <span class="text">So there&#39;s that. And what&#39;s important there is clear communication, clear direction, and not having any kind of, like, fuzziness as to what you&#39;re supposed to do. And I think the most dangerous thing in a moment like that, and this is where I&#39;ll sort of pick up specifically on this Calgary situation, is, man, I&#39;ll tell you, like, if your direction is strong and then it weakens and it goes strong and it weakens again, as I would argue has been the case with some of the communications in Calgary, people will not know where they are. Like you can go from like very strong and kind of ease off. You can go from eased off to very strong. But if the fact base has not fundamentally changed otherwise, like to seesaw back and forth, it&#39;s just going to be confusing for people. It&#39;s going to have confusing conversations across households, across the city where people say, hey, we should give the kids a bath. and the other spouse says no i don&#39;t think we&#39;re supposed to do that right now and the other spouse says no they need to and i think the mayor said it&#39;s okay and the other one says no i actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s okay right now and we don&#39;t really need to like they&#39;re not that dirty right like people are legitimately confused at a moment like that and so you do need to think about what&#39;s going to get us through the crisis because like</span>

And so at the end of it, they might judge you high on the political side, but you&#39;ve probably gotten very lucky to get through it in a sense where you&#39;ve actually managed the crisis.

But the reason we don&#39;t want people to play politics during a crisis is we don&#39;t want them thinking about the takes and puts of politics at a moment when lives are on the line, when reputation&#39;s on the line, when money&#39;s on the line, right? You want them thinking clearly and exclusively about the matter in front of them.</span>

This is what I&#39;m going to tell is how I&#39;m going to provide it. That&#39;s true at the provincial level too, right? And you see it, it doesn&#39;t necessarily manifest in the same way. Like you&#39;re not letting the official opposition know the minute before you tell everybody if the provincial operations center has been activated. That simply does not happen. And do</span>

            <span class="text">do you agree with Carter that like what they&#39;re looking for is just information? Is there anything else that they need? And frankly, can you overcompensate by like giving them too much or bringing them into the entire sort of fact base or those sort of things in a spirit of collaboration or transparency? I&#39;m kind of curious if just the raw facts early is simply all they need.</span>

            <span class="text">no i certainly not um although i think that might be all they need but it&#39;s not all they want is maybe a better way to put it right they they want to be involved in it they think their judgment is better than yours that&#39;s the nature of it they think they do a better job of running the government that&#39;s why they&#39;re running against you for the government so they want to hear they&#39;re going to believe that like them putting out the like one thing on facebook was more impactful than you using the entire apparatus of government to communicate something like oh i talked to bob And Bob said he wouldn&#39;t know what the fuck to do if it wasn&#39;t for my Facebook posts. Yeah, no, Bob could have figured it out. In fact, was probably more confused by your Facebook posts if he had just gone to the government side, right? But you do want to make sure they&#39;re informed because they are, at this moment, if politics are aside, part of the team. Team communicate. Team communicate what needs to happen. And they need to be able to answer those questions. And especially because their bias is not necessarily going to be that you&#39;re such a super smart person, you need to spend the time and explain these things and make sure that they also have the information they need. But it would be bonkers to have counselors running around also giving like updates to the mayor&#39;s briefing. That&#39;s chaos. You know, we often say in crisis communications, you know, many brains, one voice. You may have</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">terms of the public servants that&#39;s a super interesting question it&#39;s one that obviously interests me as as somebody who was a public servant right you hmm you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you you know you don&#39;t necessarily always 100 trust the politicians but in my experience the public servants really appreciate the skill set politicians bring in a crisis and i think this is actually true of the communications industry more generally people will often look at us and think oh it&#39;s just fluff oh it&#39;s just like you know putting the right color on the brochure until there&#39;s a fucking crisis right and then everybody is staring at you and saying what do we say how do we say it and that&#39;s when you can really step up and explain the value of communications and we&#39;ve already talked about the fact politicians are communicators first and foremost.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And I generally think that public servants are generally fairly grateful for politicians at these moments. Again, because politicians are often willing to accept the expertise more so at that moment too. They also want to know what the solutions are. And everybody is just sort of rowing in the same direction with a single cause. You&#39;ve got experts, you&#39;ve got everybody back at the operations center, you&#39;ve got the people on the ground who are performing the work, and you have the politicians doing politician things that you need them to do. and so it really does create a sense of like team like with everybody going on and in terms of how you maintain that and ensure that that&#39;s happening as like the communicator in chief who&#39;s out there you don&#39;t fucking throw your team under the bus that&#39;s like that&#39;s just it right like you you make sure that everybody knows that you&#39;re all working together and it&#39;s certainly not a time for recriminations ever</span>

They make sure that that the first time that the general counsel and the head of communications have to hash it out isn&#39;t the real thing. And you can start to work through some of those things kind of in a safer environment and identify some of these challenges ahead of time. And that you have a certain amount of camaraderie by the time you sort of hit the real show, right? But those tensions are fucking real.

            <span class="text">Corey, this is, of course, not unique to this situation. We&#39;ve seen politicians continue to be, well, politicians, partisan politicians in times of crisis. Most recently, I look at the provincial side, not even most recently, but a recent example, I think it&#39;s fair to say, when Danielle Smith blamed Stephen Gilbeau for the cold snap and the electrical grid conversation that we were having in Alberta in the broadest strokes, she took to that as one of her primary talking points. But I want to get your like guide on this. Do you share the same view as Carter that there&#39;s it&#39;s airtight, no blame, or even in providing context or providing, you know, when people want to know the why of something happened, shouldn&#39;t you just be honest, even if that means you&#39;re blaming another order of government, your predecessor, etc?</span>

And say, well, your rules were way ahead of where we were. And that&#39;s how you, quote unquote, get away with it, or that&#39;s how you lessen the pain of it. But again, here in Calgary, we saw Mayor Gondek somewhat suggest that the province wasn&#39;t paying enough and that&#39;s why this occurred. And then the Premier smashed it right back in the Mayor&#39;s face saying, why don&#39;t you focus on the things actually the city&#39;s responsible for instead of stuff like upzoning, right?

I know, Corey, you&#39;re talking about the optics of ensuring that it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re doing things for reputation and you&#39;re here to solve the issue that is in front of the electorate. But I want to actually get a strategist&#39;s sense of reputation management in a crisis, especially when things are not going well. If things are going well, it&#39;s easy to kind of like retweet, oh, like you&#39;re a hero, et cetera, all those sort of things. You find ways to make sure people are reminded of that.

You&#39;re going to fuck it up. Like just, you know, acknowledge also your limits as a human and focus on the thing that matters in front of you.
