            <span class="text">Corey, do you want to apologize? Carter is the master of the double down. John, you are a more sane, rational, introspective individual. Will we be getting an apology or a course correction from you in regards to the pure political intent of Pierre Polyev&#39;s letter not being the business community, which you advocated for for a good hour, I would say, last episode?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I for sure stand by it. I think what these people assume, because they are wrong, is that Pierre Polyev has some sort of like, really awesome deep ties to the business community. And if he was trying to deliver a message to 1000 business leaders at once, he would just go into like the WhatsApp chat called, you know, tycoons and just say, Hey, guys, this is the new strategy. But that&#39;s actually not how the world works. And here in the real world, when you&#39;re trying to communicate with a lot of people, even if that is fewer than all of Canada, Canada, then you use media like this. So, yeah. But people can&#39;t fathom that. They can&#39;t imagine that you would try to deliver a message through a newspaper to anybody short of everybody. And that&#39;s wrong. And it was a wrong idea supported by Stephen Carter, who is, and</span>

            <span class="text">strategy conversation, maybe even, Carter, a partially a tactic conversation, because many would characterize as to what Daniel Smith and the UCP are doing right now as the political art of flooding the zone.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I want you to help me understand what this concept of flooding the zone is, where it&#39;s kind of come from. Is it relatively new? Is it a Trump sort of era creation? What are we seeing right now provincially? Would you classify that as flooding the zone? And how does one combat it and what are its limitations? Because while the NDP, aforementioned vis-a-vis Gill, are in a leadership race, the UCP perhaps are taking advantage of putting out a lot of big ticket items, none of which we can keep up with. So, Carter, talk to me about this concept of flooding the zone. When did you first hear of it? Are you a fan of it? What does it mean to you as a practitioner, as a strategist? And I want to spend a good amount of time on this particular political strategy that I don&#39;t think, I think gets a lot of buzziness, but doesn&#39;t get a lot of examination. emanation yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i think that this isn&#39;t i mean certainly not the first time um that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that we&#39;ve seen this i think that the probably the most recent example of of the flooding the zone took a little bit different format it was stephen harper&#39;s omnibus motions right where he would put together uh inside of the budget a whole bunch of different pieces uh legislation that would be changed right Right. And so you would have multiple thousand page bill that was one. There was an omnibus. It touched a whole bunch of pieces of legislation and it changed it. I mean, arguably, the Municipal Act Bill 20</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">20 is something of an omnibus bill. It&#39;s changing two different pieces of legislation, the Local Authorities Election Act and the Municipal Government Act. act um so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so it&#39;s a bit of an omnibus but stephen harper did massive omnibus pieces of legislation he flooded the zone by making it virtually impossible for one person to know every element of the bill that was before them and being debated before them uh so i i would say that this isn&#39;t a new tactic it is a tactic that tends to work uh because you are able to remove people&#39;s um ability to focus on something. One person, one opposition party might be arguing about one piece and then another opposition party would be arguing about just the simple logistics of the bill. So there&#39;s multiple ways that this can be argued against. And each of those different ways that it&#39;s argued against helps to water down the various pieces of opposition so it&#39;s it&#39;s not new it&#39;s been done many many times before um and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, give me your understanding of its genesis from your perspective. I&#39;m not asking for a birth date. But like I am asking for is this in your mind a pre Trump or post Trump sort of phenomenon and to use the simplest and perhaps the laziest political timestamp in that sense?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think that Trump is the reason for it. I think Trump is a symptom of it. You see an awful lot of people pushing an awful lot of ideological policy, and you have an awful lot less regard for this notion of governing slowly and calmly, right? And it&#39;s interesting that Stephen brings up Harper and his Harper&#39;s Omnibus. One of the things I think about when I think about Stephen Harper is a guy who governed far less conservative than he was,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was, right? He decided, I&#39;m going to go more towards the middle. That&#39;s how I&#39;m going to win elections. in daniel smith we have an entirely different model of politician we have somebody who is happy to present themselves as a moderate and then run as as kind of like tinkering and experimentally right-wing a government as conceivable and so you talk about flooding the zone and honestly even the bill numbers tell you you&#39;re not wrong like the fact that we&#39;re talking about bills numbered into the 20s tells you it&#39;s been a pretty robust session of the the legislature yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s also kind of been par for the course and she&#39;s been a leader like it&#39;s just thing after thing after thing and it was a little bit more reserved in that period just before the election but even then not really she was still doing a lot of stuff she was still announcing a number of things how she was gonna kind of you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know fix health care in x number of days and yes she didn&#39;t blow up ahs then but it was you know she was doing she</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">she fired ahs is uh uh, uh, you know, leadership. And this has been a government that&#39;s been governing just like with their whole fucking ass the entire time that she&#39;s, uh, that she&#39;s been in charge here. Like she&#39;s really, really going for it. And so it&#39;s kind of tough for me to say that they&#39;re flooding the zone at this particular moment when it feels like there&#39;s just kind of like a pipe burst and the water is perpetual and it&#39;s just filling the area all of the time. And I get this sense that next semester or next semester, next session, you&#39;re going to see the exact same, right? You&#39;re going to see another 20 bills of experimental</span>

If we&#39;re talking about folks with ideology, as soon as they get power, going quick, fast into the last chapter, does the size of the mandate matter anymore to you? Is that an outdated political principle in some ways? If this was another episode, I&#39;d go in the, why the fuck do we still do this segment of the show? But Corey&#39;s almost unearthed it for me. Does mandate size matter anymore?</span>

            <span class="text">No, no, it really doesn&#39;t. And I&#39;ll tell you why. Because political power is what you make of it. And when you invest, you invest in political power. So when you&#39;re using your political power, when you&#39;re when you&#39;re doing all this activity that Danielle Smith is doing, you are doing it for a political reason. And that political reason is often to grow your political power in the end game. I think that Danielle Smith is doing all of these things because she believes it&#39;ll make her more popular, not less. Now, that more popular may be with a very specific group of people who are going to go and do a leadership review in the fall of 2020, 2024. That might be all the audience that she tries to appeal to. Or she might be thinking, the municipalities are historically, historically unpopular. I think that&#39;s both true of Calgary and Edmonton. If we pick on Calgary and Edmonton, then we become more popular, because</span>

And all of a sudden, 63 days later, he&#39;s winning the election. How does that happen? It happens because we have huge political culture shifts. You don&#39;t see, you know, minor slow growths. 2015, Rachel Notley comes out of nowhere to win the election. You know, even Justin Trudeau comes from third place to win in 2015. um these these vehicles this isn&#39;t slow builds anymore this is we are going to put together the coalition that people want and we&#39;re going to put the person in front of it that people fall in love with and all hell breaks loose obama</span>

Well, fuck the other guys more, so I guess I&#39;m on board. And the consequences of you... We&#39;ve seen that play out so many times. Well, they have nowhere else to go, right? They&#39;ve created such a gap between themselves and the other party. Their choices are retirement or getting behind the leader. You&#39;re not seeing floor crossing. You&#39;re not seeing moderation the way that you did before. And what tends to bring down the leaders is a lack of purity, not kind of a lack of pragmatism.

            <span class="text">way more than they should. It&#39;s disproportionate. It&#39;s disproportionate, the threats that are faced by female candidates. It&#39;s noteworthy to note that Deepika Damerla is in second place, also a female candidate in Mississauga. And she was at the debate today. So I suspect that Carolyn Parrish was more concerned about herself saying something ridiculously stupid than any particular threats that may or may not have been uttered towards her. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, Corey, just to add a bit more color to this. So at the previous debate, this candidate that has just pulled out of the debates said about refugees, quote, they have a bed, they get a meal a day, and they sit around smoking cigarettes all day because they have nothing to do. It&#39;s a waste of energy. It&#39;s a waste of our money. She says that at a debate. She then subsequently announces that this is her new debate strategy, which is to not do debates. I knew Carter would know the context. I was going to add it in between the questions. But Corey, the art of this, how would you do it if you were her, right? Like, you know, she clearly now has a policy of not doing debates any longer because she&#39;s not good at them or she doesn&#39;t want to do them based on her track record. But if you had to clean up this mess, how would you do it as a political practitioner for her on her behalf? I&#39;m looking less for analysis and more for like a strategy for her that would perhaps maybe be a bit more elegant than what she&#39;s presented here.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, interesting. So not so much can you get away with avoiding debates because clearly you can in these charged times, right? Everybody will forgive their candidate for all sorts of sins. But what&#39;s a more elegant way to get out of going to the debate, right? I mean, she could have done the classic. She walks up to the lectern. She reaches for her phone at one point and says, oh, I&#39;m sorry, I got to take this. and then says the hospital and then bolts out of there i think that would be like a lot of intrigue that that&#39;s pretty good i like that a lot and then if people ask questions you say i&#39;m</span>
