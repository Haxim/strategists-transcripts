        <p>The gang eulogize the leadership campaign of Gil McGowan before turning to volume-of-political-change as a tactic. Corey remembers he has the ability to edit the audio to embarrass Stephen with his eight-year-old prediction.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the strategy/tactic of "flooding the zone" - how it works, why it seems more common these days, and how it can be resisted by opposition parties - before turning to how to artfully pull out of a debate. Is frequent "flooding the zone" a consequence of more ideological politics? How do you avoid debates when people already know you're bad at them? And how much weaker is the Alberta NDP leadership contest with the loss of Gil McGowan and his 1964 energy? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I think what these people assume, because they are wrong, is that Pierre Polyev has some sort of like, really awesome deep ties to the business community.

But that&#39;s actually not how the world works. And here in the real world, when you&#39;re trying to communicate with a lot of people, even if that is fewer than all of Canada, Canada, then you use media like this. So, yeah. But people can&#39;t fathom that. They can&#39;t imagine that you would try to deliver a message through a newspaper to anybody short of everybody. And that&#39;s wrong.

What are we seeing right now provincially? Would you classify that as flooding the zone? And how does one combat it and what are its limitations? Because while the NDP, aforementioned vis-a-vis Gill, are in a leadership race, the UCP perhaps are taking advantage of putting out a lot of big ticket items, none of which we can keep up with. So, Carter, talk to me about this concept of flooding the zone. When did you first hear of it? Are you a fan of it? What does it mean to you as a practitioner, as a strategist? And I want to spend a good amount of time on this particular political strategy that I don&#39;t think, I think gets a lot of buzziness, but doesn&#39;t get a lot of examination. emanation yeah</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">that we&#39;ve seen this i think that the probably the most recent example of of the flooding the zone took a little bit different format it was stephen harper&#39;s omnibus motions right where he would put together uh inside of the budget a whole bunch of different pieces uh legislation that would be changed right Right. And so you would have multiple thousand page bill that was one. There was an omnibus. It touched a whole bunch of pieces of legislation and it changed it. I mean, arguably, the Municipal Act Bill 20</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">20 is something of an omnibus bill. It&#39;s changing two different pieces of legislation, the Local Authorities Election Act and the Municipal Government Act. act um so</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">so it&#39;s a bit of an omnibus but stephen harper did massive omnibus pieces of legislation he flooded the zone by making it virtually impossible for one person to know every element of the bill that was before them and being debated before them uh so i i would say that this isn&#39;t a new tactic it is a tactic that tends to work uh because you are able to remove people&#39;s um ability to focus on something. One person, one opposition party might be arguing about one piece and then another opposition party would be arguing about just the simple logistics of the bill. So there&#39;s multiple ways that this can be argued against. And each of those different ways that it&#39;s argued against helps to water down the various pieces of opposition so it&#39;s it&#39;s not new it&#39;s been done many many times before um and</div>

If we&#39;re talking about folks with ideology, as soon as they get power, going quick, fast into the last chapter, does the size of the mandate matter anymore to you? Is that an outdated political principle in some ways? If this was another episode, I&#39;d go in the, why the fuck do we still do this segment of the show? But Corey&#39;s almost unearthed it for me.

So when you&#39;re using your political power, when you&#39;re when you&#39;re doing all this activity that Danielle Smith is doing, you are doing it for a political reason. And that political reason is often to grow your political power in the end game. I think that Danielle Smith is doing all of these things because she believes it&#39;ll make her more popular, not less. Now, that more popular may be with a very specific group of people who are going to go and do a leadership review in the fall of 2020, 2024. That might be all the audience that she tries to appeal to. Or she might be thinking, the municipalities are historically, historically unpopular.

We&#39;ve seen that play out so many times. Well, they have nowhere else to go, right? They&#39;ve created such a gap between themselves and the other party. Their choices are retirement or getting behind the leader. You&#39;re not seeing floor crossing. You&#39;re not seeing moderation the way that you did before.

          <div class="said">ultimately saying she&#39;s afraid to face the residents, face the people, things you would expect, they would say. Carter, we&#39;ve talked at length about debates, about the low cost or no cost of pulling out of debates. But this is fascinating to me. Someone pulling out in such a public way rather than having like a I don&#39;t have a debate policy and then and then issuing a policy. What do you make of something like this in terms of how you say no, how you get out of something? Are you fine with this strategy? Two lines, we&#39;re not doing it, we&#39;re moving on. Is this a 24-hour story and it&#39;s over for her? I want to almost litmus test the current political world and how this strategy aligns with it.</div>

If you say this at the beginning, and this is one of the reasons I think that the CPC candidates never show up for the first debate. If you don&#39;t show up for the first debate, then it doesn&#39;t matter, you know, if you perform poorly. Carolyn Parrish performed poorly at the at the first debate. She subsequently says, I feel threatened and I&#39;m no longer going to participate in the debates. It puts a question in the voter&#39;s mind. Is she not participating because she says stupid things or is she not participating because</div>

It&#39;s noteworthy to note that Deepika Damerla is in second place, also a female candidate in Mississauga. And she was at the debate today. So I suspect that Carolyn Parrish was more concerned about herself saying something ridiculously stupid than any particular threats that may or may not have been uttered towards her. Carter,</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, Corey, just to add a bit more color to this. So at the previous debate, this candidate that has just pulled out of the debates said about refugees, quote, they have a bed, they get a meal a day, and they sit around smoking cigarettes all day because they have nothing to do. It&#39;s a waste of energy. It&#39;s a waste of our money. She says that at a debate. She then subsequently announces that this is her new debate strategy, which is to not do debates. I knew Carter would know the context. I was going to add it in between the questions. But Corey, the art of this, how would you do it if you were her, right? Like, you know, she clearly now has a policy of not doing debates any longer because she&#39;s not good at them or she doesn&#39;t want to do them based on her track record. But if you had to clean up this mess, how would you do it as a political practitioner for her on her behalf? I&#39;m looking less for analysis and more for like a strategy for her that would perhaps maybe be a bit more elegant than what she&#39;s presented here.</div>

Everybody will forgive their candidate for all sorts of sins. But what&#39;s a more elegant way to get out of going to the debate, right? I mean, she could have done the classic. She walks up to the lectern. She reaches for her phone at one point and says, oh, I&#39;m sorry, I got to take this. and then says the hospital and then bolts out of there i think that would be like a lot of intrigue that that&#39;s pretty good i like that a lot and then if people ask questions you say i&#39;m</div>
