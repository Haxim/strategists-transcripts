        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan assemble their fantasy cabinets for Trudeau's first government. How are cabinets assembled? What do the powers-that-be consider when creating such a body? And honestly, why would Corey pick a journalist from Newfoundland to be Minister of Finance? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

And then you, you add in the second tier of rocks, the smart ones, the people who, um, have to be there for a whole bunch of different reasons. Uh, they may not have been loyal to you in the past, but you, you grab those people and then you fill in the small sand. Uh, Those people that are virtually indistinguishable from one another but are being chosen for gender reasons or regional regions. So you&#39;ll find, I mean, I&#39;ve put in a couple of people in my cabinet that in my notes I put last second edition because now I need this.

But I think when you think about a country like Canada, and as big and diverse as we are, there is no doubt a pretty broad understanding that cabinets reflect regions. We go out and we make sure we have regional representation. But where I&#39;ve seen MPs go off the rails in the past is that they believe just because they&#39;re expected to reflect regions that they should act regionally. and when you&#39;re building a cabinet especially for a country like this with so many diverse opinions think about alberta think about quebec think about the maritimes you need to make sure that you can put yourself in somebody else&#39;s shoes and think about these issues in a way you have to show you have a mind for cabinet in a country like canada this is not a very easy country to govern at the best of times and when it&#39;s divided it can be very difficult and that&#39;s what uh where i think think sometimes MPs make a mistake. Yes, they don&#39;t want to just be the champion for Calgary, for example. They need to be the champion from Calgary who can put themselves in the shoes of someone from Trois-Rivières. I</div>
