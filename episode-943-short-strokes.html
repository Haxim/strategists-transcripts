That&#39;s not tracked in all of the polls. And in fact, ECOS, I think, has actually shown the conservatives after tightening, opening up a little bit of a lead again, small numbers, small samples, can&#39;t see too much in that. But it</span>

And I think what is pretty universal commentary that it was not a great night for Trudeau and it was a fine night for O&#39;Toole almost as a result, right?</span>

Maybe Canadians just liked what he said. Maybe they liked his climate plan&#39;s ambition. Maybe they liked the fact that he said, hey, I can&#39;t believe you wanted to put the flag back up on September 30th. And I don&#39;t know. I mean, it&#39;s possible that this was more about content than it was style. And maybe they thought that those answers that I described as overstuffed were robust and comprehensive. It&#39;s possible. It&#39;s not necessarily the theory that I would give the most credence too because it feels like a lot of people who watched the debate came to the same conclusion that was a bit of a rough night for the prime minister but it&#39;s certainly possible</span>

            <span class="text">theory two, the debates were awful, but they made people think that maybe Trudeau could lose. Then you look at who&#39;s going going to win this election. And that&#39;s numbers that we&#39;ve seen throughout the election. If we see there was a significant spike in that week over week, it&#39;s a pretty reasonable hypothesis that that can be attributed to the debate, given that polling actually ran in the other direction during that particular week, right? The Liberals climbed in the polls relative to the Conservatives. So that would be pretty strong justification for theory number two. Theory number three you test on is really easy. You just poll and you say who won the debate. And if we see that the plurality of canadians think that trudeau won the debate in particularly people in that red orange switching group or in that red blue switching group then yeah you can say okay he probably did better in the debate in in the final summation than people thought theory four that carter spoken into existence is a little bit harder to test but we would go back at the rich body of data that shows that whenever stephen carter makes a prediction in politics the opposite comes true and that that that would also be useful. If you can exclude all of your other theories, that&#39;s when you land back on maybe the debates didn&#39;t have an effect at all. But this is your opportunity almost to look for the ones that are testable and say, okay,</span>

            <span class="text">carter i want to get into a bit of strategy perhaps accepting the fact that that Trudeau is now perhaps in the lead. Let&#39;s just assume that we&#39;re at Tuesday. We get a couple more days, we&#39;ll find out very quickly, of this sort of tracking poll, and Trudeau&#39;s in the lead. The question I have for you, Carter, is, is a lead a lead a lead? And what I mean by that is, if you&#39;re the liberal camp, are you acting exactly the same, regardless of which of these theories got you the lead in the final stretch? Or is there any nuance or difference that you need to consider with how you got that lead and what your messaging may look like going forward? So for example, if the lead was just like the debate didn&#39;t matter, you&#39;re powering through, suppose you&#39;re able to figure this out, or you have a good hunch yourself internally, because they&#39;re doing reams of polling that we don&#39;t have access to, or the resources to do. So the question I have for you, are any of these theories creating a different sort of outcome for you strategically in how you use and capitalize that lead? Or are all leads the same and your strategy is singular and you power through? through if</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I want to ask you the same question I asked Carter, which is, how are you dealing with this lead? If you can tease out which theory got you this lead. And then Carter, save that thought you just had, because it&#39;s a really good one about either party or either campaign acknowledging that they&#39;re in a lead in the final days. What&#39;s the strategic choice they want to make? But Corey, to that first question, suppose the Liberal lead is validated in the next couple of days with a few tracking polls. Do these theories matter in terms of your actions going forward?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, they absolutely matter. A lead is not a lead is not a lead. And I&#39;d go further, Zane. I&#39;d say it&#39;s absolutely essential you understand why it&#39;s happening, because otherwise you could make decisions that are incredibly self-defeating.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So let&#39;s just say it was the theory three that Trudeau actually won the debate. Well, then you want to get that content out there. You want to talk about all of these strong arguments, and you want to look strong. But that cuts against theory two. two, because if theory two is O&#39;Toole could win, this is what moved people into your camp. Then you going out and looking strong and acting as though you&#39;re going to win. This thing doesn&#39;t help you at all. O&#39;Toole could win. This requires an entirely different strategy.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And if it&#39;s theory one, you don&#39;t bundle any of this. It&#39;s a waste of your time. You&#39;re going to be talking about an event that fundamentally doesn&#39;t matter for people. So you do need to understand what&#39;s driving the polls. Otherwise you&#39;re just a bit of a nihilist. You&#39;re just somebody who&#39;s drifting And very amateurishly just picking on things that you have a gut feeling worked or not. So I suspect that they&#39;re working very hard to understand why people are moving, where they&#39;re moving, how they&#39;re moving. Because the alternative is you could absolutely blow yourself up in the final week of the campaign, which you cannot afford to do.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, let me ask my final question on this and start with you first, because Carter gave me a few of his thoughts. Either camp, O&#39;Toole or Trudeau, are you acknowledging, you know, let&#39;s just say this thing remains tight. They&#39;re up in a few. You&#39;re up in a few. Is the best strategy to acknowledge that you&#39;re in the lead and showcase the poles that say you&#39;re in the lead and wave those around and run as a front runner? Or is it to say this thing is tight or run as an underdog? Do you feel like there&#39;s a strategic lane that&#39;s most advantageous in this final seven-day stretch that we&#39;re going to be on come tomorrow?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, again, it will really depend on what your strategy is. And sometimes you want to look like a winner when</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The general rule, the default adage, is to act like you&#39;re 10 votes behind, right? Because you do want people to feel as though they have to keep their foot on the gas on your team. They&#39;ve got to go out there and they&#39;ve got to work hard. And the last thing you want is it&#39;s like that episode of The Simpsons where Bart is running for class president and they all go out and they celebrate on the school ground. And then there&#39;s two votes for Martin because, you know, even though they&#39;re the only two supporters for Martin, they&#39;re the only two people who bother to show up to vote. You&#39;ve got to be careful that you&#39;ve still got your volunteers motivated for E-Day, that they&#39;re doing their get out the vote, that they&#39;re doing all of the things you need them to do.</span>

            <span class="text">However, sometimes you want to feel like a winning campaign. Sometimes that&#39;s the momentum you want, the bandwagon you want to build. Other times that&#39;s very dangerous. It quite depends on the situation you find yourself in. Carter,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to ask you a more specific version of that question to round us out. So on O&#39;Toole, what&#39;s his best game plan here? To look like he&#39;s in front, be tied, behind? If everything is in the margin of error, you get to kind of write your own story and fudge with your own numbers in a sense and say, this is where we&#39;re at. What&#39;s the most advantageous for O&#39;Toole heading into these final seven days? Is it to show that I&#39;m ahead of Trudeau and we can kind of get this thing done? Is it to show that we&#39;re tight, to your point earlier, that you said this thing&#39;s really close and advantageous to perhaps both parties? or is to say we&#39;re behind and the prime minister we knew this was going to happen he&#39;s caught up he&#39;s in the lead etc and use that as a motivator what are you thinking is is the right lane for a tool to pick in the last seven days everything</span>

You said every single decision makes it feel like you&#39;re Bambi on ice, even if it&#39;s a small decision on where to put the comma in an email, because either you&#39;re trying to protect a lead, get a lead, you think everything could make or break you. And in some ways, the media, the population, the voters, the pundits don&#39;t help in that regard, because they are also looking at every single detail, especially in a volatile race like this.

Because in these moments, you can kind of go a little bit more risky, which probably gives you greater exposure, but greater upside. Less risky, not worth it. Why did you do that? That&#39;s going to haunt you in the coming week ahead. Or, same, this was fine, what you did. Does that make sense in terms of a construct for both of you? Corey, you look a little confused. Is it because you were just tired after directing an entire segment poorly?</span>

Now, in a funny way, I don&#39;t think that was necessary because it&#39;s not as though they&#39;re creating a more dire fiscal picture than any of the other parties that are out there. But they knew that this was not their strong suit. They knew they didn&#39;t want to be arguing the specifics of PBO sanctioned numbers. And so they left it for the week before the election, just so they could say they did it without sweating it too much beyond that. that.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, Aaron O&#39;Toole has an opposing view to Justin Trudeau regarding the raising of the flags. Justin Trudeau says, no, we will leave them at half-mast until Indigenous communities across the country are ready. Aaron O&#39;Toole says, by the 30th end of the month, if I so become Prime Minister, those flags will be raised, we&#39;ll be proud of Canada, we&#39;ll get to work, etc. If you&#39;re O&#39;Toole, would you have gone with a bit more, a riskier sort of strategy here, Or was it less risky than what he just did? Or this was fine? This played to what he needed to do? What do you think?</span>

            <span class="text">I think this was fine. Anything further than that, and you really risk a backlash. This is one of those issues that I suspect there&#39;s a lot of Canadians who will agree with Aaron O&#39;Toole, but know that they&#39;re not supposed to agree in polite company. But to go any further would really invite a conversation that Aaron O&#39;Toole is just not equipped to have. When you looked at the reconciliation section of the debate, right, if you want to take nothing else from the debate, take this away, which is Justin Trudeau has got pretty good command of this file and Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s answers are deeply unsatisfactory. So I&#39;m not sure that he wants to spend an awful lot of time talking about reconciliation. This does seem to be in, you know, notwithstanding Justin Trudeau&#39;s failures on this issue or shortcomings on this issue, this is very much more in his box than Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s box.

But to say, yeah, you&#39;ll lower the flag, but you&#39;re not fixing these problems is probably an interesting framing to go harder on. And in that sense, maybe you could go a little bit harder. But it continues to be an issue that I don&#39;t think – like if that&#39;s your issue, you&#39;re probably not voting conservative. I keep coming back to</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you on our next one. In a post-debate scrum or a press conference slash event, Justin Trudeau says that it was wrong to suggest that Quebecers are racist. He said that the question asked by Sashi Curl regarding the discriminatory Bill 21 in Quebec was offensive. If you&#39;re Trudeau, would you have taken a greater risk on this, gone more aggressively, less risk on this? Or would you have stayed the same with the response that he had, effectively joining Blanchett and O&#39;Toole in the same category as being like, oh, shaking your fist on this particular file and question on Bill 21? I will acknowledge that O&#39;Toole is the only one that&#39;s kind of said he wouldn&#39;t intervene with the federal powers should he get them as prime minister, but we can get into the depths of that later. But Carter, on the Trudeau response from what he said, which he said that it&#39;s wrong to suggest Quebecers are racist and that the question was offensive, your</span>

            <span class="text">think it&#39;s deeply, deeply irritating to me that everybody was immediately going to jump to Quebec. Quebec is not racist. Quebec couldn&#39;t possibly be racist. It&#39;s wrong to say that Quebec is racist. I think one of the things we&#39;ve really had to come to grips with over the past year and a half, two years in particular with Black Lives Matter and all of that is that there is racism everywhere, you know, big and small that needs to be addressed. And we walk through our lives in so many different ways, thinking about things through one lens and ignoring the fact that if you looked at them through a very different but also legitimate lens, it is a clearly racist policy. And I&#39;m not saying this is unique to Bill 21, but for fuck&#39;s sake, people, this is a bill that says you&#39;ve got to put aside your culture and your heritage and your religion if you want to advance in Quebec&#39;s civil society. Are we really going to pretend that there&#39;s not any elements to that that are troubling? It is so, I mean, it&#39;s hard to not come to the conclusion that all of our leaders have within them this ability to be utterly disingenuous cowards when there&#39;s votes at play here.</span>

I&#39;ve been saying this for a while. I don&#39;t know if you guys would agree that that that strategic sort of pathway exists for him. But for me, that&#39;s the most disappointing one on 21.

I think maybe even Trudeau would wonder whether it was an inappropriate question. I certainly don&#39;t think O&#39;Toole would think it was an appropriate question.

Blanchet clearly, you know, knew exactly there was red meat for him to go on in that debate. But Corey, to your point then, was this from the pure politics of it, and I appreciate you got to talk a bit about the substance, should the prime minister have actually, was he fine?

In his response, would you feel like that&#39;s fine? That&#39;s reasonable?

No, absolutely not. This is a time when Canadians should be get a very clear chance on who they want to end this pandemic. So a bit of a shift in his language, who they want to kind of end this pandemic once and for all. Carter, would you have gone with a more riskier approach here, perhaps exposing yourself more, a less riskier sort of like, you know, we&#39;re in it now, whatever. Or was this fine? This tone of absolutely not. I&#39;ve got no regrets whatsoever. We&#39;re powering through. We&#39;re going to, you know, and kind of spinning it in that regard. I</span>

The other one is saying this is about the recovery. You know, there&#39;s obvious time horizons to that that makes one think of. But I&#39;m curious, from your perspective, on the question that he&#39;s been getting constantly, the answer of no, absolutely not, no regrets. Would you have gone with a riskier approach, a less riskier approach, or this version is fine?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, this ties back to our conversation earlier about you need to know what message track you&#39;re on. You need to know what&#39;s actually moving the votes right now. So let&#39;s just take as a hypothesis, which could be entirely wrong, that part of the reason for a bounce is that people are saying O&#39;Toole could potentially win this thing. In that case, maybe a little humility is called for here. Maybe you want people to feel like there is a little bit of regret there. And maybe the regret you frame is not that you&#39;re having an election, but you say, yeah, I do have one very significant regret here, and it&#39;s that I didn&#39;t make the case for this election. I believe this is a very consequential election. We are coming out of a pandemic. It&#39;s largely been managed as a result of the Liberal government in a very able fashion. We&#39;re coming out better than a lot of other countries. But yeah, I deeply regret that I wasn&#39;t able to explain to Canadians just how important this moment is. And I&#39;m hoping that I can spend the next week explaining to them how important this moment is. And if there feels like there&#39;s a little bit of a stench of death on that, if you actually need people to think that O&#39;Toole could win this, that would actually be a pretty reasonable strategy and a pretty reasonable way to talk about those things. So I don&#39;t know, because I don&#39;t have access to their polling. I don&#39;t have a strong enough understanding as to what&#39;s driving these numbers at this point. But it is quite possibly not the approach you want to take. Because if the arrogance of the liberal approach is in many ways what there was a backlash to in the first bit, and they&#39;re just trying to get it over there, you don&#39;t want to jump back into that. You don&#39;t want to be acting arrogant again, a little too cocksure after you just barely started getting polls that showed you in the lead again.</span>

I&#39;m stopping the rise. The rise is just not happening for me. You know, it was going from 16 to 17 to 20, but I&#39;m stuck at 20. I&#39;m stuck at 20 percent. And I have the exact fear that everyone in my orange shoes has had in previous elections, that Justin Trudeau is going to steal a quarter of my votes, get a majority government, and I&#39;m going to be rendered useless and irrelevant. So, Stephen Carter, I need to ask you first again, I&#39;ve got seven days left. What do I do now? Now, I&#39;ve told people that I&#39;m not going to prop up a conservative government so they can vote with their heart. I sense some danger in that. I&#39;ve told people that Justin Trudeau and I are different people fundamentally. So, you know, maybe there&#39;s some merit in that. I&#39;ve told them that he&#39;s failed on true progress and that he&#39;s cynical and he doesn&#39;t execute. So maybe there&#39;s something in that. But what do I need to do, Carter? I&#39;m at 20 percent. Maybe I&#39;ve stalled out. But my game now is, can I just keep my 20? What do I do to keep my 20 percent, Stephen? And how do I how do I ensure that people don&#39;t leave me for Justin Trudeau with seven days left?</span>

            <span class="text">Two things. Number one, it&#39;s going to be a minority government. People want you to be there to be the controlling interest of the minority government. Number two, show some balls on Quebec, for God&#39;s sake. If you can&#39;t stand up and say that there&#39;s racism in Quebec, then who can? And it doesn&#39;t mean that everybody&#39;s a racism or racist. Racism exists systematically because of people not standing up and saying that it&#39;s wrong. And you can&#39;t be the one who doesn&#39;t stand up and say this is wrong. What is happening in Quebec is wrong. And it&#39;s one of the reasons, just one of the reasons, that the NDP is absolutely nowhere there. So you have nothing to lose. Stand up, say what&#39;s right, and it will help you across the rest of the country. On top of that, just double down on everything. You go as hard as you can on every issue and don&#39;t take any politically popular positions. When you&#39;re talking about taxing the wealthy, yeah, fuck that, we&#39;re going to tax the wealthy. You&#39;re going to tax corporations, yeah, fuck that, we&#39;re going to tax corporations. If you can&#39;t say, yeah, fuck that, in every policy, then you&#39;re not running at all. And in terms of losing votes to the liberals, you need everybody to understand, understand if votes switch then that means that the liberals get the majority if votes stick that means that the ndp is going to be there to hold the liberals to account so</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, so rarely is he right. Here&#39;s the thing. There&#39;s maybe some logic to Stephen&#39;s approach on Quebec from a purely political point of view. It&#39;s too late for that. You&#39;ve made your bed. You&#39;ve made your comments here. This is an issue that Quebec and the rest of Canada cannot see eye to eye on because they&#39;re looking at it from entirely different lenses. And there does need to be more of an appreciation from the rest of Canada that Quebec does look at this fundamentally different. That doesn&#39;t mean you should indulge that viewpoint without any kind kind of critical eye, just as we wouldn&#39;t want Quebecers to look at issues in the rest of Canada without indulging a critical eye the other way as well, right? That&#39;s what friends do for each other. They help each other see their blind spots. I think you should have made a comment more along those lines. And you should have said, listen, I understand some of the logic of Bill 21. I do. But let&#39;s take a bit of a gut check here. And I&#39;m asking you to look at it through the lens of somebody else, somebody with perhaps my lived experience, and what that means. And everything thing that, you know, my friend Zane Velji was saying earlier, could not be the Speaker of the Assembly, could not be a police officer. And that&#39;s really troubling to me, because my faith matters to me and my cultural heritage matters to me. But I think that&#39;s done. I think that&#39;s over. Your question is really about what&#39;s going on in the next week. What are we going to do in the next week to try to close this thing out strong?</span>

The Liberals are are at 30%, what you want to do is you want to narrow down your efforts and you want to get the 30 seats that was probably the reasonable upside that you always had, the 40 seats maybe, and just do it. This is not going to be the campaign for you. So at this point, what you don&#39;t want to do is in pursuit of the campaign you didn&#39;t get, blow up the campaign that you have. You&#39;ve got to be careful. You&#39;ve got to be smart. You&#39;ve got to not run against yourself here. Take those seats. Get some modest gains. You had a good campaign. It was on top of a good campaign in 2019 you could be somebody like jack layton who runs multiple campaigns and really defines your party for a generation and you&#39;re doing a pretty good job but now is not the time and i&#39;m not saying surrender i&#39;m far from that i&#39;m saying don&#39;t be crazy don&#39;t take the steven carter swing for the fences approach what you want to do right now is make sure you&#39;ve got a strong contingent a strong caucus from which you can build even stronger carter</span>
