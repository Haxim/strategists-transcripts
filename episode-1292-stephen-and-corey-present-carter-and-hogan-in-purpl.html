I think that it is a solid introduction to Nahed as an individual.

Well, I&#39;m just not sure that works in a one ballot, one member, one vote, single I think that the process requires that he not take the barb. And it&#39;s really wise strategically to point instead his his acid tongue against Danielle Smith. And let&#39;s be honest, brilliant at it.

And I think that Kenny had some real discipline in not taking her on very often, but it had to just drive him crazy because we were making hit after hit after hit. And we got media story after media story after media story. story. The media will cover this story of Nahid Nenshi attacking Danielle Smith. It will be the story of the day more often than it will not be.

I think that Nahed Nenshi is a spectacular campaigner. And I think that in the air war, especially, he&#39;s going to do an exceptional job. job. But I also think that there are very large pockets of the province that Nahed Nenshi can&#39;t win as the leader of the New Democrats. And that may include significant parts of Calgary. I&#39;d be shocked if he was really that viable in many more ridings than the NDP won in the last campaign. I&#39;d love to see a poll by poll, you know, like a riding by riding type of approach to to how this would actually play out. But explain to me how he&#39;s going to win in Lougheed or Shaw or any of the other areas that were lost, Calgary Southeast, by the NDP. I mean, maybe he picks up one or two in the Northwest. But even in the Northeast, he&#39;s not as popular as people think he is.</span>
