            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and you actually told us during the podcast this was not a bit by the way this was not one of our classic strategist bits this was this was steven carter medicated after a bike accident, taking twice the recommended dosage, realizing that about 60% through the show, and then probably just staring at his hands the entire time because my video stopped working. So I had no idea what was going on with Carter. And I will say that train wreck is available to you alongside a numerous number of other episodes for a low, low price of $6 a month.</span>
