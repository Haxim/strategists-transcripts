And while you would think it would be a pretty straightforward thing to sort of rebuild it brick by brick like Wayne Manor in a Batman movie, the fucking city of Calgary development department has said no to the owners of the lot that they cannot rebuild the thing that was there just before COVID hit. Like, this is not like they&#39;re trying to build something new there. They&#39;re trying to rebuild the building that was there. And it&#39;s mostly because, you know, at the risk of sounding like Rick Bell, you know, the apparatchikets at City Hall think they&#39;ve got a better idea for what to do with the land. They</div>

And this is on Center Street and only a couple hundred meters away from a new LRT station. So this has got a cast of characters. And we need to strategize.

          <div class="said">unbelievable that the city is acting in this particular context. Because of course, if it was 12345 Alberta Limited, who was trying to get this done, it wouldn&#39;t have nearly the the same punch. So I think if you are interested in convincing your neighbors to help build a groundswell to help convince the city to reverse its decision upon appeal, which is happening in two weeks, you&#39;ve got to keep kind of central to that everybody&#39;s story here, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind that these are actual people. This isn&#39;t just you know, some planners fetish for having higher density development on on Center Street. These were people&#39;s livelihoods. You know, it&#39;s It&#39;s sort of like, imagine if your house was on Center Street. Sure. There are houses on Center Street. There&#39;s lots of houses on Center Street in that rough proximity, too. If your house burned down and you&#39;re like, I&#39;m going to rebuild my house. This is such an important part of my life. And the city said, yeah, sorry about that. No. How would you feel about that?</div>

You know, the elderly couple with the land, the immigrant couple that are, you know, the success story that come to the country just only a few short years ago and have already established a successful business that just happened to burn down through bad luck, not their own, nothing that they did, just bad luck. And of roles and you make sure that people can see themselves in it and with a central moral right the biblical stories or the moral tales that we tell ourselves that we tell our children all of them have a central moral that we&#39;re supposed to learn and the central moral of this particular story is that people must stand up to planning people</div>

          <div class="said">Nicely done, Carter. You know, often in public narrative, we&#39;ve got this concept of the three stories, the story of me, the story of we, the story of now. You&#39;ve actually done that. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve teased it out specifically for folks, but why this group, why the community needs to get involved, why the urgency to act, and what the future state could look like with or without action. So you&#39;ve kind of stated those. Corey, you wanted to jump in, and then I&#39;ve got, I&#39;m going to get super tactical with you guys, because we know the timeline here. It&#39;s two weeks. So I want to get really tactical in a second as to how these individuals, without the use of expensive consultants, right, finds airtime, gets their story out, etc. But Corey, I&#39;ll let you get in your thoughts first, and then we&#39;ll go a little bit deeper.

          <div class="said">And that is why we start with people, because ultimately, it is about a narrative that you are trying to craft. And when you&#39;re talking about any kind of campaign, when you&#39;re talking about moving moving towards a decision point and trying to convince people at that decision point to take your road rather than the other person&#39;s road. It is about crafting the narrative that we&#39;ve gone on here. So this really is the starting point. You look at the elements of story that are available to you. You look to the most compelling ones. You&#39;ve both provided different frameworks, but fundamentally, when you talk about strategy work, that is where we began. You want to look at what&#39;s in front of you. You want to take the components that are available, take this effectuation approach. But always, always, you&#39;re looking at the components of story.</div>

          <div class="said">I appreciate that. So we&#39;re on the same page. We&#39;ve got a set of characters. We&#39;re going to give them roles. We&#39;re going to construct a story. Carter, let&#39;s get more specific. Two weeks, reverse engineer a rough tactical timeline for me. So let&#39;s talk about the ends, the ideal ends for them. They get to go to... Corey, correct me if I&#39;m wrong. This is a Subcommittee on Planning for Appeal. Is that correct? I think it&#39;s the Subdivision and Development Appeal Board. Okay, so it&#39;s an appeal board. Carter, that&#39;s what happens in two weeks. That&#39;s the ends. Talk to me about what an ideal outcome for them is. And then let&#39;s give us a rough skeleton of what some tactics look like. Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you to add to those from what Carter suggests.</div>

We need to be on the drive show for seven minutes talking about this or we need to get 15 minutes on the on the Rob Breckenridge show. and we&#39;re going to talk about not just our situation but the situation much a lot broader than that our situation isn&#39;t unique this is why you have to cover it not because uh this this type of thing happens all the time but because you know we&#39;re the ones fighting just to rebuild our dairy queen but the guys down the street that are building the arena they&#39;re not running into these types of problems this is a bit you know this is a bigger systemic issue and we&#39;re the ones fighting and you have to be on our side so the pitch needs to be made to other media outlets to amplify and then you have to find your message</div>

You and I have been on campaigns together. This is your specialty in some ways, especially when the campaign cycle is on. You know how to get coverage. You&#39;ve talked to me a bit about the story. Tell me the tactics of pitching radio. You&#39;ve gotten global to cover you already. That seems to be the soul strike. I could be wrong. But are you going back to that well? How are you getting other media outlets to do it? Are you going exclusive? Are you DMing? Give me the tactics. What&#39;s happening here?</div>

When you want to talk about that conflict, there&#39;s one ready-made in the rejection.

          <div class="said">Well, let&#39;s be realistic. When you&#39;re talking about something with two weeks to go, you don&#39;t have time for a lot of tactics. So you&#39;re going to be looking off the shelf. This is not time to start getting cute with micro-targeting or anything like that. Not that I believe those resources would be necessarily available to the proponents in any case. And if you wanted to organize people to support them, again, you&#39;ve got two weeks. There&#39;s not really time for that. So you&#39;ve really got two streams that you can take. One is big, and they&#39;re not mutually exclusive. You can run them both at the same time. And I would recommend that you do one of them is big story low touch and the other one is local story high touch and carter has talked a bit about in fact so have i but this big story low touch this idea you get some media coverage that you broaden the issue you make it about not just one family but lots of families and for that there&#39;s a few things i want to say one is you look for the bigger point and</div>

They&#39;re hearing the story, you&#39;re asking them to push towards something very specific, you can push it towards lots of lawmakers, not just not just an appeal board that may or may not care about those things. things uh you know they&#39;ll send emails it&#39;s not necessarily going to be these high touch communications that with the local story you would have but you can get a lot of people with lesser interest to get involved because they just they they agree to the principle the other stream that you can take is the local story high touch so it&#39;s people who maybe live in the neighborhood maybe have fond memories of their kids going to that dairy queen maybe they just realize that right across the street from this is a fucking parking lot at the safeway and so who gives a If it&#39;s not a transit oriented development, the entire stretch of that part of Center Street is kind of a wasteland of low density things, you know, with exceptions. So, you know, and they can send in, you know, the angrier, you know, more bespoke communications to their counselor, they can phone 311, they can leave complaints, they can write letters, they can phone up these offices, and they can create noise that is</div>

What pressures do you need to be able to put on them? Because knowing the process and knowing the people that you&#39;re trying to influence, you&#39;re not trying to influence the broader population of the city of Calgary. You are trying to put specific influence influence on the government. And this is why, you know, this little example of the Dairy Queen is actually really important in the overall scheme of things.

Now, the law is probably on your side, the zoning is probably on your side, you can probably win this just outright. The other is that you could lose. So those are the two easiest ones, you can win, or you can lose. And losing is going to be extremely painful, because you don&#39;t want to be setting precedent, you don&#39;t want this type of situation, you know, this type of argument to be able to carry be carried forward. Well, you allowed a drive through here, why wouldn&#39;t you allow a drive-thru over there. The issue of precedence is one that the city of Calgary certainly will not want to be falling into.
