        <div class="desc"><p>The gang celebrate the 1000th patron by dedicating a discussion of Donald Trump and China to their new best friend, Brett Andrews.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Donald Trump’s widely-panned CNN appearance, continued Chinese interference charges in Ottawa and the most important person in our lives, Brett Andrews. Does Trump’s appearance mark his return to the centre of America’s national conversation? Have China’s attempts to retaliate against Michael Chong changed the math in Ottawa? And how long until Brett Andrews replaces Zain and Annalise? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Visit </em><em><a href="http://www.brettandrews.ca" target="_blank">BrettAndrews.ca</a></em><em> to fill out the 2023 Strategists' listener survey.</em></p></blockquote></div>

When you saw that this was happening, when you saw they gave him a primetime slot, you know, many are equating this to less of a town hall, which we are used to as a format of facilitation by a host, and more so like a debate between a CNN host. Like this was like a back and forth to the point where at the end of the debate, Trump was like, you&#39;re a nasty woman for everything that you&#39;ve done over the course of this hour to me.</div>

And it is the media&#39;s job to give us the the platforms to speak from. And the CNN, all CNN did was give Trump the platform. And to Corey&#39;s point, he may hang himself a little bit from that platform because he&#39;s not do you know, he&#39;s not great at this. um and in the past we let him get away with it we society let him get away with it because we were uh willing to look past societal norms in order to bring him you know to to allow</div>

          <div class="said">The news is not always pleasant to watch. Often we deal with reprehensible situations. We have dealt with murders, we have dealt with violence, and we have dealt with Donald Trump. But whether it&#39;s reprehensible does not determine its newsworthiness or lack thereof. Donald Trump on our network yesterday made no shorter than five statements that will have serious consequences to his campaign in the future and perhaps American democracy. And as a network, while we are deeply uncomfortable with the positions that Donald Trump took and the attacks against our anchor, there&#39;s no question that it reached a bar of newsworthiness and that the American democracy and the American conversation is stronger because of what we had to go through.</div>

The decisions that some people made in the 2016 election had ramifications, and the decisions that are going to be made in the 2024 election will have ramifications.

But he seized the media cycle with this. And now people are talking about Donald Trump again in ways, frankly, that they weren&#39;t a week ago. And for me, my view of it is Donald Trump got value out of it in that we&#39;re all reacting to Donald Trump again. And that is ultimately Donald Trump&#39;s superpower. He keeps us spinning. He keeps us moving. He keeps us talking about him rather than everything else around him, putting him in context, the other people who could potentially move the country on from Donald Trump, such as DeSantis, frankly, such as Biden, such as any of the other candidates that might be out there for president.</div>

Like, I mean, look at the legal troubles he&#39;s in, Look at the way he crashed out of the White House. I mean, you pick your words carefully, but you basically say, look, that&#39;s not my concern. If Donald Trump decides that he&#39;s actually going to go through with running, almost suggest that his announcement is kind of like a fake announcement or whatnot, well, then I guess we&#39;ll see him in the primaries. But the reality is I&#39;m interested in becoming president of the United States here. And I&#39;m looking forward to taking the fight to Joe Biden. And I would actually not necessarily spend a ton of time on Trump at the start. Like, he&#39;s going to come at you, he&#39;s going to be a jugular, but you almost jujitsu him. And the angrier he comes at him, you go, you know, I really appreciate what Donald Trump&#39;s done, but this kind of heat, this kind of energy, that&#39;s</div>

But I, you know, Zane, to your question, I don&#39;t think the rules have changed. I think that Donald Trump is just somebody who has, because of his entertainment value, as much as we might disdain that, because of the numbers that he can draw and all of that he&#39;s just in a stronger negotiating position but the reality is these things are always negotiated now they&#39;re usually negotiated with more decorum campaigns are</div>

You&#39;ve got actions taken this week that people have been calling for for months now, in certain ways. You have a prime minister who didn&#39;t know, right? The prime minister did not know. This is a Globe and Mail and intelligence officials verifying to MP Chung that this is what happened. If you&#39;re the prime minister right now, what sort of crisis damage are you doing? Are you you just saying, fuck this noise? I&#39;m taking David Johnson out of the picture. We&#39;re calling a public inquiry. Are you channel changing on the issue? Are you channel changing away from the issue? Can you even channel change for long enough so that it doesn&#39;t get back to the issue? You also note that there&#39;s more MPs, more actual names of your colleagues will come out in terms of who else was targeted. This seems, Corey&#39;s bear traps is absolutely right.

          <div class="said">it was a really solid one in terms. So, Zane, as you were going on, the reason I was so emphatically agreeing is I actually think that complexity has has two consequences that have political elements here. The first is with the conservative caucus, like the more that this ratchets up and this becomes China and its effect on this nation and the consequences to the conservative caucus members themselves and all of that, I think the more it forces people to be serious about this and say, okay, you know, I know we said it would handcuff us and no, we can&#39;t take these security briefings and all of that. But at a certain point, it&#39;s like, we</div>

          <div class="said">we got to figure this out, right? And so we&#39;ve all got to take this a little bit serious. Maybe we got to dial down the rhetoric. Maybe we got to get behind closed doors and figure out what the fuck we&#39;re dealing with, right? So that&#39;s element number one. And I think that can change the tenor of the political conversation overall. And certainly, it makes it less of a game when you&#39;re in the caucus and you&#39;re now seeing the consequences that are happening for some people. And perhaps that&#39;s not fair to say that they thought it was a game, but perhaps it&#39;s not unfair to say they weren&#39;t taking it super seriously like this before this particular moment.

And that muddying, I think, has political consequences that are not entirely negative for the liberals. Although, as we&#39;ve said, there are bear traps all around that the liberals need to watch out for here. But the two are tied. As the stakes get more serious, as this becomes clearly more geopolitical in nature, I think that both the Conservative caucus more immediately and the Canadian public are viewing it more as a geopolitical struggle, and that has domestic political consequences.</div>
