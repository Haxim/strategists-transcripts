When you saw that this was happening, when you saw they gave him a primetime slot, you know, many are equating this to less of a town hall, which we are used to as a format of facilitation by a host, and more so like a debate between a CNN host. Like this was like a back and forth to the point where at the end of the debate, Trump was like, you&#39;re a nasty woman for everything that you&#39;ve done over the course of this hour to me.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, my top line thoughts are, you know, why would CNN do this? And I agree with Corey. It was for ratings. I mean, I&#39;m told that they got six times the normal ratings for that particular moment in time. I mean, that&#39;s a significant ratings bump. I mean, I&#39;ve actually penned an invite to Donald Trump to join the strategist next week. If we can get a, you know, a six times ratings bump. I mean, that&#39;s huge. You</span>

Is it the media&#39;s job to stop the proliferation of anarchy or is it us as political operatives? And I think it&#39;s our job to stop the the the spread of political anarchy. And it is the media&#39;s job to give us the the platforms to speak from. And the CNN, all CNN did was give Trump the platform. And to Corey&#39;s point, he may hang himself a little bit from that platform because he&#39;s not do you know, he&#39;s not great at this. um and in the past we let him get away with it we society let him get away with it because we were uh willing to look past societal norms in order to bring him you know to to allow</span>

You fill the audience with everybody, everybody. And if Donald Trump doesn&#39;t want to have the general population in the audience, then he doesn&#39;t get the slot.</span>

We have dealt with murders, we have dealt with violence, and we have dealt with Donald Trump. But whether it&#39;s reprehensible does not determine its newsworthiness or lack thereof. Donald Trump on our network yesterday made no shorter than five statements that will have serious consequences to his campaign in the future and perhaps American democracy. And as a network, while we are deeply uncomfortable with the positions that Donald Trump took and the attacks against our anchor, there&#39;s no question that it reached a bar of newsworthiness and that the American democracy and the American conversation is stronger because of what we had to go through.</span>

The decisions that some people made in the 2016 election had ramifications, and the decisions that are going to be made in the 2024 election will have ramifications. Those decisions will not be made by CNN. Those decisions will be made by the voters of the United States of America, and that is what we&#39;re the most proud of as a news organization.</span>

But do you feel like there&#39;s actually an argument that a primetime slot, especially to a guy who&#39;s been sluggish in the polls that people are just, you know, looking at as more of a sideshow than anything else?

I think that&#39;s a, like, again, in many ways, for me, it comes back to the audience but what i do believe is that it was of value to trump which doesn&#39;t mean it was wrong for cnn to do it i you know i think that people would love to think that if it promotes a politician it&#39;s not newsworthy but by that definition basically almost any coverage of a politician right shouldn&#39;t happen the value for donald trump in many ways was not his base who have stuck with him they were thick and thin it was that once again and for the first time in a a while in a way that wasn&#39;t entirely so weird to say, because what he said was so batshit crazy. But he seized the media cycle with this. And now people are talking about Donald Trump again in ways, frankly, that they weren&#39;t a week ago. And for me, my view of it is Donald Trump got value out of it in that we&#39;re all reacting to Donald Trump again. And that is ultimately Donald Trump&#39;s superpower. He keeps us spinning. He keeps us moving. He keeps us talking about him rather than everything else around him, putting him in context, the other people who could potentially move the country on from Donald Trump, such as DeSantis, frankly, such as Biden, such as any of the other candidates that might be out there for president.</span>

And you&#39;d be like, listen, I think Donald Trump was a great president, but I mean, I think we can all acknowledge Donald Trump&#39;s time is done here. Like, I mean, look at the legal troubles he&#39;s in, Look at the way he crashed out of the White House. I mean, you pick your words carefully, but you basically say, look, that&#39;s not my concern. If Donald Trump decides that he&#39;s actually going to go through with running, almost suggest that his announcement is kind of like a fake announcement or whatnot, well, then I guess we&#39;ll see him in the primaries. But the reality is I&#39;m interested in becoming president of the United States here. And I&#39;m looking forward to taking the fight to Joe Biden. And I would actually not necessarily spend a ton of time on Trump at the start. Like, he&#39;s going to come at you, he&#39;s going to be a jugular, but you almost jujitsu him. And the angrier he comes at him, you go, you know, I really appreciate what Donald Trump&#39;s done, but this kind of heat, this kind of energy, that&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s exactly why, you know, I&#39;m running. Because it&#39;s clearly evidence he&#39;s not actually going to be the guy next time.

But I, you know, Zane, to your question, I don&#39;t think the rules have changed. I think that Donald Trump is just somebody who has, because of his entertainment value, as much as we might disdain that, because of the numbers that he can draw and all of that he&#39;s just in a stronger negotiating position but the reality is these things are always negotiated now they&#39;re usually negotiated with more decorum campaigns are</span>

He is a person who is expected to speak his mind. And he&#39;s not just someone who&#39;s running around spouting lines. Right.

China&#39;s kind of a bully. The government of China has strength and power, and they are not afraid to use it. um you know we can see the retaliation they have done twice now against the united states because the speakers of the house have met with the uh the president of taiwan that is legitimate uh actions taken because they do not like the action of another government we had two of our citizens taken uh hostage essentially uh by that government um they&#39;re not they don&#39;t play the same rules that we play and any action that we take could be deemed to be an affront to China and when it you know I mean I got a lot of this when we were even just dealing with the Dalai Lama coming to Calgary like the truth of the matter is if you do something that China doesn&#39;t like you wind up on a list and that&#39;s just reality and they do things that we don&#39;t do they do try and influence the outcome you know they try and influence um through their core uh through their expats they try and influence members of the legislative assembly they try and influence uh your your your your counselor they try and influence your mayor and now they&#39;re influencing mla or mps um what</span>

Like at the time, I think I said that that&#39;s a dangerous comment, because all you need to do then is sort of point that something ended up in the prime minister&#39;s office, and it implicates Justin Trudeau.

You&#39;ve got actions taken this week that people have been calling for for months now, in certain ways. You have a prime minister who didn&#39;t know, right? The prime minister did not know. This is a Globe and Mail and intelligence officials verifying to MP Chung that this is what happened. If you&#39;re the prime minister right now, what sort of crisis damage are you doing? Are you you just saying, fuck this noise? I&#39;m taking David Johnson out of the picture. We&#39;re calling a public inquiry. Are you channel changing on the issue? Are you channel changing away from the issue? Can you even channel change for long enough so that it doesn&#39;t get back to the issue? You also note that there&#39;s more MPs, more actual names of your colleagues will come out in terms of who else was targeted. This seems, Corey&#39;s bear traps is absolutely right. This seems like a shit ton of bear traps, some of which you&#39;ve put for yourself, some of which are newly emerging.

Now, the question does become, what are the recommendations that come out of it? And perhaps they will be like what Stephen said, that say, we&#39;ve got to deal with this in a back room where we can have more robust security conversations that include many parties or maybe it will say we need a public inquiry or maybe it&#39;ll say we need a combination of these two things because there are public questions and there are private questions or you know questions of state security is probably a better way to put on it all of which must be addressed at this particular moment and like lest we forget this the michael chong thing is really quite serious And quite dramatic.

This isn&#39;t something that we solve in public. This isn&#39;t something that we make hay on. This is something that needs to be discussed. And we need to reach a solution because China, China is a powerful, powerful ally slash frenemy. This could go really bad in a very short period of time.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it&#39;s charitable, but an immense stretch to call China an ally at this point, Stephen. But I think your point is a really Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it was a really solid one in terms. So, Zane, as you were going on, the reason I was so emphatically agreeing is I actually think that complexity has has two consequences that have political elements here. The first is with the conservative caucus, like the more that this ratchets up and this becomes China and its effect on this nation and the consequences to the conservative caucus members themselves and all of that, I think the more it forces people to be serious about this and say, okay, you know, I know we said it would handcuff us and no, we can&#39;t take these security briefings and all of that. But at a certain point, it&#39;s like, we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we got to figure this out, right? And so we&#39;ve all got to take this a little bit serious. Maybe we got to dial down the rhetoric. Maybe we got to get behind closed doors and figure out what the fuck we&#39;re dealing with, right? So that&#39;s element number one. And I think that can change the tenor of the political conversation overall. And certainly, it makes it less of a game when you&#39;re in the caucus and you&#39;re now seeing the consequences that are happening for some people. And perhaps that&#39;s not fair to say that they thought it was a game, but perhaps it&#39;s not unfair to say they weren&#39;t taking it super seriously like this before this particular moment.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, no, they were trying to extract political value. And you saw it even how Polyev was writing to the special rapporteur and other things on that file. Keep going, Corey. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, dear rapporteur in quotes and all that. We talked about that. But the second element is the public element. And let&#39;s look at it from the lens of the liberals right now. And let&#39;s just talk about this. And I&#39;ve sort of introduced this, right? There was the issue previous on, I mean, there&#39;s been so many issues related to China, including the vote on the Uyghur, the Uyghur vote in the first place, where, you know,</span>

            <span class="text">was a story where it seemed like there was potentially one of the angles was almost collusion china and liberals or at least liberal indifference or maybe there was something with the c you know csis and the security apparatus and there were a lot of people in the story and you weren&#39;t necessarily sure i mean you knew china wasn&#39;t acting great but maybe some other people were not acting great you didn&#39;t quite know who the villains were and we had to get to the bottom of this and all that but now we&#39;re layering in more stories where clearly china is acting, being a bad actor. And it is combining and it&#39;s conflated in people&#39;s minds. And it&#39;s becoming</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">becoming a little more difficult to say this is a liberal party story, and it&#39;s feeling a lot more like a bigger China story. And that muddying, I think, has political consequences that are not entirely negative for the liberals. Although, as we&#39;ve said, there are bear traps all around that the liberals need to watch out for here. But the two are tied. As the stakes get more serious, as this becomes clearly more geopolitical in nature, I think that both the Conservative caucus more immediately and the Canadian public are viewing it more as a geopolitical struggle, and that has domestic political consequences.</span>

We&#39;d like you to maybe just consider potentially for a moment here going to brettandrews.ca and filling out our survey. It&#39;s really important to Zane.
