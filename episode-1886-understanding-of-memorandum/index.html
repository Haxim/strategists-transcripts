        <p>NEW EP: Episode 1886: Understanding of Memorandum</p><p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dive into the generational, transformative MOU between the Canada and Alberta. They explain what it actually means, what it definitely doesn’t, and why everyone involved is already gaming out the best and worst case scenarios. Is everyone suddenly buying pipelines? Who actually gained (and who got played)? And how up to date is Carter on the latest trends? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p>Get your live show tickets now!<br /><a href="http://strategistslive.show" target="_blank">http://strategistslive.show</a></p>

Carter, Shannon, we can talk about the details of the MOU or the lack thereof, but I want to spend the majority of it on the strategy side of things for each of the relevant parties.

          <div class="said">uh my main takeaway is that this is a major signal to uh oil and gas investors that they can place capital here uh without any of the uh other uncertainties that had been placed in or that they had that they had heretofore said were barriers to them placing capital the clean electricity regulations so uh moving those aside means that you can invest in natural gas, fire electricity generation anywhere in the country, because I think we all know that an exemption for Alberta is basically icing the policy entirely, that there would no longer be any oil and gas cap regulations that were still TBD.</div>

          <div class="said">And so if you wanted to make an investment in any kind of primary production in Alberta or elsewhere, that you wouldn&#39;t have to factor that in to your risk outlook for that investment. And that, you know, linear infrastructure of many kinds, not just the North Coast, but other types of investments in linear transportation infrastructure for oil and gas, that those would be at not just at not frustrated by an oil and gas cap or or other forms of regulation but uh would also be declared in the in the national interest so this isn&#39;t just for a pipeline to the as yet notional to the north coast but any other type of infrastructure that people were looking at whether it was an expansion of existing infrastructure or or uh new investments up to you know churchill or east west interconnectivity or those kinds of things so it was rolling out the red carpet for that and saying there are no longer any uh impediments right so we&#39;re back to harper era kind of uh regulatory environment there uh and harper era approach uh which is anything goes but harper plus uh which is that um if you know environmental assessment gets in your way or any of those kinds of of laws we&#39;ll move those aside for you as well on that side so</div>

A whole bunch of pre-existing climate requirements have been eliminated, but they&#39;ve been replaced with an effective carbon tax. And that carbon tax is going to be an effective rate. I think it&#39;s one hundred and thirty dollars. And if it is at that level suddenly, you know, and goes up from there, suddenly projects like Pathways become viable.
