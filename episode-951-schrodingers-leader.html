            <span class="text">Speaking of not being right, Carter, are you ready to take your victory lap and then walk of shame simultaneously? Because as we have often said on this show, Stephen Carter is great at strategy, horrible at predictions. You made the case last episode that Jason Kenney should sign the papers for one Brian Jean. He&#39;s indicated that he will. But then you boldly said that Jason and Kenny will 100% not sign the papers because that&#39;s a fucking stupid thing to do. Once again, Stephen Carter proving good at strategy, bad at predictions.</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to actually just use that and get us started. Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, the bickering continues. Corey, what is your response? Stephen Carter is taking a victory lap. on Jason Kenney saying, yeah, sure, I&#39;ll sign the papers of one Brian Jean. But then again, I would endorse whoever the members choose and then sideswiping Jean by saying, I&#39;m sure that the local members will have some questions about the reliability of one Brian Jean, given that he did not complete his term in Parliament, he did not complete his term as MLA, and of course, that he lost as leader. What do you make of what one Jason Kenney&#39;s stance was quite literally on On the day our episode got released, hours later.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think he&#39;s trying to have his cake and eat it, too. I think it&#39;s crazy that he&#39;s even suggesting that he would allow. We&#39;ve heard your point. We&#39;ve</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But let&#39;s just restate the obvious here. This is somebody who has said that they are actively against his leadership. And he has the authority as leader. Okay, let&#39;s put it this way. As a leader, you get to sign papers or not sign papers. And that&#39;s totally separate from whether or not they&#39;re a criminal or not, because that&#39;s all covered in a different process, the green light process.

            <span class="text">If you understood the Conservative Party and the United Conservative Party itself, you know that you can&#39;t withhold your signature because the grassroots dominates. If the grassroots wants it, then you have to give it. That&#39;s the way the party works. This</span>

            <span class="text">Well, and I&#39;ll tell you the value that is in display here is the value of self-preservation or living the day, I suppose. I think what this really tells us, this gives us some insight into just how challenged it is right now, right? right? Because if you were in a much stronger position, there&#39;s no way you would put up with this shit. Absolutely no way.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that just weakens him and makes him look like, I&#39;m trying to undermine this guy. I&#39;m sure the constituents will have something to say about how bad this guy is when they don&#39;t have something to say about how bad this guy is he&#39;s going to look weaker so i&#39;m not sure why he&#39;s taking that position but it just kind of you know if he&#39;s going to be if the cory&#39;s point he&#39;s going to be forced to sign these papers anyways um because he&#39;s so weak then further weakening yourself by pointing you know saying that the members will have something to say well when they say something they&#39;re going to say the wrong thing so don&#39;t don&#39;t</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, this is the classic slippery slope argument that you&#39;re bringing up, being like, if he&#39;s going to sign Brian Jean&#39;s papers, you know, where&#39;s the bottom? And I feel like the bottom should be Zane Velji for Alberta Party leader running for a UCP nomination at some point somewhere to test out the bottom for the UCP. But Corey, now that this is where the, you know, last time we were doing scenarios, which which scenarios we should analyze and effectively might present themselves. Now that we know we&#39;re here, what is Brian Jean&#39;s next move? Does he have a next move in him, given the comment that he heard from Jason Kenney at the podium on Friday?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, his next move is to run for the nomination and win and say, I guess they weren&#39;t that concerned, leader.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s not to handle this head on. It&#39;s not to let the bickering that that Kenny&#39;s trying to start from the podium continue, but to put your head down and win. Is that right, Carter? You would agree? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, the best revenge is served cold. And this is one of those opportunities where it&#39;s right there. Just go and win. Like the leader is not going to have much to say about the actual nomination race. If Brian Jean wants to win, then Brian Jean needs to activate his community and pretend there is no, you know, leadership</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">leadership aspiration. He just needs to serve the people of Fort McMurray. So I almost said Grand Prairie. Whoa, that would have been terrible. So, you know, this is a great opportunity for him just to start to ignore Jason Kenney. Of course, I suspect he won&#39;t because I don&#39;t think that Brian Jean is that talented a politician. But, you know, if he if he is a talented politician, he&#39;ll focus on the all politics is local adage. Corey,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, let&#39;s talk about Kenny. I want to talk about Kenny about another thing as well that happened on Friday. But let&#39;s round this particular item off with Jason Kenny in regards to any</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">any advice for him now that he&#39;s put out his having his cake and eating it too. He&#39;s picked a strategy, so to speak. Would you just tell him to shut the fuck up about this from here on in that there&#39;s no upside? side? Or would you tell him to keep talking, keep poking, see if Gene pokes back, that it&#39;s actually useful to you, as you&#39;d mentioned maybe last time in the confines of your leadership review, to actually have a choice versus a referendum? What would you suggest to Jason Kenney at this point now that he&#39;s picked the lane? Not your ideal lane, but he&#39;s picked this one.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I can see what he&#39;s trying to do, or I think I can, which is he is trying to put a few things out into the universe and A, get reaction from Brian Gene, and or B, have other people carry his water from this point forward, which is easier if Brian Jean reacts, right? They can start building that narrative that in many ways is what we were talking about, this idea that Brian Jean&#39;s not a team player, he&#39;s in it for himself, blah, blah, blah, all the way through. I would say that from this point forward, most of what needs to happen needs to happen behind closed doors, not behind microphones. And he should be seeing, not directly, but through his intermediaries, If he can&#39;t make the ride a little bit more difficult for Brian Jean, change the conversation in Fort McMurray. If he wins the nomination, maybe at least hobble him through it. If there&#39;s enough questions that are brought up, if there&#39;s enough of a fuss that&#39;s kicked up, maybe it&#39;s at that point he says, well, as leader, you know, I have to take</span>

He is going to face a leadership review in March. That leadership review is, if it were held today, as the pollsters say, things wouldn&#39;t work out particularly well. But it&#39;s not held today. So Jason Kenney has several months to put some sort of an emphasis on what his premiership looks like. And if he&#39;s able to do that, I mean, one imagines that the fourth wave of COVID is just about at the at the end. One hopes that there is no fifth wave around Christmas or at the end of Christmas.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to another Alberta story. I want to talk about Jason Kenney losing a minister, losing his ag minister in one, Devin Dreeschen, a young up-and-coming minister out of central Alberta. His father&#39;s the MP of the area. If you&#39;ve heard of Devin Dreeschen, well, you may not have heard of him if you&#39;re outside of Alberta, but you may have seen a picture of him, because the photo of Devin Dreeschen wearing a Make America Great Again hat, holding up a drink, has kind of become one of the iconic photos out of the UCP. I think that&#39;s That&#39;s fair to say. Oh, absolutely.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I think it&#39;s it&#39;s been seen more and more of the last couple of days simply because Devin Treachan is now gone as ag minister. He resigns after admitting that he&#39;s got an alcohol problem. Hopefully, you know, the former minister gets all the help that he needs. But this is after reporting by CBC that indicated several things, including several binge drinking sessions within his office after session, often and sometimes during the day, and was part of a broader lawsuit against the premier&#39;s office in regards to a toxic workplace culture lawsuit brought on by a former staffer. Carter, you know, let&#39;s start with the raw politics of losing a minister. Let&#39;s actually start here and then drill down into specifics because you&#39;ve been in one of these offices. Losing a minister that you yourself did not want to lose and or push out, that was not engineered by you on the inside. Give me the cost of losing a minister to like the workflow and the work of a ministry. I know this is not where this story is being covered, but I really like to cover this from the perspective of what does this do to the work of a pretty important file in Alberta, in the ag file? Like, what will this do? And it could be any ministry, but this is a pretty reasonably important ministry. Losing a minister, let&#39;s start here with the conversation. What does it mean? I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think, unfortunately, in today&#39;s world, losing a minister isn&#39;t really that important anymore, because the premiers already have such a, the premiers or the first ministers, if you will, have such control over their files. They are, you know, they&#39;re sending the marching orders for the minister uh the deputy minister of that particular uh uh ministry</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">ministry is is reporting back to the deputy minister of executive council the command and control structure that&#39;s been put in place is is such that the minister herself or himself um is just simply a cog that faces outwards towards the general population the bureaucrats the ones who you know the the The Corey Hogans, as Corey will point out, the bureaucrats are the ones actually making the world work. And those bureaucrats have the same mandate letter. They have the same marching orders from the deputy minister of executive council. And those things are still going to happen. What&#39;s not going to happen is the public face of the minister going out and meeting with all the various groups and all the stakeholders. Because realistically, that seems to me in today&#39;s governing structure to be the most important role of any minister. Make sure that your stakeholders like our government. That&#39;s your job. And this minister dropped the ball. And I think the good work of the Alberta government or the work that the bureaucrats are doing will continue on within the parameters that the premier had already set.

Losing a minister, Carter kind of says, with the command and control structure that we&#39;re seeing from modern premiers or prime ministers&#39; offices, not that big of a deal. But explain to me, maybe from some of your experience and knowledge, what losing a minister in such a sudden manner might mean to the broader functions of government and perhaps that ministry itself.

They said, I&#39;m quoting now from the CBC piece, they said when the minister and his staff would pull out alcohol, the doors to the office were often locked to prevent others from accidentally wandering in. Two said it was common to hear the refrain, quote, unquote, shields up as a signal to lock the doors. Once the doors were locked, a code word for gaining access to the office was sometimes decided upon. The employee said, Carter, let&#39;s talk about this because, you know, we discuss a lot of strategy on this show, but you two have particular insight into the halls of power quite literally. Alcohol consumption politics seems hand in hand. I mean, I think that&#39;s fair, I think, to say. From something like this, would you, let</span>

But the other one you said is how it&#39;s seen and if it&#39;s different. Do you feel like it&#39;s culturally different today than it was perhaps back in the day? And the reason I asked that question is, A, because you brought it up, but B, to maybe throw something else under the table for the two of you is the premier&#39;s response and the political sort of ramifications of that saying, you know, I have no, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here because I don&#39;t have the quote in front of me, but I have no real issue if people are responsible and drink socially and in politics. It&#39;s fine as long as they&#39;re responsible, etc., was kind of his headline. And that he also acknowledged that he had a drink or two with Minister Dreeschen at the time when there were some guests involved from—some stakeholders involved for his ministry. industry. Carter, how&#39;s it seen today? And does the premier have any downside here? And is he out of step with perhaps the times on how people may view alcohol and politics? Or is it all baked in and we&#39;re fine and this is just going to be, you know, move on sort of conversation? What do you think?</span>

Well, his problems only get worse, Carter, because you add the Civil Liberties Caucus, which, by the way, in media interviews on Friday, fucking hilariously, their spokesperson, one of the MPs, Gladue, was saying that, listen, we&#39;re not here to usurp his leadership. But on November 22nd, I will let you know my vaccination status. And some of us might just show up to the House of Commons to let you know our vaccination status. I&#39;m like pretty much guaranteeing she&#39;s not vaccinated. But also, Carter, in addition to the Civil Liberties Caucus, here&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing. Aaron O&#39;Toole has a note out, a leaked note out to his MP saying, do not comment on any media requests in relation to seat redistribution. And of course, what ended up happening is that memo got leaked to the media. Certain MPs said, well, why would we leave it to the leader&#39;s office to comment? They usually don&#39;t comment. They just sit on their hands and hope the problem goes away. Their whole strategy is no one move, no one gets hurt. So more frustration with Aaron O&#39;Toole in relation to his leadership. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s try to make this segment about rehabilitation. Let&#39;s be on Team O&#39;Toole. Join us on the island. I&#39;ll send a helicopter. copter. What the heck does this guy need to do? This is almost reminding me a bit of our retreat style episode that we had a segment on prior to him jumping into the campaign. We often forget how low his poll numbers were heading into that federal election when we thought everything was done. This was a done deal. And of course, this guy was leading in the first two weeks of that campaign. So a bit on that, Carter, like, let&#39;s go back to that mindset. Let&#39;s get the troops together. You know, let&#39;s figure out what the retreat needs to look like. And I&#39;m going to ask I&#39;m going to ask you the same question I did when we started that particular episode. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s have you author the agenda for what Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s retreat needs to look like. He&#39;s going to have one. He&#39;s going to say, you know what? There&#39;s a long weekend. I&#39;m going to take some time off prior to Remembrance Day. I&#39;m going to spend Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We&#39;re going to get together. Stephen Carter, help me construct the agenda. What do I need to do now?</span>

This is not a failing of Aaron O&#39;Toole. I mean, absolutely, things didn&#39;t go his way, but Stephen Harper failed to a young upstart prime minister in Trudeau that didn&#39;t have much of a record to point to outside of a very nice looking family and a really good set of hair, you know, hair, haircut. cut um then of course you know andrew shearer failed and now aaron o&#39;toole has failed well</span>

Analysis on that. Number two, there on after, how does Aaron O&#39;Toole play into that vision of what what people want to see from a Conservative Party? And number three, what&#39;s the strategy to convince the caucus, the MPs, that we can get through this together? If I was asking you to give a second look to the agenda that Carter&#39;s roughly laid out, what else would you be adding as the O&#39;Toole brain trust takes Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to figure out their strategy going forward? What else would you want to throw on that list?</span>

One of the things I find interesting about Aaron O&#39;Toole, the ghost, which is what he&#39;s been since the, you know, the election, no one&#39;s really seen him. Yeah. Yeah, is he seems to be following a strategy of conflict avoidance, which makes me think he&#39;s quite worried that any dust up that would occur, he would lose, right? And so it&#39;s not a bad strategy in that sense you might think it&#39;s cowardly you might think that it&#39;s uh you know it doesn&#39;t have the bravado of a leader but it might be the smart one if you truly do not believe that if push comes to shove these people are going to have your back at this moment and if you believe time will change that then yeah you keep your head down and you you let temperatures cool you let people get context you you you build a coalition and you build understanding standing.</span>

You&#39;ve been the most pugilistic on the show saying that there&#39;s a weak leader, strong leader model. This fits into weak leader. Is it temporally? And do you agree with Corey that conflict avoidance, which is perhaps the strategy O&#39;Toole is undertaking, is a good one, given the fact that, as Corey&#39;s analyzed, any fight he wages or, you know, jumps into the metaphorical ring-in, he might more than likely lose.</span>

I think that if O&#39;Toole starts to talk about how, you know, this revolving door of leadership is only playing into Justin Trudeau&#39;s hands, that he&#39;s willing to stay on and to work with every member of this caucus to develop a brand that works for everybody, then I think that that will actually hold some strength because he needs to serve this group. There is no heir apparent. I mean, if O&#39;Toole dropped out, there is no one standing in the wings that should be the next one. um you know there&#39;s no uh trudeau</span>

And I&#39;m going to serve you, my caucus first. And that&#39;s the type of leadership that I will put forward. And maybe he didn&#39;t do that during the campaign. Maybe they tried celebrity style, Justin Trudeau-ing Justin Trudeau. And now they have come to the conclusion, all of them together, cumulatively, that this isn&#39;t their strength. The real strength is to build a team. And ultimately, you know, you can tell everybody the lie that that&#39;s what Stephen Harper did, and maybe they&#39;ll believe it. it.</span>

Given everything that you&#39;ve kind of been able to synthesize, you know, a retreat like this would probably need some hot takes put out there saying, we should do this, we should do that. This is what we should consider. Given all the synthesis we have in our head, let&#39;s go here. Should Aaron O&#39;Toole stop being a ghost? Should he start showing up? And if so, what does that look like? Maybe we start here as the original question of his brand and an appearance. Carter&#39;s already given perhaps a model of leadership. Let&#39;s be more specific and tactical. Should he start showing up more and owning this current situation?</span>

He&#39;s alive and dead, and he&#39;s doing his best to make sure no one opens the damn box. And maybe there&#39;s some logic to that. Because if he goes in front of reporters, if he starts And he starts talking to them and they start asking, well, all of the questions about vaccination, the questions about Alberta&#39;s equalization referendum, which I still don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked about on this pod, which is pretty weird.

            <span class="text">Corey, in this strategy, is there any way he can externally telegraph leadership, telegraph? Because he&#39;s got some problems coming up. November 22nd, when the House of Commons returns, he might have the Civil Liberties Caucus. So yes, he goes in the bunker. He stays there. We decide that is what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s effectively getting out his sewing kit, sewing the entire caucus together, one phone call at a time, ensuring that the collective approach that Carter has mentioned that we can get through this together, that there&#39;s a winning play here, there&#39;s a winning strategy. Let&#39;s say he succeeds on all that, he executes it.</span>

But maybe more importantly, other members of the caucus saying, if I want to go for leadership, Maybe I need to take a few swipes now. I need to emerge. Maybe there needs to be an heir apparent in the window for people to see that there is a possibility, that there is an alternative, so to speak. So how would you suggest that he telegraph some form of leadership while playing this strategy? Yeah,</span>

Because if everybody is building up the 22nd as this big moment where we&#39;re going to see Aaron O&#39;Toole crumble and the conservatives stay united and they follow the rules or everybody shows up vaccinated or something like that, unlikely as that may seem at this particular moment, well, then that&#39;s a chance for people to go, huh, maybe</span>
