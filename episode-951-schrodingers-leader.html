          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk the resignation of Devin Dreeshen and O'Toole's caucus problems. Why do we hear so many stories about drinking in politics? Is Erin O'Toole's "discretion is the better part of valour" strategy wise? And can we hear more about Corey's real estate decisions? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

He&#39;s indicated that he will. But then you boldly said that Jason and Kenny will 100% not sign the papers because that&#39;s a fucking stupid thing to do.

Corey, what is your response? Stephen Carter is taking a victory lap. on Jason Kenney saying, yeah, sure, I&#39;ll sign the papers of one Brian Jean. But then again, I would endorse whoever the members choose and then sideswiping Jean by saying, I&#39;m sure that the local members will have some questions about the reliability of one Brian Jean, given that he did not complete his term in Parliament, he did not complete his term as MLA, and of course, that he lost as leader.

They can start building that narrative that in many ways is what we were talking about, this idea that Brian Jean&#39;s not a team player, he&#39;s in it for himself, blah, blah, blah, all the way through. I would say that from this point forward, most of what needs to happen needs to happen behind closed doors, not behind microphones. And he should be seeing, not directly, but through his intermediaries, If he can&#39;t make the ride a little bit more difficult for Brian Jean, change the conversation in Fort McMurray. If he wins the nomination, maybe at least hobble him through it.

So Jason Kenney has several months to put some sort of an emphasis on what his premiership looks like.

I want to talk about Jason Kenney losing a minister, losing his ag minister in one, Devin Dreeschen, a young up-and-coming minister out of central Alberta. His father&#39;s the MP of the area. If you&#39;ve heard of Devin Dreeschen, well, you may not have heard of him if you&#39;re outside of Alberta, but you may have seen a picture of him, because the photo of Devin Dreeschen wearing a Make America Great Again hat, holding up a drink, has kind of become one of the iconic photos out of the UCP.

            <div class="said">And I think it&#39;s it&#39;s been seen more and more of the last couple of days simply because Devin Treachan is now gone as ag minister. He resigns after admitting that he&#39;s got an alcohol problem. Hopefully, you know, the former minister gets all the help that he needs. But this is after reporting by CBC that indicated several things, including several binge drinking sessions within his office after session, often and sometimes during the day, and was part of a broader lawsuit against the premier&#39;s office in regards to a toxic workplace culture lawsuit brought on by a former staffer. Carter, you know, let&#39;s start with the raw politics of losing a minister. Let&#39;s actually start here and then drill down into specifics because you&#39;ve been in one of these offices. Losing a minister that you yourself did not want to lose and or push out, that was not engineered by you on the inside. Give me the cost of losing a minister to like the workflow and the work of a ministry. I know this is not where this story is being covered, but I really like to cover this from the perspective of what does this do to the work of a pretty important file in Alberta, in the ag file? Like, what will this do? And it could be any ministry, but this is a pretty reasonably important ministry. Losing a minister, let&#39;s start here with the conversation. What does it mean? I</div>

And those bureaucrats have the same mandate letter. They have the same marching orders from the deputy minister of executive council. And those things are still going to happen. What&#39;s not going to happen is the public face of the minister going out and meeting with all the various groups and all the stakeholders. Because realistically, that seems to me in today&#39;s governing structure to be the most important role of any minister. Make sure that your stakeholders like our government. That&#39;s your job. And this minister dropped the ball. And I think the good work of the Alberta government or the work that the bureaucrats are doing will continue on within the parameters that the premier had already set.

Two said it was common to hear the refrain, quote, unquote, shields up as a signal to lock the doors. Once the doors were locked, a code word for gaining access to the office was sometimes decided upon.

But the other one you said is how it&#39;s seen and if it&#39;s different. Do you feel like it&#39;s culturally different today than it was perhaps back in the day? And the reason I asked that question is, A, because you brought it up, but B, to maybe throw something else under the table for the two of you is the premier&#39;s response and the political sort of ramifications of that saying, you know, I have no, and I&#39;m paraphrasing here because I don&#39;t have the quote in front of me, but I have no real issue if people are responsible and drink socially and in politics. It&#39;s fine as long as they&#39;re responsible, etc., was kind of his headline. And that he also acknowledged that he had a drink or two with Minister Dreeschen at the time when there were some guests involved from—some stakeholders involved for his ministry. industry. Carter, how&#39;s it seen today? And does the premier have any downside here? And is he out of step with perhaps the times on how people may view alcohol and politics? Or is it all baked in and we&#39;re fine and this is just going to be, you know, move on sort of conversation? What do you think?</div>

I talked about it last episode in regards to his Civil Liberties Caucus. Well, his problems only get worse, Carter, because you add the Civil Liberties Caucus, which, by the way, in media interviews on Friday, fucking hilariously, their spokesperson, one of the MPs, Gladue, was saying that, listen, we&#39;re not here to usurp his leadership. But on November 22nd, I will let you know my vaccination status. And some of us might just show up to the House of Commons to let you know our vaccination status. I&#39;m like pretty much guaranteeing she&#39;s not vaccinated. But also, Carter, in addition to the Civil Liberties Caucus, here&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing. Aaron O&#39;Toole has a note out, a leaked note out to his MP saying, do not comment on any media requests in relation to seat redistribution. And of course, what ended up happening is that memo got leaked to the media. Certain MPs said, well, why would we leave it to the leader&#39;s office to comment? They usually don&#39;t comment. They just sit on their hands and hope the problem goes away. Their whole strategy is no one move, no one gets hurt. So more frustration with Aaron O&#39;Toole in relation to his leadership. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s try to make this segment about rehabilitation. Let&#39;s be on Team O&#39;Toole. Join us on the island. I&#39;ll send a helicopter. copter. What the heck does this guy need to do? This is almost reminding me a bit of our retreat style episode that we had a segment on prior to him jumping into the campaign. We often forget how low his poll numbers were heading into that federal election when we thought everything was done. This was a done deal. And of course, this guy was leading in the first two weeks of that campaign. So a bit on that, Carter, like, let&#39;s go back to that mindset. Let&#39;s get the troops together. You know, let&#39;s figure out what the retreat needs to look like. And I&#39;m going to ask I&#39;m going to ask you the same question I did when we started that particular episode. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s have you author the agenda for what Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s retreat needs to look like. He&#39;s going to have one. He&#39;s going to say, you know what? There&#39;s a long weekend. I&#39;m going to take some time off prior to Remembrance Day. I&#39;m going to spend Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We&#39;re going to get together.

One of the things I find interesting about Aaron O&#39;Toole, the ghost, which is what he&#39;s been since the, you know, the election, no one&#39;s really seen him. Yeah. Yeah, is he seems to be following a strategy of conflict avoidance, which makes me think he&#39;s quite worried that any dust up that would occur, he would lose, right? And so it&#39;s not a bad strategy in that sense you might think it&#39;s cowardly you might think that it&#39;s uh you know it doesn&#39;t have the bravado of a leader but it might be the smart one if you truly do not believe that if push comes to shove these people are going to have your back at this moment and if you believe time will change that then yeah you keep your head down and you you let temperatures cool you let people get context you you you build a coalition and you build understanding standing.</div>

You&#39;ve been the most pugilistic on the show saying that there&#39;s a weak leader, strong leader model. This fits into weak leader. Is it temporally? And do you agree with Corey that conflict avoidance, which is perhaps the strategy O&#39;Toole is undertaking, is a good one, given the fact that, as Corey&#39;s analyzed, any fight he wages or, you know, jumps into the metaphorical ring-in, he might more than likely lose.</div>

They&#39;re currently going through their negotiations to keep a two- or three-year deal in place. If you&#39;re the liberals, is this strategy overrated or underrated if you could get security for 24 or 36 months with the NDs continuing on supporting you in Parliament? You</div>
