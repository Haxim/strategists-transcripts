And you fall back into line so quickly because you&#39;re whip dogs that care only about the party and don&#39;t care at all about Albertans. And we&#39;ve seen that, especially now that, I mean, they all still stood there smiling one day after Take Back Alberta not only took, you know, took over the leadership, but now they&#39;ve taken over the party executive. This isn&#39;t the party that Jason Kenney constructed. This isn&#39;t a party that reflects progressive conservative as well as Wild Rose perspectives. It doesn&#39;t look like the Wild Rose. It doesn&#39;t look like the progressive conservatives. it looks like uh an independence party that has been taken over uh by extremists and uh choosing to sit there choosing to fall in the line um it&#39;s what the weak always do too</div>

Many, including the Catherine McKenna&#39;s and the Mark Carney&#39;s and the other notable sort of liberal types, were going with McKinney. A smaller number, I think one, Yasser Naqvi, went with Sutcliffe. I kind of want to talk to you about this as an overrated, underrated question as related to what this means for the liberals. As the majority of them leaned in on a candidate that didn&#39;t ultimately win in the heart of Canadian politics in Ottawa. You might tell me this is the most overrated thing of all time. You might tell me that there&#39;s something quite underrated about this, that the Liberals might be losing their touch or their level of connection, so to speak, with the candidate that lost by double-digit points.
