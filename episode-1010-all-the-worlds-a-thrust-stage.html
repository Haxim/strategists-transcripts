You don&#39;t really have it on lock, so to speak, with your homies. These are These are people that you may not necessarily be able to trust, so to speak, and they might stab you in the back the first chance they get.

So this is the tentpole value of a convention like that. and political parties do tend to see election year conventions as the moments to do that you&#39;ll often also see policy releases i&#39;m not there were a few things i saw from the ndp but not like a platform that wasn&#39;t released uh</span>

There&#39;s just so many more levers to pull when you are in power, and it gives you so much more range of motion. Not to kind of take away from the fact that she did a very good job of taking this stepwise. Even on Friday, I&#39;m going to announce these cabinet ministers.

A smaller number, I think one, Yasser Naqvi, went with Sutcliffe. I kind of want to talk to you about this as an overrated, underrated question as related to what this means for the liberals. As the majority of them leaned in on a candidate that didn&#39;t ultimately win in the heart of Canadian politics in Ottawa. You might tell me this is the most overrated thing of all time. You might tell me that there&#39;s something quite underrated about this, that the Liberals might be losing their touch or their level of connection, so to speak, with the candidate that lost by double-digit points.
