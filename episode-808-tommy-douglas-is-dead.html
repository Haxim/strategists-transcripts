            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. No one asked for this. This is like MJ on the Wizards. And people are like, wait, what? You were once MJ? And I&#39;m like, let&#39;s just get past that. Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, Do Not Disclose. Guys, I want to talk about the new campaign finance laws here in Alberta, specifically applying to municipalities, municipalities, but also taking this concept of what&#39;s happening here in Alberta and expanding it about what role money plays in modern politics. And I think it&#39;s going to be a healthy discussion. But before we get started, just to kind of fill some folks in, Carter and Corey, you guys may have some additional items to add, but I wanted to do a quick run-through of what Alberta&#39;s new legislation looks like for municipalities. And so we have You have donation limits that have gone up. You can now donate up to $5,000 per candidate with no limit of how many candidates you can donate to. That was by the previous NDP government, Corey, if I&#39;m not mistaken, was it set at $2,500 amongst, right, as an aggregate cumulative? Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was an aggregate cumulative of twenty five hundred. Now you can donate to and PACs actually now have a five hundred thousand dollar limit during the actual election period prior to that. No limit. And if you&#39;re doing three hundred and seventy five K or less, you do not have to disclose anything in terms of any of the expenditures. And then the other big one is you do not have to disclose donors prior to Election Day. So regardless of whether you&#39;re a PAC or a candidate, there is no disclosure of who is funding you prior to Election Day. Carter, Corey, before we kind of move on into this into into kind of the strategy of this, any other elements? Because this was a pretty big bill. Any other elements that stood out to you that you wanted to highlight before</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">before we jump into it?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think the one big thing that jumps out to me is that the PACs don&#39;t have to report if they spend under a certain amount of money. They don&#39;t have to submit audited statements. I think the number is 350 off the top of my head. had $350,000. It&#39;s a big number.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that does leave a rather significant hole, given that it takes absolutely nothing to form a PAC in Alberta. It&#39;s like Corey and I are forming the anti-Zain Velji PAC. We could just do it by</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;ll get to that in a second, Corey. But before we do, thanks for adding that thing, Carter. What do you kind of make of the legislation in general? And what are your initial thoughts when you read it or you saw it for the first time?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it&#39;s one of those things that is going to get a certain audience very keyed up and unfortunately not have a ton of resonance outside of the deeply politically engaged who already have strong opinions as to who should win any given election. Where I think it&#39;s going to be challenging to drum up opposition</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">opposition to any kind of legislation like this, which does make an election less transparent, which does mean an election is more likely to go to those with money rather than, you know, be broadly distributed amongst the population, is this is really just going back to what the election law was a couple of years ago. So it&#39;s tough to say the sky is falling, that we are in this deep new world of social injustice. This is what status quo was two years ago. So, you know, it&#39;s going to be tough to get people to care.</span>

And in 2010, when he was candidate, Nenshi always released those donors. But do you feel like it&#39;s egregious and kind of against the democratic principle? Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">exactly baked in as standard operating procedure within our country right now. Now, that said, it does seem to me that this is a clear improvement in the electoral process, right? Rather than having to wait until after the fact to see who has supported a campaign, where that money is coming from, you get to see beforehand.

But before we do that, there&#39;s two things I want to hit specific here before we kind of expand the conversation further. The first one is what I&#39;d call the S word, which is slates. We&#39;ve heard about this a lot in the municipal side. Does this legislation in your mind introduce and perhaps realize the concept of slates greater than we&#39;ve had before?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Maybe. I mean, when you have municipal PACs that are able to spend so much money without regulation, it certainly creates a strong incentive to organize your funding</span>

And when you think about how parties evolved and were created, it largely happened this way, right? You had groups-coordinated activity.

And all of a sudden, those rules around PACs create all of these loopholes, and people are making sure that they&#39;re able to get the money ahead of time and not be defined as a PAC.

What sort of ramifications are you seeing? Or give me some of your prognostication. What are you expecting to see on the PAC front in Alberta in this upcoming municipal?</span>

Now the government has said there&#39;s no surpluses, so there&#39;s an incentive to spend that money, you know bringing together your guys&#39;s points of having more spending than perhaps we&#39;re ever going to see in these municipal races but the goal was for the government to equalize this to make it fair for those that are new entrants into the race carter in your mind does this this does this legislation do that no</span>

I actually wanted to introduce a listener question later on, but I want to do this one now, which is, you know, we had a listener, PJ, asking if you&#39;re one of the counselors right now, right, knowing, to Corey&#39;s point, because Corey&#39;s point just brought this up, the rules that are not the rules that you wish they were, you know, and how do you wish they were, how would you be kind of strategizing right now as one of the counselors or a mayoral candidate? Would you be doing anything different, or would you be following the rules? And the reason I ask this question is because, you know, I worked for Calgary&#39;s Mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who often liked to play the game of how the rules were or wishes how the rules were with the donor disclosures ahead of time. If you&#39;re working for one of the councillors right now, Carter, are you just abiding by the rules or are you trying to seek the moral high ground if you&#39;re strategizing?</span>

The first is the economy. We are still sitting in a situation with millions of people unemployed or underemployed. That is a real problem. It has not yet surfaced as a problem. We haven&#39;t decided who to blame because we continue to blame COVID. But at some point, we&#39;re going to stop blaming COVID and we&#39;re going to start blaming governments. Who gets blamed for that will dictate a large swath of any election discussion. And so the economy is the first and the second, of course, is COVID itself. You know, most of our cases came from the states in our first run, you know, And we&#39;re all feeling pretty smug and pretty happy with ourselves because we&#39;re doing such a better job than the United States.</span>

No. We get the questions sometimes. Okay. Here we go. We&#39;re going to go much quicker. We&#39;re going to go less in detail. I wanted to explore those topics a bit more. Corey, over to you for the first one. On a scale of 1 to 10, Trump&#39;s team this week says that the election is Biden&#39;s to lose. All the pressure is on him. This game of expectation setting, what do you give that lack of strategy? I don&#39;t even know what to call that. What do you give that strategy a score of?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I like it a lot from the point of view of somebody who wants the United States to continue to be a democracy because it&#39;s going to make it that much harder for Trump to claim the election was rigged when he ultimately does lose it. So so the system wins in this case. Right. We can all breathe a little bit easier that Trump is acknowledging that he is not currently winning the election. As far as strategy goes, I think it&#39;s a bad one for Trump because Trump has always tried to be the guy who&#39;s like, no, I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m a winner. I win. And you can&#39;t be the winner who&#39;s down by 15 points, 10, 15 points. So Carter, what do you make of this telegraphing? I</span>

            <span class="text">mean, their staff&#39;s out on an island again, and he&#39;s just going to ignore them anyways. So the guy with the big megaphone is going to tell everybody the election&#39;s fixed, the polls are fixed, I&#39;m already winning, don&#39;t even worry about it. And then when they lose, everybody&#39;s going to be shocked and heavily armed.</span>
