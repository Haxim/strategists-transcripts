          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about election finance laws, the timing of the next federal election and calls for the resignation of Jason Kenney's speechwriter. Are political action committees about to wash Alberta municipal elections with money? Is Trudeau's standings in the polls artificial? And how much rent does Matt Wolf pay to have such a large place in Stephen Carter's head? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, Do Not Disclose. Guys, I want to talk about the new campaign finance laws here in Alberta, specifically applying to municipalities, municipalities, but also taking this concept of what&#39;s happening here in Alberta and expanding it about what role money plays in modern politics. And I think it&#39;s going to be a healthy discussion. But before we get started, just to kind of fill some folks in, Carter and Corey, you guys may have some additional items to add, but I wanted to do a quick run-through of what Alberta&#39;s new legislation looks like for municipalities. And so we have You have donation limits that have gone up. You can now donate up to $5,000 per candidate with no limit of how many candidates you can donate to. That was by the previous NDP government, Corey, if I&#39;m not mistaken, was it set at $2,500 amongst, right, as an aggregate cumulative? Yeah.</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was an aggregate cumulative of twenty five hundred. Now you can donate to and PACs actually now have a five hundred thousand dollar limit during the actual election period prior to that. No limit. And if you&#39;re doing three hundred and seventy five K or less, you do not have to disclose anything in terms of any of the expenditures. And then the other big one is you do not have to disclose donors prior to Election Day. So regardless of whether you&#39;re a PAC or a candidate, there is no disclosure of who is funding you prior to Election Day. Carter, Corey, before we kind of move on into this into into kind of the strategy of this, any other elements? Because this was a pretty big bill. Any other elements that stood out to you that you wanted to highlight before</div>

Now the government has said there&#39;s no surpluses, so there&#39;s an incentive to spend that money, you know bringing together your guys&#39;s points of having more spending than perhaps we&#39;re ever going to see in these municipal races but the goal was for the government to equalize this to make it fair for those that are new entrants into the race carter in your mind does this this does this legislation do that no</div>

I actually wanted to introduce a listener question later on, but I want to do this one now, which is, you know, we had a listener, PJ, asking if you&#39;re one of the counselors right now, right, knowing, to Corey&#39;s point, because Corey&#39;s point just brought this up, the rules that are not the rules that you wish they were, you know, and how do you wish they were, how would you be kind of strategizing right now as one of the counselors or a mayoral candidate? Would you be doing anything different, or would you be following the rules? And the reason I ask this question is because, you know, I worked for Calgary&#39;s Mayor, Naheed Nenshi, who often liked to play the game of how the rules were or wishes how the rules were with the donor disclosures ahead of time. If you&#39;re working for one of the councillors right now, Carter, are you just abiding by the rules or are you trying to seek the moral high ground if you&#39;re strategizing?</div>

We haven&#39;t decided who to blame because we continue to blame COVID. But at some point, we&#39;re going to stop blaming COVID and we&#39;re going to start blaming governments. Who gets blamed for that will dictate a large swath of any election discussion. And so the economy is the first and the second, of course, is COVID itself.

Corey, over to you for the first one. On a scale of 1 to 10, Trump&#39;s team this week says that the election is Biden&#39;s to lose. All the pressure is on him. This game of expectation setting, what do you give that lack of strategy? I don&#39;t even know what to call that. What do you give that strategy a score of?</div>

So so the system wins in this case. Right. We can all breathe a little bit easier that Trump is acknowledging that he is not currently winning the election. As far as strategy goes, I think it&#39;s a bad one for Trump because Trump has always tried to be the guy who&#39;s like, no, I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m a winner. I win. And you can&#39;t be the winner who&#39;s down by 15 points, 10, 15 points. So Carter, what do you make of this telegraphing? I</div>
