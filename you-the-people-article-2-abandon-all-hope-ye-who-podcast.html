They did so because in their independent judgment, not to do so would be a disservice to those who elected them. There was a time when the idea that a president would commit a crime was unthinkable, let alone would consider themselves above the law and not subject to such base elements.</span>

She lost in Iowa. She lost in New Hampshire. You You can argue about whether she underperformed or not, but she lost.

I mean, our system is so different because basically we elect a prime minister and that prime minister is given full control by their caucus.

This demanding of blind obedience and this demanding that they have authority above and beyond everybody else.
