        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Neither Zain, nor Annalise nor the Liberal leadership hopefuls are available to host tonight, so Stephen and Corey take the opportunity to dive into one of the most explosive allegations to hit Alberta politics in years. Which is really saying something. Let&#39;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the allegations of major scandal at Alberta Health Services. What&#39;s to be made of Smith&#39;s statement on the matter? What&#39;s to be made of the NDP response? Can Carter avoid &#34;false, baseless and defamatory&#34; commentary? Zain Velji isn&#39;t here and neither is Annalise Klingbeil. Giddy up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan talk about the Donald Trump&#39;s first 18 days, and his speed run of every bad idea anybody has ever had. Gaza guest stars as the future home of a Trump-themed Super 8 motel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

The gang unpack and build strategies for the Canadian players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about America announcing tariffs and Canada announcing retaliation. How did the Prime Minister do? What do Poilievre, Smith and the Liberal leadership candidates need to do now? What kind of consensus needs to be built? And do you think Carter is going to try to undercut Hogan by offering to run the campaign for $39 million a month? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang do a classic deep dive on the identities and brands of the six Liberal leadership campaigns that made it to the starting line, answering questions like: &#34;What is brand?&#34; and getting Carter&#39;s unbiased answers to questions about his candidate&#39;s brand. Corey Hogan&#39;s suit jacket guest stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about recent developments in liberal leadership politics before diving deep into the brands of the six candidates. Who&#39;s got the best handle on their brand? What even makes a good political brand? And did you take the under on last week&#39;s over/under question? We hope so.

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Australian Liberals need not apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the strategy of responding to continued Trump threats, how (or if) the Liberal candidates should navigate the same, how (or if) the Liberal candidates should separate from Trudeau and much more. Has Danielle Smith been put in a box of her own making by Trump declaring he doesn&#39;t need Canadian oil? Is hope good for the Liberals - even if it&#39;s delusional? And over/under on 2.5, how many Liberal leadership candidates are going to take up this once-in-a-lifetime hosting opportunity? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>
