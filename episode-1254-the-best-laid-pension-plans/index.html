        <p>The gang spend most of the time reacting to the mind-melting news that Alberta has eyes on half the Canada Pension Plan, discussing the government's strategy - and what the strategy of everyday Albertans who are opposed to this move should be - before turning briefly to the Greenbelt and the risk it presents to Doug Ford's government.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Danielle Smith's play for an Alberta Pension Plan - and to take half the CPP with her on the way out the door - before turning to Doug Ford and a stunning Greenbelt reversal. Does Danielle Smith actually think she can get her hands on half the CPP, or is there something else going on? Has Doug Ford stopped digging down? And is Formula One the new AFL? zAIn Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

You&#39;ve made it very clear this is about equal in equal out type of plan that isn&#39;t there to protect us as we age.

Look, you can go through and you can make an argument on the merits of whether it makes sense for there to be a Canada pension plan or an Alberta pension plan in the province of Alberta. I think that the argument&#39;s pretty one-sided, personally. I think it lands on Canada pension plan making sense for a bunch of reasons maybe we&#39;ll get into. They largely have to do with scale being so important in this space, The idea that they&#39;re de-risked by larger population pools. Both of those things would be lessened with an Alberta pension plan. But at the end of the day, you&#39;re kind of telling on yourself that you&#39;re a giant asshole. If you&#39;re sitting there and you&#39;re saying, hey, look at this pension plan. I found this one neat trick that the federal government doesn&#39;t want you to know. The way this formula was written in this one way. If we pull out, we think we could get half of the pension, half of the pension. like you&#39;re talking about ruining the the retirement of tens of millions of canadians like that is your clever strategy that&#39;s</div>

          <div class="said">Well, it&#39;s an interesting one, because at the end of the day, if you really want to kind of strip away all the bullshit, and I think the notion that we would get 53% of CPP is part of of the bullshit. But there are arguments for and against us being in our own pension, as I was saying. And actually, Trevor Toome wrote a really good paper about this that got released yesterday as well. I mean, I think it&#39;s a great primer for anybody who wants to understand the language of the pension, the nature of pensions, some of the considerations here. And I&#39;m going to summarize his work, and I hope I don&#39;t do it too poorly. But what it comes down to is, yeah, at this moment, moment, maybe Albertans could have lower premiums or higher money on the back end here when you retire at this moment. But it&#39;s riskier, right? So it increases risk. And that&#39;s something that Albertans need to sort of consider here. So yeah, that&#39;s one of the things that would be in theory of benefit, this idea that you would have, at the moment, potentially lower contributions or higher outputs. The other thing, though, is exactly what Stephen&#39;s talking about here. It&#39;s this notion that you then have an enormous pot of money that the government can direct towards alberta industries and in fact in this nonsense survey that was put out uh that was one of the things that was listed right like this idea of hey couldn&#39;t this be a benefit that we invest in all the</div>

And so if you look back, there were polls in the spring. And in those polls, Albertans were somewhere between 20 and 30% supportive of leaving the Canada pension plan, like rock bottom numbers, which is why it didn&#39;t come up in the election. It&#39;s why Danielle Smith said during the election, we&#39;re not going to do this. But now, you know, between this kind of miracle math that&#39;s allegedly going to give us half of the pension plan, all of the benefits, they just love you to know, to the point that the survey is like, which of these awesome things do you want to do first with all of the great money we&#39;re going to have available if we just fuck the rest of the country this way? You know, the reality is there&#39;s no handbrakes here. They are going all in and all out on this. I can&#39;t tell you the number of Government of Alberta ads I&#39;ve run across today.

And now we&#39;re going to go to a referendum on it and on what it is remains incredibly murky because we obviously don&#39;t know how much money Alberta would actually get. Alberta does have the right to pull out of the CPP, but we don&#39;t know how much money Alberta would actually get. We don&#39;t know what that pension plan would look like.

And so I think it becomes a little bit easier for the CPP to say, you know, sure, yeah, people from Alberta contributed more money than they withdrew over this period of time. But over the longer horizon that is the CPP, here&#39;s where that just falls apart for you. And actually, they were in Nanaimo, or they were back in Ontario or New Brunswick or Newfoundland or wherever they ended up going back to. And that&#39;s where they made the withdrawals. So, you know what, Alberta, it actually nets out pretty close to your share of the population in CPP, which is like 16, 17%. Like, that&#39;s what I suspect is probably going to happen. I don&#39;t have any insight into that. But it seems like it&#39;s pretty likely that with more information, and let&#39;s be super clear, there&#39;s a massive asymmetry in information between, I don&#39;t know, the Alberta government&#39;s panel that effectively did this on a cocktail napkin and CPPIB and the robust information they have there.

We know the starting point was pretty low in terms of support for leaving the CPP. Yes, they&#39;ve come out hard with their big three arguments. I think all All of them are very assailable. And I don&#39;t believe fundamentally that that&#39;s even where people are going to get hung up. They&#39;re going to get hung up on the notion that we&#39;re talking about trying to get more than half the pension. Like, I don&#39;t know that people are going to get past that in their analysis. They&#39;re going to say, well, this is all bullshit. That&#39;s obviously not the case. And then when you start having other more serious conversations behind it, like, okay, well, the management of this plan would cost, what, a billion dollars that the panel report report said?

That&#39;s actually just how these things generally tend to work, right? We have these demographic bubbles. It&#39;s It&#39;s part of why the pension looked so much under threat in the 90s before the major reforms that kind of resolved that challenge here. And then there&#39;s the simple reality that bigger pensions get better returns. The more money you have to play around with, the more deals are available to you, the more you actually make the market in different ways. And we are way better off working</div>
