          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan get detailed about funding for "political staff". Was it wise of the Liberals, Conservatives and NDP to apply for the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy? Is the Alberta premier's office overpaid and overstaffed? And is Zain really just an uglier and meaner version of Jon Favreau? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

            <div class="said">Well, if I&#39;m the Alberta NDP, I am only going after the UCP. if I am 100% certain I am not going to need to call on that wage subsidy, because you want to talk about hypocrisy. It&#39;s one thing to use a federal program that&#39;s out there that you may have ideological challenges with. It&#39;s another entirely to slam somebody for using it and then get it yourself. That is true hypocrisy. And I think that when I look at the comments the Alberta NDP have made, they&#39;ve been pretty measured. It&#39;s more like, so far, we haven&#39;t used the federal wage subsidy. And they&#39;re keeping their options open because they, like the rest of of us have no idea how long this is going to go on.

            <div class="said">the last thing I want to talk about on this subject is the messaging. So we talked about the politics, the political upside, downside. The one interesting thing about this story was how it was rolled out. So if you recall, it was rolled out initially as something that the federal NDP alone were taking advantage of. And there was almost a profile on the federal NDP, their staffers, their building. And I think what they tried to do was get out in front of it, own it, rather than the other two parties, the Libs and the conservatives, who also were taking advantage of this but weren&#39;t waving their arms loudly. Carter, over to you. What did you make of this? Because for the first four hours of this story, and I know this is inside political baseball, but for the first four hours, the public thought this was a program that only, of course, the federal NDP would come in third place were going to use. But what did you make of their strategy and what would you have done differently?</div>

            <div class="said">One of the things that politicians on both the left and the right have been pretty keen to do whenever they are not benefiting from any of these, whether it&#39;s subsidies or donation supports, you know, because donations get huge tax credits. I have some shocking news for people out there. That means that is public money being foregone. Basically, the equivalent of public money going to these parties through that too. too. But, you know, politicians have stoked that flame, right? They&#39;ve said this is ridiculous. We shouldn&#39;t be giving public money to these. They should be able to pick themselves up by their bootstraps and fundraise for themselves.</div>

            <div class="said">And maybe they&#39;ll think a bit harder about that now, now that they need to rely on these subsidies as well. I know there&#39;s more than one conservative politician that I follow who has given these great pay-ins to, no, these public dollars are are well spent on democracy, right? Democracy is important. Why wouldn&#39;t you want it to go there? I think it&#39;s ridiculous. It wouldn&#39;t. Well, these are the same federal politicos who are also the first to say, get rid of that federal wage subsidy. What a waste of money. It should only be private money that is going to political operations. So look, I mean, there&#39;s a lot of hypocrisy going around, but as I am fond of saying, hypocrisy is the human condition. I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s going to take too much of a beating for this. The federal NDP, I suspect Stephen is right, in six months some people will only remember that uh because of uh the fact that after four hours it just wasn&#39;t news anymore and it&#39;s really less news once everybody&#39;s doing it um and certainly when i looked at just comments and feedback on stories 80</div>

And this comes to us from a story here in Alberta, where it was revealed, can I say, that Jason Kenney&#39;s political staff now totals $2.9 million. And I think this is an interesting gateway for us to maybe talk about what a political staff within a premier&#39;s office looks like. I think both of you guys have intimate knowledge of not just the titles, the positions, but frankly, the operations of these things. And, you know, maybe I&#39;ll start with you, Carter, which is, first of all, let&#39;s comment on this particular Alberta story. So let&#39;s start with the Alberta part of it, which is, is this a scandal for Jason Kenney and the UCP? And if I can just, you know, try to catch people up, it was ultimately revealed that it&#39;s $2.9 million. Many people said that some of these positions never existed in the previous Notley government. government, the UCP has come back and said, Oh, no, we&#39;re actually 20 plus percentage points cheaper than the notly government premier staff. And then you had a UCP MLA, Drew Barnes, come out and say, Oh, I&#39;m disappointed by these numbers. These are very high, especially in these, you know, crisis pandemic time. So let&#39;s just start with the political story at hand. And then let&#39;s go deeper. Carter, is this a scandal that the UCP needs to be worried about?</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah. And actually, the way you teed that up, I have a million things to say on this topic, all of which will be boring if I go too far so i&#39;ll try to keep it on treetops but look first of all uh there&#39;s a difference between political staff and and public service staff that is not well understood i think and fair enough right uh because those lines haven&#39;t always been perfectly adhered to which sort of builds into my point here but political staff are allowed to be um political right like they they can have an axe to grind they can they can put what we&#39;d call contrast messaging in there more aggressively talk about how they&#39;re better than, you know, the other side. Public servants aren&#39;t like that. You know, I was a public servant up until two and a half months ago, and we have a code of conduct, and we&#39;re expected to comport ourselves in a certain fashion. And there&#39;s just different rules of the game. And so I say that as a tee up to this point. A growing political staff isn&#39;t always bad, because those positions existed in the Klein era. Those positions exist in a lot lot of governments. But what they will often do in absence of putting them on the books as political staff within a premier&#39;s office is hide them within what is supposed to be a nonpartisan public service. So in many ways, when you see it, like quite candidly, it can be, you know, somebody having the courage to just say, all right, we&#39;re going to put some sunlight on this. This is the way it should be done. Certainly, Rachel Notley, with the release of all of the political contracts was a big step in that direction, you know, moving a lot of the issues management there steven when you were chief of staff under redford uh the creation of the press secretaries which moved the political part of communications out of the public service undoubtedly grew the size of the political staff but it was the right thing to do and then the last thing i&#39;ll say is there&#39;s a lot of ways to measure growth and where the where the where the people are there is the premier&#39;s office there&#39;s the minister&#39;s office are you talking about political staff overall are you talking about uh positions also that that might be funded by individual departments.

There was an interview that came out where Elizabeth Warren has been softening her stance on Medicare for all, presumably to get herself into the race for VP. She ultimately said that all we need to make is progress on healthcare. She&#39;s been less Less committal than she was full-throatedly on the campaign trail during the primary, but Medicare for all. What do you think of her strategy on a scale of 1 to 10 right now?

And if she&#39;s hearing either directly or through channels that they think that she&#39;s too exposed on this issue, look, this is her last shot. I mean, they&#39;re all getting up there in the years. This septuagenarian parade we&#39;ve got of political candidates in the United States is wild, but she&#39;s not going to get another run at the presidency here. That to me seems unfathomable. So why not position yourself for the vice presidency, try to do good? I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ever been driven by the healthcare issue. I&#39;m sure many people will jump on and tell me why I&#39;m wrong on that front. but to me it&#39;s always been for her wall street the economy overall the need to to you know trust bust and those things that&#39;s what she cares about she has made the decision herself that she&#39;s willing to let go of the health care thing which was always kind of maybe a priority but a lesser priority so i i think that&#39;s fine i think that makes sense like i said it&#39;s her last shot you know there&#39;s</div>
