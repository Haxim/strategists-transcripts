        <p><em><strong>FIXED AUDIO. SORRY ABOUT THAT GANG, WE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH OUR RECORDING PLATFORM YESTERDAY, HAD TO DO THINGS MANUALLY WHICH, I MEAN, YOU LISTEN, YOU HAVE TO KNOW NOBODY HAS THE COMPETENCE FOR THAT.</strong></em><br /><br />Stephen, Zain and Corey are reunited to talk about the Canada Post strike and Freeland/Trudeau drama in Ottawa.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the (impending) pause to the Canada Post strike and Trudeau's crumbling partnership with Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland. When it comes to the Canada Post job action so far - who's winning and who's losing? When it comes to the relationship between the PMO and the Finance Minister - is it too far gone? And when it comes to "full confidence", would you purchase it from a .CA domain or are you looking for the seal that a .COM delivers?  Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I&#39;m waiting for a couple of important pieces of mail that are important to me. And I couldn&#39;t believe, I still cannot believe that this strike has gone on for a month. You would think you&#39;d start to see some sort of bend from either the union or from Canada Post. I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s going to happen. And so I think it&#39;s entirely appropriate that the minister step in and return normal service for a period of time. I&#39;m not sure if May is the right timeline. I think that getting us through the Christmas season is really essential. This is the only time I think the Canada Post may be an essential service. So getting us through the Christmas season is certainly important.</div>

It&#39;s starting to feel less and less essential, especially with all of the parcel delivery services that exist out there that we interact on a day-in, day-out basis. So I think this is not just about saving Christmas. I really feel in some ways this is about saving the essential nature of Canada Post.</div>

They see the impact. impact. Corey&#39;s not kidding when he&#39;s talking about the impact on small business. This is a significant set of impact on small businesses, and it</div>
