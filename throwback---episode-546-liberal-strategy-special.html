You&#39;re starting from this ground place, And then you are trying to add the next easiest set, the next easiest set, the next easiest set. And maybe you get to majority. Depends on how far you get prior to the election actually happening.</div>

We need to look at the demographics that are out there, past election results, the resources the parties have on hand as far as the amount of money which tells us an awful lot about what we can expect them to do certain things are just off the table if you don&#39;t have any local resourcing same with</div>

That&#39;s quite a turnaround from where they were about six months ago, where they were the leaders.

          <div class="said">wisdom, why don&#39;t we take it from there, is that, well, okay, so let me put it this way. There is conventional wisdom, and then there&#39;s conventional wisdom, what strategists conventionally say, and then there&#39;s what appears to be the truth in this case, which is much different still. So people like to say when they look at a poll, oh, yeah, okay, you&#39;ve got those guys in the lead, but look at that, 30% undecided. If they all break to the liberals, they&#39;re going to win. That&#39;s stupid. I hope none of you out there are that stupid.</div>

          <div class="said">counterpoint is something that strategists often say. I know I&#39;ve said this myself many times, is that undecideds tend to break along the same lines as the decided voters. And that kind of makes sense, especially when you look at it from a statistical standpoint. You&#39;ve got a sample of 60% voting one way and a sample of 40% who share a lot of similarities with that 60%. How are they going to break? because it&#39;s not like the 40% who don&#39;t vote are entirely common in other</div>

          <div class="said">OK, that was very, very cool stuff and a lot to unpack there. I do want to quickly summarize for people that may be catching up on on all the things that we just talked about. So number one, high level of undecideds, right? Overall, across the board, high level of undecideds. Number two, Stephen, you&#39;re mentioning that the disparity between gender on undecideds tends to favor women with more of them being undecided. That&#39;s number two. Corey, you mentioned that there&#39;s also this factor that the undecideds do not seem to be breaking the way the decideds are. That&#39;s factor number three. And we&#39;re now talking about how that may split across all of the provinces or may have particular leanings to specific provinces, right? Right. Right.</div>

          <div class="said">Right. And I think you might be listening to me and saying, like, well, what do you mean the undecideds are breaking a different way? But we talked about this a bit earlier and kind of our tee up for this. We&#39;re not just looking at voting intent and this is their intent is undecided. But we also look at accessibility and viability. Accessibility is who would you consider voting for? Viability is who do you think is going to win? Right. Right. And what you find is that the options that the undecideds are considering are much more likely to be liberal or New Democrat than have conservative in the mix. Yeah.</div>

          <div class="said">they only have one seat in New Brunswick right now. The NDP have one seat, and then the balance of the seats are conservative. But the conservatives in our polling and in our trends are really starting to drop in New Brunswick. And up come the NDP. But I don&#39;t think the NDP are going to sustain it. I think that we&#39;re looking at three seats for sure in New Brunswick and as many as six. So that becomes kind of our first, oh, here&#39;s some seats that we could grab.

          <div class="said">Let me kind of agree with you, I guess, by way of looking at the accessibility numbers. When you look at New Brunswick, when you look at everywhere in Atlantic Canada, the Liberals&#39; accessibility numbers are totally off the charts, both in general and then with the undecideds. In a good way. Yeah, in a great way. Like at New Brunswick, we were just talking about 50% of voters said they&#39;d consider voting liberal, 59% in Newfoundland, 52% in Nova Scotia. Those are high numbers. I mean, I know we haven&#39;t gone through everywhere yet, but liberal accessibility numbers are higher in Atlantic Canada than anywhere else in the country. I think their ceiling is pretty high. If anything, I think you&#39;re underestimating their ceiling in this context. Well,</div>

At this particular moment in 2011, it was a Conservative-Liberal fight for most of the seats in Atlantic Canada. At this stage, if the Liberal Party is going to take more seats, they have to be more worried about the New Democrats than they are about the Conservatives. That is going to repeat itself only,</div>

The Liberals are very polarizing. what the conservatives have become to so much of the rest of the country the liberals have been for a generation to quebec and they have a real hard ceiling in quebec and that hard ceiling is around 30 percent that&#39;s while the new democrats are looking at a hard ceiling of almost 60 percent wow twice that number yeah</div>

Toronto itself is a fight between the liberals and the New Democrats. And then Southern Ontario is not exactly out of play either.

If they continue to push on infrastructure and economy, my belief is that it is not enough to change the ballot box question and not enough to change the outcome. There&#39;s a really interesting McLean&#39;s poll that was put out, and I&#39;m sure we can put it somewhere on a tag so people can look at it.

I want to make the liberal party the family first party that puts why are we looking at bringing in infrastructure construction? because this is the time to invest in our future for our families, for our children. Why do I want to be taking care of the middle class? Because it&#39;s about families. It&#39;s about middle class families. It&#39;s not just about the middle class. I want to now make it about middle class families. Why is the Liberal Party the party that cares about refugee families?

And I&#39;ll take care of your economy that enables the wedge issue, the health care issues, the other things to be dropped in by the liberals and be more effective.

Now, normally, when you have policies that test well, sometimes people have the very mistaken urge to just announce them in some random order.

Not that we&#39;re listening to the polls, but let&#39;s get to British Columbia and let&#39;s get as many votes as we can get. Then the next step that we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to take a jump from BC back to Ontario, and that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to announce a significant policy in two weeks.

          <div class="said">Okay. So this is good. This was an exciting discussion. I do want to tease it back from the top. So we started this thing by forming some hypotheses at the beginning. We talked about the grassroots support, about the urban areas that the Liberals may be strong at. We then went into the field. We got data and we tried to back this up, which informed our situation analysis, which we completed today. It was about the goal. We put our goal at forming government, right? That was what Corey said, forming government and the 120 seats. From there, we went into our strategic opportunities for where we need to go. Carter, you took us across the country. B.C., Ontario stood out as the main grounds that we needed to go. When we look at the how now, we&#39;re looking at a</div>

          <div class="said">a social-based policy or social-based policies targeting B.C. and Ontario where you&#39;re now getting viability off the table and you are now having the issues of trust being put into play. That&#39;s where we are today. Corey, anything I missed right there?</div>

          <div class="said">No, I think that&#39;s a pretty good summary. These things are always more complicated than that. In fact, there&#39;s a lot of data we skipped over in our own analysis because</div>

          <div class="said">perhaps we figured it wasn&#39;t germane at the end of the day. But I will say this. Ultimately, if this strategy is going to be successful for the liberals, any strategy, it has to align Justin Trudeau&#39;s strengths with the opportunities available in the electorate. And I think Carter and I, I don&#39;t want to speak for you, but I think we see there is those opportunities. We</div>
