          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and they select the leader. Now, they&#39;re bound delegates. It&#39;s not unlike a primary system in the U.S. where you are a delegate, but you are bound to the person that you said you would support. So you&#39;re going to support Richard Starkey, or you&#39;re going to support Sandra Janssen, or you&#39;re going to support Rick McIver, whoever&#39;s running. And you run, and you declare that, and you&#39;re part of their slate, and you win or lose in the riding according to proportional representation. You get 30% of the vote, you get 30% of the delegates. You get 20% of the votes, 20% of the delegates.</span>

How does this deviate from the norm in a sense, like what would the norm be Carter&#39;s talking about a very early deadline to become a member and be on this board. But what else and we&#39;ll talk about the implications that I don&#39;t want to forget that.

            <span class="text">i suspect strongly it&#39;s been quite the opposite now what this means of course is that if you had done this long ago you have now self-selected yourself into this aristocracy that has a much much higher chance of being a delegate to a convention. Now, let&#39;s just say, so</span>

            <span class="text">so this is by October 1. Now, say right now, for fun, you have a board of directors of five members in a random constituency. Sure. Why in God&#39;s green earth would you appoint any additional board members between now and October 1? You&#39;re guaranteed to be a delegate if you do not. Normally, what happens is the board can replenish itself. It can add other board members in between annual general meetings. There&#39;s also a freeze, I&#39;m told, on annual general meetings. So it&#39;s not like the board&#39;s</span>

You look at the rabble out there, you look at the rest of the people, and they&#39;ve got to fight for the rest of the delegate positions. That&#39;s definitely creating a strange overclass in the PC party. And ultimately, I mean, that&#39;s what I can&#39;t believe. It seems like the PC insiders have decided their problem was they were too open and they&#39;ve got to lock down. And I&#39;ll tell you, in my experience, when parties start fearing takeovers and locking the doors like that, parties die, right? I</span>

So we&#39;ve talked about, and we&#39;ll talk ramifications in a second. So we&#39;ve talked about what the rules are. We&#39;ve talked about the change from a system of one member, one vote to a delegate system. But Carter, to your point, and in extension of Corey&#39;s, what could the unintended consequences of a system that has superdelegates, what you&#39;d call, and I&#39;m going to use your label, quasi-superdelegates, what could the unintended consequences be of a system like this? Just in generalities first, and then we&#39;ll get into specific candidates per se.</span>

Is the danger have greater ramifications within our system? Is the disparity that Carter talks about between members something that&#39;s overblown in your mind? Or do you also, as you&#39;ve mentioned, feel like this could actually be, you know, the beginning of the end if they move through in this manner?</span>

            <span class="text">The system that is in the United States, why we all call them superdelegates, It came out of the Democratic Party&#39;s situation, which was created because they were worried they were electing too liberal of candidates. The masses, with their passions being inflamed, were getting these liberal lions into positions of power, and they wanted to introduce a check against this. So they authorized party officials, elected officials, to have a vote regardless. They didn&#39;t have to stand for election in the primary system, in the caucus system. And that became what we now know as superdelegates. Now, what</span>

And, of course, that&#39;s a bad look. I just don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t think more about the optics.

Is there any other out that they have, like, in terms of both messaging and procedure to say, well, in fact, I hear some of the lines on Twitter these days, well, these rules were always in place. And as what you mentioned, we could do whatever we want. We&#39;re a party, blah, blah, blah. Sure. Yeah. What&#39;s messaging that would work if you&#39;re them right now?

And this is a system that is unique to this unique set of circumstances. And we&#39;re not committing that this is how we&#39;re going to do it going forward, but we&#39;ve just come out of an election. We know we&#39;re particularly prone or vulnerable to a takeover, and we have to be sensible about these things. We&#39;re not saying necessarily that this is our ideal form of democracy.

            <span class="text">make them pay by check or credit card no cash that&#39;s easy enough if you want to do cash maybe make them show up with id in certain situations validate them against the voters list uh which they did last time and And they&#39;re probably going to do to an extent this time as well, right? And if they&#39;re not, you know, because many political parties allow non-citizens to vote if they&#39;re permanent residents, have a process to deal with that as well. But any check you make like that makes, like, you&#39;ve increased the level of engagement required to get involved. Like, you&#39;ve got an additional verification step, which means you&#39;re going to filter out the people who don&#39;t care very much. And that&#39;s inevitably going to get, you&#39;re not going to be able to do these floods of members like Stephen was talking about. and then you can just set cutoff dates that are wildly at back uh you can set the spending limits low so if for example you&#39;re worried about jason kenney having all the money cap it at 150 000 and then who cares he does he can&#39;t do anything with that extra money uh maybe make a requirement that you know what they could have done is make a requirement explicit that said you must be eligible to be an mla in</span>

And from that, the committee, I don&#39;t know if there were votes, but I think it generally worked by consensus. We came to conclusions. We put together a glossy, big document that explained everything that we assessed, how how we went through provided to the board of directors to do the kind of final vote on</span>

Politics I&#39;m talking about. For me, it&#39;s always about openness, democracy, those kinds of things. I think people should be involved in the process. I always push for the most open process possible. And, uh, there were some changes, but generally it was accepted. The big curveball that was put in the liberal contest was after those rules were accepted at a special general meeting we called. We managed to push even more aggressive changes so that federal liberal system of registered supporters being able to vote originated in Alberta. It originated with us at that special general meeting. And that was wild because all of a sudden we had the most open contest. And that was pretty crazy. But, of course, there were people who wanted to see a much more closed contest. test and generally speaking uh there were two groups of people who wanted to do that one was the the uh notion that they just didn&#39;t like the system and they were sort of trying to re-litigate the special general meeting requests like let&#39;s see the member votes separate from the registered supporter votes things we were just like no that&#39;s that&#39;s not going to happen there&#39;s not two classes of voters um but</span>
