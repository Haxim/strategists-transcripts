          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan discuss leadership rules through the prism of the Alberta PCs setting the stage for their contest. What's fair in a leadership contest? How does the party establishment put its thumb on the scale? And how awful is the return of crowd favourite segments "Magic Pills" and "Fortune Cookies"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Why in God&#39;s green earth would you appoint any additional board members between now and October 1? You&#39;re guaranteed to be a delegate if you do not. Normally, what happens is the board can replenish itself. It can add other board members in between annual general meetings. There&#39;s also a freeze, I&#39;m told, on annual general meetings.

That&#39;s definitely creating a strange overclass in the PC party. And ultimately, I mean, that&#39;s what I can&#39;t believe. It seems like the PC insiders have decided their problem was they were too open and they&#39;ve got to lock down.

            <div class="said">The system that is in the United States, why we all call them superdelegates, It came out of the Democratic Party&#39;s situation, which was created because they were worried they were electing too liberal of candidates. The masses, with their passions being inflamed, were getting these liberal lions into positions of power, and they wanted to introduce a check against this. So they authorized party officials, elected officials, to have a vote regardless. They didn&#39;t have to stand for election in the primary system, in the caucus system.

And this is a system that is unique to this unique set of circumstances. And we&#39;re not committing that this is how we&#39;re going to do it going forward, but we&#39;ve just come out of an election. We know we&#39;re particularly prone or vulnerable to a takeover, and we have to be sensible about these things. We&#39;re not saying necessarily that this is our ideal form of democracy.

And if they&#39;re not, you know, because many political parties allow non-citizens to vote if they&#39;re permanent residents, have a process to deal with that as well. But any check you make like that makes, like, you&#39;ve increased the level of engagement required to get involved. Like, you&#39;ve got an additional verification step, which means you&#39;re going to filter out the people who don&#39;t care very much. And that&#39;s inevitably going to get, you&#39;re not going to be able to do these floods of members like Stephen was talking about. and then you can just set cutoff dates that are wildly at back uh you can set the spending limits low so if for example you&#39;re worried about jason kenney having all the money cap it at 150 000 and then who cares he does he can&#39;t do anything with that extra money uh maybe make a requirement that you know what they could have done is make a requirement explicit that said you must be eligible to be an mla in</div>

I always push for the most open process possible. And, uh, there were some changes, but generally it was accepted. The big curveball that was put in the liberal contest was after those rules were accepted at a special general meeting we called. We managed to push even more aggressive changes so that federal liberal system of registered supporters being able to vote originated in Alberta. It originated with us at that special general meeting. And that was wild because all of a sudden we had the most open contest. And that was pretty crazy. But, of course, there were people who wanted to see a much more closed contest. test and generally speaking uh there were two groups of people who wanted to do that one was the the uh notion that they just didn&#39;t like the system and they were sort of trying to re-litigate the special general meeting requests like let&#39;s see the member votes separate from the registered supporter votes things we were just like no that&#39;s that&#39;s not going to happen there&#39;s not two classes of voters um but</div>
