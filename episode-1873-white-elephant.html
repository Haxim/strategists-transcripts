          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the first minister&#39;s meeting has concluded at least the first tranche of the conversations that are public in saskatoon and it is all love doug ford coming out and saying that this is the best meeting that they have had in years oh it doesn&#39;t matter that there&#39;s no guarantees and no specific projects on the list even though and despite Shannon, we were promised a list. Talk to me about what your takeaway here is, at least from the communication you see from the premiers, that you see from the prime minister, there was a high bar here, was the high bar met?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Yes. The dividing line in Canadian politics, the axis of disagreement is federalism, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Daniel Smith can&#39;t do politics of grievance on specific groups. Even the furthest reaches of the right in this country can&#39;t exploit the politics of grievance to other specific groups of people, recently arrived immigrants or anyone else. It doesn&#39;t fly in Canadian politics. What flies is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">is othering on the basis of region. That is what Canada is built on. And any time that you can rise above that, even for a moment, even to set the tone or the agenda of a government and, you know, in a honeymoon phase, that is a good day. And you could tell that no premier saw political advantage in bursting that bubble today. When you watch them all parade out doing their little power politics hits and their little press conferences, every single one of them were effusive and kind of ready to give</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">give the federal government a chance. It doesn&#39;t matter that there&#39;s no specific list as a matter of public policy, as a matter of the public interest. I&#39;m glad there isn&#39;t a specific list, because I&#39;m looking for some due diligence here. Not to get too far down the rabbit hole of the policy aspects of this. But I mean, I don&#39;t want people, you know, signing off on a bunch of white elephants and spending a bunch of money where they shouldn&#39;t on projects that may or may not have, you know, social or political support, as well as, you know, support from the financial side. So I think this was an unmitigated success, a rare one in Canadian politics. And we should take those wins where we can get them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Connor, same question to you. And then I&#39;ve got a follow up around, are we absorbing as a Canadian public any of this and what that can do, what that can actually mean for Carmi&#39;s chances of telling a winning story, even though he&#39;s having winning meetings and winning projects? I&#39;m assuming your answer, but give it to me rather than me assuming it. What was did this meet the bar today? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that it met the bar from the expectations of people who pay attention. Shannon&#39;s happy.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And that&#39;s all that I can really, you know, I mean, as long as Shannon&#39;s happy, then the people who pay attention are happy. That&#39;s all we can ask for. But the gen pop, you know, we don&#39;t pay attention anymore. We&#39;ve talked a lot about the downfall of traditional media. We&#39;ve talked a lot more about the downfall of social media in the last few years. Who exactly is following this? Who&#39;s paying attention at this stage? And what impact is going to have? Because it&#39;s going to have to be more than one weekend or one week, right? It&#39;s going to have to be a sustained push from this government and really sustained communication structures for the better part of a year before people are really going to start to grab onto it. Shannon&#39;s proclamation that federalism as our last bone to pick is done. You know, I mean, she&#39;s a little optimistic. mystic uh i think that you know we&#39;re still going to be able to danielle smith will still find a way to blame mark carney for everything that goes wrong oh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">oh i&#39;m not saying that it&#39;s not that that it&#39;s gone that&#39;s what you said that&#39;s what you said it&#39;s absolutely not what you said no i was listening i was paying attention the tradition</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">for sure it&#39;s it is gone uh or it is uh we&#39;ve got some grace today i would say uh it&#39;s It&#39;s coming back. You already heard Daniel Smith sort of saying it is. What was it? Necessary, but not sufficient precondition. Right.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Shannon, talk to me about the question Carter refuses to answer because he probably isn&#39;t up to it, which is what is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is the cost of us not absorbing everything Carney is doing? he&#39;s trying to tell a very specific story as an extension of the election around who the protagonists are why we&#39;re doing what we&#39;re doing and who the antagonists are and does this fit that storyline for you and is this happening too fast perhaps for the general public to consume all of this to understand what&#39;s happening here why we&#39;re doing certain things or do you think they&#39;re just providing him grace to do whatever for however long undetermined</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">undetermined amount of time well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">well the public wants a economic response to an economic threat uh so in as much as they&#39;re getting anything and and stuff like this does punch through right it&#39;s not like the usual cut and thread of politics of what&#39;s going on in the house or question period or what have you uh it&#39;s a much different uh type of uh media story right because it involves all of the premiers and it and and if anything punches through it&#39;s that carney wants to build stuff which is actually kind of what he said right And if you were to go out and ask man on the street, that&#39;s very likely what they would say, I guess he wants to build stuff, we&#39;ll see how it goes. That&#39;s what you&#39;d get from your average Albertan, I&#39;m quite certain. So, in that sense, you know, job done on this day. Going forward, the price, though, to your actual question, the price that gets paid going forward is that there are a lot of, there&#39;s a lot of politics between here and there in terms of whatever</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">whatever projects we&#39;re talking about, whatever regulatory processes we&#39;re pulling out of the way with whatever legislation he ends up tabling. And the extent to which people aren&#39;t kind of understanding that there are trade-offs there is the extent that the dragons are just around the corner, right, of changing up the environmental rules, of even circumventing some of our Section 35 responsibilities. I don&#39;t know how they&#39;re going to do that, but I&#39;m talking about the Indigenous consultation pieces. Some of this is coming, and there are conflicts to come. And if the public&#39;s not kind of tracking the drumbeat on this, all of a sudden we&#39;re going to be into conflicts around specific proposals, projects in specific geographic spaces, and the public&#39;s not going to have a lot of context for that.</span>

And they&#39;re saying, okay, we&#39;re not jumping in today. It doesn&#39;t seem right. None of the premiers are jumping in today. This is not something to oppose. But Carter, help us find the soft tissue here between what Carney&#39;s putting out right now and where this could go. Help us see around the corner. Channon&#39;s saying here that this is eventually going to fray. Danielle&#39;s going to do her thing. Help us see around the corner what opportunities exist for us to get ourselves into the narrative, into the story. This is an economic file that historically conservatives have been leading.

If it&#39;s something like a pipeline that has to go across the nation with an environmental and First Nations consultation process, that&#39;s less good, much less good, because now that could be a 10-year project.

I&#39;m sure it happens to munis as well, right? They get the same kind of representations. And then you have private sector proponents for various projects who come in and say, oh, you know, my factory widget making is going to employ, you know, untold thousands of people and bring in untold millions of tax revenue and what have you. And it&#39;s shovel ready. It is also not. But that&#39;s fine. That happens all the time. Right. Which is why that level of due diligence is really important. And if it is actually ready to go, then or even if it&#39;s close, and this is where like, I, I given a bit of confidence that a guy who was, you know, the chair of Brookfield, I will have some sense on how projects are financed and managed.

            <span class="text">And you&#39;ve got a more tenuous coalition to hold together in British Columbia for the Liberal Party of Canada than you have elsewhere. You have to get back some of that more working class, blue-collar vote in southern Ontario. Okay. And you need to have an affordability pitch there. Maybe it&#39;s not a nation building project in Brampton, maybe it&#39;s more housing there, but I&#39;d also be doing some polling on what people are looking for in those areas. And you also have to hold together a Quebec coalition. If you&#39;re going to go stomping through the environment, you&#39;re going to find PDQ that the BQ is going to start eating your lunch, right? Right. So you have to think about those regional dynamics. But I would say because of that, you&#39;re going to want to look at British Columbia and southern Ontario as two spots where if you&#39;ve got something, move it.</span>

And that just made more opportunity for people to go to war on it. I&#39;m thinking here of the emissions cap legislation, the electricity regs. You know, these were the emissions cap in particular. I want to say it was three or four years of consult, right, from sort of idea to, like, not even execution. And so, you know, people did get tired of that at various levels, and not just, you know, in Alberta or on the so-called right or whatever the case may be. It just it took them a long time to do anything. You know, I&#39;m thinking here of like Long-Term Care Act, some of these things.
