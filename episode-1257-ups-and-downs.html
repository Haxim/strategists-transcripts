            <span class="text">let&#39;s move it on to our first i don&#39;t have time fucking time for this my man at 45 percent of my computer let&#39;s move it on to the first yeah Yeah, I&#39;m also dealing with a clock of my own. Yeah, this is a mess. We&#39;re a gong show. That&#39;s good. Give us your money, by the way, people. Keep doing it. Our first segment, Carter, the cost of living politically. I have three topics on hand, and I want to ask you guys the political cost of them. They&#39;ve emerged in the news. I want to talk about the specific story, but I want to talk about then the broader story as well. Carter, let&#39;s start here. The first story. We</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">have Pierre Pauliev now, through sources and reporting by Radio Canada, they&#39;ve talked to multiple conservative sources that are saying Pierre Pauliev is going to be temporarily mealy-mouthed on the entire gender identity parental rights issue. They really don&#39;t know where to go with this particular file. Do they take the lead of some of the conservative premiers and follow their step on defending parental rights? some premiers defending it to the nth degree, perhaps even bringing out that notwithstanding clause? Or do they have a more tame response on it, per se? But Carter, the question I have in this segment called The Cost of Living Politically is, what is the political cost of the public seeing your calculus, or the public seeing you calculate this, of this leak coming out Now, through multiple sources saying you&#39;re actually not just engaging in conviction, which was the Pierre Polyev brand, or one of the brands that he said he was going to bring, but that you actually have calculus in you and that you are calculating on this particular file. So the question around cost, Carter, political cost, is around what cost do you pay when people see you making political calculus open in public and see that sausage being made?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, this is really interesting because I&#39;m, you know, I wanted to respond that some issues are beyond politics, right? Some issues are more important in politics and standing up for children&#39;s rights is probably first among them. And then I kind of thought, well, is that my own political calculus, right? Like, am I just taking a position that I know will have certain resonance within the audiences that we&#39;re talking to tonight?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so my own political calculus has been conducted. My political language</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">language is set so that I offend the least number of people or I inspire a certain subset of it. The challenge is when you allow it to be seen, when you allow it to be seen, then it takes away some of the value of the action. So, you know, weighing it shows to the, you know, the far right that they that you&#39;re not a true believer, you know, taking these kind of half steps shows the other sides that you&#39;re you know, you&#39;re also just kind of waffling for political gain.

            <span class="text">You&#39;re talking about the cost. I&#39;m going to suggest to you there&#39;s also a benefit. I think they want to show the calculation on this one. I think where they&#39;re going to end up is a situation where they say something to the effect of the conflict we feel is the conflict Canadians feel. We are unsure about this issue. It makes us deeply uncomfortable how far this has pushed against parents&#39; rights to be involved in their children&#39;s lives, but it also makes us deeply uncomfortable to do anything heavy-handed when we know there are children involved and we know there are legitimate reasons for better and stronger protections in this space. And yes, you saw that conflict at our convention. You probably have seen that conflict at your Thanksgiving table as people come to this well-meaning with very different views. So as conservatives, we&#39;re not sure. So let&#39;s talk a bit about principles. Let&#39;s talk about the things that we believe in. We believe in protecting children. We believe that parents know better how to raise their children as a general rule than anybody else does. does. And, you know, I could easily see Pierre Polyev actually spinning out a message track from that conflict. I don&#39;t think the conflict hurts him. I don&#39;t think the idea that he&#39;s going to rag the puck and flip-flop and be mealy-mouthed hurts him if everybody thinks that&#39;s the strategy. And so, you know, there are some benefit to the calculation being exposed bare there. So the next round of, you know, articles about Pierre Polyev giving deeply unsatisfactory answers about this they&#39;ll say oh yes but that&#39;s his internal strategy to manage these forces look how clever the man is right like it&#39;s like meta yeah it is it&#39;s a game upon a game but i actually don&#39;t believe for a minute they don&#39;t want us to know but a game upon</span>

I mean, massive in the historic sense in Manitoba. The process stories that came out instantly about that and how our friend Brian Topp was involved behind the scenes and all of that and how it works. People, there&#39;s a certain class of political observer who wants to read it like a sports match, right? They want to understand the conditioning that went into it, the strategy that went into it, the X&#39;s and O&#39;s of it all, right? Even though the majority of people who watch sports are just sort of watching it and getting wrapped up in the excitement there or capturing the thrust and the parry. And I think that people have sort of decided, and it&#39;s become normalized over the past many, many decades at this point, that we don&#39;t hold it against politicians that they calculate, unless</span>

So I don&#39;t feel that this falls into that category. And I actually think that&#39;s the opportunity for Pierre Poliev. And I think that&#39;s the trap for his opponents.

And I want to explore the cost of what the cost is of having senior staffers at senior levels of your government wanting to be humble candidates at some point. And you may even get where I&#39;m trying to go in some ways, Corey, but give me your take, because you might diverge with me a bit. So</span>

That was much more common in my view in the NDP and it was far, far less common with the liberals in my view. And I&#39;m sure people can find counterexamples all over the place. But generally speaking, if you wanted to have a liberal nomination be taken seriously, you wanted to go and do something. And maybe it was just, I say just, but maybe it was be a lawyer. Maybe it was be a business person. Maybe, maybe, maybe. But you&#39;d go do things and you&#39;d come back and you&#39;d get a liberal nomination.

Being a humble elected person, you&#39;re kind of seen as, oh, like, you know, the third-ranked PMO staffer, fifth-ranked PMO staffer ranks significantly higher than you, you know, so to speak, in the ecosystem. So the reason I phrase it that way was to try to get a reaction, but I don&#39;t come here with preconceived notions.

One of the reasons is because I don&#39;t want to be labeled with something that is so big in the eyes of the public, but that is so small to me, which would be you&#39;re a one-time political staffer, right? And I speak personally, because I know you guys, we&#39;ve had this conversation offline. But Corey, you think you can. You can wear the other parts of your resume or your three-dimensionality after you get labeled as a political staffer. Because Leslie Church, I don&#39;t even know what she did prior to this. She&#39;s had a whole life prior to 2015. I&#39;d even even bother looking at it. Because I&#39;m like, well, she&#39;s Krista Freeland&#39;s Chief of Staff. That&#39;s how she&#39;s ever going to be known. And I mean, that&#39;s no small role. She&#39;s Chief of Staff of the Deputy Prime Minister.

They&#39;d know that, of course they would, that this is a different type of job. But there&#39;s also that, fuck, I used to have this before, and while this might be a step up on the ladder to our earlier conversation, it&#39;s kind of not in some ways, depending on how you look at the gig and the power that you had.

And I don&#39;t want to take anything away from the Manitoba NDP, from Brian, from the whole entire team there, to Wab Canoe in particular. But what is the cost of winning? I actually, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever talked about this larger topic on the show. And I don&#39;t want to take 45 minutes because I&#39;m at 7% battery, which I&#39;ll have to rectify.

His star shines incredibly bright. Is there a cost there in the sense of, like, maybe being too high to deliver? Like, it was one of the Obama criticisms was, like, they were expecting the world, and they got a very pragmatic, iterative, thoughtful, but like, like, hey, I&#39;m just two links in a long multi-generational chain of presidents sort of person.

And that&#39;s because, you know, nothing in life is as good or as bad as you think it&#39;s going to be, including your politicians, except Donald Trump was as bad as we thought, but everybody else is not as good as you think it&#39;s going to be. And that&#39;s just the reality here. And so, you know, that&#39;s tough for some people to digest. And this is the—Wabkanu will never be as popular as he is right now.</span>

Wab&#39;s getting that type of attention, too, right? right? Do you dial that up in the moment? Because there&#39;s probably benefit around galvanizing staffers, galvanizing attention, drawing focus on your province, where you are, etc. You know, leaning into the history? Or do you kind of do the opposite and say, let&#39;s temper expectations? Let&#39;s not get way too high right now, because this will actually maybe not be so great for us a couple weeks, couple months, couple years down the road?</span>

And the governing&#39;s tough. Governing&#39;s tricky. And governing means making choices. And you disappoint people.
