Can we go straight to Ottawa? I think that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed, Corey. And let&#39;s start here as we talk about Ottawa. I want to talk about Justin Trudeau.</span>

            <span class="text">extending the news cycle, dragging in heels to the inevitable, which is something we have said about the Liberals increasingly more so in the last number of months. But is he just dragging his heels to the inevitable? Or is this the right move, the right strategy? Do you see it? And was it a good good one well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i think when you apologize as a general rule you you over apologize you don&#39;t try to find the line of exactly where apology is because the risk then becomes people insist you do it again and do it again and again until you get it right which is</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and the intervening time usually requires the apology to go even further so you&#39;re not trying to make good and get the apology that you needed yesterday you&#39;re trying to get the apology you needed a week from now which is probably even bigger because it includes the fact that you You didn&#39;t get the apology right the first time. So I think it was a mistake not to just say, I am sorry. I am sorry on behalf of this country. I am sorry on behalf of this parliament. I am sorry myself, you know, and actually sort of go down the list of the groups for which you&#39;re apologizing and say, this was just unacceptable on every level. And it was a failing, you know, you don&#39;t want to hedge this. So you don&#39;t want to do the thing where it&#39;s like, yeah, I mean, it was, we&#39;re in the situation because the speaker put you wouldn&#39;t want to do any of that you just say like it there&#39;s no excuse for glorifying and putting accolades on people who fought for adolf hitler regardless of the circumstances full stop you know that&#39;s what&#39;s expected of you that&#39;s what&#39;s required of you i do want to back up a few days though and say i knew you were going to do this here we go do it whole situation makes me feel fucking crazy like the like just crazy because and we talked about at this last part, we don&#39;t need to go over this, you know, song and verse again, but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like the The idea that we&#39;re supposed to believe that this nobody could have known and this is all on the speaker and that they get to put all the trash out with the speaker makes me crazy. It also makes me crazy that Pierre Poliev, who also clapped, can then turn around and say, shame on you, Justin Trudeau. How did you let this? How do you let this happen, Pierre? How did any of you let this happen?</span>

The new Speaker will be elected on Tuesday, that&#39;s what we suspect. Members will go into the House of Commons. Clinton&#39;s funny little rule about electing a speaker is you have to remove or withdraw yourself from the ballot by 6 p.m. tomorrow or else your name stays on the ballot to be speaker. Many folks have indicated they want to be speaker. Carter, talk to me broadly. I&#39;m going to drop our current sort of thread on do you get the strategy and do you like it? What should the liberal strategy be in electing a speaker here? Is it any more complicated than let&#39;s find a good liberal who wants to be speaker? Or talk to me about any nuance you&#39;d have, any thoughts you&#39;d have. Is there a strategy around this? And I&#39;m also going to go around the horn to see what the conservative strategy, perhaps even more importantly or interestingly, should be around the speaker elections here. So liberals first, then conservatives. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, you want an excellent parliamentarian. You want someone who actually understands the rules. I mean, obviously, the speaker is very well supported by bureaucrats. There are people who specialize in this type of understanding of governance and understanding of the precedent, and those staff will help carry you through it. But you do want an excellent parliamentarian, one who understands the rules kind of intuitively, that they can step into the role. And that dictates a certain type of experience, a certain type of person that is committed to understanding and learning and staying on top of those rules. You know, Andrew Scheer was a good person who understood those rules. What&#39;s his name in Alberta here? Nate, Nathan, Nate.</span>

Put his name forward, black man. Should we just head in that direction? Let&#39;s just all converge on that, because it&#39;s overdue from a, not a pure symbolism perspective, but from a broader sort of what this could mean.
