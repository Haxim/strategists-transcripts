        <div class="desc"><p>These kind of trips always take a little longer than you expect.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. The tour continues as Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter head to Ottawa, another part of Ottawa and then Washington DC in the continuation of their Cross Canada Checkdown. Did Trudeau fumble his apology for the Hunka affair? What are the strategic considerations of selecting a new speaker? And why won't Speaker Jeffries do anything about the federal government causing Alberta electricity problems in 2035? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

So I think it was a mistake not to just say, I am sorry. I am sorry on behalf of this country. I am sorry on behalf of this parliament. I am sorry myself, you know, and actually sort of go down the list of the groups for which you&#39;re apologizing and say, this was just unacceptable on every level.

So you don&#39;t want to do the thing where it&#39;s like, yeah, I mean, it was, we&#39;re in the situation because the speaker put you wouldn&#39;t want to do any of that you just say like it there&#39;s no excuse for glorifying and putting accolades on people who fought for adolf hitler regardless of the circumstances full stop you know that&#39;s what&#39;s expected of you that&#39;s what&#39;s required of you i do want to back up a few days though and say i knew you were going to do this here we go do it whole situation makes me feel fucking crazy like the like just crazy because and we talked about at this last part, we don&#39;t need to go over this, you know, song and verse again, but</div>

The new Speaker will be elected on Tuesday, that&#39;s what we suspect. Members will go into the House of Commons. Clinton&#39;s funny little rule about electing a speaker is you have to remove or withdraw yourself from the ballot by 6 p.m. tomorrow or else your name stays on the ballot to be speaker. Many folks have indicated they want to be speaker. Carter, talk to me broadly. I&#39;m going to drop our current sort of thread on do you get the strategy and do you like it? What should the liberal strategy be in electing a speaker here? Is it any more complicated than let&#39;s find a good liberal who wants to be speaker? Or talk to me about any nuance you&#39;d have, any thoughts you&#39;d have. Is there a strategy around this? And I&#39;m also going to go around the horn to see what the conservative strategy, perhaps even more importantly or interestingly, should be around the speaker elections here.

There are people who specialize in this type of understanding of governance and understanding of the precedent, and those staff will help carry you through it. But you do want an excellent parliamentarian, one who understands the rules kind of intuitively, that they can step into the role. And that dictates a certain type of experience, a certain type of person that is committed to understanding and learning and staying on top of those rules.
