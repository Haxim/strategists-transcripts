So Stephen Carter, let me start here. I&#39;ll let you guys go wherever you really want on this and we&#39;ll take the conversation. We&#39;ll kind of like move it on as it dries up. Find Fabulous or Fuck the budget for the liberals. As the last 48 hours have gone, you and I have talked historically on this podcast and in other places that the budget is a communications exercise. Find Fabulous or Fuck for the liberals, 48 hours into their budget.</span>

            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s fine. I think that people are, you know, not blown away by it. I think that That people are saying, you know, this is different than what we were expecting. But I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re seeing a massive uptick of anger. I don&#39;t think, you know, the $78 billion deficit. Corey and I have talked ad nauseum about how people don&#39;t care about deficit. They like to pretend that they care about deficits, but they really don&#39;t. As long as they&#39;re getting their stuff, they&#39;re happy. And right now, they&#39;re going to get more stuff. There&#39;s stuff coming down the pipe. And I like the shift from operating the capital. I think that that is a strong maneuver by Carney and Champagne. And I think that overall, people are going to be very happy with this budget. Even the opposition parties don&#39;t seem to want to make it go away. They just want to do the regular level of rabble-rousing without any real significance. I think it&#39;s an absolutely fine document.</span>

But we&#39;re not seeing a lot of the signals on, you know, EI reform and those kinds of things. But what you are seeing is sectoral supports to the economy. You are seeing, you know, obviously a major focus on infrastructure, defense, things that put people to work. You&#39;ve seen language in there around unionized labor. So if you&#39;re a building trades member today or yesterday, you&#39;re pretty happy with this document because the first time the government of Canada has really embedded that beyond some of the boutique ways that Christopher Freeland tried to.

I wanted to go five fabulous or fucked on floor crossings, but let me actually ask this question. Matt Gennaro, the conservative MP of Edmonton Riverbend, who was long rumored historically as one of those folks in the broader conservative movement that just doesn&#39;t belong there. This guy, you know, Pierre Palliev was not his cup of tea. Peter McKay was the guy he supported when O&#39;Toole ran. He&#39;s been a long time. He was prior to this, he was a progressive conservative MLA in Alberta. To the three of us, and to many listeners, probably well known, or known as a guy that has been around Alberta politics for a while. He&#39;s chosen, however, after saying yesterday that he was not going to cross the floor, to today, Shannon and Stephen, resign. He&#39;s</span>

Pierre Pallieva never had any of this kind of challenge coming to him for the last four years. They never had any of this pressure on their caucus. Nothing. Because the NDP allowed them to not have it. And so not only did everybody&#39;s house leaders have to do less work, But also caucus and leader had to do less work to keep each respective team together, in particular for the conservatives. So Pierre Polyevra&#39;s shitty tactics and his way of, you know, letting Jenny just bang on people and, you know, rig nominations and all the rest of the horse shittery that they got away with for the last four years being dicks to people because that&#39;s their modus operandi is being straight dicks all the time. they got away with it because the ndp let them the minute that don davies was like oh maybe i won&#39;t vote for it look at this two of them boom gone within 48 hours which</span>

And we know how omnipresent she is. So I would be shocked if there isn&#39;t a group of them, in which case you&#39;re doing it for maximum hurting of Polly Evra more so than the drama on the budget,</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, we could discuss this for hours. I want to, our format is broken down already. Any final thoughts of advice to any of the players or characters in this floor-crossing drama? The government, the next floor crossers, the conservatives, the new Democrats. Leave us with one final piece of advice. And Shannon, same to you in a second.</span>
