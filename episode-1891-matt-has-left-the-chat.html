So Stephen Carter, let me start here. I&#39;ll let you guys go wherever you really want on this and we&#39;ll take the conversation. We&#39;ll kind of like move it on as it dries up.

I don&#39;t think, you know, the $78 billion deficit. Corey and I have talked ad nauseum about how people don&#39;t care about deficit. They like to pretend that they care about deficits, but they really don&#39;t. As long as they&#39;re getting their stuff, they&#39;re happy. And right now, they&#39;re going to get more stuff. There&#39;s stuff coming down the pipe. And I like the shift from operating the capital. I think that that is a strong maneuver by Carney and Champagne. And I think that overall, people are going to be very happy with this budget. Even the opposition parties don&#39;t seem to want to make it go away. They just want to do the regular level of rabble-rousing without any real significance. I think it&#39;s an absolutely fine document.</div>

Matt Gennaro, the conservative MP of Edmonton Riverbend, who was long rumored historically as one of those folks in the broader conservative movement that just doesn&#39;t belong there.
