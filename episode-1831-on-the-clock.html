        <p>No one can stop a ticking clock. But the great ones always find a way to slow it down.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are on the clock. With twelve minutes for each segment, they need to tackle the BC election, the Trudeau revolt, US politics and a mystery bonus section that Zain will graciously let them choose. Is Harris' campaign dying a vibe-based death? Who will win the showdown at the Liberal caucus? And can we all agree we don't care about the Speaker in BC? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

But she seems to be stuck on a couple of things. Perhaps, Carter, we may look back on botching a question when she was asked around how her presidency is going to be different than Joe Biden&#39;s. She&#39;s tried to clean that up in the days after, but her answer during the moment was not much different, which is not a great answer. Many ways to answer that. That&#39;s how she chose to answer it. I&#39;m paraphrasing, of course. And then you have Donald Trump doing Donald Trump things and not necessarily being held accountable for them because they&#39;re so voluminous. They&#39;re so all over the place. And you, of course, have the added dynamic on the Kamala Harris side, Carter. I&#39;m just throwing just a few things on the list of the Michigan politics with the Arab Muslim population. We had another sort of chapter written today by kicking out some Palestinian Americans from a rally. Carter, this is even.</div>

So the vibes is for me, I think the most interesting story, because anything else is arguing about one point in polling, which is like nothing. It means nothing. There&#39;s no way you can say with accuracy that that one point is real or not when you&#39;re looking at the national polls. And the swing state polls in a lot of cases are not better. Like you look at it and it&#39;s like, oh, look at the average. North Carolina, less than one point lead for Harris. Georgia, Georgia, less than one point lead for Trump. Arizona, less than one point lead for Harris. They&#39;re so fucking close, I guess is my point. We can dissect it and we can pretend it&#39;s meaningful, but it&#39;s not.
