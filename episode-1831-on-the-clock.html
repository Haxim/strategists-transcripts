I don&#39;t want to live this again. We might all have to live this again. But it&#39;s just like the most tedious pain in the ass existence for political parties. So this is where I say deeply unstable, because it also gives this untested conservative caucus, this untested conservative party, it gives every fucking member a veto on the government existing.

You know, the challenges of, you know, how the speaker gets selected, how all these ins and outs and the workings of government, I think are going to be very tedious for British Columbians.

And you guys both last episode suggested that that would not be the case. You do anything like that on the back end of a meeting. So we know that. We also know that you&#39;ve also had an additional dynamic added, which is the alternatives have presented themselves, whether strategically or opportunistically.</span>

But she seems to be stuck on a couple of things. Perhaps, Carter, we may look back on botching a question when she was asked around how her presidency is going to be different than Joe Biden&#39;s. She&#39;s tried to clean that up in the days after, but her answer during the moment was not much different, which is not a great answer. Many ways to answer that. That&#39;s how she chose to answer it. I&#39;m paraphrasing, of course. And then you have Donald Trump doing Donald Trump things and not necessarily being held accountable for them because they&#39;re so voluminous. They&#39;re so all over the place. And you, of course, have the added dynamic on the Kamala Harris side, Carter. I&#39;m just throwing just a few things on the list of the Michigan politics with the Arab Muslim population.

            <span class="text">there is that lingering concern that Trump is going to outperform his polls because he did the last two elections, he was on the ticket, right? Right. So the vibes is for me, I think the most interesting story, because anything else is arguing about one point in polling, which is like nothing. It means nothing. There&#39;s no way you can say with accuracy that that one point is real or not when you&#39;re looking at the national polls. And the swing state polls in a lot of cases are not better. Like you look at it and it&#39;s like, oh, look at the average. North Carolina, less than one point lead for Harris. Georgia, Georgia, less than one point lead for Trump. Arizona, less than one point lead for Harris. They&#39;re so fucking close, I guess is my point. We can dissect it and we can pretend it&#39;s meaningful, but it&#39;s not.

I think a strong ground game, uh, in, in swing States and in swing, um, districts, uh, all of a a sudden can really change the outcome. We&#39;ve seen strong ground game here in Canada versus weak ground game. Now, we&#39;ve also seen what a tsunami looks like.

If Trump or Harris can take all of Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan, right, like Georgia, Arizona, if they can take all of them, for example, the vast majority of them kind of appears as an electoral college wave. So I&#39;m not trying to undercut your point, but I wanted to insert that, that this this does have like a one point tilt you know we&#39;re no longer talking about electoral votes</span>

Like, how much can the vaunted civic infrastructure stand up to a person like Donald Trump after he&#39;s had four years in the open to replace people who were not willing to play ball and who were willing to take seriously their oath to the Constitution with utter fucking stooges and hacks who are willing to do whatever they want? they think needs to be done in order to win this election what</span>
