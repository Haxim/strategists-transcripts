Because let&#39;s be clear, a fuck up in this situation is not necessarily Mark Carney, a trained corporate professional, a trained public intellectual, central banker saying the wrong thing. A fuck up in this situation is a wrong look, is a wrong smirk, is nodding your head at the wrong time. Because Trump would say something normal and then say something inane and then look over to Carney. And you&#39;ve got to be extremely careful in the moment that you&#39;re not nodding along while Donald Trump is saying Christopher Freeland fucking sucked at her job.</span>

            <span class="text">Or whatever, right? And there was a few moments, and one thing Carney does not have is a poker face. Like, we&#39;ve seen that throughout his, like, the last six months. Mark Carney does not have a poker face, but man, did he put one on today, and he was close to cracking a few times, and sometimes couldn&#39;t help himself, but none of it was penalty-worthy, none of it was disastrous enough, but the stakes were extremely high, and I think he did really well.

So, you know, I think that Mark Carney is in control of his own situations that may come off a little bit assholery uh when it comes to the actual uh communications with the media but i think it&#39;s really solid because um he&#39;s giving solid answers he&#39;s giving kind of yes no direct answers that are are hard to misinterpret and difficult to to take and and rebelize you know turn into a true north quote or something along there&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">What I feel is the policy. What&#39;s what I intellectualize is the outcome. We&#39;re also hearing about this as it relates to everything from his priority set, even including that press conference last week, talking to some high level liberals. Their answer was, yeah, thanks for the congrats, man. But that was just Mark Carney. Right. Like, thanks. But like he literally has an agenda of what he wants to do. He&#39;s telling you in his own words. And I feel like he treats the media in the same way. it&#39;s not over packaged it&#39;s not over rehearsed it&#39;s very much um kind of i&#39;m thinking in the moment because i care and it&#39;s you know carter like when you&#39;re free to kind of just respond and the stakes are relatively low it feels like that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing i think there is it could be a bit gaff prone when when like he&#39;s got a bit of a a bit of a track record and there&#39;s things in motion and timelines aren&#39;t being met and all that sort of stuff happens but for the moment it&#39;s not not only refreshing, it&#39;s novel. And I want to make sure we separate what&#39;s politically refreshing, but with what&#39;s also politically novel, because we&#39;ve had 10 years of Trudeau and we&#39;ve had a half a decade of Polyev, two very different communication styles from Carney. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">So you think it works in the presence of media? Yeah, I think</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">think it works for now. And I think ultimately what will end up happening, just like in politics, where your circle of trusted advisors starts big and then ends narrow, narrow you you start becoming more risk mitigating and you start becoming more defensive uh as your track record builds because you&#39;re trying to protect something behind you not just run free with what&#39;s ahead of you and he&#39;s got the flexibility to to say no to things to do one word answers to do all these novel communication things uh and lay out priorities but at some point they&#39;re going to be late on something they&#39;re going to poorly execute something it just happens it&#39;s not because mark carney&#39;s not good at what he does it&#39;s because it&#39;s government and it&#39;s a a slow moving machine, regardless of your ambitions as a prime minister, as a singular dude or person. And so I suspect a more defensive communication style that&#39;s going to come. But I think right now what we&#39;re seeing is the right strategy combined with novelty. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, do you think it works? Because that was interesting to me about today was so much focus, obviously, on the meeting with Trump, but then the speaking to the media after. And to Zane&#39;s point, it is new. It is novel. It&#39;s a very different way of interacting and speaking to media than we&#39;ve seen for the past decades.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I think yes and yes. I&#39;d be surprised if there was no prep on it. I think something like that starts with the seed of an answer. And, of course, there&#39;s multiple ways of doing it. You saw that in the press conference afterwards where he was at the Canadian embassy answering a similar question. He asserted that in a much more aggressive, assertive tone to create a secondary clip of it. But in the moment when you&#39;re sitting beside the president in and being hosted, he was also Canadian polite and he used something. And I think, you know, what really gave him the, um,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">um, the go ahead to keep going was that in, within the first second of saying it, Trump agreed. And, and you could almost see that Trump, like the respect kind of seemed real. I&#39;m really curious</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter. It seemed like it was almost like not even respect. It was like, I&#39;m kind of jealous of this guy. I don&#39;t want to disappoint this guy. Like Trump is a child, right? Yeah. And Mark Carney is like a serious person. Like he&#39;s actually what a successful business person looks like in some ways, right? Right. Trump is not like a real lucky loser. Trump is not a successful business person. He&#39;s not. You know, he was handed an opportunity and he squandered</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">squandered that opportunity. And everything else since then has been made out of fairy dust and the apprentice to create this image of Donald Trump is the short version of it. But there is a level of respect that Trump had to him where he agreed within the first couple of seconds, which allowed Carney to kind of very loosely kind of continue that analogy. I&#39;ve been in situations where, even if the politician is a masterful communicator, masterful communications and organic communications are two very different things, right? And this goes back to a world that Carter and I love deeply, which is the world of comedy. Most people come to watch a standup comedian perform their hour knowing fully that this hour has been performed at local theaters or comedy clubs near you, but they want to feel like they&#39;re hearing it from the first time stream of consciousness, like they just came up with it. In fact, the art form doesn&#39;t work. It doesn&#39;t feel natural. It doesn&#39;t feel connective. It doesn&#39;t feel like we&#39;re sharing a common experience if they don&#39;t have that underlying foundation of ease, of organic, of I just came up with this sort of thing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I think this press conference has that parallel. That line has that parallel, which is that everyone knows, ourselves included, that the team prepped a version for him. But what worked in that moment was two elements. Number one, he picked up on the real estate side. And you saw how assertively Carney was to get in on there. Because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Because I think he saw an opportunity to be like, I&#39;m going to make mention of it now. I&#39;m going to talk about 51st State over and over, but now&#39;s the time. You mentioned real estate. You mentioned the border. The team had probably also, Team Carney, probably also said every time Trump mentions the imaginary line, he goes right into this thing and that&#39;s where you get in. And so I do think this was rehearsed. I do think that was put together. But the execution on his part, the way he kind of spaced it, the way he looked up, the way he kept going once Trump said yes, the way he added examples, not just well scripted, well executed. So it&#39;s a very long way to say yes, which I believe is what this podcast is about, is saying very simple, short things in extremely long ways. Is that the message to take, Carter? I believe it is.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so. I mean, the body language for me was really all about the facial expressions. And Mark Carney, like I said, does not have a great poker face. You know, he really doesn&#39;t. So even when Trump was talking about all the gold that now the Oval Office has, as Carney was like near laughter, which made me laugh because I was like, that is so fucking crazy. Trump is like, welcome to the Oval Office. We&#39;ve now got gold. And Carney&#39;s like, uh-huh. And he&#39;s just like trying not to laugh. I heard from someone who was inside the room that the Canadian delegation was like stone cold the whole time. And I feel like they were all trained to like be stone cold the entire time, including Carney. But I think his body language is fine. His cadence was fine. His tone was fine. Um, he was very much in the reaction mode, right? He had a couple of things to say. He picked his spots. He hits solid signals. I think on the, on the, um, the real estate line, he, he hit the home run on that one. Um, but everything else was body language. How do you sit there for a seven minute monologue about 10 topics of</span>

Alberta, I, you know, it polls somewhere around 20%, which is, but I think that that&#39;s people who just are angry saying these things who haven&#39;t really thought through separation.

            <span class="text">tacit consent. If I&#39;m being charitable, which I am. But we&#39;ve seen this across the world. Trump is an example of this. Trump re-election is an example of this. All the crazy stuff right now that we are seeing, no one really voted for. but it was a price of eggs and and and future opportunity dialing down something crazy in the crazy package and selling a small simple version of it or a small simple subset of it same with like when india demonetized their money do you guys remember this they literally position as as government corruption as fighting back against black money and they just you know invalidated currency notes for people. And we see this in governance. We see this in elections. And we&#39;ve seen it very recently. People will buy a broader crazy package, a broader package of things that they do not like if it includes one thing that they really do like. And my worry is that the separatists find that one thing. And my worry is that the opposition is saying all of the reasons against it versus fighting it on that one thing. The separatism fight in Alberta, should it happen, may be on something entirely unrelated or directly not related to separatism. That is my prediction. It will be a ballot box question about it, but it will be a debate about something like healthcare. It will be a debate about something like economic upside for youth or economic diversification. They&#39;ll find a 70-30 issue to fight the 30-70 issue, which is separatism. That is how they They will sell this thing. And that is why Daniel Smith, am I wrong, Carter? That is why Daniel Smith has proposed something as crazy because there is a pathway for this. And she may have actually overplayed her hand in this regard in terms of potentially being a co-author of this outcome.</span>

Actually, you&#39;re not conservatism. And define yourself as Pierre Poliev as what you consider to be a more moderate approach. Look how moderate Jason Kenney is looking to us right now. Right? Seriously though. Jason Kenney was the most right-wing thing that happened to our province in, was it 2018? 2019? Holy George</span>

Pierre Palliev has the opportunity to take a clear unifying stance against separatism, address the grievances of Albertans, but also know that, what, fuck you. If you give me 10 less points next election, I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m taking a stance around what conservatism is. And frankly, he could be one of those leaders in</span>

And in fact, you will be rewarded if you cool down these separatist sentiments or quash them. To me, despite</span>
