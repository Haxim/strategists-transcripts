            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, you&#39;re welcome, Carter. Corey, we&#39;ve got a lot to talk about. You know, Canada&#39;s on pace to perhaps quadruple the number of COVID cases we have. This is a scary situation. And we&#39;ve been talking about COVID as, of course, is part of our politics and policy and kind of life that we&#39;ve been putting out every single week on our episode. But I want to spend the entirety of today&#39;s episode on this. And I will start with the inside out, so to speak. Talk about our home province as move out to the federal side of things. And I mean, there is no, I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I think, more obvious and specific way to kind of start than to talk about where Jason Kenney is, because that is starting to become the storyline here in Alberta. There are storylines about COVID, don&#39;t get me wrong. We don&#39;t have a province-wide mask mandate. We have record number of cases here. Kenney&#39;s approval has gone from 68% in March on his handling of COVID down to 37%. We&#39;re seeing no real decisive action in parallel with our other provincial counterparts. But maybe let&#39;s start with the question that I asked the front, which is, where is Jason Kenney? It&#39;s been nine days since we&#39;ve seen him. This is a moment of leadership, regardless of who you voted for, that you expect your premier to be out there. And what maybe compounds that and what surprises me is that we often talk about it. And one of the most, you know, primal insights of politics is that you don&#39;t let any crisis go to waste. And you kind of, you know, have leaders that are made in crisis moments, yet we haven&#39;t seen our premier. So So I want to start with the specific of that as to what you think might be happening, a little bit of reckless speculation, and then let&#39;s kind of broaden that point around what leadership looks like or perhaps doesn&#39;t look like in a time of crisis.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well, listen, there&#39;s a lot of reasons why somebody could not show up for a bit in politics here, and I&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not saying any of these are the reasons why Jason Kenney&#39;s not around right now, but let&#39;s start with Occam&#39;s razor. or let&#39;s start with the most obvious if you if you&#39;re going out to talk to people it&#39;s because it&#39;s a big deal and if it&#39;s a big deal what the fuck are you doing and if the answer is nothing what the fuck are you doing right so uh it&#39;s quite possible that it&#39;s as simple as that it&#39;s why in the world would i stand up and announce nothing next to dina hinshaw as we have the the largest covet numbers not just that alberta&#39;s ever had but now the largest in the country where we have more cases of covet today as we&#39;re recording 1538 than they do in ontario than they do in in quebec that like that&#39;s not adjusted for population that&#39;s just the largest number raw number yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">raw numbers so it&#39;s it&#39;s quite possible it&#39;s as simple as that the next reason you might not want to go up there is um plausible deniability so if you are actually planning something big if you are planning to have a dramatic lockdown and you know this on tuesday but you&#39;re not doing it until sunday or monday you&#39;re probably going to avoid the media in between because there is no more dangerous a situation in communications this is not just a political rule is a communications rule when you know things that you are not allowed to say when there&#39;s kind of this this additional information that you cannot share with the world because you may slip that out and uh and then all of your planning is done so better to send other people out better to have people who don&#39;t actually know what the plan is go and say i don&#39;t know because because they don&#39;t know, and they can&#39;t accidentally release that plan.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And the third one is, you know, just maybe you don&#39;t want to deal with it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Is this troubling times for everybody? I think people forget that premiers are people too, and people sometimes avoid difficult situations. Sometimes it&#39;s as simple as that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, what do you think of kind of Corey&#39;s lay of the land, the three scenarios that he put out there? Do you want to respond to them? I&#39;d be curious to get your response to them more specifically. And is there anything else you want to add considering your time in political office and seeing how political leaders and, frankly, leaders react to scenarios?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">me offer a fourth, and the fourth goes something along the following. Jason Kenney has deeply held ideological beliefs. He believes strongly in less government. He believes strongly that in the power of the individual, that individual responsibility is a cornerstone for our society, society in general. This</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">This is who he is at his core. And this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this is not the time for that. This is not the time when that is actually working. So maybe Jason Kenney is just literally trying to wrap his head around something that&#39;s not just a new idea, but something that is shaking his ideological core. Something that&#39;s shaking him to the center of who he has defined himself for the last 50 plus years. I mean, this is who he is. This is how he was raised. This is what he believes strongly. And now he&#39;s finally in a position where he can do something and have a government that reflects his individualism, his rugged self-determination, his everybody can lift themselves up by their own bootstraps type of mentality. And it is failing. It is failing him at his at his greatest hour of need, because he honestly said when he when he started off by saying to Albertans, I trust you exercise personal responsibility. I don&#39;t have to knock you down. I trust who you are. He actually believed that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And it takes a little bit of time to come around to bringing in a new policy that contradicts that which who you are at your core. so that&#39;s that&#39;s a fourth one and i think that you know there&#39;s probably</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i can see that one being interlaced with a couple of of cory&#39;s other uh ideas but for me this is something that has shaken the man to his core otherwise we would have seen him i mean i get the whole you can&#39;t you know on tuesday you decide you&#39;re going to lock down next monday i get that that makes sense to me but this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this isn&#39;t a nine-day decision-making cycle that says we&#39;re not going to lock down tomorrow if we hadn&#39;t seen him today and they locked down tomorrow but we&#39;d seen him on friday then i could say you know i can make that case but this is a this is a much shorter window this is um this is holy shit we went over a thousand cases locked the down lock it down this is what we really have been asking for from the beginning is tell me what the rules are tell me what the you know when x happens y will happen you know if we get over a thousand cases a day in alberta we will lock down okay then everybody knows we got to pull back we got to make sure we haven&#39;t had any of that so i&#39;m not sure this is a case of he has a plan that he&#39;s just afraid to accidentally let slip i think that he</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">he is more likely in his uh in cory&#39;s first or third scenarios uh with maybe a health healthy dose of uh i don&#39;t want to do this this is against who i am uh layered in there there just to add some flavor.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I want to pick up on two things. You know, there is two items that Carter mentioned here that I think are important, only two in that nine-minute monologue. Number one was,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Kenny has not telegraphed any sort of metric or bar to say that we&#39;re going to act at a certain point, right? So when we communally or collectively, personal responsibility does not work, at a certain point, a communal trigger or restriction a regulation will happen. So that&#39;s point number one. The point number two is the broader point Carter brought up, and I want to get your take. Do you feel like, you know, in the specific of this particular premier, but also in the more general, that this reconciliation of where one&#39;s ideological compass is, and then seeing it not bear out, you know, is perhaps what might be happening? And maybe I&#39;ll add a layer to it, because what confuses me is that, you know, as we&#39;ve discussed many times on this show, regardless</span>

And so for him to not act, for him to know that these poll numbers are going down, that these case numbers are going up, it almost seems out of step and out of character from what he&#39;s seen. So I just want to get you to react to anything</span>

These are important jobs, and you get exposed to an awful lot of information that you cannot blurt out your mouth. So that compartmentalization is an important part of the job. The other point is exactly what you said, Zane. There hasn&#39;t really been conditioning on this point. If you knew on Tuesday you were, say, locking down on Monday, which may still happen. It may just be that people feel backed into it, or maybe there&#39;s internal triggers on it, but they&#39;re hoping that they will not be hit, and they don&#39;t want to have to walk it back. But you would expect a certain amount of conditioning.</span>

And so it&#39;s not so much that you are trying to avoid the microphone because you might say something like it&#39;s an accident. You may not know yet. You might be trying to settle these pieces behind the scenes. You might be hoping this thing resolves itself one way or the other, and then you don&#39;t have that problem.

Having been political staffers, campaign managers, etc., having dealt with leaders who perhaps, you know, haven&#39;t made decisions or refuse to make decisions or refuse to kind of accept that they need to be present, their voice is important and needs to be heard, that they&#39;re the ones that need to steward a particular message. Carter, and what has been your experience with elected officials or those running for office around kind of their refusal to take a stand? And do you feel like, I guess what&#39;s embedded in my question is, do you feel like there&#39;s people around the premier kind of looking and tracking day to day as we&#39;re seeing the poll numbers go down, the calls for him to show up, go up, the case numbers go up saying, Mr. Premier, you need to show up? What do you kind of think might be happening with the internal machinery right now? And maybe if you&#39;ve had any insight with dealing with leaders in a similar situation?</span>

I mean, it&#39;s no secret that Alison Redwood would struggle with certain pieces of being the premier and wouldn&#39;t necessarily want to tackle difficult issues head on. I think that&#39;s a natural part of the job. It is really hard sometimes to put yourself out there when you don&#39;t have a particularly good solution.

Let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s talk about that vacuum, because I&#39;m glad you brought this up. That vacuum is starting to be filled with misinformation, yes, but also some of, you know, the deputies within the UCP government, right? Just today, we had UCP Associate Minister Jason LeJuan talk about how, you know, we We are going to act once we kind of see the stress test on hospitals and ICUs. We&#39;ve also seen, you know, in certain cases, the health minister step up, but none of them being the premier in certain cases. So I want to talk about that vacuum a bit. But Carter, I also want to put a clarifying point on something, which is him showing up, the premier, showing up is one thing, but inaction is another, right? Like him showing up and doing the things Corey&#39;s foresees there, which I loved, you know, is one part of the job. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an excuse for the inaction we&#39;ve also seen, right? There&#39;s almost two things that have kind of come together. Him talking you through what his strategy is one thing, him disappearing and also not having strategies is two separate things. So I want to kind of get your take on why haven&#39;t we seen the action, right? Right. So let&#39;s put aside the fact that the premier isn&#39;t here. Where do you think the fact is that we haven&#39;t, you know, done the province wide mask mandate? We haven&#39;t actually increased the regulations. Do you feel like it goes back to a personal sort of belief to your point? Or do you think there&#39;s something more at play? You know, we&#39;ve heard some of the speculative reasons that there&#39;s, you know, the rural caucus can&#39;t can&#39;t go along to get along because the case counts there are lower. That ideology is part of it. You know, where do you kind of draw the line on where the inaction might be coming from, regardless of the presence of the premier? premier?</span>

You know, tell me why. Why would a premier in this situation not act? Why would he not do a mandatory mask mandate? Now, that&#39;s the simplest thing. I think we&#39;re well past a mandatory mask mandate. I think that that was a three week ago solution. And I think that when you go over 1500 cases in a day, I suspect that we&#39;re looking at something a lot stronger um i don&#39;t know why he hasn&#39;t acted i don&#39;t know why this hasn&#39;t been his predominant piece one of the things that i also don&#39;t know and going back to your uh</span>

I think it&#39;s fair to say that we&#39;ve all heard rumors of certain sort of measures that might be taken. But, Corey, I want to go to Carter&#39;s point here. You know, let&#39;s put on the strategist&#39;s hat. You know this premier has to take some action. What are you advising him in terms of his public appearance going forward? The public is lacking context, lacking signals, perhaps not understanding the inaction of the past two weeks at least, not understanding the directionality that this government may take. What does his next public appearance need to look like? And I&#39;m not saying park ideology, but maybe incorporate his ideology as part of it, but maybe with the tools of, like, you know, comms that he needs to ensure his message lands with the vacuum that he&#39;s left.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it really depends on what they decide to do, if anything, because the first thing you might need is an excuse. If there is a lockdown tomorrow, where the hell has he been will be a pretty obvious question, right? Why are we just hearing from you now? Why weren&#39;t we given any kind of fore-notice that this may happen? And he&#39;s going to have to say something like, well, look, I&#39;ve been working out behind the scenes. We were watching the numbers closely, obviously.</span>

He&#39;s invested $30 million a year in the Canadian Energy Centre in order to give us back our economic engine. He&#39;s told us what he&#39;s going to do. He&#39;s told us why he&#39;s doing it. And he&#39;s told us how it&#39;s going to impact us. That has happened in any issue that he cares about, any issue that he cares about. Even the parks issue, which arguably has been a train wreck for him. They&#39;ve done town halls. They&#39;re countering it.

But before we even leak it, what we&#39;re going to do is we&#39;re going to be starting to set the table for why a reset is so important and how we can keep the economy going. So I&#39;m going to have Andrew Leach on my side. I&#39;m going to have all, you know, I&#39;m going to get all the economists to tell us why or how we can keep the economy moving through Christmas, which is one of the most important retail cycles, period, right? We have to keep the retailers open and whole. So here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to do that.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

And we&#39;re going to start talking about that again, three or four days before we&#39;re going to do it, or if we&#39;re going to do it really quick, we&#39;re going to start talking about it two days before we do it so</span>

And when we start to see our hospitalization decrease and our infection numbers decrease, When they reach this level, we can reopen. And I have to set all of that up in advance so that people know exactly what&#39;s going to happen to avoid panic.

            <span class="text">yeah. So, Carter, I think that was incredibly articulate. Doing the what without the why can, you know, sow this sort of panic and further enhance the chaos. You know, so where there was a vacuum of information prior to, there perhaps is an overwhelming of information and more speculation as to the why. Corey, do you agree with that? And is that similar advice that you would give on a practical front? They call you right now, you know, we&#39;re at like nine o&#39;clock when we&#39;re recording this podcast saying, hey, Corey, we think about tomorrow morning. What do you think?

But I&#39;m, I&#39;m somewhat skeptical, because we&#39;re looking at all of, I guess, let&#39;s, let me tell you this way, we&#39;re looking at this and saying, well, they&#39;ve really blown it, if they do this, because they haven&#39;t done this conditioning. But that makes me think maybe, maybe they&#39;re not going to do it. The other group that they need to think about conditioning is their base. You know, for many months, they&#39;ve been saying this is unnecessary. This is too much pain. You know, this is a we&#39;ve got to sort of ride this out reasonably. We can&#39;t destroy the economy. Because this only kills people with comorbidities over the age of X, right?</span>

Generally speaking, we have a tendency to blame the person before us. Right. The premier who&#39;s in charge. It was not rational to blame Rachel Notley for the economic downturn of 2014 after she was elected in 2015. It did not matter what was rational. Right. Right. It was in front of us and it was that emotional soup that mixed around us and that economic uncertainty that we pinned upon her.</span>

Number one, react to what you heard from Carter around this emotional soup concept and then like pivoting on blame.

So I&#39;m actually totally happy. I hope people have not dropped off. But let&#39;s talk about the federal scene, because I think it&#39;s also very interesting what we saw from Trudeau this past week. Using the bully pulpit, right? Telling Canadians, to Stephen&#39;s point, that Christmas will be different this year, right? That we have passed that window of Christmas normalcy. Now, different provinces trying different things around Christmas. Quebec most, I guess, notably having their quarantine pre and post to be able to attend Christmas time with family. family. I guess the question I have, Carter, for you is twofold on the federal side of things. Number one, what did you make of the Trudeau use of the bully pulpit? And number two, do you feel like the blame that we&#39;ve been talking about might rest at his feet right now for what we might be seeing across the country? I&#39;ve skipped over all the other provinces. They&#39;ve got, you know, their cocktail of restrictions, regulations, you know, BC installing their mandatory mask mandate and having a more targeted shutdown. Ontario, as of tomorrow, going for 28 days, and then all in between for the other provinces. But what do you kind of make of Trudeau&#39;s use of the bully pulpit? And secondly, what do you kind of think of the political price he might be paying with the second wave emerging?</span>

But at the end of the day, the thing that he&#39;s doing beyond the legislative stuff is just sort of being there for us, which is more than, you know, some some premiers have been. So it&#39;s a weird one. Right. It feels very touchy feely. It feels very like getting on the couch, but that&#39;s an important role for leaders. Leaders need to be there and be accessible and look human about this. This is an emotional issue. People are losing their livelihoods. People are losing their lives. And we want to know that our leaders give a damn. And Justin Trudeau is now turned to being give a damn in chief again with his press conferences outside of Rodeo Cottage. And that&#39;s great.

You know, certainly, it seems like from our sense of the polling and our sense of just anecdotal experience, that there isn&#39;t an outrage, even in Alberta, Justin Trudeau is polling higher on his COVID response than Jason Kenney is. But one person that&#39;s trying to make hay with it is Aaron O&#39;Toole, leader of the Conservatives. Just today, he put out this graphic that said Trudeau has had 11 months to manage the a pandemic, but Canadians are worse off than in the spring, and then an image of a woman in a mask. Do you feel like strategically, A, that attack is strategically sound, part A to that question? And B, do you feel like there&#39;s perhaps some danger for the O&#39;Toole side, for the O&#39;Toole camp to try to make hay of something that I think Canadians understand, at least a large There are swaths of Canadians understand that the prime minister is trying to do what he can with the cards that have been dealt to him and every other leader across the globe. So I&#39;ll go to you first on this, Carter. Corey, I want to get your reaction thereafter.</span>

I think I might have done something along the lines of we have the greatest deficit and we have the greatest spending and the least to show for it. Right. You certainly aren&#39;t feeling like you&#39;re safe. You&#39;re certainly not feeling like your economic future isn&#39;t in some fashion safe or secure. So what the hell? All we&#39;ve done is spent all the money and have nothing to show for it, which is the typical liberal move. The typical liberal is there to spend as much as he possibly can and to get as little as he possibly can. And so Justin Trudeau is following the mold.</span>

            <span class="text">As far as being critical of the Prime Minister, I think there&#39;s ways to do that. And I think that there are conservative ways to do that. Let&#39;s be clear, there are certain lines of attack that are not really open to O&#39;Toole. One of them is the Premier should be getting more involved in provincial health matters. He wouldn&#39;t put it that way. But you You could imagine it being like, oh, he just wants the premiers to do his dirty work. He has the tools. He needs to take a stand with the federal government&#39;s</span>

But there are lines of attack that are available to him, and they are along what Stephen was talking about. So obviously the economy, obviously the budget. We need to spend what&#39;s necessary, but we need to do more than spend. You can&#39;t fix this merely by putting it on Canada&#39;s credit card. It takes some thought, some strategy, and I&#39;m not seeing that from this prime minister. he&#39;s literally opened up his wallet and he&#39;s let every liberal interest come by and pull out a little bit of money right like there is a conservative critique that is available uh perhaps even one that implies uh graft or corruption but um yeah like this notion that he just hasn&#39;t done enough is it just sort of or like things haven&#39;t gotten better</span>

            <span class="text">carter there&#39;s one final thing i want to talk about on the federal side which is is what&#39;s been not dominating the conversation, but it&#39;s been increasingly getting louder and louder as part of what Trudeau has been talking about on the federal side of things, which is</span>

            <span class="text">the vaccine that is perhaps coming in 2021, what that looks like. And I know that we haven&#39;t really snapped into focus what this looks like. Will it be Moderna? Will it be Pfizer? What will it be? I know last episode, we talked about, you know, the Prime Minister giving him credit for securing and hedging our bets and having the highest per capita vaccine acquisition. But I want to talk about just very quickly here, as we start this conversation, certainly not end it on this episode, which is communications about the vaccine. You know, in a recent press conference this week, Trudeau said it&#39;d be a big sigh of relief when the vaccines this spring will come out. And I also wanted to just, with that line, talk to you guys about your initial thoughts of what advice would you give the prime minister, knowing that, A, we&#39;re still speaking in abstractions, B, that there&#39;s an expectation setting here that they&#39;re going to need to be really careful of, right? These vaccines might land, but the distribution and the logistics are a massive executional operation that is, you know, just fraught with uncertainty. So from a political standpoint, how are you going to, what are some of the lessons and principles you&#39;re thinking of of injecting into the PM&#39;s, you know, conversations right now, so that there&#39;s an expectation setting for the public so that when they, you know, when the vaccine is at the end of 2021 for them, or maybe 2022, that they receive it like that, that he&#39;s not there to kind of have the political blame as we&#39;ve been talking about as squarely at his feet. I know that&#39;s a very long question, one that we can&#39;t necessarily answer in specificity, but abstraction, but some first principles of what What you would be telling him right now when he addresses vaccines and their upcoming, you know, landing in Canada, so to speak? Carter, you first. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that the first step is that let&#39;s not confuse our distribution models with those of the United States. We have a far more robust distribution of, you know, vaccinations than they do in the U.S. because we have, for example, we&#39;ve implemented province-wide or really society-wide influenza vaccinations for years. We started doing the chickenpox vaccination years and years ago. We&#39;ve got vaccinations for our children.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Our vaccination systems are actually relatively robust, and they start with our health care system, right? What I&#39;d be talking about is setting people up for the waves waves, because what the prime minister is doing by talking about a single vaccination that&#39;s going to start to arrive in the spring, first of all, I don&#39;t know what the spring means. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s March or if that&#39;s May. This is Canada. What is the spring? And secondly, it&#39;s not going to come in one wave. It&#39;s going to come in a series of waves. And the people who are first going to get that first wave judging from the numbers of vaccinations that are coming we will have more vaccinations for COVID-19 than we traditionally give in Alberta for the influenza vaccination so if that&#39;s the case then we&#39;re going to have a fairly robust initial wave of vaccination but if it&#39;s not the case say that only one of those two vaccinations is able to actually deliver significant numbers to and it&#39;s halved or maybe it&#39;s quartered then we better be starting to set up with the people who are going to get the vaccinations first are the ones who need it most we&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">going to get those vaccinations and then i would start defining what the hell does it mean to be a frontline provider now part of the problem is he&#39;s not necessarily going to be able to define each of those he&#39;s handing it off to the provinces and each province is going to go step-by-step to define what each of those waves looks like. I&#39;d probably just start saying the first wave of vaccinations will be available in the first or second quarter of 2021. I&#39;d make it a lot more vague. He&#39;s making it a lot more specific. And I think that specificity is going to come back and bite him in the ass.</span>

Like we spend a lot of money on vaccinations to protect our health. This vaccination is going to come, and it&#39;s going to be super important. We need to get in line when it&#39;s our turn to get in line, and this is the opportunity to stop this. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t even think a lockdown is going to stop this.

And the time before that, he, you know, he was there and he was doing nice moves, but, you know, recency bias, right? And those first 30 days seem pretty remote at this point. I will say this, though. I do believe that he&#39;s made the moves behind the scenes that have allowed him to move forward more aggressively once people start paying attention to the Conservative Party again. People discount him at their peril. I think he&#39;s a serious man with very strong political chops, and we&#39;re going to see that coming forward. forward. People look at the polls, they laugh about the polls. Those polls are a reaction to the US political moment. We are going to have our own political moment at some point.
