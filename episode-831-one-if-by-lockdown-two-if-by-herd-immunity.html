            <div class="said">Oh, you&#39;re welcome, Carter. Corey, we&#39;ve got a lot to talk about. You know, Canada&#39;s on pace to perhaps quadruple the number of COVID cases we have. This is a scary situation. And we&#39;ve been talking about COVID as, of course, is part of our politics and policy and kind of life that we&#39;ve been putting out every single week on our episode. But I want to spend the entirety of today&#39;s episode on this. And I will start with the inside out, so to speak. Talk about our home province as move out to the federal side of things. And I mean, there is no, I</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">I think, more obvious and specific way to kind of start than to talk about where Jason Kenney is, because that is starting to become the storyline here in Alberta. There are storylines about COVID, don&#39;t get me wrong. We don&#39;t have a province-wide mask mandate. We have record number of cases here. Kenney&#39;s approval has gone from 68% in March on his handling of COVID down to 37%. We&#39;re seeing no real decisive action in parallel with our other provincial counterparts. But maybe let&#39;s start with the question that I asked the front, which is, where is Jason Kenney? It&#39;s been nine days since we&#39;ve seen him. This is a moment of leadership, regardless of who you voted for, that you expect your premier to be out there. And what maybe compounds that and what surprises me is that we often talk about it. And one of the most, you know, primal insights of politics is that you don&#39;t let any crisis go to waste. And you kind of, you know, have leaders that are made in crisis moments, yet we haven&#39;t seen our premier. So So I want to start with the specific of that as to what you think might be happening, a little bit of reckless speculation, and then let&#39;s kind of broaden that point around what leadership looks like or perhaps doesn&#39;t look like in a time of crisis.</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;m not saying any of these are the reasons why Jason Kenney&#39;s not around right now, but let&#39;s start with Occam&#39;s razor. or let&#39;s start with the most obvious if you if you&#39;re going out to talk to people it&#39;s because it&#39;s a big deal and if it&#39;s a big deal what the fuck are you doing and if the answer is nothing what the fuck are you doing right so uh it&#39;s quite possible that it&#39;s as simple as that it&#39;s why in the world would i stand up and announce nothing next to dina hinshaw as we have the the largest covet numbers not just that alberta&#39;s ever had but now the largest in the country where we have more cases of covet today as we&#39;re recording 1538 than they do in ontario than they do in in quebec that like that&#39;s not adjusted for population that&#39;s just the largest number raw number yeah</div>

            <div class="said">me offer a fourth, and the fourth goes something along the following. Jason Kenney has deeply held ideological beliefs. He believes strongly in less government. He believes strongly that in the power of the individual, that individual responsibility is a cornerstone for our society, society in general. This</div>

            <div class="said">this is not the time for that. This is not the time when that is actually working. So maybe Jason Kenney is just literally trying to wrap his head around something that&#39;s not just a new idea, but something that is shaking his ideological core. Something that&#39;s shaking him to the center of who he has defined himself for the last 50 plus years. I mean, this is who he is. This is how he was raised. This is what he believes strongly. And now he&#39;s finally in a position where he can do something and have a government that reflects his individualism, his rugged self-determination, his everybody can lift themselves up by their own bootstraps type of mentality. And it is failing. It is failing him at his at his greatest hour of need, because he honestly said when he when he started off by saying to Albertans, I trust you exercise personal responsibility. I don&#39;t have to knock you down. I trust who you are. He actually believed that.</div>

            <div class="said">Kenny has not telegraphed any sort of metric or bar to say that we&#39;re going to act at a certain point, right? So when we communally or collectively, personal responsibility does not work, at a certain point, a communal trigger or restriction a regulation will happen. So that&#39;s point number one. The point number two is the broader point Carter brought up, and I want to get your take. Do you feel like, you know, in the specific of this particular premier, but also in the more general, that this reconciliation of where one&#39;s ideological compass is, and then seeing it not bear out, you know, is perhaps what might be happening? And maybe I&#39;ll add a layer to it, because what confuses me is that, you know, as we&#39;ve discussed many times on this show, regardless</div>

            <div class="said">uh that he would be having something and not wanting to risk saying it for starters you would expect him to be able to deal with those things i can tell you premiers keep secrets they have to some of them are um of a political nature but many more or of a policy nature, or you name it. These are important jobs, and you get exposed to an awful lot of information that you cannot blurt out your mouth. So that compartmentalization is an important part of the job. The other point is exactly what you said, Zane. There hasn&#39;t really been conditioning on this point. If you knew on Tuesday you were, say, locking down on Monday, which may still happen. It may just be that people feel backed into it, or maybe there&#39;s internal triggers on it, but they&#39;re hoping that they will not be hit, and they don&#39;t want to have to walk it back.

Having been political staffers, campaign managers, etc., having dealt with leaders who perhaps, you know, haven&#39;t made decisions or refuse to make decisions or refuse to kind of accept that they need to be present, their voice is important and needs to be heard, that they&#39;re the ones that need to steward a particular message. Carter, and what has been your experience with elected officials or those running for office around kind of their refusal to take a stand? And do you feel like, I guess what&#39;s embedded in my question is, do you feel like there&#39;s people around the premier kind of looking and tracking day to day as we&#39;re seeing the poll numbers go down, the calls for him to show up, go up, the case numbers go up saying, Mr. Premier, you need to show up?

            <div class="said">Let&#39;s talk about that vacuum, because I&#39;m glad you brought this up. That vacuum is starting to be filled with misinformation, yes, but also some of, you know, the deputies within the UCP government, right? Just today, we had UCP Associate Minister Jason LeJuan talk about how, you know, we We are going to act once we kind of see the stress test on hospitals and ICUs. We&#39;ve also seen, you know, in certain cases, the health minister step up, but none of them being the premier in certain cases. So I want to talk about that vacuum a bit. But Carter, I also want to put a clarifying point on something, which is him showing up, the premier, showing up is one thing, but inaction is another, right? Like him showing up and doing the things Corey&#39;s foresees there, which I loved, you know, is one part of the job. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an excuse for the inaction we&#39;ve also seen, right? There&#39;s almost two things that have kind of come together. Him talking you through what his strategy is one thing, him disappearing and also not having strategies is two separate things. So I want to kind of get your take on why haven&#39;t we seen the action, right? Right. So let&#39;s put aside the fact that the premier isn&#39;t here. Where do you think the fact is that we haven&#39;t, you know, done the province wide mask mandate? We haven&#39;t actually increased the regulations. Do you feel like it goes back to a personal sort of belief to your point? Or do you think there&#39;s something more at play? You know, we&#39;ve heard some of the speculative reasons that there&#39;s, you know, the rural caucus can&#39;t can&#39;t go along to get along because the case counts there are lower. That ideology is part of it. You know, where do you kind of draw the line on where the inaction might be coming from, regardless of the presence of the premier? premier?</div>

You know, let&#39;s put on the strategist&#39;s hat. You know this premier has to take some action. What are you advising him in terms of his public appearance going forward? The public is lacking context, lacking signals, perhaps not understanding the inaction of the past two weeks at least, not understanding the directionality that this government may take. What does his next public appearance need to look like? And I&#39;m not saying park ideology, but maybe incorporate his ideology as part of it, but maybe with the tools of, like, you know, comms that he needs to ensure his message lands with the vacuum that he&#39;s left.</div>

But I&#39;m, I&#39;m somewhat skeptical, because we&#39;re looking at all of, I guess, let&#39;s, let me tell you this way, we&#39;re looking at this and saying, well, they&#39;ve really blown it, if they do this, because they haven&#39;t done this conditioning. But that makes me think maybe, maybe they&#39;re not going to do it. The other group that they need to think about conditioning is their base. You know, for many months, they&#39;ve been saying this is unnecessary. This is too much pain. You know, this is a we&#39;ve got to sort of ride this out reasonably. We can&#39;t destroy the economy.

But let&#39;s talk about the federal scene, because I think it&#39;s also very interesting what we saw from Trudeau this past week. Using the bully pulpit, right? Telling Canadians, to Stephen&#39;s point, that Christmas will be different this year, right? That we have passed that window of Christmas normalcy. Now, different provinces trying different things around Christmas. Quebec most, I guess, notably having their quarantine pre and post to be able to attend Christmas time with family. family. I guess the question I have, Carter, for you is twofold on the federal side of things. Number one, what did you make of the Trudeau use of the bully pulpit? And number two, do you feel like the blame that we&#39;ve been talking about might rest at his feet right now for what we might be seeing across the country? I&#39;ve skipped over all the other provinces. They&#39;ve got, you know, their cocktail of restrictions, regulations, you know, BC installing their mandatory mask mandate and having a more targeted shutdown. Ontario, as of tomorrow, going for 28 days, and then all in between for the other provinces. But what do you kind of make of Trudeau&#39;s use of the bully pulpit?

But one person that&#39;s trying to make hay with it is Aaron O&#39;Toole, leader of the Conservatives. Just today, he put out this graphic that said Trudeau has had 11 months to manage the a pandemic, but Canadians are worse off than in the spring, and then an image of a woman in a mask. Do you feel like strategically, A, that attack is strategically sound, part A to that question? And B, do you feel like there&#39;s perhaps some danger for the O&#39;Toole side, for the O&#39;Toole camp to try to make hay of something that I think Canadians understand, at least a large There are swaths of Canadians understand that the prime minister is trying to do what he can with the cards that have been dealt to him and every other leader across the globe.

Let&#39;s be clear, there are certain lines of attack that are not really open to O&#39;Toole. One of them is the Premier should be getting more involved in provincial health matters. He wouldn&#39;t put it that way. But you You could imagine it being like, oh, he just wants the premiers to do his dirty work. He has the tools.

We need to spend what&#39;s necessary, but we need to do more than spend. You can&#39;t fix this merely by putting it on Canada&#39;s credit card. It takes some thought, some strategy, and I&#39;m not seeing that from this prime minister. he&#39;s literally opened up his wallet and he&#39;s let every liberal interest come by and pull out a little bit of money right like there is a conservative critique that is available uh perhaps even one that implies uh graft or corruption but um yeah like this notion that he just hasn&#39;t done enough is it just sort of or like things haven&#39;t gotten better</div>

            <div class="said">the vaccine that is perhaps coming in 2021, what that looks like. And I know that we haven&#39;t really snapped into focus what this looks like. Will it be Moderna? Will it be Pfizer? What will it be? I know last episode, we talked about, you know, the Prime Minister giving him credit for securing and hedging our bets and having the highest per capita vaccine acquisition. But I want to talk about just very quickly here, as we start this conversation, certainly not end it on this episode, which is communications about the vaccine. You know, in a recent press conference this week, Trudeau said it&#39;d be a big sigh of relief when the vaccines this spring will come out. And I also wanted to just, with that line, talk to you guys about your initial thoughts of what advice would you give the prime minister, knowing that, A, we&#39;re still speaking in abstractions, B, that there&#39;s an expectation setting here that they&#39;re going to need to be really careful of, right? These vaccines might land, but the distribution and the logistics are a massive executional operation that is, you know, just fraught with uncertainty. So from a political standpoint, how are you going to, what are some of the lessons and principles you&#39;re thinking of of injecting into the PM&#39;s, you know, conversations right now, so that there&#39;s an expectation setting for the public so that when they, you know, when the vaccine is at the end of 2021 for them, or maybe 2022, that they receive it like that, that he&#39;s not there to kind of have the political blame as we&#39;ve been talking about as squarely at his feet. I know that&#39;s a very long question, one that we can&#39;t necessarily answer in specificity, but abstraction, but some first principles of what What you would be telling him right now when he addresses vaccines and their upcoming, you know, landing in Canada, so to speak? Carter, you first. Well,</div>

            <div class="said">Well, I think that the first step is that let&#39;s not confuse our distribution models with those of the United States. We have a far more robust distribution of, you know, vaccinations than they do in the U.S. because we have, for example, we&#39;ve implemented province-wide or really society-wide influenza vaccinations for years. We started doing the chickenpox vaccination years and years ago. We&#39;ve got vaccinations for our children.</div>

            <div class="said">Our vaccination systems are actually relatively robust, and they start with our health care system, right? What I&#39;d be talking about is setting people up for the waves waves, because what the prime minister is doing by talking about a single vaccination that&#39;s going to start to arrive in the spring, first of all, I don&#39;t know what the spring means. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s March or if that&#39;s May. This is Canada. What is the spring? And secondly, it&#39;s not going to come in one wave. It&#39;s going to come in a series of waves. And the people who are first going to get that first wave judging from the numbers of vaccinations that are coming we will have more vaccinations for COVID-19 than we traditionally give in Alberta for the influenza vaccination so if that&#39;s the case then we&#39;re going to have a fairly robust initial wave of vaccination but if it&#39;s not the case say that only one of those two vaccinations is able to actually deliver significant numbers to and it&#39;s halved or maybe it&#39;s quartered then we better be starting to set up with the people who are going to get the vaccinations first are the ones who need it most we&#39;re</div>

            <div class="said">going to get those vaccinations and then i would start defining what the hell does it mean to be a frontline provider now part of the problem is he&#39;s not necessarily going to be able to define each of those he&#39;s handing it off to the provinces and each province is going to go step-by-step to define what each of those waves looks like. I&#39;d probably just start saying the first wave of vaccinations will be available in the first or second quarter of 2021. I&#39;d make it a lot more vague. He&#39;s making it a lot more specific.

We need to get in line when it&#39;s our turn to get in line, and this is the opportunity to stop this. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t even think a lockdown is going to stop this.

And the time before that, he, you know, he was there and he was doing nice moves, but, you know, recency bias, right? And those first 30 days seem pretty remote at this point. I will say this, though. I do believe that he&#39;s made the moves behind the scenes that have allowed him to move forward more aggressively once people start paying attention to the Conservative Party again. People discount him at their peril. I think he&#39;s a serious man with very strong political chops, and we&#39;re going to see that coming forward. forward. People look at the polls, they laugh about the polls. Those polls are a reaction to the US political moment. We are going to have our own political moment at some point.

You know, it separates you and it gives you a lot of, you know, it&#39;s better than picking fights with your fellow councillors. However, I&#39;m getting really tired of cities trying to be public health experts. You know, cities don&#39;t do public health. They shouldn&#39;t do public health.

But listen, most people will be listening to this on Monday. This question will be dated by then. But of course, this answer will live in infamy regardless, Carter, because it is another Stephen Carter prediction answer. And of course, you hit them out of the park every time, buddy. Just wanted to let you know. Thanks for that. Thanks for going from 100% in one direction to 100% in another direction in a span of 70 minutes. And we&#39;ll leave it there. That is a wrap on episode 831 of The Strategist. My name is Zane Velji. With me, as always, Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter, and we&#39;ll see you next time.</div>
