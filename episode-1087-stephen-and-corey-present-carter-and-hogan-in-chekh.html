We know about him calling as president to the Secretary of State of Georgia and making comments about him potentially being in legal jeopardy if he didn&#39;t find those votes. And of of course there are the um you know the actions he took in terms of riling up the crowd and and then some like you know there&#39;s talking about how he used his justice department or he instructed them or he wanted them to create you know fraudulent claims of fraud so that he could then have pretext to do all sorts of crazy shit and that&#39;s where he broke the law well</div>

I mean, um, that&#39;s not going away. What is going away is the staggering degree at which we burn them. Um, we will not be burning oil and gas the same way, uh, in 20 years as we are now. And, and the biggest example of that is the, is the electric car. I mean, we, we use so much, um, energy in transportation and we are shifting the way that we&#39;re looking at transportation.

And by the way, the investments in this space also has the opportunity to create entire new markets for us as we become leaders in this space and strengthen our position as an energy superpower. Really play on some of those sentiments, but really make it clear that this is a step beyond what Danielle Smith Smith promise. This is not the Daniel Smith agenda you thought you were voting for.
