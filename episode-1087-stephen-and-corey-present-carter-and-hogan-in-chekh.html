And I think that that tells us a story. And I, I think that you&#39;d be, uh, you&#39;d be nuts not to assume that there&#39;s still going to be some sort of a story told about this moving forward.</span>

I think one of the reasons why political consultants like you and I often would suggest opportunities for the spouse to be engaged is that having somebody who, who is there and loves you and trusts you and can be kind kind of a proxy for all of those feelings that people like to see that they like to see that a candidate is worthy of that love and that trust. And I just don&#39;t know if it matters that much when you&#39;re a sitting prime minister that everybody&#39;s formed opinions of, but certainly when people are forming opinions about you in the first place,</span>

And I think it is making a tangible difference because these Fox hosts that are, you know, kind of used to getting that briefing note from Bill Barr.

The insurrection, the the events of January 6th, the continued lies about the steal of this election, you know, and again, it&#39;s as articulated by Jack Smith in the indictment. It is fine for him to to run around and say this was a stolen election. I mean, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s morally right, but I get it. It&#39;s it&#39;s under their freedom of speech laws as arcane as they are. You can basically get away with saying anything you want if you&#39;re a public politician.</span>

            <span class="text">listen he can he can say whatever he wants about the election. That&#39;s protected speech. Where he has gotten himself into legal jeopardy is when he tried to, through, you know, coercion and fraud, interfere with a change in government. And so it identifies a number of very specific actions. Obviously, we all know about the fake elector slates. We know about him calling as president to the Secretary of State of Georgia and making comments about him potentially being in legal jeopardy if he didn&#39;t find those votes. And of of course there are the um you know the actions he took in terms of riling up the crowd and and then some like you know there&#39;s talking about how he used his justice department or he instructed them or he wanted them to create you know fraudulent claims of fraud so that he could then have pretext to do all sorts of crazy shit and that&#39;s where he broke the law well</span>

And it is articulated, I think, in tremendous detail, step after step after step where individuals stood up and said, no, you&#39;ve lost the election. This is not the way that we should be doing that. You are threatening the U.S. democracy. democracy um and he was told this on many many levels by many different people and members</span>

And by the way, if I&#39;m a company, I&#39;m also having that same anxiety. I&#39;d be worried.

            <span class="text">We&#39;ve just got to get down to the fundamentals. Oil and gas are great. Why are we messing around with all these other things? That seems like an obvious continuation of it here. But at least under the Kenney government, there was this notion of we&#39;re not going to pick winners or losers. We&#39;re going to let everything bloom and we&#39;ll see what kind of works. This is a kind of an interventionist approach aggressively trying to pull us towards a past that we were in uh that i just don&#39;t think a lot of albertans think is the future and and so there&#39;s kind of this classic social democratic frame of forward not backward right like we want to go forward they want to go backward it&#39;s been used by governments and attempted governments for at least a century yeah</span>

            <span class="text">even like a smart bet on the future, even things Alberta was doing that seemed like they could be keeping the door open for a future that was not for oil and gas. And that&#39;s pretty dangerous because this is a fairly young province with a young population. I don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t have a lot of confidence that people are saying, yeah, what I really want is less renewable energy. energy most of the conversations i have even with ucp supporters with kind of the soft skeptic side of like the ndp agenda are like it&#39;s too fast it&#39;s not going to happen on that timeline yeah</span>

I mean, um, that&#39;s not going away. What is going away is the staggering degree at which we burn them. Um, we will not be burning oil and gas the same way, uh, in 20 years as we are now. And, and the biggest example of that is the, is the electric car. I mean, we, we use so much, um, energy in transportation and we are shifting the way that we&#39;re looking at transportation.

            <span class="text">yeah i mean part of it is rhetoric part of it is just making it clear that this is this is even by here&#39;s what i would say people voted for the ucp that you need to vote for you and you need to craft for them a reason to believe like oh this isn&#39;t what you you voted for right and so i can imagine something along the lines of like hey look it&#39;s one thing not to get on the bus it&#39;s quite another to stand in front of it and dare it to run you over like this government should take its own advice and butt out of this particular market and and just this is where the capital wants to go why are you standing in the way in investments in alberta jobs in alberta this is not saying there can&#39;t be jobs in oil and gas as well this is actively standing in front of people who want to create other jobs, more jobs, good jobs that could be there in any kind of energy mix going forward. And by the way, the investments in this space also has the opportunity to create entire new markets for us as we become leaders in this space and strengthen our position as an energy superpower. Really play on some of those sentiments, but really make it clear that this is a step beyond what Danielle Smith Smith promise. This is not the Daniel Smith agenda you thought you were voting for. I think you got to give people the excuse to come to you and just say like, oh, wow, this is not the thing that I thought I wanted.</span>

You&#39;ll recall when I&#39;m not sure if you were there for this.
