            <span class="text">for dog shampoo. This was in my head all day. I have to tell you. I was thinking about this a lot. What part of it were you thinking about? Well, it&#39;s like, why did this shampoo speak to you in the first place? Like, let&#39;s put aside the fact there&#39;s a dog on it. You&#39;re like, oh, that&#39;s great. That&#39;s for me. You know, its big emphasis is that it&#39;s odor control shampoo. Is this a problem?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sound okay. And then his defense was, all sorts of shampoos have pictures like dogs on them. I challenge you to go to the shampoo aisle of your local grocery store. Come to the same conclusion.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it&#39;s incredible. Speaking of incredible, guys, it is that time of year. It is our time for our annual podcast listener survey. Now, Corey, as the quarterback of our annual survey, you take this role and responsibility very seriously, and you have for the last 37 years. We do this podcast survey for our listener base. We just want to understand how to monetize you. We want to understand what you care about, audience, so that we could pretend to care about it and sell it back to you. And we&#39;ve been doing the survey for 36 years. We&#39;ve yet to actually endorse a product because we&#39;re still in data collection mode. But the big news this year, Corey, of course, is that we finally have the domain PodcastSurvey.ca. After an extensive, nearly decades-long legal battle, we have finally come up with the PodcastSurvey.ca domain name. But do you want to fill our listeners in on the survey itself?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, as you mentioned, for 36 years running, we haven&#39;t actually found any value in the audience, so it hasn&#39;t been commodifiable. But we&#39;re hoping to break that this time around. and so many have asked you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you know we should ask different questions in order to commoditize them better uh but they can go fuck themselves i just wanted to make that mention before i pass the mic back to you we&#39;ve</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ve been asking the same questions for 34 of those years um goes back to our radio days when steven and i used to do this on radio with chester uh because of course when you&#39;re on radio those things matter an awful lot more than when you&#39;re on podcast and we just kind of got used to it but we um in the early days of the internet when the the domain servers weren&#39;t You know, it wasn&#39;t the way it is now. Essentially, you had to send in a letter with a stamp and say, I want this domain. And we sent in a request for podcast surveys at the same time that kind of a farm slash fishery that, you know, dealt with peas and also, you know, fly fishing sent it in. And there</span>

            <span class="text">we want to talk about the Steve Allen report. We are going to double click into Alberta. You know, the fact that we&#39;re on twice a week now allows us these opportunities to deep dive. I mean, we could have done this a long time ago, but now the fact that we have committed to it allows us the fact to do a little bit of a deep dive. And that&#39;s what I want want to do today? Because, Corey,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, fill us in on a bit of the details. Was it on Friday afternoon that we found out that this legendary report that was going to be commissioned by Steve Allen, who is an accountant here in Calgary, where we&#39;re recording today, was going to put this inquiry together about how the province&#39;s oil and gas critics fund a concerted campaign against Alberta He asked for his third extension. So now the report, which was supposed to be due today as we record Sunday, January 31st, is now due May 31st of 2021. This is the third extension, as I mentioned. The increased budget, I think, also has increased along the way to now costing Alberta taxpayers three and a half million dollars. And then there&#39;s been these, Corey, maybe you can, and Carter, you can kind of jump in here to help me contextualize this. Has it been leaks of documents that he&#39;s putting together? Or have these been put out on purpose? Maybe you can help our listeners and even myself understand where some of the other external documents have kind of made their way and have kind of already promoted criticism of a report that hasn&#39;t come out. So, Corey, if you jump in first on context, and Carter, I&#39;ll let you kind of fill in some other gaps as well. So</span>

            <span class="text">So Zane, you would be forgiven for thinking these documents must have been leaked because they&#39;re so terrible. You can&#39;t imagine that somebody would actually put them out of their own volition. But these have been released by the inquiry as inputs going in. Let me rewind a little bit. Let&#39;s take it back to 2019 here for our non-Alberta listeners. And even those Alberta listeners who haven&#39;t been as consumed by the absurdity that is this story, as I think the three of us have. In 2019, amongst, you know, political parties make promises, some of them are pretty weird. And one of the promises that the UCP made during this fever moment in Alberta that we&#39;ve talked a lot about how the oil and gas industry support has become kind of like this cultural touchstone. But the UCP made a promise that they were going to hold an inquiry into anti-energy campaigns, this concerted conspiratorial effort of groups from the United States and beyond in order to landlock Alberta oil for their own nefarious interests. And a lot of this was based on the work of Vivian Krauss, who I will not call a journalist, but Vivian Krauss had come to the conclusion that this was a big conspiracy based on reading of financial statements and over</span>

Not a great look. Signed off by the minister, too. Not a great look. There have been delays, as you&#39;ve mentioned already, Zane. We&#39;re on our third right now. This was supposed to be a relatively quick inquiry. There have been reductions in scope. So the scope, it removed whether they were going to say. So now the inquiry doesn&#39;t even cover whether what these environmental groups are saying is the truth, right? Right. So now it&#39;s just our environmental groups advertised in Alberta. Well, you don&#39;t need a $3.5 million inquiry to say yes. Everybody knows that just as there are oil groups that are advertising in Alberta. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So each province has their own piece of legislation that enables these types of inquiries, and they are usually done for very serious reasons. Something has gone wrong within government, and they wish to fix that thing that has gone wrong. They then do an inquiry, and that inquiry is supposed to advise the government how not to do this type of mistake in the future.</span>

So when you when again, they posted these different documents, these reference documents on their website before, which I haven&#39;t double checked today. But as of Friday, or maybe it was yesterday, you couldn&#39;t get to the commission&#39;s website. You had to go to the Wayback Machine on Google to actually go back and find the old website. But in essence, what they have done is they&#39;ve commissioned reports. They paid $28,000 to a former school teacher in Great Britain to publish a 100-plus page report detailing many different conspiracies around climate change in total. So it seems like while</span>

            <span class="text">while the commission&#39;s not going down the track of what is true and what is not true, they&#39;re very comfortable going down the what is not true track, right? Because the official position of the government of Alberta is climate change is real. Climate change is something that we have to take into account, and it is something that we have to ensure that our environmental standards are addressing. That hasn&#39;t changed since Rachel Notley was the premier. That is the position of the government. and um but this commission seems to be on on trying</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I want to talk strategy in a second, but both of you brought up an interesting point that I think is worthy to tease out for a second, which is that this is an inquiry. Tell me the difference between this being an inquiry where you said it&#39;s a big deal versus the premier saying, hey, Steve, write me a report. Write Write me something on WhatsApp. And I think that I think is really important for us to understand, because as much as we&#39;re going to now talk about the strategy element to it, the reason this is becoming a story outside of Alberta is, Corey, to your point, some of these inputs are so ridiculous that they&#39;re finding their own earned media outside of the four walls of this province. But this is a big deal, to your point, is it not? And explain to us what the difference between maybe an inquiry of this nature looks like versus just a casual report that the premier asked his buddy Steve to put together?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, ultimately, it comes down to the powers of the commissioner, right? The ability to compel evidence and testimonies and to reach out and you get a big staff and you get a budget. Apparently, $905,000 isn&#39;t enough to actually read the act to understand you&#39;ve got to talk to the people you&#39;re accusing. That would have taken $906,000, I guess. But in theory, you&#39;ve got an awful lot that allows you to kind</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">kind of force things. So specifically, the commissioner has the power to summon anybody and require them to give testimony. And that&#39;s pretty</span>

            <span class="text">pretty wild. Like me writing a report, I can&#39;t do that. I think it goes without saying. And so this is a way to kind of pull things in and turn over rocks. And this is under oath. So if you lie to the commissioner, you&#39;re perjuring yourself. And so that&#39;s the big deal. That&#39;s the difference here. Like I said, it&#39;s a quasi-judicial process. And when you give somebody that kind of power, and maybe this is putting a bit of a bow on it and circling back, and</span>

And that&#39;s part of why everybody is so worked up about this, and I think rightly so. You got to keep in mind, this started in July 2019.

We&#39;re going to get to the bottom of it.

Bring it out on like the 19th of December and let that thing rest and let everybody dissect it for two weeks from the 19th to the, you know, the 3rd of January. Who the fuck&#39;s going to care?

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, then let&#39;s talk about strategy a bit more. First of all, two-part question. Let&#39;s start as broad as we can. A, do you agree with Carter&#39;s assessment that this is something that has turned into a fiasco? I think we generally do. So maybe a quick answer on that. And then B, what sort of steps are you taking if you&#39;re a senior advisor to the premier right now in order to create an off ramp for you for this particular inquiry?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I think this is an interesting case study, but maybe not even necessarily just because it&#39;s subject matter is the environment in Alberta and all of that. But in some ways, it&#39;s such a pure example of a fiasco of the government&#39;s own creations. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah. And so then the question becomes, when governments do such a thing, how do they get out of such things? Right,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">goal is kind of what I phrased it to Stephen as, but yeah, it seems to be headed in that direction. It&#39;s a good framing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">because it is interesting. Most of the time when government makes a mistake, there is such a long lead and there&#39;s so many other extenuating circumstances. It&#39;s very difficult to sort of pin these things back on the government. But right here we have something</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">something that it&#39;s almost impossible to pin on anybody but the government. And at this point, the longer it seems to be going on, the more embarrassing it is and very damaging for the province of Alberta. We&#39;ve now gotten to the point where there&#39;s international coverage of this, you know, international associations of journalists taking Alberta to task. I can only imagine what the media value of all of this negative press for Alberta is. Probably far eclipses the money we&#39;re wasting with the energy war room. yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know even if we assume the energy war room was being effective with those dollars it would be a bit of an embarrassing situation for all involved so your question zane is what am i doing in the premier&#39;s office at this point yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right. Carter, what you wanted to add here, Corey&#39;s kind of set up a very interesting framework. You&#39;ve commissioned this, quite literally. You&#39;ve set up the inquiry. It&#39;s your project, your report. It&#39;s not like this was handed or forced to you. In fact, this was created out of thin air as a campaign promise. You set the guardrails for what the outcomes were going to be. How do you extract yourself? And can you extract yourself from this situation, Carter? Carter?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">interesting enough, Zane, I&#39;ve had a similar experience. When Alison Redford ran to become the premier of the province of Alberta, she promised an inquiry, a full inquiry, into queue jumping in health care. and uh you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know i think that you know what we can say about that is that it was uh it was constrained zane it was constrained it was not the it was not the fully realized um promise that we&#39;d made in the leadership uh that was actually followed through on instead it was it was smaller and i think that it was rightfully criticized uh by the general public because it didn&#39;t come out and actually address the issue that we&#39;d campaigned on. So yeah, I&#39;ve been there. I&#39;ve been where Jason Kenney is right now, where you promise something in the election, you promise that you get to the bottom of it, and then maybe you found that the bottom wasn&#39;t exactly where you thought it was going to be. So you just kind of redefine the scope of the inquiry. This is 2013. It&#39;s a totally different time. I was no longer chief of staff when the report was was issued. But we did start that process because the, you know, you had to do something to follow through on the promise that you&#39;d made. But, you know, at the end of the day, you weren&#39;t going to get to where you wanted to go. So you just did something and you let it go as quickly as possible. That inquiry also had</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it was actually rejected. The inquiry extension was rejected, and we demanded the report – well, not we, but they demanded the report right away, again, in no small part because it curtailed it. This is a different experience because he&#39;s allowing the extensions, but I think he&#39;s doing it the exact wrong way. I would say your homework is due, Mr. Allen, on the 31st of January.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, listen. Expectations are sky high when something is that late. All of a sudden, all of the eyes and literally eyes all over the world are looking at this. If this report had</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">had never been given an extension, they never would have gotten these nonsense reports and they would have been in a much better situation. It&#39;s pretty easy to Monday morning quarterback, but it&#39;s also, to Carter&#39;s point, pretty foreseeable. If you have an inquiry like this going off the rails, the question you have to ask yourself if you&#39;re in a premier&#39;s office is, can I get it on the rails?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And you have to be honest with yourself as you assess that, because if the answer is no, then</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">then it becomes all about mitigation and minimization. You want to make this thing as small as possible and move on. And this isn&#39;t just about inquiries, Zane. It&#39;s about anything that a government does that when they started, it suddenly goes awry. But if you think you can get it on the rails, then you try to fix it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Whether it was ever fixable, I think – I&#39;d be curious how they came to the conclusion it was fixable, I suppose. And the scope changes that they had in summer of last year didn&#39;t</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">What was their plan and is that plan still playing out is a very big question. I think that we won&#39;t know the answer to for several months at this point. So,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So, okay, here&#39;s where I think we are. We&#39;ve set the context of the report. We&#39;ve set, I think, our strategic sort of direction for both of you. Carter, you used the term bury. Corey used the term mitigate and minimize. Let&#39;s get into some tactics. Let&#39;s explain to our listeners how this is done, right? Because we talk about burying a report, and I just take that for, Carter, I just like, yep, I move on. I gloss over usually when we mention that term. Let&#39;s use this episode to talk about what that looks like, tactically talk about what that looks like. So, you know the circumstances. You&#39;ve talked about expectations, both of you have. Three extensions make the expectations quite high. The input documents, which I initially thought were leaked, but thank you, Corey, for explaining to me that those are input documents to preview a bit of a trailer as to what some of the inputs might be for this report. So you guys know that condition. You know that the opposition is primed to pick on this because it&#39;s becoming a bullseye that&#39;s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The press coverage beyond the four walls of Alberta have also now extended the story. So, Carter, let&#39;s tactically talk about this. What does burying look like? If you were given the mandate by the premier saying, fuck it, Stephen, we&#39;ve got to bury it, what&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re doing? Or what&#39;s the first couple of things that you&#39;re doing tactically to start that process and minimize something like this? And let me be clear. I&#39;m not putting this segment on and facilitating it so we can advise the government, so to speak. But I want people to understand and have an understanding of kind of what the tactical process looks like. Like when political operatives say, yep, we&#39;re going to minimize, mitigate, or in Carter&#39;s terms, bury this report.</span>

May 31st is going to be due and the minister has got up to three months to release the report. So that means that all of my opposition is now looking at May the 31st and beyond to be ready for the report to drop. up so the research teams at the ndp and the uh i&#39;ll just pick on them or the uh the federal liberals they&#39;re you know if they&#39;re interested in it their research teams will be ready to go for a specific point in time uh</span>

Do you have any problems? He says, no, I don&#39;t think I can get it done. I said, no. No, do you have any problems? You&#39;re maybe not hearing me. Do you have any problems? No, I don&#39;t.

But I&#39;d say to Sonia Savage, you&#39;re going to accept or you&#39;re going to reject all of those things and you&#39;re going to release this thing on March the 2nd. Right. So February 28th, March the 2nd, it gets released.

So Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you for the same thing, your tactical list of what you&#39;re doing up until the release. And then let&#39;s park it there on both fronts, because then I want to talk about how to mitigate and minimize the post-release shelf life, so to speak, how to ensure that its distribution cycle beyond the day that it&#39;s released gets minimized. But let&#39;s get to the the day of releasing the report. Corey, what do you make of what you heard from Carter? Is there something different that you were thinking of in terms of an approach or a tactical list? You get the exact same call saying green light, minimize and mitigate is what we&#39;re doing, Corey. What&#39;s one of the first things or first series of things you&#39;re doing?</span>

            <span class="text">A lot of what Stephen Carter said, but let me give you my own version of it here. So first, I start by letting it known I was disappointed with the report on background, whether that&#39;s Minister Sonia Savage, or whether whether that&#39;s premier Jason Kenney or staff, that&#39;s something that I have out there a bit just to soften the ground a bit, or it&#39;s not, you know, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s wrong. I would say, oh, I was hoping, you know, they would have done a better job. Frankly, check the calendar, see if there&#39;s a good event coming up. If timing was more the friend, Steven, I like your February 28th. I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s going to be good or going to work for them, but you know, if they could pull it off, February 19th would be the perfect day. In my opinion,</span>

A perfect hook would be something along the lines of there&#39;s evidence of an environmental group acting in a shady fashion that basically reinforces the thesis that your report could not reinforce. And so you try to conflate the two issues by dropping it at the same time if such a matter occurs. Okay hook would be it&#39;s a matter of significance to Alberta on oil and gas that allows you to just sort of slide it in there and it becomes less a standalone alone event that people remember and more just a component of a bigger energy environmental issue within alberta cory</span>

Before I do that, I want to ask Carter your take on Corey&#39;s softening of the ground on the media strategy. Would you bring the media in at any point up until the release of the report? Are you leaving the media in any sort of leaks? Are you either of you kind of leaking this thing ahead of time?

But what you could do is actually use this moment right now and start making it known that, yeah, when we started looking at what Commissioner Allen was doing, we were a little disappointed with the report. He got distracted on the wrong issues. He was focused on matters that were of less concern to us. We wanted to really have a document – whatever the report is going to end up being, start pretending you asked for that all along and Commissioner Allen was the one that was awry on this. It just allows you to both lower expectations for it because, again, as I said, this</span>

He&#39;s been the president of the Calgary Stampede, which is, I mean, don&#39;t get me started on the Stampede Mafia. They are very, very powerful in Calgary.

But what Corey just described about how you&#39;re going to make him the noob in this thing. like he&#39;s the guy who&#39;s going to be left holding this thing because jason kenney&#39;s not and uh the fact that steve allen put himself in this position um without realizing that uh he is going to be um made to be made to be the clown um this is i</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m taking that Corey question, which was the heart of my question in some ways. The optimized Jason Kenney, the politically savvy Jason Kenney. He uses a cousin of, he uses something related to one of the strategies and series of tactics you guys have put out on the table. What are you thinking of if you&#39;re not Lee and Trudeau and those as you perhaps contemplate your response and contemplate them trying to minimize and bury a report like this?</span>

            <span class="text">has already taken this thing through the trash once, or more than once. I mean, this thing has gone through the trash so many times. It&#39;s just going to be a continuation of it. And I expect it&#39;s going to haunt Jason Kenney right up through the election. This is a foundational mistake in terms of him misreading where Alberta is. It kind of reminds me of Jim Prentiss in Bill 10. You know, when Jim Prentice tried to kind of push the anti-LGBTQ legislation in the 2014-2015 time frame, people just rose up against it. And I think that people are rising up against this, too. Now, are they Jason Kenney&#39;s people? No. But they are the people that Rachel Notley needs and Justin Trudeau needs to be successful in this province. Not that Justin Trudeau is going to see a big breakthrough, but Rachel Notley is, again, getting close to numbers that say that she&#39;s going to form government. So I&#39;d bang the shit out of this. And the environmental agencies, the environmental organizations, I think they should grab every pot and pan and just bang the crap out of it. They were attacked. They were brought under a microscope, and they&#39;re going to emerge unscathed and stronger. stronger. So make sure that they should celebrate that from the rooftops as long as they possibly can.</span>

            <span class="text">Okay, we&#39;ll move on to some other questions and other items that we&#39;ve seen this week. Let&#39;s start here. On a scale of 1 to 10, Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you on this one. Aaron O&#39;Toole this morning on a Sunday morning political talk show said that Justin Trudeau has a conflict of interest if he picks the next governor general, simply because he could have a conflict of interest by choosing someone that might politically side with him in this minority situation, the whole concept of triggering an election. There could be some hanky-panky going on. He didn&#39;t use those terms. I&#39;m paraphrasing, so to speak, but ultimately insinuating that there is a conflict of interest for Justin Trudeau to pick the next governor general. On a scale of 1 to 10, that political argument for Aaron O&#39;Toole, what do you give it? i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think with the public maybe a six but in general it&#39;s not a particularly strong one i mean you you could argue there&#39;s a conflict of interest where uh you know liberal party members are choosing the liberal leader because that liberal leader will then be able to affect their lives well no kidding but this system actually puts the prime minister as the paramount player in all of this so to suggest that there&#39;s a conflict by him uh recommending an appointment to the queen which like he he&#39;s picking the person here like that&#39;s not a conflict of interest that&#39;s just that&#39;s just how it goes now the reason why erin o&#39;toole may have some kind</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">kind of pickup with this is that generally speaking canadians have dealt with in the past bit and seen in situations like the bc minority government that these representatives can occasionally come in and be pretty significant in determining who the prime minister is going to be but in some ways that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s you know i won&#39;t even say that&#39;s the exception it&#39;s the system plays out differently than that you know fundamentally Ultimately, the prime minister is still the one who goes to the GG and says, I want it done this way, right? We don&#39;t pretend for a moment that the GG is like this deeply independent voice. If they were, do you think Michel Jean would have prorogued parliament? Like, that&#39;s just not how it actually works. So, yeah, I mean, it sounds okay. If people think the governor general is the prime minister&#39;s boss, it makes sense. The governor general is not the prime minister&#39;s boss, though. So it doesn&#39;t really make any sense.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s a total fail, Zane. I mean, this is a ridiculous premise. First of all, the premise is that people give a shit about the governor general. They don&#39;t. The fact that this particular governor general turned out to be a bully, big fucking deal. Move on. No one is going to change their vote based on this. and my advice to Aaron O&#39;Toole would be pick an issue that actually Canadians care about and I&#39;m actually going to vote on, you stupid fuck.</span>

So Harper did use a panel like this to choose David Johnson. That&#39;s how he was chosen. So it&#39;s, yeah. But I think it almost reinforces your point. How many Canadians knew that?

            <span class="text">mean, it&#39;s oh, it&#39;s big deal for them. So I guess I&#39;ll put it on over because not having the debt means that they have, you know, the ability to incur more debt in the future. So good for them.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think it&#39;s over because there&#39;s a range of motion that that affords and it&#39;s not as though just getting into the black was when that moment happened but obviously if you&#39;re in 7.7 million dollars of debt you are desperate to avoid an election by by any means necessary that&#39;s not going to be the case if you&#39;re debt free you can go borrow another 7.7 million dollars apparently and you can run yourself another election campaign So it&#39;s important. Money is, to quote Stephen Carter, the currency of politics.</span>
