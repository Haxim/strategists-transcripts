          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter dig deep into Alberta's inquiry into "Anti-Energy Campaigns", using the issue as a launching pad to talk about the political art of burying your own initiatives. How does the Alberta government extract itself from the Allan inquiry? How might they position this to be a win - or at least not a loss? And who among us hasn't been guilty of using dog shampoo? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Now, Corey, as the quarterback of our annual survey, you take this role and responsibility very seriously, and you have for the last 37 years. We do this podcast survey for our listener base. We just want to understand how to monetize you. We want to understand what you care about, audience, so that we could pretend to care about it and sell it back to you. And we&#39;ve been doing the survey for 36 years. We&#39;ve yet to actually endorse a product because we&#39;re still in data collection mode. But the big news this year, Corey, of course, is that we finally have the domain PodcastSurvey.ca. After an extensive, nearly decades-long legal battle, we have finally come up with the PodcastSurvey.ca domain name. But do you want to fill our listeners in on the survey itself?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Corey, fill us in on a bit of the details. Was it on Friday afternoon that we found out that this legendary report that was going to be commissioned by Steve Allen, who is an accountant here in Calgary, where we&#39;re recording today, was going to put this inquiry together about how the province&#39;s oil and gas critics fund a concerted campaign against Alberta He asked for his third extension. So now the report, which was supposed to be due today as we record Sunday, January 31st, is now due May 31st of 2021. This is the third extension, as I mentioned. The increased budget, I think, also has increased along the way to now costing Alberta taxpayers three and a half million dollars. And then there&#39;s been these, Corey, maybe you can, and Carter, you can kind of jump in here to help me contextualize this. Has it been leaks of documents that he&#39;s putting together? Or have these been put out on purpose? Maybe you can help our listeners and even myself understand where some of the other external documents have kind of made their way and have kind of already promoted criticism of a report that hasn&#39;t come out. So, Corey, if you jump in first on context, and Carter, I&#39;ll let you kind of fill in some other gaps as well. So</div>

            <div class="said">So Zane, you would be forgiven for thinking these documents must have been leaked because they&#39;re so terrible. You can&#39;t imagine that somebody would actually put them out of their own volition. But these have been released by the inquiry as inputs going in. Let me rewind a little bit. Let&#39;s take it back to 2019 here for our non-Alberta listeners. And even those Alberta listeners who haven&#39;t been as consumed by the absurdity that is this story, as I think the three of us have. In 2019, amongst, you know, political parties make promises, some of them are pretty weird. And one of the promises that the UCP made during this fever moment in Alberta that we&#39;ve talked a lot about how the oil and gas industry support has become kind of like this cultural touchstone. But the UCP made a promise that they were going to hold an inquiry into anti-energy campaigns, this concerted conspiratorial effort of groups from the United States and beyond in order to landlock Alberta oil for their own nefarious interests. And a lot of this was based on the work of Vivian Krauss, who I will not call a journalist, but Vivian Krauss had come to the conclusion that this was a big conspiracy based on reading of financial statements and over</div>

This was supposed to be a relatively quick inquiry. There have been reductions in scope. So the scope, it removed whether they were going to say. So now the inquiry doesn&#39;t even cover whether what these environmental groups are saying is the truth, right? Right. So now it&#39;s just our environmental groups advertised in Alberta. Well, you don&#39;t need a $3.5 million inquiry to say yes. Everybody knows that just as there are oil groups that are advertising in Alberta. And</div>

But as of Friday, or maybe it was yesterday, you couldn&#39;t get to the commission&#39;s website. You had to go to the Wayback Machine on Google to actually go back and find the old website. But in essence, what they have done is they&#39;ve commissioned reports. They paid $28,000 to a former school teacher in Great Britain to publish a 100-plus page report detailing many different conspiracies around climate change in total. So it seems like while</div>

Tell me the difference between this being an inquiry where you said it&#39;s a big deal versus the premier saying, hey, Steve, write me a report. Write Write me something on WhatsApp. And I think that I think is really important for us to understand, because as much as we&#39;re going to now talk about the strategy element to it, the reason this is becoming a story outside of Alberta is, Corey, to your point, some of these inputs are so ridiculous that they&#39;re finding their own earned media outside of the four walls of this province.

A, do you agree with Carter&#39;s assessment that this is something that has turned into a fiasco? I think we generally do. So maybe a quick answer on that. And then B, what sort of steps are you taking if you&#39;re a senior advisor to the premier right now in order to create an off ramp for you for this particular inquiry?</div>

            <div class="said">So I think this is an interesting case study, but maybe not even necessarily just because it&#39;s subject matter is the environment in Alberta and all of that. But in some ways, it&#39;s such a pure example of a fiasco of the government&#39;s own creations. Yeah,</div>

            </div>

            <div class="said">because it is interesting. Most of the time when government makes a mistake, there is such a long lead and there&#39;s so many other extenuating circumstances.

So yeah, I&#39;ve been there. I&#39;ve been where Jason Kenney is right now, where you promise something in the election, you promise that you get to the bottom of it, and then maybe you found that the bottom wasn&#39;t exactly where you thought it was going to be. So you just kind of redefine the scope of the inquiry. This is 2013. It&#39;s a totally different time. I was no longer chief of staff when the report was was issued. But we did start that process because the, you know, you had to do something to follow through on the promise that you&#39;d made. But, you know, at the end of the day, you weren&#39;t going to get to where you wanted to go. So you just did something and you let it go as quickly as possible. That inquiry also had</div>

Carter, you used the term bury. Corey used the term mitigate and minimize. Let&#39;s get into some tactics. Let&#39;s explain to our listeners how this is done, right? Because we talk about burying a report, and I just take that for, Carter, I just like, yep, I move on. I gloss over usually when we mention that term. Let&#39;s use this episode to talk about what that looks like, tactically talk about what that looks like. So, you know the circumstances. You&#39;ve talked about expectations, both of you have. Three extensions make the expectations quite high. The input documents, which I initially thought were leaked, but thank you, Corey, for explaining to me that those are input documents to preview a bit of a trailer as to what some of the inputs might be for this report. So you guys know that condition. You know that the opposition is primed to pick on this because it&#39;s becoming a bullseye that&#39;s getting bigger and bigger and bigger. The press coverage beyond the four walls of Alberta have also now extended the story. So, Carter, let&#39;s tactically talk about this. What does burying look like? If you were given the mandate by the premier saying, fuck it, Stephen, we&#39;ve got to bury it, what&#39;s the first thing you&#39;re doing? Or what&#39;s the first couple of things that you&#39;re doing tactically to start that process and minimize something like this? And let me be clear. I&#39;m not putting this segment on and facilitating it so we can advise the government, so to speak. But I want people to understand and have an understanding of kind of what the tactical process looks like. Like when political operatives say, yep, we&#39;re going to minimize, mitigate, or in Carter&#39;s terms, bury this report.</div>

So Corey, I&#39;m going to ask you for the same thing, your tactical list of what you&#39;re doing up until the release. And then let&#39;s park it there on both fronts, because then I want to talk about how to mitigate and minimize the post-release shelf life, so to speak, how to ensure that its distribution cycle beyond the day that it&#39;s released gets minimized. But let&#39;s get to the the day of releasing the report. Corey, what do you make of what you heard from Carter? Is there something different that you were thinking of in terms of an approach or a tactical list? You get the exact same call saying green light, minimize and mitigate is what we&#39;re doing, Corey. What&#39;s one of the first things or first series of things you&#39;re doing?</div>

            <div class="said">A lot of what Stephen Carter said, but let me give you my own version of it here. So first, I start by letting it known I was disappointed with the report on background, whether that&#39;s Minister Sonia Savage, or whether whether that&#39;s premier Jason Kenney or staff, that&#39;s something that I have out there a bit just to soften the ground a bit, or it&#39;s not, you know, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s wrong. I would say, oh, I was hoping, you know, they would have done a better job. Frankly, check the calendar, see if there&#39;s a good event coming up. If timing was more the friend, Steven, I like your February 28th. I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s going to be good or going to work for them, but you know, if they could pull it off, February 19th would be the perfect day. In my opinion,</div>

Okay hook would be it&#39;s a matter of significance to Alberta on oil and gas that allows you to just sort of slide it in there and it becomes less a standalone alone event that people remember and more just a component of a bigger energy environmental issue within alberta cory</div>

At some point, you drop this thing. whether you follow the weakening the ground model or not um if you do it before may 31st you&#39;re going to catch folks by surprise great so you got that goal accomplished you do it on a friday how do you limit um cory talked about natural in control channel changer ie the budget what else are you trying to do to to mitigate and limit its uh shelf life uh in the in the media cycle or as a topic of conversation for either the opposition or the activists or the twitterati or or even your base in some ways? Because not forgetting them from perhaps turning on you if they felt like it didn&#39;t go far enough. How are you trying to mitigate the post-release element tactically, once again, of this report?

It&#39;s just going to be a continuation of it. And I expect it&#39;s going to haunt Jason Kenney right up through the election. This is a foundational mistake in terms of him misreading where Alberta is. It kind of reminds me of Jim Prentiss in Bill 10. You know, when Jim Prentice tried to kind of push the anti-LGBTQ legislation in the 2014-2015 time frame, people just rose up against it. And I think that people are rising up against this, too. Now, are they Jason Kenney&#39;s people? No. But they are the people that Rachel Notley needs and Justin Trudeau needs to be successful in this province. Not that Justin Trudeau is going to see a big breakthrough, but Rachel Notley is, again, getting close to numbers that say that she&#39;s going to form government. So I&#39;d bang the shit out of this. And the environmental agencies, the environmental organizations, I think they should grab every pot and pan and just bang the crap out of it. They were attacked. They were brought under a microscope, and they&#39;re going to emerge unscathed and stronger. stronger. So make sure that they should celebrate that from the rooftops as long as they possibly can.</div>

On a scale of 1 to 10, Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you on this one. Aaron O&#39;Toole this morning on a Sunday morning political talk show said that Justin Trudeau has a conflict of interest if he picks the next governor general, simply because he could have a conflict of interest by choosing someone that might politically side with him in this minority situation, the whole concept of triggering an election. There could be some hanky-panky going on. He didn&#39;t use those terms. I&#39;m paraphrasing, so to speak, but ultimately insinuating that there is a conflict of interest for Justin Trudeau to pick the next governor general. On a scale of 1 to 10, that political argument for Aaron O&#39;Toole, what do you give it? i</div>

            <div class="said">think with the public maybe a six but in general it&#39;s not a particularly strong one i mean you you could argue there&#39;s a conflict of interest where uh you know liberal party members are choosing the liberal leader because that liberal leader will then be able to affect their lives well no kidding but this system actually puts the prime minister as the paramount player in all of this so to suggest that there&#39;s a conflict by him uh recommending an appointment to the queen which like he he&#39;s picking the person here like that&#39;s not a conflict of interest that&#39;s just that&#39;s just how it goes now the reason why erin o&#39;toole may have some kind</div>

            <div class="said">kind of pickup with this is that generally speaking canadians have dealt with in the past bit and seen in situations like the bc minority government that these representatives can occasionally come in and be pretty significant in determining who the prime minister is going to be but in some ways that&#39;s</div>

            <div class="said">that&#39;s you know i won&#39;t even say that&#39;s the exception it&#39;s the system plays out differently than that you know fundamentally Ultimately, the prime minister is still the one who goes to the GG and says, I want it done this way, right? We don&#39;t pretend for a moment that the GG is like this deeply independent voice. If they were, do you think Michel Jean would have prorogued parliament? Like, that&#39;s just not how it actually works. So, yeah, I mean, it sounds okay. If people think the governor general is the prime minister&#39;s boss, it makes sense. The governor general is not the prime minister&#39;s boss, though. So it doesn&#39;t really make any sense.</div>
