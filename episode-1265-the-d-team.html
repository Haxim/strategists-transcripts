I mean, I&#39;m floored. I&#39;m truly floored that the next move was not some sort of Alberta Sovereignty Act reaction that was identical to Scott Moe&#39;s but done here in Alberta.

And while the governments you mentioned are maybe not natural friends of the Trudeau government, you had to expect that too. You had to expect that these conservative governments who weren&#39;t going to do the carbon tax in the first place were then going to say, this is insufficient, and you&#39;d have a bunch of critics who were rallying opposition and reinforcing your opponent&#39;s messages right there on the ground.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">offended by this is is is actually even beyond the policy. It&#39;s kind of like the malpractice that clearly underlines an action like this. You know, what you talk about, the idea of like an oppo team, you know, we&#39;ve called them red teams or blue teams in the past, depending on, you know, where you are, what your politics are, right? You do that for big things, not small things. So as you&#39;re talking, even, it makes me wonder, like, did they not realize this was a big thing? Like, that&#39;s one of the things that I kind of contemplate. But to answer or to build on what Stephen was talking there in in terms of like what fell down or what would you normally do yeah i&#39;ll tell you literally everything that goes through community government has a communications plan maybe it&#39;s one page maybe it&#39;s 100 it&#39;s probably not 100 that&#39;d be a fucking terrible comms plan but the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the basic sections i can tell you at the government of alberta is not all of them and maybe it&#39;s changed a bit in phraseology over the time is key messages sure makes sense counter messages anticipated counter messages and rebuttals to those counter messages including proof points right mitigations so what are you doing to try to manage the downsides that people are complaining about because you want to make sure the comms plan is not just trying to solve things with words but actually looking at some of the policy levers that might be available because what ends up happening is you&#39;ll have like a a communication.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And rather than just talking back to it, you&#39;ve preemptively thought about the mitigations that you&#39;re going to create. You&#39;d have anticipated stakeholder reaction, you would have who is responsible for managing each stakeholder, you would have audience specific messages, you might have stakeholder specific messages, and you would have the research that&#39;s necessary, as well as ways you would evaluate performance as it goes through.

It&#39;s just that it&#39;s the same mistake. Now, of course, it&#39;s not the same mistake in that they&#39;d done the carbon tax before. for it&#39;s the same mistake insofar as they still don&#39;t understand crisis and they don&#39;t understand crisis communications they don&#39;t seem to recognize when they&#39;re going into it and they don&#39;t seem to be able to figure out how to get out of it it&#39;s therefore it feels like we lurch from communications crisis to the communications crisis and that is why you know it it feels so tenuous um and that&#39;s why i mean i&#39;ve i&#39;ve reached the conclusion that there is no way out of this the only way out of this is a resignation from the principal and</span>

            <span class="text">These things need to be parts of a story, and they need to be thinking about the story that they want to tell at the next election. And when you have one day this action and four weeks earlier, a mutually exclusive action in the other direction, it creates this sense of like, even if this makes sense based on their strategy that nobody can sort of seem to figure out from a distance, that&#39;s problematic for them. because right now it&#39;s just looking like a government in total scramble mode. I actually think you can get away with reversing a great number of things if you are consistently reversing them towards one story and kind of one foundational objective. But what we&#39;re seeing from this government is not that. We&#39;re seeing selective reversals. We&#39;re seeing decisions sometimes to retreat, decisions sometimes on the same topic to run into the wall in front of them. And as a result, like, it&#39;s hard to say that there&#39;s any strategy to this whatsoever. And when there&#39;s no strategy, that&#39;s when you kind of assume panic.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I think it&#39;s horrible that we have provinces actively saying we&#39;re not going to follow the law, no matter how irritated they are. I would have actually felt much better with it if they&#39;re like, that&#39;s outrageous. We&#39;re not going to make our people pay that. And so that&#39;s going to be something that we&#39;re going to deal with the feds. But to put Sask Energy in that situation, to kind of flout the law, I think is a problematic stance for any premier to take. And it&#39;s part of a growing and worrying trend with Scott Moe, I think, in terms of just not actually thinking that these things apply to him. And so he&#39;ll use a notwithstanding clause if he has it. And clearly, he&#39;s not even limiting himself to kind of the emergency release valves of our legal framework. He&#39;s just now breaking the law. And that&#39;s a real problem for me. uh i do</span>

I don&#39;t think the government&#39;s going to play ball on that particular matter here. But of course, all he needs to do now is sort of perpetuate it and put his political, maybe not even primary opponents, but like tertiary and secondary opponents into difficult situations, doing things like the motions that he&#39;s brought forward here. And he gets people on the record. He creates discomfort within their coalitions. And yeah, I mean, that&#39;s good opposition work here.

            <span class="text">Federal Finance Minister Christia Freeland said a few headlines came out of the meeting. She said that Alberta would need to negotiate international agreements if it quits the CPP. She also said that she&#39;s asked the chief actuary to determine Alberta&#39;s share of CPP, which is something Alberta has been asking for.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">want your guys&#39; take on this. I guess, Carter, just the fact that this meeting happened in the first place and that it was about the Alberta pension plan with, I think, kind of that saying,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">saying, like, this is all we&#39;re talking about. I know others wanted to talk about the carbon tax there. And she&#39;s like, no, we&#39;re just talking about Alberta.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think that&#39;s actually a really smart play. I think focusing on the problem child is pretty wise. uh no one else is it feels particularly strongly or positively about this this isn&#39;t a good thing for other provinces um and it creates um challenges for the for the provincial government in in it creates a common enemy i guess and the common enemy is danielle smith and her government also we learned that by putting in specific rules about what how these things are supposed to go helps the federal government. It helps the country. So whether it was the Clarity Act or some other vehicle talking about how future referendums are going to be managed, this is going to be a referendum. It&#39;s a provincial referendum, but nonetheless, it&#39;s not all that much different than the separation one, except that you&#39;re not leaving Canada. You&#39;re just leaving a fiscal instrument. instrument nonetheless uh there should be questions as to which act should govern the the referendum should it be governed by the feds or should it be governed by the provinces these are all things that need to be talked about at the um government levels at the at the political levels and starting early i mean this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this our government&#39;s not saying when they&#39;re going to bring this to referendum or even if they&#39;re going to um it&#39;s right now just kind of uh a political hot potato. So I think it&#39;s pretty good that the feds jumped on it and are starting to take actions.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">So on that note, one of the pieces I was reading today said, which this was new to me, maybe you guys knew this, Smith has recently said she won&#39;t go ahead with a referendum until governments or the courts deliver a hard number on how much Alberta gets if they leave. Corey, talk to me about the strategy. I know Horner&#39;s been asking for a while for like this hard number. There was the commitment today to get the hard number like talk to me about the strategy of what that hard number from the feds um should or or could or will look like well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well this is one of those interesting things because she can say she&#39;s you know freeland can say she&#39;s reached out to the chief actuary to get a number but this is not like a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a spreadsheet you just go boop and like the number comes out There are so many interpretations</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">interpretations of the act that are on the table. And so I think this is one of the interesting challenges. This is part of why the government came up with its rather absurd calculation, or LifeWorks did, that, lest we forget, it actually originally calculated that Alberta should get more than the entire value of CPP based on the formula. And then said, but that seems crazy. So we&#39;re just asking for half, you know, like really great</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">great defensible argument there, guys. But there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there is interpretation and interpretation and interpretation. And the chief actuary is going to have to ultimately make some political decisions or provide a list of like a million permutations here. And I&#39;m actually not sure that that necessarily serves the federal government. Although, if the chief actuary came back with a number that was super low and said, I just put it in the spreadsheet, and this is what you&#39;re owed, Alberta, maybe that does. But that, you know, I&#39;m curious to see what the next move is here. I worry this is the chess of the federal government once again, where they&#39;re not necessarily thinking all of the moves ahead. Because play this out a tiny bit.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, that might actually be enough to give Danielle Smith what she needs, which is to say, okay, well, now I can run a less bullshit laden campaign for an Alberta pension plan. Because if I ignore any of the challenges with risk, and if I just keep narrowly focused on like the year that we&#39;re in, what contributions could be like, maybe I can tell a story about this Alberta pension plan leaving more money in Albertans pockets. And it allows her to sort of reframe things and get out of the box that she put herself in, which is this absolutely absurd number, which</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">which I think was a problem for her and a bit of malpractice in communications because it just became unbelievable. believable well now the feds have provided a believable number like it might still be fake what the provincial government comes back on but it might be a believable number or</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">or maybe that number comes in even lower and it can&#39;t actually provide all of the magic and ice cream and unicorns that we&#39;ve been promised by the provincial government and now the provincial government has what they probably want more than a pension plan which is a fight right like a fight with the government saying this is unfair once again you&#39;re being unfair show your work i&#39;ll see you in court and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. There&#39;s a lot of complications that have to go in there. There&#39;s consultations that need to happen with other provincial finance ministers. The feds can&#39;t just come up with a number and say, this is the number. The feds have to go through a whole bunch of different steps because everybody is invested in the number in a way that no one was invested in Alberta&#39;s number, right? No one really cared what Alberta&#39;s number was. Or Alberta didn&#39;t care what anybody else thought. The feds have to go through a whole bunch of discussions about all the variables, all the assumptions, and that&#39;s going to take, it&#39;s going to take a long time to chat with each of those people to come up with the methodology by which this number is going to be calculated.</span>

But what she did is she said, I&#39;m going to go get the chief actuary to get a number. and that is ultimately math at the end of the day that&#39;s it&#39;s kind of why you go to an actuary is</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well and maybe that&#39;s the answer maybe the chief actuary&#39;s response is this is really fucking complicated these eight million things need to be figured out so you&#39;re going to have to go talk to everybody under the sun and actually if that&#39;s their strategy it&#39;s not a bad one i&#39;ll say that but let&#39;s hope that is their strategy because otherwise i&#39;m worried this number will come out too quickly. And, and it just gives like too much, too much space for the Conservatives to regroup and, and turn the page on, you know, the very challenging number</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I think that it&#39;s going to embark on a process. That process is going to be articulated. And then as they move through the process, they will give periodic updates. We&#39;re currently discussing with the premiers or the finance ministers, what the various variables should look like and how they&#39;re commonly understood. And we anticipate the following challenges and the following questions. And we&#39;ll have a fulsome answer sometime in 2024. 24 so</span>

Is it going to be my old friend, Rick Orman, who ran for the leadership against Alison Redford? And, you know, is it going to be him or is it going to be like, who is the person and are they going to be associated with the Take Back Alberta group? uh you know who&#39;s who&#39;s going to be claiming victory and who&#39;s going to be claiming defeat this is a very interesting thing because it strikes me that there&#39;s just it&#39;s factioned and anytime there&#39;s factions um it</span>

So it is an interesting read in that sense. An awful lot of stuff that looks like it&#39;s been ported up from the United States.
