          <p>Annalise, Stephen and Corey discuss the ongoing carbon tax exemption controversy, Freeland meeting with Finance Ministers and committing to getting Alberta a number on the CPP and more.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. "In 2015, a hack politico unit was sent to entry-level positions by a PMO to do work for which they were fit. These men and women promptly escaped from jobs where they could do no damage to the Ottawa elite. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as senior staffers. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you don't care how it turns out....maybe you can hire The D-Team."</em></p></blockquote>

You do that for big things, not small things. So as you&#39;re talking, even, it makes me wonder, like, did they not realize this was a big thing? Like, that&#39;s one of the things that I kind of contemplate. But to answer or to build on what Stephen was talking there in in terms of like what fell down or what would you normally do yeah i&#39;ll tell you literally everything that goes through community government has a communications plan maybe it&#39;s one page maybe it&#39;s 100 it&#39;s probably not 100 that&#39;d be a fucking terrible comms plan but the</div>

And when you have one day this action and four weeks earlier, a mutually exclusive action in the other direction, it creates this sense of like, even if this makes sense based on their strategy that nobody can sort of seem to figure out from a distance, that&#39;s problematic for them. because right now it&#39;s just looking like a government in total scramble mode. I actually think you can get away with reversing a great number of things if you are consistently reversing them towards one story and kind of one foundational objective. But what we&#39;re seeing from this government is not that. We&#39;re seeing selective reversals. We&#39;re seeing decisions sometimes to retreat, decisions sometimes on the same topic to run into the wall in front of them. And as a result, like, it&#39;s hard to say that there&#39;s any strategy to this whatsoever. And when there&#39;s no strategy, that&#39;s when you kind of assume panic.</div>

And so that&#39;s going to be something that we&#39;re going to deal with the feds. But to put Sask Energy in that situation, to kind of flout the law, I think is a problematic stance for any premier to take. And it&#39;s part of a growing and worrying trend with Scott Moe, I think, in terms of just not actually thinking that these things apply to him. And so he&#39;ll use a notwithstanding clause if he has it. And clearly, he&#39;s not even limiting himself to kind of the emergency release valves of our legal framework.

I don&#39;t think the government&#39;s going to play ball on that particular matter here. But of course, all he needs to do now is sort of perpetuate it and put his political, maybe not even primary opponents, but like tertiary and secondary opponents into difficult situations, doing things like the motions that he&#39;s brought forward here. And he gets people on the record. He creates discomfort within their coalitions. And yeah, I mean, that&#39;s good opposition work here. This motion that the Conservatives brought forward that&#39;s going to have NDP support, or at least it was going to when I was looking at it earlier,</div>

It helps the country. So whether it was the Clarity Act or some other vehicle talking about how future referendums are going to be managed, this is going to be a referendum. It&#39;s a provincial referendum, but nonetheless, it&#39;s not all that much different than the separation one, except that you&#39;re not leaving Canada. You&#39;re just leaving a fiscal instrument. instrument nonetheless uh there should be questions as to which act should govern the the referendum should it be governed by the feds or should it be governed by the provinces these are all things that need to be talked about at the um government levels at the at the political levels and starting early i mean this</div>

Corey, talk to me about the strategy. I know Horner&#39;s been asking for a while for like this hard number.
