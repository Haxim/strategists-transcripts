We&#39;re actually recording. This is Friday, March 14th. We&#39;re recording while the MPs step into Rideau Hall to get sworn in. The MPs turned cabinet ministers when they walk out. Stephen Carter, some</span>

            <span class="text">some of them already holding positions. Let&#39;s start here. We&#39;re going to do some live reaction, which is going to age perfectly, I think. I think it&#39;s going to age beautifully. And then we&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re also going to talk about some of the bigger topics, kind of like the media right now. We&#39;re going to make our content extremely disposable. To an extent. So let&#39;s start with this. Let&#39;s start with this, Carter.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">he&#39;s going to be sworn in as prime minister today. We&#39;re expecting a smaller cabinet than the Justin Trudeau 30 some odd, I think 36 or 37. Someone correct</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">me if they know. We don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going to be. But by the time everyone hears this, they will know. And so will we. What exactly that cabinet is. But we&#39;re hearing smaller. smaller but carter before we get into smaller and who&#39;s in who&#39;s out which we&#39;ll see on the screen shortly should mark carney even be assembling a cabinet we&#39;re in an acute crisis but also he&#39;s ready to call an election what what&#39;s up here why are we why are we doing this whole formality</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">formality rigmarole when we&#39;re heading to an election anyways because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">because it&#39;s his government and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">excuse me his government requires his personal stamp he needs to put his his people in the forefront, if he doesn&#39;t put his people in the forefront, that it stays Justin Trudeau&#39;s government. And he can&#39;t have that heading into an election. It&#39;s very clear. They&#39;re the same people, though. It&#39;s not all the same people. They&#39;re all going to be in different roles. There&#39;s not all the same people. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, as long as they&#39;re in different roles, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all think</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think it&#39;s different. They&#39;re not all going to be the same people there, Mr. Hogan. I mean, your name was in consideration there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not entirely sure for how long, but at least I brought it up. OK, so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so so your core argument is even if it&#39;s the same recycled Trudeau era people who&#39;ve gotten into office on the Trudeau mandate, one can call it. And if they even if they&#39;ve endorsed Carney in this leadership race, he needs them because this is his stamp, his stamp</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">government. This is the direction. This is him saying, I am going in a different direction. I&#39;m taking a smaller cabinet because I need I need more of my people to be elected in the next election. This is the direction that I&#39;m going. I don&#39;t think he has time for mandate letters, but if he did, he&#39;d be able to set up a real tone of this is how we&#39;re going to change this government. And that is essential. I&#39;m not sure if you guys are following along, but before Justin Trudeau resigned, this was a deeply unpopular government.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And so you need to make change in order to make this actually work.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so Carter&#39;s points have merit, and I more than likely side with him in this case.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But should I? Should I side with Carter? Like, is there, can you give me a compelling reason, perhaps, as to why Carney should not be swearing in a cabinet today? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I look a stiff breeze could knock me over on this particular issue, because I do see some of the merit that Stephen&#39;s talked about, like as a political communications exercise, the reset has some value making the cabinet smaller, more focused</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">focused has some value. But there are real and obvious downsides. The first is what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what they&#39;re not going to do the job like they&#39;re going to have the job for like a week, and then we&#39;re going to be in an election. And is this something we want to be encouraging? And does that really align with Mark Carney&#39;s brand of being like a straight shooting technocrat, right? But the second part is, I think, underlined by Mark Holland&#39;s announcement yesterday, where he said he&#39;s not going to run again. And now he supported Chrystia Freeland in the leadership race.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know that Mark Holland would</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">would ever even with a gun to his head admit it&#39;s because he&#39;s not in cabinet. But I think part of it is probably because he&#39;s not in cabinet. And I think the minute you start making cabinet decisions, people start reacting to cabinet decisions. And that is the challenge here. Some people are going to like the picks, some won&#39;t. They&#39;ll have conversations like we just had. Aren&#39;t these just the same people we didn&#39;t like earlier? Some people will feel upset they&#39;re not in cabinet. Some people will feel upset that the people they wanted to be in cabinet aren&#39;t in cabinet. And so you now have a situation where you&#39;ve</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;ve got something to react to and it&#39;s not all going to be good. Cabinet making is a difficult thing. Disappointment is baked into the game. And there will be disappointed people, both in canada or canada canada more generally and within the uh within the cabinet or</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">canada i prefer canada yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s good it&#39;s like canada india it&#39;s got a good oh yeah it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s like marginally racist it&#39;s like it&#39;s become canada now like there&#39;s just so many of us right uh just like um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s too many of us um okay so carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">actually cory like if you if you&#39;re if you&#39;re a principal here let&#39;s just say you were advising carter he was neutral on the issue sure which</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">which way would you go because you said a stiff breeze could blow you over which way would you and how loud would you be advocating for the position that i&#39;ve maybe almost kind of forced you to take which is the the opposite of carter&#39;s here what would you be advised sure</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sure so i mean first of all i&#39;d say whenever you&#39;re at one of of these split issues if you&#39;re being smart about it what you want to say is okay we see pros we see cons uh how would we mitigate the cons in one scenario how would we mitigate them in the other and you try to get a full honest picture with yourself i like to use a frame of like mitigations and messaging right don&#39;t just tell me we can talk around it if i can tell me what you&#39;re going to do to solve the problem first and then we&#39;ll find the best words when we&#39;ve resolved the problem to the most satisfaction possible but if you told me okay i&#39;d really like you to make the case for not doing it i think i&#39;d say this is all part of a look i don&#39;t think you can not i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think you can here let&#39;s put it this way i think if you want to ask how i mitigate against the downsides of mine which is you say well because the challenge of not doing a cabinet as well is pierre polyev&#39;s gonna say oh this is just trudeau&#39;s old cap same this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is trudeau&#39;s this is literally trudeau&#39;s cabinet right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">well and and we should we should get to that because he&#39;s always one thing we didn&#39;t get to last time was the mendocino interim chief of staff and the lametti transition team stuff because that&#39;s also very trudeau era also trudeau fired era but keep going with your point yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i would say we have less time we have less time to call the election because if you aren&#39;t going to do the cabinet thing then i think you almost you could create a lot of drama and a lot of i&#39;m very different by getting sworn in this morning just you as prime minister and then the The first thing you do, say, thank you, Your Excellency, or whatever you&#39;re supposed to call the governor general. I never remember.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Zane would. Zane should remember. And then handing her. I don&#39;t pledge my allegiance to her. I just. Pledge</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Pledge your allegiance to</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Then hand a piece of paper to her saying, and now I&#39;d like to call the election. Right. So</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Is he prime minister now, Carter? This is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is more Jean Chrétien appearances. We&#39;re getting a lot of Jean content. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, this is a lot of Jean content. And if we if we somehow see Jean Charest, it&#39;s too much Jean content overall. But what the fuck is Jean Chrétien doing so active, Carter? I have no idea. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, excellent. Move on to the question that I asked Corey. How committed would you be to telling your principal, Carney, that he should do what he&#39;s doing today, which is having people in cabinet? And then I want to get to some questions that you can even start answering for me, Carter. If you are committed to him appointing cabinet, which is I suspect where you&#39;re going, how committed is Stephen Carter to ensuring that there&#39;s folks from the outside and or one dark horse crossover pick? And crossover can mean what you want. Crossover we&#39;re partisan crossover from corporate sector anything like that like how much would you be advocating for that today and of course all will be known but as we kind of wait for all to be known how would you be advising carney today on on those two matters well</span>

Because I think that this is his last opportunity to put a stamp on this government that is going to be soaked with Trudeau before the election. Of course it&#39;s soaked with Trudeau. It&#39;s been Trudeau&#39;s for a decade. It would be nearly impossible to remove this government from the Trudeau era completely. But you do get to put a stamp on it. You get to say, this is my new cabinet this is the new direction that we&#39;re going these people aren&#39;t in cabinet these people are in cabinet but they&#39;re in new roles and you get to move past the christian freeland as finance finance minister the</span>
