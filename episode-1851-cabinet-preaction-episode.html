          <p>In what is designed to be the podcast's most evergreen episode ever - the gang convene just before Carney's cabinet is announced to discuss Carney's cabinet.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter wait for people to shuffle into Rideau Hall, and fill the time by discussing the strategy of Carney's cabinet. Why build a cabinet at all? How do you tell a story with your cabinet? Regardless of who ends up in it - who should be in the cabinet? And what insight does the Strategists' intern have on all of the above? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">so so your core argument is even if it&#39;s the same recycled Trudeau era people who&#39;ve gotten into office on the Trudeau mandate, one can call it.

            <div class="said">government. This is the direction. This is him saying, I am going in a different direction. I&#39;m taking a smaller cabinet because I need I need more of my people to be elected in the next election. This is the direction that I&#39;m going. I don&#39;t think he has time for mandate letters, but if he did, he&#39;d be able to set up a real tone of this is how we&#39;re going to change this government. And that is essential. I&#39;m not sure if you guys are following along, but before Justin Trudeau resigned, this was a deeply unpopular government.</div>

And is this something we want to be encouraging? And does that really align with Mark Carney&#39;s brand of being like a straight shooting technocrat, right? But the second part is, I think, underlined by Mark Holland&#39;s announcement yesterday, where he said he&#39;s not going to run again.

And I think the minute you start making cabinet decisions, people start reacting to cabinet decisions. And that is the challenge here. Some people are going to like the picks, some won&#39;t. They&#39;ll have conversations like we just had. Aren&#39;t these just the same people we didn&#39;t like earlier? Some people will feel upset they&#39;re not in cabinet.

How committed would you be to telling your principal, Carney, that he should do what he&#39;s doing today, which is having people in cabinet? And then I want to get to some questions that you can even start answering for me, Carter. If you are committed to him appointing cabinet, which is I suspect where you&#39;re going, how committed is Stephen Carter to ensuring that there&#39;s folks from the outside and or one dark horse crossover pick? And crossover can mean what you want. Crossover we&#39;re partisan crossover from corporate sector anything like that like how much would you be advocating for that today and of course all will be known but as we kind of wait for all to be known how would you be advising carney today on on those two matters well</div>

Because I think that this is his last opportunity to put a stamp on this government that is going to be soaked with Trudeau before the election. Of course it&#39;s soaked with Trudeau. It&#39;s been Trudeau&#39;s for a decade. It would be nearly impossible to remove this government from the Trudeau era completely. But you do get to put a stamp on it.
