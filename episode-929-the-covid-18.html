It&#39;s that Georgia has just decided democracy doesn&#39;t work for the elected officials because the elected officials don&#39;t like the outcome.

Having Mark Carney come and talk about, you know, a plan to grow the economy is pretty smart on that front. Certainly a lot of credibility with the Bay Street crowd. The other thing, of course, they&#39;re going to be talking a lot about, and this has been reported on a few senses, is election readiness, getting ready for whenever this election comes.</span>

So it will be interesting. It will be very interesting to sort of watch their tone and tenor coming out of it and the tone and tenor of the members who are responsible for election readiness and carrying it on. Because you can really kind of create momentum accidentally in these moments, too, in the name of being prepared.</span>

That would be spectacular. Let&#39;s make a call. Let&#39;s make that happen. You know, he&#39;s from Alberta, theoretically. It would be fantastic. He could change the way that we view the election in Alberta for sure. But otherwise, no, I don&#39;t think so. He&#39;s got time. He can nose around the Liberal Party for quite some time before he ever has to announce to lead the Liberal Party. Because I think that&#39;s his end game.

Now, it&#39;s kind of reinforcing because he will never get in the cabinet correcting like this. But yeah, it&#39;s – you&#39;ve got a couple of dangerous elements if you&#39;re Jason Kenney. You&#39;ve got somebody who gives no fucks. You&#39;ve got more people who have gone from private grumbling to public grumbling, and that can start fueling fires. And that means you&#39;re all of a sudden going to have constituency associations weighing in, and presidents of local boards saying, well, maybe it&#39;s now time to trigger a conversation about the leader, because those people are less controllable even than an out-of-control caucus. And these things can kind of explode and get out of your hands in kind of a big way. So yeah, it&#39;s absolutely a revolt.</span>

I&#39;m going to park the Kenny stuff in his response on on regional openings and all that sort of stuff for a second. it. One more question before I jump into strategy for this 17. That&#39;s what I want to do first is I want to I want to I want you guys to do like we used to whiteboard strategy for these 17 how to like make this successful for their agenda. Let&#39;s just make a few assumptions as to what their agenda is. But what does success look like to them? What would you be positioning success for them? How to break free how to break off how to be how to gain maximum leverage within the UCP be Calcas, whatever these options look like to them. But before I do that, I want to talk about two of the names. Allard and Cooper stuck out to me. Cooper because he&#39;s Speaker and because, of course, he had that email to a constituent that he wrote during the Hawaii vacation scandal leaked, and it was pretty scathing about his leader, Jason Kenney, also the Speaker. And then Allard, the former minister. Do those names mean anything to you? Do they signal something to you specifically, or especially, I should say, or do any others. Corey mentioned Drew Barnes. I look at Drew Barnes as a fringe player in many ways, but those two voices I found to be quite interesting. So Carter, maybe I&#39;ll get your take if there is any that you have with those two voices in particular, and then let&#39;s move on to strategy for the 17.</span>

There&#39;s a reason she&#39;s a former minister. And this is it. She couldn&#39;t be counted on. She&#39;s the hell out of there. And she has nothing to lose by going after this. Cooper should be stepping down as the speaker. This is this is ridiculous in my mind. He&#39;s not just an MLA. He is the speaker of the legislature. He should be standing apart from this. He can say whatever he wants to a constituent as an MLA. But as soon as he starts acting as a political minister uh within the party um this to me is stepping outside of his role as the speaker he could offer encouragement he could offer uh you know quiet words that if if this group were to seek party status in the legislature he&#39;d of course recognize them um that would be fine cooper should be stepping down as the as the speaker and</span>

I think that tri-corner hat is cutting off the blood in his head because he is not actually somebody who is supposed to do the things that he is doing here. He is a spokesperson for the House. I&#39;m going to read you verbatim something from the Legislative Assembly website here. Once elected, the Speaker becomes an impartial representative of the whole Assembly and must serve all MLAs equally, regardless of party affiliation. The key characteristics of the Speaker&#39;s role are authority and impartiality. The Assembly grants the Speaker the authority to direct a debate and proceedings, and the Speaker does so without favoring MLAs from one party over those of the other. We all know he&#39;s a UCP MLA, and the role of an MLA is twofold. It is to be somebody who votes in a certain fashion and also to be an ombudsman for services. When you&#39;re a speaker, you give up that voting in a certain fashion rule. You don&#39;t take sides on these things. You&#39;re still an ombudsman for your constituents, but you&#39;re supposed to stay out of the fray.</span>

In the United Kingdom, you resign your party when you become the speaker. We&#39;re not quite there. We&#39;re in a little bit of a different dynamic here. But this is pretty extreme.

But I guess this means that you&#39;re acting in a way that you want them to reelect you. So if you want to get reelected, you better find a way that the premier is going to sign your nomination papers.

I mean, when I ran Alison Redford&#39;s leadership campaign and her 2012 campaign, I had to make a discerned choice. Do I go to the right and go after those right-wing conservatives that say that they are more conservative and more committed to the Conservative Party than anybody else? Or do I move to the left and go after the centrists and the people who are in the center who represent large urban areas? and I made a deserted choice to move to the left because it&#39;s a lot more reasonable over there. You don&#39;t have the wackadoodles that would tie themselves to the, you know, Corey&#39;s point about the power lines. My God, I live that. You know, those guys, you know, the</span>

This is a culture war, and choosing to be, you know, Jason Kenney&#39;s choice to unite the right meant that he brought together these two distinct cultures, and it&#39;s going to be super hard to keep them together in time.</span>

            <span class="text">I wrote an article about this in 2016. The very way that Jason Kenney merged the party was essentially surrendering power to the right, right? He talked about using as a model for this merger what Harper had done when he brought together the old PC party and the Canadian Alliance, and it was just give in to all their demands, just give in to all of them, just get it done. Whatever you need to do to get it done, get it done. But in that case, Harper was surrendering to the center. In Kenny&#39;s case, when he was leader of the PCs trying to merge with the Wild Rose, he was kind of surrendering to the right. Right.</span>

The first one saying, showing more flexibility to regional openings, right? So that&#39;s one of the calls for in this letter, Nathan Cooper saying, we can&#39;t have the same policy for the entire province. Can he showing a bit of soft tissue on that saying, yeah, I could be open to that, right? When we reopen, open there could be you know waves of how we do that uh the second one being this uh stance that if you fuck around i i&#39;ll kick you out of caucus right not not the words but that sentiment and the third one being being leaked here and and slowly being substantiated by some caucus sources saying that kenny was threatening to call a snap election um to to to uh as a way to to boot these these people out now that found its way in the in the media and the social commentary they&#39;re on in but we</span>

And I think they know that. So this is the game of chicken that everybody is playing right now, right? But if you&#39;re Jason Kenney, you&#39;ve got to get your caucus on the same page. You absolutely have to. There needs to be kind of a foundational level setting where everybody feels like, okay, we&#39;re going to get at least the same general acceptance of the facts here. And I kind of have flippantly on twitter today says jested like hey he should offer them a choice they can they can work a shift in an icu in a covid ward or they can fucking leave caucus and you know maybe not literally that but it&#39;s got to be something pretty close like you know it&#39;s got to be drew i need you to understand how serious this is so we&#39;re going to go and we&#39;re going to talk about how serious this is and as part of the showing the reasonable and yes i understand the other side of this all too it&#39;s but let&#39;s also canvas and let&#39;s talk about the pain this is doing to the economy let&#39;s Let&#39;s talk about our other options for the economy.

And he would sometimes, maybe to his credit, but maybe not, almost change his mind or be a bit unreliable himself in how he was going to vote in some of those council settings. And I think as a result, he leaves a council that&#39;s very different. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s more polarized. I think it&#39;s just a council that kind of is</span>
