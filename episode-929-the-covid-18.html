Having Mark Carney come and talk about, you know, a plan to grow the economy is pretty smart on that front. Certainly a lot of credibility with the Bay Street crowd. The other thing, of course, they&#39;re going to be talking a lot about, and this has been reported on a few senses, is election readiness, getting ready for whenever this election comes.</div>

Now, it&#39;s kind of reinforcing because he will never get in the cabinet correcting like this. But yeah, it&#39;s – you&#39;ve got a couple of dangerous elements if you&#39;re Jason Kenney. You&#39;ve got somebody who gives no fucks. You&#39;ve got more people who have gone from private grumbling to public grumbling, and that can start fueling fires. And that means you&#39;re all of a sudden going to have constituency associations weighing in, and presidents of local boards saying, well, maybe it&#39;s now time to trigger a conversation about the leader, because those people are less controllable even than an out-of-control caucus.

That&#39;s what I want to do first is I want to I want to I want you guys to do like we used to whiteboard strategy for these 17 how to like make this successful for their agenda. Let&#39;s just make a few assumptions as to what their agenda is. But what does success look like to them? What would you be positioning success for them? How to break free how to break off how to be how to gain maximum leverage within the UCP be Calcas, whatever these options look like to them. But before I do that, I want to talk about two of the names. Allard and Cooper stuck out to me. Cooper because he&#39;s Speaker and because, of course, he had that email to a constituent that he wrote during the Hawaii vacation scandal leaked, and it was pretty scathing about his leader, Jason Kenney, also the Speaker. And then Allard, the former minister. Do those names mean anything to you? Do they signal something to you specifically, or especially, I should say, or do any others. Corey mentioned Drew Barnes. I look at Drew Barnes as a fringe player in many ways, but those two voices I found to be quite interesting. So Carter, maybe I&#39;ll get your take if there is any that you have with those two voices in particular, and then let&#39;s move on to strategy for the 17.</div>

There&#39;s a reason she&#39;s a former minister. And this is it. She couldn&#39;t be counted on. She&#39;s the hell out of there. And she has nothing to lose by going after this. Cooper should be stepping down as the speaker. This is this is ridiculous in my mind. He&#39;s not just an MLA. He is the speaker of the legislature. He should be standing apart from this. He can say whatever he wants to a constituent as an MLA. But as soon as he starts acting as a political minister uh within the party um this to me is stepping outside of his role as the speaker he could offer encouragement he could offer uh you know quiet words that if if this group were to seek party status in the legislature he&#39;d of course recognize them um that would be fine cooper should be stepping down as the as the speaker and</div>

I think that tri-corner hat is cutting off the blood in his head because he is not actually somebody who is supposed to do the things that he is doing here. He is a spokesperson for the House. I&#39;m going to read you verbatim something from the Legislative Assembly website here. Once elected, the Speaker becomes an impartial representative of the whole Assembly and must serve all MLAs equally, regardless of party affiliation. The key characteristics of the Speaker&#39;s role are authority and impartiality. The Assembly grants the Speaker the authority to direct a debate and proceedings, and the Speaker does so without favoring MLAs from one party over those of the other. We all know he&#39;s a UCP MLA, and the role of an MLA is twofold. It is to be somebody who votes in a certain fashion and also to be an ombudsman for services. When you&#39;re a speaker, you give up that voting in a certain fashion rule. You don&#39;t take sides on these things. You&#39;re still an ombudsman for your constituents, but you&#39;re supposed to stay out of the fray.</div>

The first one saying, showing more flexibility to regional openings, right? So that&#39;s one of the calls for in this letter, Nathan Cooper saying, we can&#39;t have the same policy for the entire province. Can he showing a bit of soft tissue on that saying, yeah, I could be open to that, right? When we reopen, open there could be you know waves of how we do that uh the second one being this uh stance that if you fuck around i i&#39;ll kick you out of caucus right not not the words but that sentiment and the third one being being leaked here and and slowly being substantiated by some caucus sources saying that kenny was threatening to call a snap election um to to to uh as a way to to boot these these people out now that found its way in the in the media and the social commentary they&#39;re on in but we</div>
