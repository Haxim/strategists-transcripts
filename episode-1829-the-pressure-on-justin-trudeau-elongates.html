      <h1>Episode 1829: The pressure on Justin Trudeau elongates</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">October 15, 2024</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>The gang reunite to talk early 20th century literature and reports of Liberal MPs collecting each other's pledges to support leadership change. The odds of Justin Trudeau's leadership surviving October may have dropped, but the odds of podcast adventure have just increased to 100%.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a growing rebel faction within the Liberal caucus, and what each "side" needs to be doing now. How does a Prime Minister's Office deal with reports of rebellion? How do rebels keep momentum? And of all the gifts the magi could bring, is a change in Liberal leadership at this time the most cosmically ironic? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

So that has to be number one. But like 1A for me, because I think storytelling is such an essential component of it, is comms, which, you know, as a comms guy, that&#39;s pretty self-serving. But they need to figure out the story of not just this government, but what a future liberal government would be like, really a future liberal government to a point Stevens made a couple of times here. What do you get? And that story then needs to be driven through everything. And yes, it needs to be driven through the ads. And yes, it needs to be, you know, implemented through all sorts of candidate materials and whatnot. not but if you just had a really crystal clear vision of both strategy and communications i actually think that most of those other pieces would fall away and you wouldn&#39;t have too too much to worry about there in terms of the third position um i</div>

And they, they need to find somebody who can really help them pick up.
