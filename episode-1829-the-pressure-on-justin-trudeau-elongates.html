Meanwhile, at the same time, her husband wants to get his wife something really, really nice. So he gets her a really, really nice hairbrush, but he has to sell his watch in order to get the money to buy her the a hairbrush and the you know the whole story is about like hey it&#39;s it&#39;s the miracle of the season blah blah blah look how much they care for each other they both sacrifice something to get something for the other but ironically here we are now neither of them can use it which i always thought was a bit lame because her hair will grow back you know what i&#39;m saying but that watch is gone that watch is fucking gone so</span>

Is there anything we should be dealing with here? What should we address that they are rightly calling out as a problem? And you do this not out of the goodness of your heart and you don&#39;t obviously do it because you think it makes you seem really strong, but you do it to make sure that they&#39;re not going to find other people that are on the edge who might otherwise then be sympathetic to that. So I actually think we got a pretty good case study of that this weekend with the announcement of the two new national co-directors of the liberal campaign. One of the criticisms was, as</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s that&#39;s horseshit and that&#39;s nonsense but what it was was people taking grievances off the table so when that letter or that oath goes to the next office of the next mp that&#39;s not something they can point to as a legitimate grievance anymore right and so So leaders&#39; offices look around the edges and they say, who&#39;s weak, right? In terms of like support for us, what are their concerns going to be? What are the concerns out there? Is there any legitimacy to this? If you happen to have a list of grievances, that&#39;s great. You just start saying, okay, what can we deal with? What do we want to deal with? What should we deal with? All of those questions.</span>

Any thoughts on that? Because lip service is easy, especially in a remote week where people are all across the country.

So the prime minister, if he&#39;s going to step down, has only one choice, and that is to prorogue. The opposition have only one choice, and that is to get a motion of non-confidence across the goal bull line. Those are the two next plays that we see.

That&#39;s not important. The structure is not important. The title is not important. The roles that the, that the, you know, the position fills is important. I do</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s a problem You should be able to tell what their goal is and how they&#39;re trying to put it together and how they&#39;re positioning themselves. So that has to be number one. But like 1A for me, because I think storytelling is such an essential component of it, is comms, which, you know, as a comms guy, that&#39;s pretty self-serving. But they need to figure out the story of not just this government, but what a future liberal government would be like, really a future liberal government to a point Stevens made a couple of times here. What do you get? And that story then needs to be driven through everything. And yes, it needs to be driven through the ads. And yes, it needs to be, you know, implemented through all sorts of candidate materials and whatnot. not but if you just had a really crystal clear vision of both strategy and communications i actually think that most of those other pieces would fall away and you wouldn&#39;t have too too much to worry about there in terms of the third position um i</span>

They&#39;re getting crushed in the quality of their digital right now. And I think in terms of the various channels that they need to tighten up on, it&#39;s that like, that&#39;s, that&#39;s unconscionable that the conservatives are running 30 circles around them for everyone they managed to do. And they, they need to find somebody who can really help them pick up. I feel like they&#39;re in a different, it&#39;s so funny how quickly this stuff moves because what was cutting edge 10 fucking years ago, if you&#39;re still like, we talked about this the other day, like if you&#39;re still trying to hit those dopamine centers, you&#39;re losing. You&#39;re running a losing path. They seem to be playing a game that went stale 10 years ago.</span>
