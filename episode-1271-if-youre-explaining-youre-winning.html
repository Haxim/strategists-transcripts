          <p>Corey and Zain take over the podcast to dig into Pierre Poilievre's 15-minute housing video. Was it effective communication? Will we see more of this? Doesn't it cut against so much common political advice? Yes, yes and it's complicated. Tune in!</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Look, Pierre Poilievre's video on housing is the talk of the internet. Listen, there's a reason for that. Zain Velji and Corey Hogan discuss the changing nature of political communications and the specifics of a viral housing hit - the case that's made, the resonance it's likely to have with the audience, the Liberal response. Stephen Carter and Annalise Klingbeil don't guest star.</em></p></blockquote>

Now, the only thing the San Pellegrino, which is what you&#39;re drinking, the only way I would buy that argument, Corey, that can would be above plastic bottle, was if it was can with foil on top. Now, what I see you drink there is not can with foil. I see you drink foil-less can, which means dirty top can does not beat out generic plastic bottle, regardless of what&#39;s in it.</div>

            <div class="said">the most patronizing politician we have seen in a long time has come out with a 15-minute Vox explainer-style video that he has posted on his socials. I&#39;m talking about none other than Pierre Polyev. He has a video called Housing Hell. He put it up over the weekend, 9.30 or so in the morning yesterday. On Twitter alone, Corey, 2 million views, another nearly 200,000 on YouTube. I suspect more on on Facebook and other platforms. It&#39;s racking up the views. I&#39;m hearing a lot of conversation about it. It&#39;s something that I haven&#39;t seen in recent memory. So before I want to discuss the substance, maybe we can discuss the form if you&#39;re open to it. And when I say it&#39;s a 15-minute explainer video by Pierre Poliev, I&#39;m not joking. It&#39;s 15 minutes long. It&#39;s voiced over by Pierre Poliev end to end. And he does a Vox-style explainer where there&#39;s highlighters on screen over charts, circling different things, infographics, motion graphics moving across the screen, you know, streams of documents rolling in, b-roll cut, you&#39;ve seen this before. The reason I&#39;m describing it, because I&#39;m trying to, you know, jog your memory, folks, you have seen something like this before.

            <div class="said">Well, what is fascinating about it, and you&#39;re alluding to the US example, I think is a good one, because we&#39;re seeing it all over the place. If you just look at the Republican primary, and it&#39;s not to say that this has just happened in this cycle, right? You and I have used this in our politics, we&#39;ve adopted some of these tactics of owned media without even fully acknowledging that it&#39;s owned media, or like actually, in our strategy or communications documents saying under-owned. But here&#39;s one thing that we&#39;ve all started to do in some ways, which is merchandise on any campaign, right? This ability to, and it used to be merchandise, just used to be like things for the volunteers. But now every campaign that I know, and you&#39;re going to see this, you know, if there&#39;s a NDP leadership race in our province, for example, in Alberta, you&#39;re going to see this happen, right? Merch is going to be part of it. Another way to kind of raise a couple of bucks to brand people, to make them human billboards. uh from merchandise to like having clips that are more like instagram influencer style right leaning into those tactics the the prime example for me is vivek ramaswamy&#39;s people putting together like forbes-like articles about his business success um or you remember him shirtless playing tennis hitting those shots like above his waist baseline like he&#39;s playing pickleball but he you know wants to that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s like a perfect example right</div>

I&#39;d say the Doug Ford PCTV, despite him winning the election, PCTV in that election was like a fucking failure. Like, but because because the premise was, well, we were just going to do the broadcast news. And what they tried to do was do the broadcast news. And I think what they were, what they and others, ourselves included, were almost agnostic of Jersey color left and right were right about is that we were transitioning to owned, but we weren&#39;t transitioning in the same way where it was going to be a copy and paste of what the media role was within the confines of the campaign. So for those that are waiting for that and saying, no, you know, like the media is still very healthy and alive because no one is doing like the six o&#39;clock news or no one is doing the content generation like we are. I think you&#39;re fooling yourselves because it&#39;s happening in a very different way. And it&#39;s already stuck up on you. You&#39;re not waiting for something to happen. It&#39;s here.

Hey, if you do this, maybe they will just wholesale take this if you make it available and run it in a local newspaper, run it in a regional magazine, whatever the case may be.

I guess we would, in many ways. It was. It was, like, clearly partisan. It was about his campaign. We&#39;ll talk about it as a function of a campaign ad, its effectiveness. But if we talk about it from a forum perspective, its effectiveness, one of the reasons I liked it was its novelty.

We could talk about that in a second too. But if they needed their videos up quickly, I could see like the arms race of back and forth political style videos like this using like AI and other things happen quite quickly.

I suspect that one of the possibilities, and once again, I don&#39;t know this, is that there was probably some, potentially some young upstart within the organization that created something like this. And people were like, we love it, like add Pierre&#39;s voice to it. If that were what happened, I could not see, I could see that being quite possible, right? Like, yes, we like something like this, right? And I think what you&#39;re seeing right now from like the tactical side of things, The conservative movement, both in the U.S., but certainly visibly within the Canadian context, seems a lot more entrepreneurial and a lot more experimental with their tactics. So I would not be surprised that the influencer marketing era, this owned media era that we&#39;re seeing, the bleeding edge, at least in the Canadian context, with perhaps some well-treaded tires from the U.S., happened on the PR side. And frankly, we&#39;ve seen it already. ready. Crypto podcasts, walk and talk videos, all these things. I think we&#39;re going to continue to see them push the envelope.

Corey. But regardless, like in some ways, you went through like that populist roller coaster, which is that there&#39;s almost something for everyone. And I wonder, from like an audience perspective, well, two things. And I&#39;ll park the second part, which is how does he get more eyeballs on this? And what should his ad strategy on this product look like? But firstly, for those that are watching this, Corey, I think the objections you had are the objections of, of, and I&#39;m going to say this like without the connotation that it sounds like, of a learned person.</div>

What I think they&#39;re going to pick up on are the small nuggets that do resonate with them, either on the problem or the solution. And they&#39;re not going to be offended by what you were offended by because, frankly, you know what QE is. You and I have an understanding of it, you deeper than me, but you know what it is, right? And I think most people would be like, yeah, okay, it didn&#39;t resonate with me, but it didn&#39;t fundamentally offend me. And I&#39;m wondering if this video in particular fundamentally pushes back against our kitchen sink approach that we talk about in our sort of communications and marketing world that&#39;s saying the kitchen sink doesn&#39;t work. The kitchen sink is bullshit. And just to be clear, what you and I mean by that when we&#39;ve done presentations and when we&#39;ve talked about this is you have targeted, tailored, niche-specific messages. Don&#39;t give them everything because because those are cause for objections that they may not have had in the first place. I want to challenge this video as perhaps being the, not the antidote, but perhaps disproving that, because I&#39;m not sure if people walk through it. They look at some of these other arguments, and they say, you know what, this makes me hate it, because he&#39;s still on the right wavelength, and there&#39;s still a couple of nuggets in there for me, regardless of where you might be on the political spectrum, if at all associated on the political spectrum.

We&#39;d give them high marks for it. You know, maybe TED would even pick it up on their main feed sort of thing, right? But I also want to reconcile that with something we hear in politics all the time. And I want you to explain this to our listeners, right? right? We call this a 15-minute well-done explainer video, right? Because that is frankly the format. But we also say in politics, when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing, reconcile</div>

We talk about the headlines, we talk about, you know getting people to understand that surface level stuff yet we now have a politician who we&#39;re celebrating not celebrating that well let&#39;s just say what it is we&#39;re congratulating for putting out this just you know quasi viral 15 minute explainer video oh i think it&#39;s viral help me understand this yeah</div>

It doesn&#39;t really mean that like an explanation of something means that you&#39;re losing. If somebody naturally supports you and then you&#39;re providing additional proof points and you&#39;re reinforcing, you&#39;re making it stronger and you&#39;re making it more comprehensive, that&#39;s not really the kind of explaining we&#39;re talking about when we say when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing. We&#39;re talking about the expansion of a thesis, right? If that thesis is fundamentally popular, if that thesis stands on its own, if that thesis is we&#39;ve got to do something about housing and everybody agrees, that&#39;s no problem at all. But what he&#39;s done by expanding on this, by explaining, if you want, is he&#39;s reinforced his ownership of this particular issue by building those presentation points that I just talked about, that credibility, relevance, comprehension, and urgency. But the message stands on its own. You don&#39;t actually need to worry about them just hearing the top line. When you say if you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing, you&#39;re usually talking about an issue where if you just hear the top line, it&#39;s a negative for you. You&#39;re going to get fucked. And do you really want to spend all of that time creating the context that would allow that not to be true? That&#39;s the kind of explaining that&#39;s losing. You</div>

            <div class="said">You know, it is so interesting, you know, because I agree with you. I think when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing as a headline has been one of the biggest misnomers and frankly, disservices to our overarching sort of both political strategy and policy, because I think it is always been about when you&#39;re justifying or rationalizing why you do or do not do something, versus people suggesting that it means we&#39;re only dealing in headlines, that this concept of politics and what Nahid would say in full sentences, or Don Ivey, this in here, or others, that that era is over, that if you can&#39;t boil everything down into 15 seconds, that you&#39;re not going to be successful. And we&#39;re seeing here someone who clearly has the 15-second, you know, let&#39;s rattle out the 15 seconds, right? Freest country on earth, gatekeepers, right? Like, everything feels broken. We got that. We got that packaged. And now we get the 15-minute. And this reminds me, in the absence of our hedonistic friend, Stephen Carter, his 330-330, he&#39;d bring up, right? Like his concept of the 3 second, 30 second, 3 minute, 30 minute. And Polyev is kind of playing that instrument very fine-tuning right now, I would say.</div>

But this is one of the reasons why, you know, when you refer to like the lens that you view things through, right, these congressional trips that we hear about, congressmen taking to Israel fully paid for, right, whether there&#39;s an active war or not. I mean, the purpose is fundamentally to view a very complicated, extremely nuanced situation through a lens that is palatable to you, that makes you understand, and that in its most subtlest ways increases your support or your level of vocalization for a particular issue, in that case being Israel. And in this case, you know, the job that this video does is even if you look at the problem and dissect it, Corey, there are partisan angles to how the problem is even defined. The first seven minutes of that video, as I call it, the roughly, right? It&#39;s not like the problem is purely defined with the purest, academic, most comprehensive, everything on the table. Let&#39;s make sure, you know, all the I&#39;s are dotted and the T&#39;s are crossed. No, it is a partisan definition of a problem. And even if you acknowledge that, it&#39;s hard to not fundamentally lean on that as a crutch every now and then, even without you knowing, because you have ingested. And I think there&#39;s huge, like, even if you watch the first seven minutes, which this is all leading to me asking you about what his ad strategy should be. So I&#39;m getting to a point in a second. But even if you watch the first seven minutes of it, or the first couple of minutes of it, the definition of the problem on his terms is helpful in its own right.

            <div class="said">I have a question for you. So this video, I think, highlights another one of Piers Polyev&#39;s, like, skills as an orator. And we&#39;ve seen, like, you know, fundamentally pretty good orators across our times, like politicians, like, you know, I&#39;ve worked with Nahed, I think he was an outstanding orator. We&#39;ve seen folks like Tom Mulcair, we&#39;ve seen, you know, on the provincial level, Jason Kenney, I think was a fantastic orator. Great orator. Pierre Poliev, talented orator.</div>
          </div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">We know that. But we also, we sometimes view oration as like a one dimensional sort of like thing, that they&#39;re just good at doing it. But there&#39;s some different columns, I would argue. And I think today, we kind of realized if we have it, and I think the walk and talk videos gave us an understanding as well, that he&#39;s actually a pretty good explainer of things. He can take complex things, yes, at a partisan lens, but give you a easy-to-understand, base-level, nod-your-head-style agreement to what he&#39;s saying. And that&#39;s a skill. It&#39;s a very specific skill of oration. We&#39;ve also seen Pierre Polyev be like this oratory prick, right? He can be, like, fast-witted. He can, like, sometimes get himself in trouble, right? Right. We may even want to talk about how this video this week might be a channel changer to the troubles, quote unquote, he had last week, despite his poll numbers going up. And when I referred to, you know, some of his comments regarding carbon tax in the UK, as well as, you know, some some run ins with journalists. But I&#39;ll park that aside.</div>

            <div class="said">I&#39;m kind of wondering the reason I&#39;m kind of mentioning this is that when we see orders in our political age, they&#39;ve almost been defined for one thing. Tom Mulcair, fiery in the House of Commons, didn&#39;t really have an explainer vibe to him. Right. right? Nahid Nenshi, excellent, like, you know, no notes, he could speak any single time. I think Jason Kenney, similarly, right? No notes could captivate a room, like, everyone in that room is like, man, I wish this was scalable, right? I&#39;m persuaded. What should Pierre-Paul Lievre sort of like oratory lane be, Corey? This is what I&#39;m ultimately trying to get to. Should it be that Bill Clinton-esque, like, explainer-in-chief with what we&#39;ve witnessed here? Should he stick to the kind of like, you know, prickly, witty, let me be charitable, the witty, fast-witted, like, you know, like, sort of fire-breathing style person, like, I&#39;m kind of trying to reconcile all of this as he picks his brand on rhetoric. He&#39;s got this amazing talent, and I&#39;m wondering if he needs to hone it in in some way, rather than just let it loose on each of these lanes all the time, where to the point they&#39;re not able to be contained, and people are more confused by who he is than actually fully appreciative of this guy&#39;s immense skill. Does that make sense even as a fundamental question?</div>

Now, when the two start to seem like they&#39;re two totally different people, he&#39;s got a bit of a problem here. But I don&#39;t think at their core, they need to be two entirely different people.

Would he just be better with a more focused sort of perspective? I think it&#39;s kind of, I wonder if that conversation is actively happening, right? Like within his party, being like, you&#39;ve got this skill. In fact, there might be too much skill. And then this sounds like too many compliments for Pierre, but I think this is perhaps what they&#39;re saying, right? Like, dude, we may want to actually strategically think about this, right? Like where your value, your oratory value is best placed, knowing that attention is fundamentally limited.</div>

It doesn&#39;t go as hard on Trudeau as his rhetoric has in the house, in other videos, etc. It doesn&#39;t mock Trudeau in that same way, so others might disagree. But to me, in my interpretation, I think all of that&#39;s deliberate, because I think their core goal, strategically, Corey, is shares. Shares and persuasion. Watch watch this, buy the problem in the way we&#39;re selling, buy the solution we are selling. And with that in mind, if you agree with it, how sticky do you think something like this is in terms of warming people up? Kind of like how those ads with his wife doing a VO for him as he was walking in the park with these kids was meant to kind of soften folks up on his image. I think this also has a persuasion element in it as it relates to shareability. Talk me through that that in terms of how sticky you think something like this could be to the overall sort of Polyev brand? Or do you think it&#39;s like a one and done 15 minute or hey, he did a good job on this file, but it actually doesn&#39;t make me feel anything about him?</div>

            <div class="said">But there is something to be said about, like, the fact that, like, this is an extension of Pierre on its own, right? And, like, the reason we&#39;re celebrating this is because of Pierre at the center of it, not just fundamentally the nutritional value of it. And I think the real sort of marker, as I try to work this out for myself, of success here is oration, content and nutritional value, not entirely, you know, partisan, so to speak, at its core in like an attack ad way, but still like, you know, done in a way that allows people to make it shareable and hedge. And I think a hedge for people is wins, right? Like it&#39;s for Paulie Evan team, as they keep people on side, or they kind of build new supporters saying, maybe I should be listening to some of the stuff he&#39;s talking about beyond this. Or maybe I should be considering him for some of my support. court</div>

            <div class="said">well and this is this is part of why this was such a if i suspect they&#39;re going to do more of these because success results in people doing things to the point where it just gets run into the ground and this is going to be is already seems like a success to your point about the views and all of that but this is such an interesting entry point for a lot of people right like even if you hate pierre polyev&#39;s uh position on 30 other issues you might actually have a bit of like no okay maybe he&#39;s got a point on this one and i suspect you&#39;re going to see that the next couple of videos are going to kind of just incrementally walk you down that road so this</div>
