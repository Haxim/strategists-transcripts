            <span class="text">i&#39;m Let some traditions remain constant. By the way, just so you know, I have bottled drinks here, which means life is going really well for me. I don&#39;t have to do the whole can thing that you&#39;re doing. That&#39;s weird. Are cans a sign of poorness? That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to discuss.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I always thought- Cans are amazing. No, no, no, no. Here&#39;s the thing. When you have someone over, okay, Corey, here&#39;s the thing. When you have someone over, okay, removing alcohol from the equation, okay, for a second.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Do you feel more classy giving them a canned drink or a bottled drink?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Okay. I think can classier than plastic bottle, glass bottle classier than can. You</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right. The ordering is no, no, no. Cans at the bottom, plastic bottles in the middle, glass bottles at the top. I think we agree on glass bottle. Let&#39;s remove that from the equation. Oh,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">glass bottle. Okay. And regardless of what&#39;s in it. It&#39;s nice.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Okay. So glass bottle is fine. Yeah, we can find some common ground. That&#39;s great. I fundamentally disagree with you. Now, the only thing the San Pellegrino, which is what you&#39;re drinking, the only way I would buy that argument, Corey, that can would be above plastic bottle, was if it was can with foil on top. Now, what I see you drink there is not can with foil. I see you drink foil-less can, which means dirty top can does not beat out generic plastic bottle, regardless of what&#39;s in it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I got to tell you. Yeah. The aluminum can is one of the great marvels of the modern world. It&#39;s very good, very recyclable. We should all be using cans all of the time. Forget these bottles, this plastic nonsense. Get with the times, folks. Cans, they&#39;re back. You heard it here first. That was</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Why do you think they have the aluminum top on those cans? Seriously, serious question. as a marketer do you think it&#39;s like pure marketing no</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">i&#39;m going to take the other side i think it&#39;s pure marketing cool uh that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing uh cory let&#39;s let&#39;s move it on to our first and our only topic uh our first and only topic the gatekeeper gap uh folks if you&#39;re tuning in this is a a combination that you haven&#39;t heard before which is cory hogan</span>

            <span class="text">Neither do I. But this, now knowing Carter&#39;s at his hedonism camp for a while, and he may not be joining us, Corey, I think it&#39;s finally time that we give the listeners what they haven&#39;t asked for, which is the long-awaited Corey Hogan Look, Listen podcast. Can you give some folks some background on what this is, and why we haven&#39;t gotten it off the ground up until now?</span>

            <span class="text">me tell you what this is going to be folks okay cory um as you may know might be um the self-described big brain of the podcast uh often uses the words look and listen uh sometimes in an educational but largely in a condescending tone um to to both his fellow panelists alongside you the listener and we wanted to formalize that with this being the first episode of cory hogan look look, and listen. We want to discuss one topic where Corey will look and listen and lecture us about why certain things happen in certain ways. And Corey, we&#39;ve got the perfect topic to dive into because just this weekend, today being December 3rd— Oh, somebody even</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">even more patronizing than me. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, arguably, you&#39;re a patronizing twin, which, by the way, to complete the circle, this is a Patreon episode. And thank you for patronizing at Patrons. Corey, the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the most patronizing politician we have seen in a long time has come out with a 15-minute Vox explainer-style video that he has posted on his socials. I&#39;m talking about none other than Pierre Polyev. He has a video called Housing Hell. He put it up over the weekend, 9.30 or so in the morning yesterday. On Twitter alone, Corey, 2 million views, another nearly 200,000 on YouTube. I suspect more on on Facebook and other platforms. It&#39;s racking up the views. I&#39;m hearing a lot of conversation about it. It&#39;s something that I haven&#39;t seen in recent memory. So before I want to discuss the substance, maybe we can discuss the form if you&#39;re open to it. And when I say it&#39;s a 15-minute explainer video by Pierre Poliev, I&#39;m not joking. It&#39;s 15 minutes long. It&#39;s voiced over by Pierre Poliev end to end. And he does a Vox-style explainer where there&#39;s highlighters on screen over charts, circling different things, infographics, motion graphics moving across the screen, you know, streams of documents rolling in, b-roll cut, you&#39;ve seen this before. The reason I&#39;m describing it, because I&#39;m trying to, you know, jog your memory, folks, you have seen something like this before. And if you haven&#39;t seen this video, you have seen this format, you have seen this type of video. Corey, let&#39;s</span>

I can&#39;t recall it but i also also haven&#39;t racked my brain deeply to see if someone has but i may have mused that that politicians should do something like this but i haven&#39;t have you well</span>

You are more than free to use French in a committee of parliament. And so it became a thing. It became a big thing. But you&#39;re right. The entire reason that Rachel Thomas was doing this was to chase what we all assume the social clip. Right. The clip of her asking the tough question and getting the unsatisfactory answer.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s super interesting. Like that changes everything, you know, that owned has become so primary. Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, what is fascinating about it, and you&#39;re alluding to the US example, I think is a good one, because we&#39;re seeing it all over the place. If you just look at the Republican primary, and it&#39;s not to say that this has just happened in this cycle, right? You and I have used this in our politics, we&#39;ve adopted some of these tactics of owned media without even fully acknowledging that it&#39;s owned media, or like actually, in our strategy or communications documents saying under-owned. But here&#39;s one thing that we&#39;ve all started to do in some ways, which is merchandise on any campaign, right? This ability to, and it used to be merchandise, just used to be like things for the volunteers. But now every campaign that I know, and you&#39;re going to see this, you know, if there&#39;s a NDP leadership race in our province, for example, in Alberta, you&#39;re going to see this happen, right? Merch is going to be part of it. Another way to kind of raise a couple of bucks to brand people, to make them human billboards. uh from merchandise to like having clips that are more like instagram influencer style right leaning into those tactics the the prime example for me is vivek ramaswamy&#39;s people putting together like forbes-like articles about his business success um or you remember him shirtless playing tennis hitting those shots like above his waist baseline like he&#39;s playing pickleball but he you know wants to that&#39;s i mean that&#39;s that&#39;s like a perfect example right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right like that is the perfect example because can i tell you in 2012 in alberta um there was a there was a photo op that we arranged where it was raj sherman going for a jog he was leader of the liberal party at the time going for a jog with me actually with his campaign manager and it was just a clip of him jogging you know with me and um and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and that ran in the newspaper right but nowadays newspapers don&#39;t send photographers to that kind of shit they&#39;re not doing that soft stuff and it&#39;s just being done through owned channels right so you try to present this image of yourself through this controlled environment that you have so much control over it&#39;s very you know it&#39;s very kind of broken but you know owned has its challenges and i think one of the things as we talk about this shift from earned to owned is that in some ways that is intrinsically tied to this super partisan world that we now live in now right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right because you&#39;re seeing just one side of things all of the time and that&#39;s a really great way to drum up your base get them really militant get them to hate the other guy get them to donate even but it also means you&#39;re less likely to access other voters and we used to do this back in our day in hill and olton you&#39;ll remember we</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">randomized surveys essentially where you would get a message a picture and it from a voice we&#39;ve talked a bit about this before right because we we knew for some people some voices would be more receptive they&#39;d be more receptive to them than others and so you test one voice you see if they&#39;re receptive you same the same message with a different voice how does that change how they deal with it now</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It is interesting and like maybe not to wrap up like the broader sort of the strokes of the conversation around this transition of owned media. But one of the things that I think we have learned and acknowledged is that, you know, you talk back to our Hill and Olten days, which were about a decade ago, I would say at this point, and we knew this trend of owned was, frankly, it happened in some ways, and it was going to happen more. This conversation of the overarching</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">overarching decline of the media, as we&#39;ve heard, has been going on for a long time. I think one thing we have learned, and I&#39;m curious to hear if you share this opinion of mine is that we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">we thought own to like the earned to own cycle would be like taking what earned media did broadcast television taking articles and reproducing them but with like a small logo at the bottom with your candidates name so you could fool people that it was just like your broadcast or it was your article right remember like we thought that was going to be the future that we were just going to replicate broadcast news in fact i&#39;d say there&#39;s been like luke lukewarm successful, if not entirely failed political experiments. I&#39;d say the Doug Ford PCTV, despite him winning the election, PCTV in that election was like a fucking failure. Like, but because because the premise was, well, we were just going to do the broadcast news. And what they tried to do was do the broadcast news. And I think what they were, what they and others, ourselves included, were almost agnostic of Jersey color left and right were right about is that we were transitioning to owned, but we weren&#39;t transitioning in the same way where it was going to be a copy and paste of what the media role was within the confines of the campaign. So for those that are waiting for that and saying, no, you know, like the media is still very healthy and alive because no one is doing like the six o&#39;clock news or no one is doing the content generation like we are. I think you&#39;re fooling yourselves because it&#39;s happening in a very different way. And it&#39;s already stuck up on you. You&#39;re not waiting for something to happen. It&#39;s here. If you&#39;re still in that in that camp would be kind of something I&#39;d posit to. I mean, I completely</span>

            <span class="text">completely agree. Yeah, I could not agree more. And it&#39;s funny, because I think back to those days, and you&#39;re right, like, and we talked about it as content marketing back</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">look i&#39;ll just say the name it was for ge right and it was like they were spending a fortune on content marketing with one of these i was there yeah yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and um and it it said literally nothing about ge until like the last sentence like all you know maybe that&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration but it was essentially just a news story yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then in like the most subtle ways it tried to embed ge in the most minimalist sense possible because the thinking was well because that you know we don&#39;t want it to feel overly partisan we don&#39;t want it to feel overly salesy so we&#39;ve got to make it feel like news and that was kind of the theory at the time and part of the theory was Because everyone knew media was in decline, traditional media. Hey, if you do this, maybe they will just wholesale take this if you make it available and run it in a local newspaper, run it in a regional magazine, whatever the case may be. And I think that was, with the benefit of hindsight, kind of a dumb idea because we saw that media was dying, but then we built all of our content to go into the dying media. We</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">thought that they would still be there despite dying, and that just isn&#39;t the case. Now we&#39;re seeing those outlets drop left, right, and center. But, yeah, like, we would have been embarrassed to do some of kind of the shameless owned media that now is just normal, done, because the norms of the time had been set by print and digital and broadcast and all of that. That&#39;s right.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right. Like, you&#39;re right. Not just the form, but the norms. I think that&#39;s so important because we were just simply looking to say who was going to take over the form and like – but the norms of like – of treating this with a light touch, of trying to just walk this fine line and persuade. So at the end of someone watching the 20 minutes, they&#39;d been marginally persuaded rather than hit by a hammer, which this video, which we&#39;ll get to, right? In many ways is, right? Like, literally, the reason you didn&#39;t want to watch it is you knew, not just you knew what was going to be said, but you knew the lack of subtlety around it. You knew it was going to be a 15-minute, like, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you know, this is the only, this is God&#39;s truth. It was going to be told to you in that way. So to get back to the question then, you don&#39;t recall something like this happening. I guess let&#39;s stick on form still before we get to content, because why not, Corey? We&#39;ve been able to burn 20 minutes this way.</span>

            <span class="text">Do you actually like this? Parking aside that it was pure polyev and that I told you to watch it because I wanted to talk about it today, as a political practitioner, when you watched it, did you actually say, you know what? Impressive. I like this. I see the strategic value of it or not. I&#39;m fundamentally and genuinely curious.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So I did, and I thought it was really well done. And I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get into it with more specificity in terms of the arguments and the nature and all of this. But there&#39;s a really big asterisk on that. Part of what I liked about it was the novelty. I think if one of these was coming every month, even, they would lose their novelty very, very quickly. People would be far less interested. fuck frankly it&#39;d be like vox you know vox does not get the eyeballs i don&#39;t believe it certainly doesn&#39;t have the cultural resonance that it did many years ago because everybody has started doing the same explainer type videos and it&#39;s become kind of diluted and cliche and all of that and</span>

            <span class="text">you know i i could open up a can of worms but fuck it why not um before we even get to what&#39;s in the video uh one of the i i agree with you completely i was also i also enjoyed it i also liked it um you know it it was we talk about these campaign ads and i i don&#39;t know if you you would call this a campaign ad. I guess we would, in many ways. It was. It was, like, clearly partisan. It was about his campaign. We&#39;ll talk about it as a function of a campaign ad, its effectiveness. But if we talk about it from a forum perspective, its effectiveness, one of the reasons I liked it was its novelty. But one of the things that was just in the back of my mind, and I&#39;m not suggesting that this is what he did, but I do know, and I think you know better than I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">easily with ai and i the ai conversation was just stuck in my head the whole time i&#39;m like serious right like to me like just how they made this and to me it&#39;s like one of the things that i could see this format or videos like this especially for entering this like video age where like you know let&#39;s say the liberals realized that you know for example tweeting out your budget which is what christopher freeland did in response to this video is not a great idea, right? We could talk about that in a second too. But if they needed their videos up quickly, I could see like the arms race of back and forth political style videos like this using like AI and other things happen quite quickly. I know I&#39;m opening up a can of worms that&#39;s deviating us from the subject matter, but I&#39;m curious if you have any thoughts on that or if that just like went through your head as you thought about both novelty and form before we get into, yes, well, the substance.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I didn&#39;t think about AI, but i would say at one point i was kind of thinking like how much did it cost to make this like either in time or money or like what do we think they invested in this particular thing yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and i don&#39;t know the answer to that but i sort of concluded just as i was watching it and probably not as much time as you might think in part because of the ubiquity of this particular format now like the number of you know themes you can download and filters and all of that that go into to adobe premiere um to create those vox effects they&#39;re they&#39;re ubiquitous and they cost like 50 bucks a pop if you want to go over to like any number of sites that sells them and yeah it still takes somebody who&#39;s got an eye for these things and a touch and a sense of the rhythm and the beat but uh yeah go um you know go to audio jungle and put in final fantasy music and you&#39;re gonna get the soundtrack that well</span>

            <span class="text">right it&#39;s not that hard you&#39;re You&#39;re absolutely right about templates. And I also say like, you know, often we give lessons on here. I suspect that one of the possibilities, and once again, I don&#39;t know this, is that there was probably some, potentially some young upstart within the organization that created something like this. And people were like, we love it, like add Pierre&#39;s voice to it. If that were what happened, I could not see, I could see that being quite possible, right? Like, yes, we like something like this, right? And I think what you&#39;re seeing right now from like the tactical side of things, The conservative movement, both in the U.S., but certainly visibly within the Canadian context, seems a lot more entrepreneurial and a lot more experimental with their tactics. So I would not be surprised that the influencer marketing era, this owned media era that we&#39;re seeing, the bleeding edge, at least in the Canadian context, with perhaps some well-treaded tires from the U.S., happened on the PR side. And frankly, we&#39;ve seen it already. ready. Crypto podcasts, walk and talk videos, all these things. I think we&#39;re going to continue to see them push the envelope. Let&#39;s talk about its substance, Corey. Let&#39;s talk about the actual substance of it, right? 15 minutes long, not an exaggeration, split almost evenly as problem solution, deep dive on the problem, kind of like we do, deep dive on the solution, hyper-partisan on both. Tell me what you thought when you consumed it for the first time.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ve said this before in a lot of different contexts. I think this is the problem right now. Like a whole generation is feeling closed out where we&#39;ve moved to a place where somebody making an average wage cannot afford an average home.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and ultimately political upheaval. And he&#39;s riding a bit of that wave right now. like when you look at where conservatives are polling with younger demographics relative to where they usually do i mean there&#39;s there&#39;s a reason here right people are now thinking that what their parents had is entirely out of reach for them and so as</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as i sit there and i think about the problem i think yeah absolutely this is the problem this is the problem we&#39;ve got to fix this particular thing and you know then there&#39;s a bit of a turn and all of a sudden it&#39;s saying and And this is because of Trudeau. This started in 2015 as basically the – no, it didn&#39;t. No, it fucking didn&#39;t. Like if you want to run the charts back and set different years, you know, you could probably say 2000. And you can definitely see this problem growing, although not at the rate of the last few years throughout the 21st century here. And so he sort of lost me on that. His kind of almost conspiratorial take on what quantitative easing was. was he&#39;s like well if it&#39;s a crazy sounding word and you don&#39;t know what it is you can bet you&#39;re being screwed or something yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">oh you know government spending created that inflation not didn&#39;t you know our spending is not higher than the other countries that you earlier talked about not having this housing problem that we have okay uh the idea that interest rates are causing this well not really i mean sort of not really obviously your mortgage payment&#39;s gone up that&#39;s going to be part of your affordability if you own a home right now but uh it&#39;s not entirely what the situation is and again it&#39;s not different from other countries it&#39;s lower in fact than many of the other countries that we&#39;re comparing to they don&#39;t have this housing problem so he sort of lost me for a few minutes there but then he got me back on when he was talking about the dangers of financialization of housing and our totally insufficient rate of building and then he lost me you know when he talked about government added costs and then he got me back when he was talking about parking and you you it was a bit of a trip at the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">where we&#39;re things that that you know like when you add so much content as a populist and you may not say he&#39;s a populist and we could talk about that but like some of it&#39;s going to resonate to you to me too right like as a progressive who&#39;s kind of been on this file quote unquote especially on the on the in the lower income and housing precarity and homelessness yeah as soon as financialization i&#39;m like fucking finally someone talking about financialization Which, by the way, like, you know, is a, I shouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a darling of the left, but it&#39;s like the progressive left across both our countries have been pushing financialization for a decade now. It effectively means like these large corporate entities, investors controlling this lot of housing, jacking up rental rates, etc. Like, that&#39;s a very simple, if simplified, and frankly, poor explanation. Yeah, simple.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s not that bad. It&#39;s pretty accurate. Like, I mean, the reality is the minute you put the profit motive in, you&#39;re going to change things.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">things. This is the root of where the housing is a human right mantra comes in and all these other things where people are talking about housing should not be investments, capitalism and housing, these sort of cultural conversations that folks may have dipped into or found themselves in the middle of, depending on their Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner conversation, Corey. Corey. But regardless, like in some ways, you went through like that populist roller coaster, which is that there&#39;s almost something for everyone. And I wonder, from like an audience perspective, well, two things. And I&#39;ll park the second part, which is how does he get more eyeballs on this? And what should his ad strategy on this product look like? But firstly, for those that are watching this, Corey, I think the objections you had are the objections of, of, and I&#39;m going to say this like without the connotation that it sounds like, of a learned person.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to have the objections. What I think they&#39;re going to pick up on are the small nuggets that do resonate with them, either on the problem or the solution. And they&#39;re not going to be offended by what you were offended by because, frankly, you know what QE is. You and I have an understanding of it, you deeper than me, but you know what it is, right? And I think most people would be like, yeah, okay, it didn&#39;t resonate with me, but it didn&#39;t fundamentally offend me. And I&#39;m wondering if this video in particular fundamentally pushes back against our kitchen sink approach that we talk about in our sort of communications and marketing world that&#39;s saying the kitchen sink doesn&#39;t work. The kitchen sink is bullshit. And just to be clear, what you and I mean by that when we&#39;ve done presentations and when we&#39;ve talked about this is you have targeted, tailored, niche-specific messages. Don&#39;t give them everything because because those are cause for objections that they may not have had in the first place. I want to challenge this video as perhaps being the, not the antidote, but perhaps disproving that, because I&#39;m not sure if people walk through it. They look at some of these other arguments, and they say, you know what, this makes me hate it, because he&#39;s still on the right wavelength, and there&#39;s still a couple of nuggets in there for me, regardless of where you might be on the political spectrum, if at all associated on the political spectrum. What do you think of that thesis well</span>

We&#39;d give them high marks for it. You know, maybe TED would even pick it up on their main feed sort of thing, right? But I also want to reconcile that with something we hear in politics all the time. And I want you to explain this to our listeners, right? right? We call this a 15-minute well-done explainer video, right? Because that is frankly the format. But we also say in politics, when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing, reconcile</span>

We talk about the headlines, we talk about, you know getting people to understand that surface level stuff yet we now have a politician who we&#39;re celebrating not celebrating that well let&#39;s just say what it is we&#39;re congratulating for putting out this just you know quasi viral 15 minute explainer video oh i think it&#39;s viral help me understand this yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well we say when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing but really what we mean is when you&#39;re justifying you&#39;re losing right like when you&#39;re saying this action is not something you would support without additional context and therefore let me provide you that additional context and let me use the time that I have to give you that context, that&#39;s what we mean by when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing. It doesn&#39;t really mean that like an explanation of something means that you&#39;re losing. If somebody naturally supports you and then you&#39;re providing additional proof points and you&#39;re reinforcing, you&#39;re making it stronger and you&#39;re making it more comprehensive, that&#39;s not really the kind of explaining we&#39;re talking about when we say when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing. We&#39;re talking about the expansion of a thesis, right? If that thesis is fundamentally popular, if that thesis stands on its own, if that thesis is we&#39;ve got to do something about housing and everybody agrees, that&#39;s no problem at all. But what he&#39;s done by expanding on this, by explaining, if you want, is he&#39;s reinforced his ownership of this particular issue by building those presentation points that I just talked about, that credibility, relevance, comprehension, and urgency. But the message stands on its own. You don&#39;t actually need to worry about them just hearing the top line. When you say if you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing, you&#39;re usually talking about an issue where if you just hear the top line, it&#39;s a negative for you. You&#39;re going to get fucked. And do you really want to spend all of that time creating the context that would allow that not to be true? That&#39;s the kind of explaining that&#39;s losing. You</span>

            <span class="text">You know, it is so interesting, you know, because I agree with you. I think when you&#39;re explaining you&#39;re losing as a headline has been one of the biggest misnomers and frankly, disservices to our overarching sort of both political strategy and policy, because I think it is always been about when you&#39;re justifying or rationalizing why you do or do not do something, versus people suggesting that it means we&#39;re only dealing in headlines, that this concept of politics and what Nahid would say in full sentences, or Don Ivey, this in here, or others, that that era is over, that if you can&#39;t boil everything down into 15 seconds, that you&#39;re not going to be successful. And we&#39;re seeing here someone who clearly has the 15-second, you know, let&#39;s rattle out the 15 seconds, right? Freest country on earth, gatekeepers, right? Like, everything feels broken. We got that. We got that packaged. And now we get the 15-minute. And this reminds me, in the absence of our hedonistic friend, Stephen Carter, his 330-330, he&#39;d bring up, right? Like his concept of the 3 second, 30 second, 3 minute, 30 minute. And Polyev is kind of playing that instrument very fine-tuning right now, I would say.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">for all of those levels, ideally, right? Like, if you&#39;re only going to have time to do one, you want to have the good 15 second one, because most people will only be at that level, and politics is a volume game. But if you can fill it all out, If you can have the 15-second version, if you can have the 15-minute version, and if you can have every version in between, that&#39;s very powerful, because that allows you to sort of meet the expectations of everybody along the way. And I&#39;ll tell you something, as much as we were just talking about the media&#39;s declining relevance here, you know, the fact is, there&#39;s going to be a lot of media who watch that 15 minutes and have now, whether</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, listen, not to bring in politically sensitive things, but when does that stop me? But this is one of the reasons why, you know, when you refer to like the lens that you view things through, right, these congressional trips that we hear about, congressmen taking to Israel fully paid for, right, whether there&#39;s an active war or not. I mean, the purpose is fundamentally to view a very complicated, extremely nuanced situation through a lens that is palatable to you, that makes you understand, and that in its most subtlest ways increases your support or your level of vocalization for a particular issue, in that case being Israel. And in this case, you know, the job that this video does is even if you look at the problem and dissect it, Corey, there are partisan angles to how the problem is even defined. The first seven minutes of that video, as I call it, the roughly, right? It&#39;s not like the problem is purely defined with the purest, academic, most comprehensive, everything on the table. Let&#39;s make sure, you know, all the I&#39;s are dotted and the T&#39;s are crossed. No, it is a partisan definition of a problem. And even if you acknowledge that, it&#39;s hard to not fundamentally lean on that as a crutch every now and then, even without you knowing, because you have ingested. And I think there&#39;s huge, like, even if you watch the first seven minutes, which this is all leading to me asking you about what his ad strategy should be. So I&#39;m getting to a point in a second. But even if you watch the first seven minutes of it, or the first couple of minutes of it, the definition of the problem on his terms is helpful in its own right. Even if you are complete bullshitty and saying everything on the back end is bullshit, I&#39;m not buying it.</span>

            <span class="text">I have a question for you. So this video, I think, highlights another one of Piers Polyev&#39;s, like, skills as an orator. And we&#39;ve seen, like, you know, fundamentally pretty good orators across our times, like politicians, like, you know, I&#39;ve worked with Nahed, I think he was an outstanding orator. We&#39;ve seen folks like Tom Mulcair, we&#39;ve seen, you know, on the provincial level, Jason Kenney, I think was a fantastic orator. Great orator. Pierre Poliev, talented orator.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We know that. But we also, we sometimes view oration as like a one dimensional sort of like thing, that they&#39;re just good at doing it. But there&#39;s some different columns, I would argue. And I think today, we kind of realized if we have it, and I think the walk and talk videos gave us an understanding as well, that he&#39;s actually a pretty good explainer of things. He can take complex things, yes, at a partisan lens, but give you a easy-to-understand, base-level, nod-your-head-style agreement to what he&#39;s saying. And that&#39;s a skill. It&#39;s a very specific skill of oration. We&#39;ve also seen Pierre Polyev be like this oratory prick, right? He can be, like, fast-witted. He can, like, sometimes get himself in trouble, right? Right. We may even want to talk about how this video this week might be a channel changer to the troubles, quote unquote, he had last week, despite his poll numbers going up. And when I referred to, you know, some of his comments regarding carbon tax in the UK, as well as, you know, some some run ins with journalists. But I&#39;ll park that aside.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m kind of wondering the reason I&#39;m kind of mentioning this is that when we see orders in our political age, they&#39;ve almost been defined for one thing. Tom Mulcair, fiery in the House of Commons, didn&#39;t really have an explainer vibe to him. Right. right? Nahid Nenshi, excellent, like, you know, no notes, he could speak any single time. I think Jason Kenney, similarly, right? No notes could captivate a room, like, everyone in that room is like, man, I wish this was scalable, right? I&#39;m persuaded. What should Pierre-Paul Lievre sort of like oratory lane be, Corey? This is what I&#39;m ultimately trying to get to. Should it be that Bill Clinton-esque, like, explainer-in-chief with what we&#39;ve witnessed here? Should he stick to the kind of like, you know, prickly, witty, let me be charitable, the witty, fast-witted, like, you know, like, sort of fire-breathing style person, like, I&#39;m kind of trying to reconcile all of this as he picks his brand on rhetoric. He&#39;s got this amazing talent, and I&#39;m wondering if he needs to hone it in in some way, rather than just let it loose on each of these lanes all the time, where to the point they&#39;re not able to be contained, and people are more confused by who he is than actually fully appreciative of this guy&#39;s immense skill. Does that make sense even as a fundamental question?</span>

I mean, I don&#39;t, I think we have talked about how Pierre Polyev sometimes falls into prick mode when he has spent so much time trying to be somebody else here, right? And that&#39;s an interesting challenge that he has. I&#39;m not sure that, well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but that&#39;s not what being a good political order is a good political order does require that kind of action that next step and there are a lot of different ways you can do that there are a lot of different tools in the toolbox and some people are just going to be innately better with some than others right um again</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and credibility. And there are lots of ways to do that. There&#39;s not one way to do that. Pierre Polyev has shown that he has a lot of ways to do that. Like he is a two-way player here. He can be that prick and he can also be that explainer. Now, when the two start to seem like they&#39;re two totally different people, he&#39;s got a bit of a problem here. But I don&#39;t think at their core, they need to be two entirely different people. He&#39;s going to have to sort of watch himself on all of these things here but but yeah i mean part of his challenge this this kind of schizophrenia that he sometimes induces here is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">it yeah okay i mean i&#39;m curious like i&#39;m i&#39;m and it&#39;s a question i grapple with like because i think it does add a bit of depth like quite literally in some ways like you know adding a 15 minute video to your stack is like is depth in some ways to be able to walk people through this this certain level of content shows a different muscle but like as it relates to the guy who who fires out headlines and and is building this certain momentum. Would he just be better with a more focused sort of perspective? I think it&#39;s kind of, I wonder if that conversation is actively happening, right? Like within his party, being like, you&#39;ve got this skill. In fact, there might be too much skill. And then this sounds like too many compliments for Pierre, but I think this is perhaps what they&#39;re saying, right? Like, dude, we may want to actually strategically think about this, right? Like where your value, your oratory value is best placed, knowing that attention is fundamentally limited.</span>

And the order probably was, let&#39;s just make it however long it needs to be. We don&#39;t need to shave it down to 15 perfect. It was 15.09, and if that&#39;s what it needs to be, it&#39;s fucking it&#39;s 15.09. That&#39;s what came out on the end. And I think there&#39;s something actually, like, as simple as that is, there&#39;s something very incisive about that in its own right.</span>

And lucky for them, they&#39;ve still got a couple of years to the election. Their best hope is to actually resolve the problem or get to a point of stalemate where the other, you know, other person&#39;s solution, I&#39;m putting solution in air quotes here it&#39;s just not something that they can run on very much either and all they&#39;re going to have left is the liberals did the thing i wanted to do which is actually not a particularly compelling message for anybody right so maybe</span>

            <span class="text">while it is partisan, as we we fully acknowledged, both in the problem and quote-unquote solutions. It doesn&#39;t go as hard on Trudeau as his rhetoric has in the house, in other videos, etc. It doesn&#39;t mock Trudeau in that same way, so others might disagree. But to me, in my interpretation, I think all of that&#39;s deliberate, because I think their core goal, strategically, Corey, is shares. Shares and persuasion. Watch watch this, buy the problem in the way we&#39;re selling, buy the solution we are selling. And with that in mind, if you agree with it, how sticky do you think something like this is in terms of warming people up? Kind of like how those ads with his wife doing a VO for him as he was walking in the park with these kids was meant to kind of soften folks up on his image. I think this also has a persuasion element in it as it relates to shareability. Talk me through that that in terms of how sticky you think something like this could be to the overall sort of Polyev brand? Or do you think it&#39;s like a one and done 15 minute or hey, he did a good job on this file, but it actually doesn&#39;t make me feel anything about him?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">actually explained things where people could say oh i didn&#39;t know some of these these things i&#39;m going to share them out there right two is it&#39;s you know it&#39;s partisan attacks don&#39;t come until about that seven minute mark at least in any kind of substantive way there there are a few things early on with trudeau&#39;s head bobbing around at the 2015 as</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as it&#39;s shooting up but by and large the the heavy partisanship comes later and so most people i won&#39;t say most like a lot of people are going to make the decision to share based on the first couple of minutes they might not even get through all of the video right away they might share it later they might just they&#39;re going to feel safer sharing it because it doesn&#39;t necessarily feel like sharing a political attack ad because the political attack ad comes later and it&#39;s embedded and it&#39;s in between a couple of different components it&#39;s somewhat buried almost like when you&#39;re writing a uh you know a paper in high school and you put your weakest argument in the middle right they put the political attack in the middle so</span>

            <span class="text">yeah exactly and so not by by kind of posting something that is like long form politics and sentences as you&#39;ve said complete sentences makes them look like a thoughtful political operator says oh this i don&#39;t always agree with pierre poliev but he made some interesting i</span>

I think there&#39;s going to be a lot of, I mean, I don&#39;t like everything Pierre Polyev does, but this is hard to refute, or this is a really good,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">because of part one, two, and three of what you just mentioned around nutritional value, political arguments, political hackery, or partisanship, or attacks being buried in the middle.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think that they have a good sense of what makes something shareable, too i mean by and large you have to be sort of impressed with the craft of this right both the craft from like a understanding of the medium and a craft from the understanding of presentations and communications it&#39;s um you know it&#39;s going to make people pull their hair out and it&#39;s going to make a lot of liberal partisans who are listening to this really mad at us for kind of giving props where props i&#39;m</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">because it includes some progressive things in it. Exact same fucking video. We would not be talking about it in the same way. There is a halo effect we are applying to this, that, you know, maybe the hour, six minute mark is not the best time to address it. Maybe minute two would have been, but fuck it. Like, as we kind of, like, by the way, that&#39;s comma, but, comma, fuck it. Not, you know, okay,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But there is something to be said about, like, the fact that, like, this is an extension of Pierre on its own, right? And, like, the reason we&#39;re celebrating this is because of Pierre at the center of it, not just fundamentally the nutritional value of it. And I think the real sort of marker, as I try to work this out for myself, of success here is oration, content and nutritional value, not entirely, you know, partisan, so to speak, at its core in like an attack ad way, but still like, you know, done in a way that allows people to make it shareable and hedge. And I think a hedge for people is wins, right? Like it&#39;s for Paulie Evan team, as they keep people on side, or they kind of build new supporters saying, maybe I should be listening to some of the stuff he&#39;s talking about beyond this. Or maybe I should be considering him for some of my support. court</span>

            <span class="text">well and this is this is part of why this was such a if i suspect they&#39;re going to do more of these because success results in people doing things to the point where it just gets run into the ground and this is going to be is already seems like a success to your point about the views and all of that but this is such an interesting entry point for a lot of people right like even if you hate pierre polyev&#39;s uh position on 30 other issues you might actually have a bit of like no okay maybe he&#39;s got a point on this one and i suspect you&#39;re going to see that the next couple of videos are going to kind of just incrementally walk you down that road so this</span>
