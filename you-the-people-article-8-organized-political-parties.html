            <span class="text">The state of the states in the battle to be president of the United States is in a state of confusion. Let&#39;s look at this state by state. In Wisconsin, Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin holds a 5 to 12 point lead over her Republican challenger, but Trump is winning over Biden. In Michigan, Democratic Senate candidate Alyssa Slotkin has a 3 point lead over her Republican challenger. But Trump is</span>

            <span class="text">In Pennsylvania, Democratic Senator Bob Casey holds an eight-point lead over his Republican challenger. But Trump is winning over Biden. In Nevada, Democratic Senator Jackie Rosen has a 10-point lead over her Republican challenger. But Trump is winning over Biden. In Arizona, Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego has a three to a 13-point lead over his Republican candidate, but Trump is winning over Biden. Even in Ohio, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has a five-point lead over his Republican challenger, but Trump is winning over Biden.</span>

            <span class="text">Democrats killing it in the Senate race, Biden getting killed for president. Does this matter? Yes. If Biden won the states that Democrats are dominating for the Senate race, he would gain 304 electoral votes. But if convicted felon Donald Trump continues to hold his lead over Biden, he would get 312 electoral votes. What&#39;s at the core of this polling? Do we actually expect Biden to be behind Senate candidates in these swing states by 5 to 10 points? How can Team Biden shift the electorate so that they shift the Democratic ticket from the top to the bottom?</span>

Like, he&#39;s got to be popular in some places to be even nationwide. Like, that&#39;s just the nature of this game. Because he is down a shit ton in Pennsylvania. He&#39;s down a shit ton in Ohio, right? Right? Like, those are really, like, it&#39;s not questionable. Is Joe Biden going to win Ohio? Joe Biden&#39;s going to lose Ohio.

You make the messaging generic, you make it all anti-Trump, you don&#39;t put Joe Biden out anywhere, and just hope like hell? Like, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great strategy, but what would you recommend to them at the moment? I</span>

It&#39;s not going to be Ohio. So then it&#39;s it&#39;s down to Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And Michigan is too close. But any one of those other four or any three of those other four could carry Biden across the finish line. They have to do something, in my opinion. And ideally, all four of them would work together to make sure that Joe Biden gets five percent, half of their lead over the next over the next few months. And that would become not just that would become my campaign goal. I&#39;m not just going to win this election. I&#39;m going to help Joe Biden win this election.
