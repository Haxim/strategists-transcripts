          <p>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan dig into the big gaps opening up between Joe Biden's polling and the polling of Democratic Senate candidates - whether it can be trusted and whether the Senate candidates should distance themselves from Joe Biden or drag him over the finish line. Pennsylvania guest stars as a Presidential "home" state with straight-ticket voting.</p>

If Biden won the states that Democrats are dominating for the Senate race, he would gain 304 electoral votes. But if convicted felon Donald Trump continues to hold his lead over Biden, he would get 312 electoral votes. What&#39;s at the core of this polling? Do we actually expect Biden to be behind Senate candidates in these swing states by 5 to 10 points? How can Team Biden shift the electorate so that they shift the Democratic ticket from the top to the bottom?</div>

It&#39;s not going to be Ohio. So then it&#39;s it&#39;s down to Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. And Michigan is too close.
