          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the launch of Election 2021. How good (or bad) were the campaign launches? Based on Day One, what kind of problems and opportunities might the parties face? And is Corey the only one worried about Justin Trudeau's hair? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

I want to try to make this a little bit more organized than our free flowing conversations. conversations. I&#39;m going to go with each of the party leaders, and I&#39;m going to try to talk about optics, message, and strategy, pluses, minuses, where they need work from what you&#39;ve seen in the first day. When I say optics, I mean, how did that first day look for you? Of course, Justin Trudeau has the incumbent advantage, being able to go from Rideau Cottage to Rideau Hall, being able to have that staged background that no one else can. But I want to compare it to everyone else on optics and what you saw there. I want to talk about message. Each of the leaders is trying to do what we&#39;ve called multiple times, lodge a ballot box question into the mind of the electorate. I want to talk about that. And then I want to round it out to say, based on what you saw and what you heard, what are you kind of feeling about their strategy thus far? Are there holes in it? Is there weaknesses? Is there strengths? Is there swim lanes that they&#39;ve have created for themselves that they should just now just bomb down i want to know what your your thoughts are and so let&#39;s try to do this in a bit of an organized way i know it&#39;ll still be utter chaos but you know stephen carter if you can try to follow the rules that would be nice uh for once let&#39;s start with justin trudeau carter and let me let me let me put optics and message together and and and i&#39;ve got a few bullets under here that i want to hit on but give me your general sense of what you saw with justin trudeau uh and for those that didn&#39;t the the imagery was was Rito Cottage to Rito Hall with the family. Maybe comment on the optics there, and then we can get started on a little bit of the message. From your perspective, what do you think of Justin Trudeau,</div>

And there&#39;s a few things under message that I found interesting, too. Carter&#39;s point was one of them. But we always talk about the staging of these things. I talked about the incumbent advantage that Trudeau had, obviously being prime minister, of being able to have that family walk in the official process and being first and being covered. What did you make of the optics? Carter, I think, gives it a pass. Carter, if I can paraphrase, and says it was expected. Was there anything interesting to you, Corey, about the optics that you saw today?</div>

And he kept just trying to pivot back to, oh, this is really important. We&#39;re talking about the future of the country. But there was not like an obvious, so what? Why are we doing this? And I think I think that&#39;s not necessarily fatal, but of both Trudeau and O&#39;Toole, there was something about their speeches where you looked at and you said, oh, that&#39;s going to be a problem.

Let me talk about the other part of it, which was he didn&#39;t really emphasize the fact that this was not about a parliament that had lost confidence. Of course, that&#39;s kind of what he had to probably say to the GG. But his phrasing was that we want to give Canadians, you, the opportunity to vote on the direction of the recovery. We&#39;ve been through a pandemic. In 2019, when we got elected, no one gave us the mandate to do the shit we&#39;re about to do. And Canadians should be able to weigh in on what the next stage of this country looks like. What did you make of that response? I want to get Corey&#39;s reaction to it, too, but I&#39;ll go to you first, Carter. What did you make of that phrasing of turning it into Canadians, less so about the confidence of Parliament, more so we&#39;re making big decisions and we want you to weigh in on them just to make sure you&#39;ve got the confidence in the direction we&#39;ve outlined?</div>

And more importantly, he doesn&#39;t fucking need it, because look at how effective we&#39;ve been working with him, so to speak. But to that point that Carter made, that I know he made tongue-in-cheek in a drive-by fashion, if the questions today had buckets, there was three of them. Number one, Carter mentioned earlier, which was, hey, if you don&#39;t get your majority, are you going to resign? Number two was, why the fuck are we here? And number three was Afghanistan. And Corey, another election, you texted this to us earlier today, another election and another refugee crisis. We had one in 2015. And now we are clearly in the middle of one here. What do you make of this as the government goes into caretaker mode, that Justin Trudeau could have an escalating human rights and refugee crisis on his hands during the middle of his sprint election?</div>

But the optics, obviously fundamentally different. I like your point about the Prime Minister having maybe incumbent advantage, sure, but also the incumbent box. Aaron O&#39;Toole didn&#39;t have a box, but he still chose a form of a box, so to speak, a virtual speech on a blue background with the party slogan or the campaign slogan, securing the future behind him. What did you make of the optics that O&#39;Toole chose for what I&#39;d not just call his launch, but I think it&#39;d be safe to say was, you know, the start of his introduction to Canadians?</div>

I think in some ways, he was almost hearkening back to that. Intentionally or not, it&#39;s the model that&#39;s been set and it&#39;s the model that he was following for a COVID election. He effectively said, this is a COVID election. That&#39;s what he wanted to do on day one. Whether he continues that, I&#39;m doubtful. I have a hard time believing he&#39;s going to be in his headquarters there the entire bloody time. But so that was his intention. And it tied to that message of the day.

I mean, he&#39;s hardly saying, you know, live free, go do do whatever the hell you want, right? He&#39;s just taking a stance that is slightly less than Justin Trudeau, but much more than what the government of Canada was contemplating, and much more than any provincial government has contemplated before yesterday,</div>

So why would you constantly remind people of COVID? He did what we thought he would do, which is he started the campaign by saying we shouldn&#39;t be having this right now because of COVID. And then he pivoted to other messages, other parts of his message, because he wants to put those chips on there. If things go bad, he wants to be able to point people back to it and say, I told you so. But he does not want to spend the next 35 days talking about COVID-19 and looking like he&#39;s hiding from COVID-19. The parallel, of course, again, is Joe Biden. That</div>

In addition to why the hell are we here? O&#39;Toole was getting some tough questions. He was being grilled. Corey&#39;s nuance on COVID was one of the lanes. Adding to that nuance was was staff being vaccinated. So if you wanted to be around O&#39;Toole, you had to get a vaccine. Of course, people being very quick to point out the irony in that is related to the fact that that was not O&#39;Toole&#39;s policy for his candidates, for the general public, so to speak, or for the federal workers. What do you make of O&#39;Toole being boxed in on vaccines?

You would vaccinate yourself against everything because anything you get, the leader&#39;s going to get. And we&#39;ve seen it in virtually every campaign. The leaders get sick because, you know, a bug goes around. The bug this time is COVID, and of course it makes sense. But it&#39;s hypocritical because the protection that you want is not a protection that you&#39;re willing to ask for for Canadians. So it&#39;s a bit of a problem. I&#39;ll be honest, both campaigns underwhelmed me today. I&#39;m not super stoked with Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s launch. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for him to be playing in the basement.

The rules are different for the broader public service and all of the considerations that come in there, not least of which are the Charter of Rights and Freedoms considerations.

We&#39;ve talked about we&#39;ve talked about that. We talked about everything you liked during the pandemic. We&#39;re the ones who bumped up the wage subsidy from a paltry percentage to what it was. We&#39;re the ones who did the rent assistance that was not specific to landlords, but those renting. Do you feel like that Jagmeet Singh&#39;s entire campaign can be waged on this sort of lane of saying what you like about them, we can do better and keep within the – you can&#39;t trust them to keep this going. You can trust us to keep it going or should he just lead into the fact that, fuck it, I am actually like a catalyst and I&#39;m going for the minority position?

If both of you were working for Jagmeet Singh, Corey, let&#39;s start with you first. Does he need paper? Does he need proof? What does he need to showcase that I&#39;m actually the one that got this stuff done for you? Or is this just about repeat, repeat, repeat, and just hope that it penetrates?

You&#39;re going to need to come up with stories that the media want to cover because right now, I just went through the Twitter feeds, looking at Singh NDP versus the CPC or the Liberals. The Liberals got a gajillion times more coverage. The CPC got a gajillion times more coverage. You know, Singh did well. Well, he got he got coverage. I remember when we were working with Joe Clark back in 2000 and we couldn&#39;t you know, we were fifth place in the news and we were sad. We were happy when we got to third place. If we could figure out a day where we could be in third place in the news cycle, then we were doing our job. And that&#39;s what the NDP needs to figure out is how are we going to get the second place in the news? How are we? Because if I can be second in the news, second in the Twitterverse, second on social media, then maybe I can be second in this election. And second in this election has a very high, you know, Corey said their ceiling is as high as anybody&#39;s. If he can get the second, then he can get the first.

It&#39;s one of the things that happens. Pundits and pollsters, political scientists, they&#39;ll try and figure something out around it. But right now, it doesn&#39;t matter at all. What matters is how strong the campaigns are and how much they&#39;re resonating with Canadians.</div>

You know, maybe they were going to vote for a third party, but now that it&#39;s serious, now it&#39;s an election, they&#39;ll come in and that tightens up the polls. But on top of that, the parties triangulate, and they&#39;re doing their jobs, and they&#39;re looking for accessible voters, and they start to hoover them up. And then all of a sudden, you&#39;re in a situation where things are a little bit tighter. So overrated. Underrated, however, because that tightening, Well, it might just be baked into the nature of politics. It matters a lot. You may find yourself in a situation where all of a sudden the liberals aren&#39;t just not looking at a majority, but might very much be in doubt whether they win an election. So both.</div>
