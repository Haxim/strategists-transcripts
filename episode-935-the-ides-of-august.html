            <span class="text">there was a bunch of people trying to rationalize it based on an article in The Guardian that says that these really crappy memes really appeal to boomers.

This was just something on a different stream that was about trying to elevate this issue, maybe playing with some of these concepts. Let&#39;s give the most modest charity to the organization here. I don&#39;t want to give a ton because it was obviously a breakdown of systems or oversight or more than likely both because there&#39;s no way.</span>

            <span class="text">How does something like that get on the schedule? It was wild. But let&#39;s just say, let&#39;s unpack a bit the dumb ad theory, which The Guardian talked about and I want to expand on it. Do it, do it, do it. Which is when you&#39;re engaging with a piece of content like this, you&#39;re engaging good, you&#39;re engaging bad, you&#39;re still providing data back to people. And we&#39;ve talked about this in different contexts. I think I&#39;ve said, when you get those texts from political parties saying, hey, this is Erica from the CPC. Do you support the conservatives?</span>

            <span class="text">If you are, say, a liberal or a New Democrat and you don&#39;t, your reaction might be to just send back curse words. But that&#39;s useful data for them. That tells them that you are strongly opposed and they can use that both in their modeling, because they probably have other demographics about you and they can understand more about, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But also it tells them not to waste any time communicating with you, which allows them and more expensive media down the road to make strategic buys, right? So at the</span>

            <span class="text">the time, I said, you know, if you really want to screw with them, say, yeah, absolutely. I mean, you will get a bunch of phone calls from fundraisers and things like that. But that hurts them more than you say no, okay? Now, the dumb ad theory is this. You put an ad out like that, and if people love it, when</span>

            <span class="text">all common sense and they will just say, I support content like this. And that&#39;s useful for purposes of fundraising, for volunteering, you know, drawing all of those people in. And similarly, everybody who throws absolute hate on it allows you to build out your models like I just described. Now, problem</span>

If all of a sudden you&#39;ve got Brad Wall on a hostile list because he fucking hated your video your model&#39;s not very good but the theory if you want to unpack it a bit more comes from the era of scammers not even telemarketers but outright scammers and that is that as much as we look at those emails from the nigerian prince or or any of the equivalent ones and we say that is so insane who would possibly fall for that that&#39;s the point they make the first step the most outlandish so they don&#39;t waste time down the road losing people down yeah right because if you you buy in at that crazy story, you&#39;ll accept anything, anything</span>

Was it the meme? Was it the execution? Was it the fact that it looked like a jib jab video? What about it was like, if, for example, if the editing had been better, would you have liked it more? Or was it just the majority message? Tell me if it was all of the above or none of the above that That just made it such a crappy message for what I&#39;d call a pre-launch video because it wasn&#39;t their launch.</span>

They went after that and, you know, does this man look like a leader? And all of a sudden that becomes the, you know, it was just over the line. This had over the line on it as well, but it also had this kind of inherent sexism. uh there was the underlying meme of it right you know justin trudeau i mean it was the opening segment right um justin trudeau is a whiny little girl that was the at the at the at the crux of the complaint at the crux of the criticism that was the point justin trudeau is a gendered negative and in today&#39;s</span>

And he&#39;s brought a lot of that flavor into the Republican Party.

I want to try to make this a little bit more organized than our free flowing conversations. conversations. I&#39;m going to go with each of the party leaders, and I&#39;m going to try to talk about optics, message, and strategy, pluses, minuses, where they need work from what you&#39;ve seen in the first day. When I say optics, I mean, how did that first day look for you? Of course, Justin Trudeau has the incumbent advantage, being able to go from Rideau Cottage to Rideau Hall, being able to have that staged background that no one else can. But I want to compare it to everyone else on optics and what you saw there. I want to talk about message. Each of the leaders is trying to do what we&#39;ve called multiple times, lodge a ballot box question into the mind of the electorate. I want to talk about that. And then I want to round it out to say, based on what you saw and what you heard, what are you kind of feeling about their strategy thus far? Are there holes in it? Is there weaknesses? Is there strengths? Is there swim lanes that they&#39;ve have created for themselves that they should just now just bomb down i want to know what your your thoughts are and so let&#39;s try to do this in a bit of an organized way i know it&#39;ll still be utter chaos but you know stephen carter if you can try to follow the rules that would be nice uh for once let&#39;s start with justin trudeau carter and let me let me let me put optics and message together and and and i&#39;ve got a few bullets under here that i want to hit on but give me your general sense of what you saw with justin trudeau uh and for those that didn&#39;t the the imagery was was Rito Cottage to Rito Hall with the family. Maybe comment on the optics there, and then we can get started on a little bit of the message. From your perspective, what do you think of Justin Trudeau,</span>

And so that sort of fell through in the messaging. And while I thought that his words were fine, and he said a nice tone in his speech, the minute it came to the questions, it all kind of fell apart for him, because he couldn&#39;t answer those questions. And he kept just trying to pivot back to, oh, this is really important. We&#39;re talking about the future of the country. But there was not like an obvious, so what? Why are we doing this? And I think I think that&#39;s not necessarily fatal, but of both Trudeau and O&#39;Toole, there was something about their speeches where you looked at and you said, oh, that&#39;s going to be a problem. They better clean it up pretty quickly. And for Trudeau, it&#39;s that this is still the Seinfeld election.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, what did you make of Trudeau&#39;s rationale? So Corey gave one part of it. Let me talk about the other part of it, which was he didn&#39;t really emphasize the fact that this was not about a parliament that had lost confidence. Of course, that&#39;s kind of what he had to probably say to the GG. But his phrasing was that we want to give Canadians, you, the opportunity to vote on the direction of the recovery. We&#39;ve been through a pandemic. In 2019, when we got elected, no one gave us the mandate to do the shit we&#39;re about to do. And Canadians should be able to weigh in on what the next stage of this country looks like. What did you make of that response? I want to get Corey&#39;s reaction to it, too, but I&#39;ll go to you first, Carter. What did you make of that phrasing of turning it into Canadians, less so about the confidence of Parliament, more so we&#39;re making big decisions and we want you to weigh in on them just to make sure you&#39;ve got the confidence in the direction we&#39;ve outlined?</span>

And ultimately, he is just riding so bloody high right now. If the criticism everyone has is you&#39;re being an opportunist, everybody wants to vote for you. That&#39;s why you called an election. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s actually the worst place in the world. We can talk about the base cynicism about it. We can talk about whether Canadians should reward this because in the long term, it&#39;s quite damaging if politicians are willing to yank our chains like this. But Trudeau had a fine day. He had a fine launch. It&#39;s not something that we&#39;re going to put in the history books as a greatest launch ever, but it was a fine launch. Carter,</span>

And more importantly, he doesn&#39;t fucking need it, because look at how effective we&#39;ve been working with him, so to speak. But to that point that Carter made, that I know he made tongue-in-cheek in a drive-by fashion, if the questions today had buckets, there was three of them. Number one, Carter mentioned earlier, which was, hey, if you don&#39;t get your majority, are you going to resign? Number two was, why the fuck are we here? And number three was Afghanistan. And Corey, another election, you texted this to us earlier today, another election and another refugee crisis. We had one in 2015. And now we are clearly in the middle of one here. What do you make of this as the government goes into caretaker mode, that Justin Trudeau could have an escalating human rights and refugee crisis on his hands during the middle of his sprint election?</span>

But the optics, obviously fundamentally different. I like your point about the Prime Minister having maybe incumbent advantage, sure, but also the incumbent box. Aaron O&#39;Toole didn&#39;t have a box, but he still chose a form of a box, so to speak, a virtual speech on a blue background with the party slogan or the campaign slogan, securing the future behind him. What did you make of the optics that O&#39;Toole chose for what I&#39;d not just call his launch, but I think it&#39;d be safe to say was, you know, the start of his introduction to Canadians?</span>

            <span class="text">imagery that was so well established by the American campaign and Joe Biden, and you know how he had those things on a daily basis with Kamala Harris at the Delaware headquarters? I think in some ways, he was almost hearkening back to that. Intentionally or not, it&#39;s the model that&#39;s been set and it&#39;s the model that he was following for a COVID election. He effectively said, this is a COVID election. That&#39;s what he wanted to do on day one. Whether he continues that, I&#39;m doubtful. I have a hard time believing he&#39;s going to be in his headquarters there the entire bloody time. But so that was his intention. And it tied to that message of the day. It tied to him saying, hey, look, this is really important. Now, one of the interesting things, and I didn&#39;t talk about it with the liberals, but the liberals and the conservatives have the opposite problem. And right now, Aaron O&#39;Toole is the one who&#39;s being hit on it, right? Which is, hey,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he struggled with that question a bit, to be sure. Although I think in some ways, perhaps he got a little bit too much abuse on it because his position was not a wild one. It was you get a vaccine or you take a daily COVID test. I mean, he&#39;s hardly saying, you know, live free, go do do whatever the hell you want, right? He&#39;s just taking a stance that is slightly less than Justin Trudeau, but much more than what the government of Canada was contemplating, and much more than any provincial government has contemplated before yesterday,</span>

And you saw that in a lot of the meta-analysis about him. He&#39;s in an interesting situation because canadians really don&#39;t know him i was struck by a poll uh andrew ends for lege he was talking about he says data shows probably close to 50 of canadians couldn&#39;t name who the leader of the conservative party was interesting for two reasons one is that&#39;s obviously a big chunk of people that he can then introduce himself to and create a positive impression with so he&#39;s got to be very careful in those first steps we talked about that last Well, on Thursday, I guess.

            <span class="text">it was a little bit of a rough ride at the start. And a lot of it had to do with the vaccination question and mandatory vaccines. It does seem to be a pretty good wedge for Justin Trudeau for the reasons we&#39;ve talked about on this pod.</span>

It&#39;s one that says, hey, in a liberal democracy, just because the majority want to do something doesn&#39;t mean we impose it on the minority. We have, you know, the right to life, liberty, and the security of person. And that means we can&#39;t force medical treatment upon you. And so here&#39;s a version of that that actually satisfies that, that says, okay, if you don&#39;t want to get this vaccine, we are still protected as a public service or as airline</span>

There&#39;s conservatives you usually think of as having the really blunt, overly simple messaging. He&#39;s got the nuanced messaging on vaccines, and he doesn&#39;t quite know what to do with it, and the media doesn&#39;t know what to do with him. And</span>

I shouldn&#39;t say act with a negative connotation, so I&#39;m going to behave as if we are in said COVID election. What did you make of those optics?

And then he pivoted to other messages, other parts of his message, because he wants to put those chips on there. If things go bad, he wants to be able to point people back to it and say, I told you so.

Because to me, the optics overrode even the pivot message today, because the first thing I go to is, O&#39;Toole was in front of a blue screen. Why was O&#39;Toole in front of a blue screen?

In addition to why the hell are we here? O&#39;Toole was getting some tough questions. He was being grilled. Corey&#39;s nuance on COVID was one of the lanes. Adding to that nuance was was staff being vaccinated. So if you wanted to be around O&#39;Toole, you had to get a vaccine. Of course, people being very quick to point out the irony in that is related to the fact that that was not O&#39;Toole&#39;s policy for his candidates, for the general public, so to speak, or for the federal workers. What do you make of O&#39;Toole being boxed in on vaccines? Do you feel like what he&#39;s his responses and the lane he&#39;s picked is strategic or do you feel like once again i hate to keep using this term he&#39;s he&#39;s kind of squared into a position that he&#39;s now going to have to spend time to try to get out of i</span>

You would vaccinate yourself against everything because anything you get, the leader&#39;s going to get. And we&#39;ve seen it in virtually every campaign. The leaders get sick because, you know, a bug goes around. The bug this time is COVID, and of course it makes sense. But it&#39;s hypocritical because the protection that you want is not a protection that you&#39;re willing to ask for for Canadians. So it&#39;s a bit of a problem. I&#39;ll be honest, both campaigns underwhelmed me today. I&#39;m not super stoked with Aaron O&#39;Toole&#39;s launch. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for him to be playing in the basement.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, yeah, again, it is that nuanced thing, right? It is that multi-layered cake, because there are lots of things governments can&#39;t do that private orgs can. Lots, lots of things that we let political parties do, We would never let governments do. The rules are different for the broader public service and all of the considerations that come in there, not least of which are the Charter of Rights and Freedoms considerations. But you can kind of set all of them aside because there&#39;s actually a very practical reason why everybody in his campaign around him needs to be vaccinated. And that is if you are not in some provinces, there are quarantine requirements. And how do you run a federal campaign if you can&#39;t do that? So, you</span>

I&#39;ll ask the same question to you. What&#39;s your strategy roundup for O&#39;Toole on day one, on launch day? What did he do well? What did he not? What do we kind of need to consider to recalibrate after day one? And where do we see holes or where do we see opportunity?</span>

And so you&#39;ve got to very quickly find a very clear way that you can describe your policy positions in a way that doesn&#39;t take you four sentences to do it when it comes to vaccines. vaccines and given the the mood and the attitude around vaccines uh maybe it&#39;s something as simple as saying uh it&#39;s it&#39;s a vax mandatory vaccine or test right like just just super simple like that like justin trudeau wants just mandatory vaccine i&#39;m saying vaccine or test and then maybe pointing people to some of the situations that they can&#39;t really argue with like you know there are there</span>

But again, as little time as possible, and you&#39;ve just got to find a really tight sound bite on why your position is actually just as good and very reasonable. But move on, right? You&#39;ve got to find a way to pivot off this vaccine issue much faster than you have if today is any indication here, because that central tension will otherwise drown you.

Carter, outdoor events, socially distant, urban setting, give it to me, top line on optics and message, and then let&#39;s dig down a bit more on the lane that Jagmeet Singh is trying to own in this election.

Should he have been more specific on the specific policies? Yes, absolutely, Stephen. But there&#39;s time for that. And this message was a pretty nice bridge out from the COVID message.

Like one of the things he&#39;s introduced and is talking about as part of his key messaging was taxing the super rich. Right. And I&#39;m sure that messaging and polling was very popular. We&#39;ve talked about we&#39;ve talked about that. We talked about everything you liked during the pandemic. We&#39;re the ones who bumped up the wage subsidy from a paltry percentage to what it was. We&#39;re the ones who did the rent assistance that was not specific to landlords, but those renting. Do you feel like that Jagmeet Singh&#39;s entire campaign can be waged on this sort of lane of saying what you like about them, we can do better and keep within the – you can&#39;t trust them to keep this going. You can trust us to keep it going or should he just lead into the fact that, fuck it, I am actually like a catalyst and I&#39;m going for the minority position? Or does he try to own the lane of like we want to be government here? You see what I&#39;m trying to say? Like there&#39;s a balance that they have to strike. I do. I absolutely</span>

Corey, you called it paper, right? The proof points Jagmeet Singh has to say, I&#39;m legitimately the one that kept this guy, i.e. Trudeau, in check, that ensured that the policies he enacted during the pandemic helped people and not just businesses. is. If both of you were working for Jagmeet Singh, Corey, let&#39;s start with you first. Does he need paper? Does he need proof? What does he need to showcase that I&#39;m actually the one that got this stuff done for you? Or is this just about repeat, repeat, repeat, and just hope that it penetrates? Or what would you kind of suggest strategically to Team Singh, if you&#39;re on that team, around how we kind of make that real or ensure that it feels more real than perhaps just the words?</span>

You&#39;re going to need to come up with stories that the media want to cover because right now, I just went through the Twitter feeds, looking at Singh NDP versus the CPC or the Liberals. The Liberals got a gajillion times more coverage. The CPC got a gajillion times more coverage. You know, Singh did well. Well, he got he got coverage. I remember when we were working with Joe Clark back in 2000 and we couldn&#39;t you know, we were fifth place in the news and we were sad. We were happy when we got to third place. If we could figure out a day where we could be in third place in the news cycle, then we were doing our job. And that&#39;s what the NDP needs to figure out is how are we going to get the second place in the news? How are we? Because if I can be second in the news, second in the Twitterverse, second on social media, then maybe I can be second in this election. And second in this election has a very high, you know, Corey said their ceiling is as high as anybody&#39;s. If he can get the second, then he can get the first. But he has to get the second and it has to happen in a hurry.</span>

But on top of that, the parties triangulate, and they&#39;re doing their jobs, and they&#39;re looking for accessible voters, and they start to hoover them up. And then all of a sudden, you&#39;re in a situation where things are a little bit tighter. So overrated. Underrated, however, because that tightening, Well, it might just be baked into the nature of politics. It matters a lot. You may find yourself in a situation where all of a sudden the liberals aren&#39;t just not looking at a majority, but might very much be in doubt whether they win an election. So both.</span>
