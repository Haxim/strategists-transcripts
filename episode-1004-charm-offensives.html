We were kind of talking about what these endorsements meant at this period in time. Is this forward momentum? Is this a byproduct of that phone call strategy that you were suggesting about talking to those that are on the fence or have not supported you? What do you think about Daniel Smith bringing two more folks from the caucus, not her caucus just yet, but on side?</span>

            <span class="text">yeah you should be but there&#39;s a reason why i did that because the commentary from that clip I think is really interesting and allows us to maybe have a conversation on strategy. Because I&#39;m not going to say this is an overwhelming sentiment, but there is certainly a sentiment from a lot of the progressive, maybe even centrist types. Where was this guy? Where was this comedic powerhouse? Where was this charm offensive Jason Kenney? Where was this self-deprecating person? And part of me wants to pull my hair out, But it&#39;s not my job on this podcast to do that. Carter, it&#39;s your job. And we&#39;ve been seeing the outcome of that over the years. So Carter, talk to me about this. Is that a valid sort of sentiment? Where was this guy? Or is that not even possible that this version of Jason Kenney could not have been presented to the public? Or is this also something that we&#39;ve talked about in the past where people are viewing this frame through how they see him in the moment versus how they saw him in the past and the emotional resonance to that. Start us off here, because I think there&#39;s a strategy discussion to fully analyze, could he have been this person and quote-unquote won over people with the personality that we saw on stage here? Carter?</span>

            <span class="text">You know, I thought political audiences were pretty hard up having to listen to the three of us to find their comedy fixes. That was pathetic comedy. That was just not even good comedy. So the fact that we&#39;re all looking at this and saying, oh my goodness, isn&#39;t he ever so funny and charming? First of all, he&#39;s always been charming. We&#39;ve talked about that, Corey and I, I don&#39;t know how many times, especially in the one-on-ones. He has been a guy that we&#39;ve watched win over room after room after room using similar techniques to what he had yesterday or the other day. This is not new for Jason Kenney. What is new is what he said in his speech. He has nothing left to lose. He can say whatever he wants. The joke about Justin probably would have played in any room. him. The UCP caucus probably wasn&#39;t going to work, right? So now that we know that it&#39;s dysfunctional, it had some meat on that particular bone. But the truth of the matter is this Jason Kenney was there the whole time. Corey said something interesting in a couple of podcasts ago. We were talking about Justin Trudeau and the way he was singing Bohemian Rhapsody. If you don&#39;t like someone, the way they hold their knife and fork will make you crazy. This is what happens when there&#39;s no longer any stakes as to whether or not you like or don&#39;t like this guy. He no longer has the same power over us, so it doesn&#39;t matter if we like him. And suddenly we&#39;re open again to the idea of liking him. When someone announces they&#39;re going to retire, their popularity jumps. All the polling right now that&#39;s coming out on Jason Kenney shows his popularity jumping. This guy was there the whole time, Corey and I. And even you, Zane, even you have pointed out that this guy can be very, very charming when he wants to be.</span>

You know, the jokiness, the self-depreciating, kind of the quirkiest sides, seeming a little bit more cerebral, a little bit more erudite than that sort of get-or-done attitude that was in the view in elections. This is who the guy is. But to Carter&#39;s point, there were obviously certain jokes that were just off-limits. And Jason Kenney is a smart enough man to know not to fall into what I would call the John Crosby trap. And this is going to be a deep poll for some of our audience who say under the</span>

They didn&#39;t need to merge with the Alberta Greens. They just became the only competent player in that space.

And instead of saying, we all got to be together in one team, he could have pitched, we&#39;ve all got to vote for me, this conservative option. And maybe he could have done something. It&#39;s hard to say. Certainly, they would have been dealing with some pretty aggressive vote splits in the rural areas, I think. That would be unavoidable.</span>

You get why they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing at certain moments. And they&#39;re small moments, but they&#39;re such telling moments. I can remember this one time Rachel Rachel Notley was doing the tour of the government offices around Christmas and she came to my department. She&#39;s talking to the people who are on the floor and just everyone sort of scrums around to hear the premier talk. And I</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s really interesting and you know going back to i know carter we brought this up in the past around using things like theater and stand-up comedy where we talk about you know the biggest skill or the biggest compliment one could be paid is if they&#39;re playing a stadium or an arena And it makes it feel like the room is one-tenth the size, that it is an intimate group. And I feel like that similarity also applies to politics, right? Where even if you&#39;re in a group of 12, the goal is to make people feel like they&#39;re one-on-one and that everyone, to Corey&#39;s point with that Rachel Notley example, everyone was beaming. Corey, I want to give you a little bit more space. Any final thoughts on here before we wrap up? Because I just really wanted to use this Kenny clip as a jumping off point to talk about charisma, political humor, and frankly, the practicality of could Kenny have been this guy? Anything final to add before we move on?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. One of the other things that I think just sort of needs to be thrown out there, and maybe we should have at the start, is that part of the reason why people are saying, wow, where was this Jason Kenny, is because the media is not generally in the business of clipping the jokes from a political speech. Yeah, exactly.</span>

            <span class="text">point. And that&#39;s what gets out there. So you don&#39;t always see that. But every single political speech is full of jokes. Every single political speech. There are very few politicians, you know, not every politician does the jokes well, but there is almost always kind of the icebreaker at the start and then the turn where you get more serious and then it loosens back up again at the end there. there.</span>

Is that a gender thing from your perspective? I&#39;m just kind of curious now, just thinking about it out loud with with the three of you or the two of us, three of us, two of you.

Maybe you made it look like you just thought of it on the spot, right? That&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve ever uttered that phrase that made them all laugh and feel good about themselves.

Look, turns out people in Alberta like the Sovereignty Act, according to this poll. Look, it looks like I would win an election against Rachel Notley, according to this poll.

What was the order of the questions? And so on. And without that information, and certainly knowing that the person who&#39;s providing you this poll and apparently commissioned this poll has a reason to ask questions in certain ways, I kind of feel the value of this poll is zero. It did, however, lead to a Rick Bell column. It did lead to a lot of social media activity. And it does fit into a general picture of Danielle Smith trying to calm the waters and saying things will be okay, serving some of her campaign interests.</span>

Most of the time, what you&#39;re trying to do is just get someone to actually kind of think that maybe you&#39;re in the game or there&#39;s a momentum shift happening. You&#39;re very rarely asking them to publish it because no one should be publishing a poll in the province of Alberta. or in any other province for that matter, that doesn&#39;t start right off by saying what the methodology is. Who did you sample? Who does the random sample consist of? So the fact that they say that they&#39;re polling UCP members, was it all the UCP members? Was it the UCP members at the cutoff date? Was it UCP members at a different date? We don&#39;t know. They weren&#39;t clear. the questions aren&#39;t shared if</span>

These are the questions. I&#39;ve often thought that Paul Ferry, who does all these great classes on politics municipally, federally, provincially, he should do a class for journalists on what statistics are and how to read a poll. Because the media class doesn&#39;t understand what they&#39;re they&#39;re looking for.

Does that accurately reflect the population in those two halves? And you can go through and you can pick out a poll and then a reputable pollster will weight things so that it accurately represents the actual outcomes. And that waiting process is very, very challenging. It does not just fall off the pen easily. It is something that, are we waiting just for age?

So what data have we accumulated over our history of data collection that will enable us to help make this more accurate? Not to shift the results, but to actually represent more accurately the randomization of the poll sample to the general population that we&#39;re trying to reflect. And that stuff is just lost on the average person. So, and by the average person, I&#39;m also including the media, who can be oftentimes fed a poll that doesn&#39;t make sense. And they write it up like it is the truth from God himself, or herself, probably. And that truth is then distributed through the media. and there&#39;s a big question as to whether or not the public follows the polls or the polls follow the public. And</span>

Their incentive is an incentive towards accuracy. Getting it right. Where you have to be careful is that if you are a pollster who works a lot with partisan pollsters or like partisan organizations, and perhaps your poll is even being weaponized to say, look, this is okay, therefore you should vote for me and create like that self-fulfilling thing, Stephen Carter is, your</span>

This is what you explicitly mentioned. Corey, you threw out the word weaponization. Carter threw out the term, do the polls follow the public or do the public follow the polls? Carter, can you explain what you mean by that when you say the public follows the polls? Because I suspect in some ways it may not be dissimilar to Corey throwing out the term weaponization of polling in some way.</span>

            <span class="text">The public follows the polls because they&#39;re looking to to figure out who they should vote for. And they&#39;d like to vote for the winner. There&#39;s this idea that people take</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">That decision is not informed, but it is a large portion of how we choose outcomes. This is why momentum, the underdog effect that I&#39;ve been able to work on with Jyoti Gondek, Nahed Nenshi, Alison Redford, why does the underdog effect work? Well, same reason that you choose the underdog in the Super Bowl. Everybody wants to see the underdog win. And if it looks like the underdog&#39;s got momentum, then all of a sudden everybody switches switches their votes over to the underdog with momentum.</span>

Because if you put your thumb on the scale, for example, if you say that we&#39;re not changing how we vote, but we&#39;re updating it. And people are triggered by the word update. Great. Yeah. Update sounds awesome. It&#39;s a value judgment to your point. I like to update my phone. I get new features. There&#39;s new possibilities. Great. Let&#39;s go with update. And then you could see the downstream effects of using a poll like that to then construct a broader public opinion.</span>

Imagine that you&#39;re, well, listen, I worked in the government for years. This happened. This is not a hypothetical. There would often be debates, policy debates, debates about opinion, and then there would be polling that was done. Well, let&#39;s see how Albertans feel about this. Some of these questions are knowable. Let&#39;s go there and answer things. And when I talk about the weaponization of polling, you know we we know there are many different ways to ask questions we know that there are many different ways to get outcomes depending on how you want to frame things what you put in the window ahead of the question and all of that um</span>

Calgary Elbow was not caught up in the NDP wave because the most likely group to beat the PCs in Calgary Elbow was clearly known to be Greg Clark.

Sometimes has to be the person who keeps everybody on message, just as Stephen Carter&#39;s talked about. And there&#39;s really nobody else who can do that role because the team is so much smaller.

I&#39;m also going to keep it on Pierre Prolliev because one of the things that this article mentions outside of the fact that Ian Todd has been hired and Carter says he knows him and he&#39;s been around politics for a while, this individual. But this article also highlights, Corey, that the staff search for Pierre Poliev has been challenging, that he&#39;s had difficulty getting people to step away from their corporate gigs to help him out, which seems perhaps interesting considering he won in a runaway train fashion. Many feel he&#39;s the front runner for the next election. We&#39;ve discussed that on this program. So, Corey, overrated or underrated in your mind, the staffing challenges for Pierre Poliev.
