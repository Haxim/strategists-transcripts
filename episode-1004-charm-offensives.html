          <p>Stephen Carter's back and the gang talks about Jason Kenney (has he found a new personality now that he's losing his job?) and partisan public opinion polls (what do we need to know about them and when can we trust them?).</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the new (?) Jason Kenney and the place of charm in politics before turning their attention to constructing a course on what everybody in the media needs to know about political polls. How important is comedy and affability in politics? When should we be leery of candidate polls? And can any of the gang name a single Keith Urban song? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">yeah you should be but there&#39;s a reason why i did that because the commentary from that clip I think is really interesting and allows us to maybe have a conversation on strategy. Because I&#39;m not going to say this is an overwhelming sentiment, but there is certainly a sentiment from a lot of the progressive, maybe even centrist types. Where was this guy? Where was this comedic powerhouse? Where was this charm offensive Jason Kenney? Where was this self-deprecating person? And part of me wants to pull my hair out, But it&#39;s not my job on this podcast to do that. Carter, it&#39;s your job. And we&#39;ve been seeing the outcome of that over the years. So Carter, talk to me about this. Is that a valid sort of sentiment? Where was this guy? Or is that not even possible that this version of Jason Kenney could not have been presented to the public? Or is this also something that we&#39;ve talked about in the past where people are viewing this frame through how they see him in the moment versus how they saw him in the past and the emotional resonance to that. Start us off here, because I think there&#39;s a strategy discussion to fully analyze, could he have been this person and quote-unquote won over people with the personality that we saw on stage here? Carter?</div>

            <div class="said">You know, I thought political audiences were pretty hard up having to listen to the three of us to find their comedy fixes. That was pathetic comedy. That was just not even good comedy. So the fact that we&#39;re all looking at this and saying, oh my goodness, isn&#39;t he ever so funny and charming? First of all, he&#39;s always been charming. We&#39;ve talked about that, Corey and I, I don&#39;t know how many times, especially in the one-on-ones. He has been a guy that we&#39;ve watched win over room after room after room using similar techniques to what he had yesterday or the other day. This is not new for Jason Kenney. What is new is what he said in his speech. He has nothing left to lose. He can say whatever he wants. The joke about Justin probably would have played in any room. him. The UCP caucus probably wasn&#39;t going to work, right? So now that we know that it&#39;s dysfunctional, it had some meat on that particular bone. But the truth of the matter is this Jason Kenney was there the whole time. Corey said something interesting in a couple of podcasts ago. We were talking about Justin Trudeau and the way he was singing Bohemian Rhapsody. If you don&#39;t like someone, the way they hold their knife and fork will make you crazy. This is what happens when there&#39;s no longer any stakes as to whether or not you like or don&#39;t like this guy. He no longer has the same power over us, so it doesn&#39;t matter if we like him. And suddenly we&#39;re open again to the idea of liking him. When someone announces they&#39;re going to retire, their popularity jumps. All the polling right now that&#39;s coming out on Jason Kenney shows his popularity jumping. This guy was there the whole time, Corey and I. And even you, Zane, even you have pointed out that this guy can be very, very charming when he wants to be.</div>

And I feel like that similarity also applies to politics, right? Where even if you&#39;re in a group of 12, the goal is to make people feel like they&#39;re one-on-one and that everyone, to Corey&#39;s point with that Rachel Notley example, everyone was beaming. Corey, I want to give you a little bit more space. Any final thoughts on here before we wrap up? Because I just really wanted to use this Kenny clip as a jumping off point to talk about charisma, political humor, and frankly, the practicality of could Kenny have been this guy?

You&#39;re very rarely asking them to publish it because no one should be publishing a poll in the province of Alberta. or in any other province for that matter, that doesn&#39;t start right off by saying what the methodology is. Who did you sample? Who does the random sample consist of? So the fact that they say that they&#39;re polling UCP members, was it all the UCP members? Was it the UCP members at the cutoff date? Was it UCP members at a different date? We don&#39;t know. They weren&#39;t clear. the questions aren&#39;t shared if</div>

And this is the point I want to make about incentives, right? Polsters who are like media polsters or polsters who work for a variety of clients, such as Janet Brown, really reputable polsters have a huge incentive to correct for these things in a scientific methodological way to come as close to reality as possible. Their incentive is an incentive towards accuracy. Getting it right. Where you have to be careful is that if you are a pollster who works a lot with partisan pollsters or like partisan organizations, and perhaps your poll is even being weaponized to say, look, this is okay, therefore you should vote for me and create like that self-fulfilling thing, Stephen Carter is, your</div>

Imagine that you&#39;re, well, listen, I worked in the government for years. This happened. This is not a hypothetical. There would often be debates, policy debates, debates about opinion, and then there would be polling that was done. Well, let&#39;s see how Albertans feel about this. Some of these questions are knowable. Let&#39;s go there and answer things. And when I talk about the weaponization of polling, you know we we know there are many different ways to ask questions we know that there are many different ways to get outcomes depending on how you want to frame things what you put in the window ahead of the question and all of that um</div>

But Carter, chiefs of staff for opposition leaders is my question. So we&#39;ve talked extensively about the chief as it relates to ministers, as it relates to the prime minister, the premier, but chiefs of staff of opposition leaders, overrated or underrated?</div>

But this article also highlights, Corey, that the staff search for Pierre Poliev has been challenging, that he&#39;s had difficulty getting people to step away from their corporate gigs to help him out, which seems perhaps interesting considering he won in a runaway train fashion. Many feel he&#39;s the front runner for the next election. We&#39;ve discussed that on this program. So, Corey, overrated or underrated in your mind, the staffing challenges for Pierre Poliev.
