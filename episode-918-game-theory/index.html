        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Commons vote on the Uyghur genocide before being subjected to the return of grab-bag favourite "Fine, Fabulous or F**ked" and the dreaded "Hoedown". Was the Liberal cabinet abstention good strategy? Are bozo eruptions in the CPC undoing O'Toole's rebranding work? And why did Stephen and Corey pass up their true calling to be poets? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

All of this, of course, without the support of the Liberal cabinet. That&#39;s right, the Liberal cabinet entirely entirely abstaining from this conservative motion. There&#39;s many things to unpack here, but let&#39;s start with the actual motion and the mechanics and the political strategy today. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start with you. The Liberals, not abstaining overall, allowing a free vote. So the Liberals that were there voted, and all of them voted yes, but Cabinet abstained from voting, including the Prime Minister. Mark Garneau was there as, of course, foreign affairs minister and issued a kind of statement, so to speak, saying, I abstain on behalf of the government of Canada. What do you think of this strategy, Carter? Was this what the Trudeau government had to do? Do you feel like this strategy might have some negative repercussions? What do you make of this particular political play?</div>

I&#39;m not sure that the target of this civics lesson should be be the government of China, because I don&#39;t think they will care. But you know, this is a non binding motion brought by the conservatives, the people who voted for it, were free to do so without impacting the government in any way. And it is important to note, and this is, again, maybe where the distinction becomes a little bit difficult for some, you know, the House of Commons is not the government, right?</div>

          <div class="said">I don&#39;t know, just be mindful that there are some policy considerations that need to be brought in here, and this might not have the intended effect in a bunch of other areas. You can also be a little more creative. Yes, income tax going up, that&#39;s an option. You could also choose to raise it specifically on higher incomes. You could bring in a wealth tax. You could create a luxury tax of some sorts where only very expensive goods, say automobiles that are 200% the average price or in jewelry that is in the same band or something like that, boats, RVs, maybe only these get hit with a sales tax. So there are policy choices out there that may make the tax more complicated, but may also make the tax more digestible.</div>

I mean, whoever&#39;s in charge of government relations at Facebook, they made some really bad choices over the last couple of weeks.

Yes, the AABBA form of poetry. And we will be having Stephen and Corey develop one of their own in real time. Here&#39;s how it works. I&#39;ve got seven items on a list. They give me a number between one and seven. I give them their item. And on the fly, they develop their limerick, AABBA structure. Of course, Corey, I want you to go first. Give me your number between 1 and 7. I&#39;ll give you your topic. Carter, you can&#39;t choose the same number, but have yours in mind, and I&#39;ll give you your topic. And then I&#39;ll give you 30 seconds to construct your limerick. I will try to fill time somehow. We&#39;ll figure that out. But, Corey, give me your number between 1 and 7. Give me 2.</div>
