A lot of feedback, some disagreement, Carter, from certain politicians saying, you know what I prefer is people if they haven&#39;t asked, just fucking tell me. It&#39;s past day five of a 10 day festival. I don&#39;t need any niceties. I just need you to fucking tell me what you want, just so I can remember you.</span>

He gave a very interesting speech that I think you have a few thoughts on. So how about you get us started?

            <span class="text">so yeah, he gave this speech. It was after the Prime Minister had left, the Prime Minister motorcade had gone out, people were kind of done, I think, with the main event. And there was some weak effort by the MC to bring everybody back around the crowd to listen to a politician speak, not a ton of takers. Like I would say that, That, for sure, it was a much more enthusiastic crowd for the prime minister, which is not necessarily what you would expect in Calgary if you&#39;re not in Calgary. But, you know, that&#39;s George Chahal territory and did very well. And who&#39;s a local liberal MP. The Pierre Poliev speech was short, which is the best thing I could say about it.</span>

You know, it was this idea of like, yeah, I&#39;m here. And, you know, I am all about opportunity. I was adopted by people, you know, opportunity. My wife is a refugee from Venezuelan socialism, opportunity. And, you know, in Canada, it doesn&#39;t matter if your name is Singh or Smith. I can&#39;t remember all of them.

And the first thing I did was actually text you two and say, hey, Pierre Polyev, are we sure he&#39;s good? And Steven said, what? What&#39;s going on? I&#39;m not there. Yeah, Carter left.

            <span class="text">Calgary. I would say most corporate Calgary, most community Calgary, like this is the one, one of the few you put on your list, right? Like you get a few things done. Like if you&#39;re, if you&#39;re being like very crass, but hey, this is a bit of like community outreach. But this is also like, this is probably your best shot to have some time with the premier or a minister because you know they&#39;re going to be there, right? It&#39;s one of the ones where you can have a bit of community, a bit of like family, also a bit of ministerial time. But I think to the point, it&#39;s, it&#39;s, there&#39;s two concerns. The first one is exactly what you said, or</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">or the way I&#39;ve kind of maybe expanded on that point around a community that happens to be a minority hosting a mainstream event. The other is really in the language of, and I was going to bring this up as a broader topic for both of you from a pure political risk perspective for this community. And there&#39;s probably folks in my religious community that are not going to love this line of questioning, but like singling out one community and being like, we owe a debt of gratitude to you. You guys are fucking amazing. Thank you so much. I think does two things. I want to talk about the political risk, which I&#39;ll get your thought on. But it also like perpetuates this minority myth model, right? That like, you know, why can&#39;t you just be like these guys? Like, aren&#39;t they exactly what you should be? And like, we should let more immigrants in because look at this one example, when we know that that is, I shouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a fringe or a norm. I just want to go down that. But it&#39;s like it&#39;s perhaps using a pedestal and showcasing a narrow example while maybe trying to gloss over some of the other realities that immigrant and refugee communities face. So those are the two strands I always think of. What the harm is to the broader sort of community when you kind of single out one. I&#39;d like to get your thoughts on that and the political risk. And the second one is really about how do our politicians and our politics start coping that at some point, and it&#39;s now, communities that happen to be minority communities and people that happen to be individuals from minority backgrounds are going to host the most fucking mainstream things because they are part of the mainstream. stream well</span>

And to your point, Zane, I think that there&#39;s this sense of like, well, look, and now Calgary has these diverse communities. Not Calgary is a diverse community. Yeah, where the leaders of Calgary come from all walks of life. And, you know, there&#39;s all sorts of backgrounds. And, I mean, my God, how many, you know, how many times are we going to have to, you know, break that stereotype before Eastern Canada sees us a little bit differently? I don&#39;t know.

I&#39;m clearly reading things into it he didn&#39;t intend, but I&#39;ll just say is you could kind of feel like you think that the Smith things are better, you know, at the bottom line.

            <span class="text">you know to your point there is a room cory and i&#39;ll let you kind of this is just more of a comment than a question i&#39;ll kind of say that if if there was a politician who kind of recognized the mainstreaming of certain things produced by groups that happen to be minority communities i think there&#39;s political value in that for them right to be like you have done something that is not just for you but is for everyone and then that is what is meant to be celebrated in some ways right like not just by people like me but like you know there is something something to that in that sense. And those are not the right words myself. But I want you to get your response because you also talked to you just mentioned Trudeau a bit as well. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything that caught your attention with what he said, or if there&#39;s any other sort of rules you wanted to kind of add to our to our growing list. And then I do want to get to political risk in a second.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I maybe I&#39;ll walk my way towards a rule. But the rough the rough outline of this rule is, you have to be thinking, would this be appropriate if I just mad libbed some of the context and and did it at say like a group that was put on by like a catholic faith group or a different organization maybe not a faith group at all and and is this how i would recognize the group would i go so all in on this and i&#39;m gonna pick a a example here the haze breakfast that uh steven mentioned yeah calgarians uh of a certain vintage will know this was like the stampede breakfast for many many years you know you would go to heritage park there&#39;d be be thousands of people there it was invite only but it wasn&#39;t that hard to get an invite yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and you would uh you know you&#39;d go through the ceremony and politicians would often have their speeches and they would say things and if somebody at the hayes breakfast had spent literally the entire speech of the hayes breakfast talking about the contribution of the hayes family and of southwest calgary and heritage park and how important it was we would say that&#39;s fucking weird weird</span>

            <span class="text">you know that&#39;s really strange and uh yes they are the hosts and and yes they deserve acknowledgement for their support of the hayes family through there but like does this actually follow is this what this event wants</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">wants to be about purports to be about and i&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a perfect parallel but i&#39;m saying as a politician you should sit you should do that check and say okay if i just swapped out a few things and if i was at like say a catholic event at southwest calgary would this speech be talking about the things i&#39;d want to be talking about or would somebody say this speech is fucking weird and and i think as we evolve as a yeah you know our understanding of kind of like the again i&#39;ll use the word intersectionality we all wear many hats right you you were just talking about that i think there&#39;s got to be more of an appreciation for that nuance by politicians and the words that they write and the words that they say should should reflect that.</span>

It&#39;s much more true that my father and I and Canada owe you a debt of gratitude, not just for what you&#39;ve contributed to this country but for being a shining example of what welcoming of what welcoming people were fleeing violence persecution persecution and fear can do that&#39;s from the prime minister that&#39;s at that same breakfast we&#39;re discussing you talk about intersectionality right as a muslim and it&#39;s my like my whatsapps are going fucking nuts like everyone&#39;s forwarding this to me being like isn&#39;t this fucking amazing canadian press writes an article with that you know debt of gratitude owed to a smiling muslim community a part of me feels amazing like we&#39;re singled out like this This is great. Like, you know, all the work that we&#39;ve all done collectively, putting these breakfasts on, all the community success, hey, they&#39;re all being celebrated. The other part of me talks about that model minority sort of thing. And we&#39;ve kind of briefly touched on that. I don&#39;t want to talk about either of those two.

            <span class="text">What&#39;s the political risk for Justin Trudeau to signal out or single out, I should say, a specific community like this so publicly, get the coverage that it did? Are you saying, ah, it&#39;s fine? like it&#39;s it&#39;s the you did it and he can do the you did it speech to anyone else or do you feel like there&#39;s political risk here when politicians go to and this is just you know one community within a sect of of a muslim sort of diaspora in canada just to be totally clear and then think about all the other faith groups other other groups split a different way like this is just a small group that we are um your your thoughts on political risk here in that sense well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i so So, when you&#39;re speaking the most general of terms, I think your political risk is not like other groups say, hey – well, actually, it is. It&#39;s exactly this. So, I&#39;m going to illustrate this with a story. When I worked for the government of Alberta, we had a person whose half of their job, half of an FTE, was</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was just writing letters that were proclamations about the various days, weeks, and months that we had. Sure. Because we very quickly got to a point where it was, we got no credit for making the comment. We got abused if we forgot to</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so I think there&#39;s a bucket of political risk here where, okay, you&#39;ve said that about this community. Now, are you going to say it about my community? Are you going to say about this community, this other community, this further community down the road? And then it becomes a game of your risk is a mission. Like, why didn&#39;t you say this about the sick community, right? Why didn&#39;t you say this about? and and people will start to look at that language and they&#39;ll put that language in front of people that&#39;s that&#39;s a challenge and that&#39;s a risk that politicians have when</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">when they go extra hard on the platitudes the the other one obviously and and i think that so many speeches about what politicians are going to do uh for the pursuit of uh reconciliation in this country is the perfect example is you dial your rhetoric up to 12 and your action is stuck at one okay that&#39;s that&#39;s fucking wonderful you said those nice things what are you going to do about the list of concerns that we have the challenges we have the rising racism in various contexts here what are you doing about if we want to do the uh the first nations went clean drinking water for christ&#39;s sake like how hard you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know the the rhetoric so outscaling action is also something to watch uh but you know that plus the idea that you are now setting a bar for for all future community conversations, those are the two risks, primary risks for a politician. Those are good ones to add.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, Corey talks about rhetoric and this omission. And then he also talks about this sort of delta between action as well. What risk do you see? Do you actually see political risk when a leader signals out a community like this, puts it out so explicitly? If the political job was to get people to share this clip within my faith community, community it&#39;s happening but i think about this more broadly right like so from that sense yeah there&#39;s like a lot of love on the whatsapp right our chosen form of communication yeah uh mandated in the quran by the way uh it&#39;s a beautiful it is very few people realize very few people realize that um but carter talk</span>

It&#39;s almost like, where does daddy&#39;s love go today, right? And if we buy into this larger paternalistic and even colonial style of thinking about things, where if you can almost be like Smith, but up until recently, you had to be Smith to get those rights and privileges, right? And if that&#39;s how we&#39;re kind of treating these groups, many of them are going to view it as a zero-sum game. It&#39;s a power ranking. You&#39;re up one day, you&#39;re down another. And if you&#39;re up one day, that means someone else is down. And someone else is down, you have to climb on their shoulders, not to kind of thank them, but to trample them and get them lower. And frankly, if you think, if anyone thinks that there&#39;s not cultural communities or faith communities that are thinking about government relations or PR or where we fit in the overall psyche or our brand or positioning, kind of in the terms that we&#39;ve been discussing over the series of our 1,081 episodes, Corey, you&#39;re mistaken. Those thoughts happen. Those conversations happen. They might be less or more strategic depending on which group you&#39;re a part of or which tables you&#39;re allowed to sit at. But to your point, Carter, I think it&#39;s a very interesting point. I think sometimes political leaders can can jump in or out of these things and say, you know, have, you know, fly by comments. And I don&#39;t think this was a fly by comment by the prime minister. But there are sort of ramifications of that and how they kind of sit. And if the overarching goal, Carter, is your challenge of people working together to produce a greater, more stitched together country or fabric or outcome. Some of these comments are actually more divisive, I would say, than they are unifying because of the the who&#39;s getting the love today vibe that that some of them bring that&#39;s</span>

Racism comes in all the different colors. I mean, everything. There is so much and there&#39;s so much to spread around, really. No one group owns it. And because of that, but I think that sometimes politicians just simplify to the point where they&#39;re like, well, we can go and say this and everything will be fine.

And I think I saw some of that with them starting to talk more about the European Union and some of the activities that they&#39;re taking and tying Canada into those types of discussions.

The number of people I&#39;ve talked to, politically savvy people, who have just sort of felt like the conflation of both the CBC reporting and the Ethics Commissioner report, and have said like, oh, like this looks like... Like the Ethics Commissioner report, just a little bit of background for people which said that the the actions the premier took were actions that would be a threat to democracy right so that was the bottom line it had three different sections section one had to do with the cbc uh you know whether these allegations that were made in cbc not by cbc but in cbc right uh saying that the premier&#39;s office had reached out to uh</span>

            <span class="text">then the second two were on these other two issues that got dinged on in terms of like talking to palowski and did she intend to interfere in justice right so the reason why daniel smith at the debate was saying like i actually i was exonerated on one was because this this uh you know comment the ethics commissioner made about the cbc reporting and i think there&#39;s going to be a lot of people out there, and it will obviously be a narrative helped along by a premier&#39;s office that&#39;s much helped by this narrative, who are going to say, well, you know, there were these accusations made, but those accusations have now been retracted, so I think it&#39;s okay. That&#39;s not actually what was the threat to democracy. The threat to democracy was the stuff on tape, where Danielle Smith was saying, well, let me take that away. Let me see if I can intercede in the administration of justice.</span>

Now, of course, there was Matt Jenner, a conservative MP, kind of put a motion together. This is the prime minister using his official Twitter account, asking Taylor Swift to, you know, make some time, inserting a few, you know, T Swift lyrics in that tweet. Are you in or are you out on that strategy? It gets the headlines. It pierces through. It goes beyond our political bubble. Some people think it&#39;s cringe. I&#39;m curious what you think. I</span>
