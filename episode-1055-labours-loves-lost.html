And they did it by doing a countdown that led to a nuclear explosion. So it wasn&#39;t exactly subtle. It was, you know, the world will end if you elect Barry Goldwater. And I think it has to be noted that it was very successful. It was the first big negative ad and it had big impact. And now we now we&#39;re living in a world where everybody&#39;s using big negative ads. You</span>

I just want to get your take on what they&#39;re trying to do by adding the AI label, by going so over the top. Carter might say this is their volume and their rhetoric, but is there something that they&#39;re trying to do in your mind around AI in particular and perhaps trying to normalize it?</span>

            <span class="text">it i don&#39;t think it has anything to do with normalizing ai it actually has everything to do with what steven said interestingly enough about uh the ad against barry goldwater which is it was the first like one of the reasons that daisy ad was so effective is it was the first ad of that style and people remembered it and we talk about it to this day because it was something that was kind of like a bit of a watershed and the reason why they went so hard on making sure we knew it was ai is because that was the hook the rnc starts to watch it you mean yeah the rnc probably puts out an ad every couple of days correct you know that&#39;s just the reality of it and how many of them are you seeing how many of them are you interested in the fact of the matter is they&#39;re being seen by their base and they&#39;re being seen when they put money behind them so that they become paid ads and what they wanted was a bit of an earned media bump by pushing this out there and it&#39;s it&#39;s not a terrible gimmick frankly because here we are now talking about this this particular ad.</span>

So for me, it&#39;s kind of the oldest trick in the book. It&#39;s using novelty to get a media hook and using that media hook to spread your message.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, because so much of what you watch on television, whether that be Hollywood produced or whether it be a slick advertisement, it might not be AI generated, but it&#39;s fiction. You know, when you see a hamburger that looks delicious, it&#39;s fiction. There&#39;s a lot of fiction there. And this is just a different tool to provide that. Do I think that the same truth in advertising standards should apply?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yes. And I think the bigger problem is that politics can get away with not being truthful in their advertisements. But, but ultimately, I think that there&#39;s a certain art to it. And I don&#39;t really care if you used AI, or if you rotoscoped it, or if you animated it, or you used any of the other number of storytelling tools we use, that&#39;s not of concern to me. And your eyes deceive you all the time. Frankly, AI is a little easier to see that you&#39;re being deceived than than a lot of the other more sophisticated tools that we use currently.

            <span class="text">it&#39;s good strategy bad execution you know the passive aggressiveness of the letters some of the phrases you even used right there where it&#39;s like i would have hoped that we could talk to each other about this and given the things you&#39;ve said i think there&#39;s a certain churlishness there that will not play well with a lot of the people that that Pierre Poliev&#39;s message is playing with, and it will be thrown back in the CBC&#39;s face as evidence that, you know, they don&#39;t like Pierre Poliev, look at the letter they sent, all of that. I think if the letter had been actually truly neutral and said like, hey, congratulations, we&#39;d love to talk to you about the CBC, followed up three months later being like, hey, just don&#39;t want this to fall off your radar, we want to talk to you about the CBC, that&#39;d be fine. But there&#39;s There&#39;s no requirement that Pierre Poliev meet with the CBC, just as there&#39;s no requirement that Pierre Poliev meet with the head of any crown corporation in Canada, or, you know, who might have concerns about what he might do. Tradition be damned. So, yeah, I think it&#39;s unfortunate the phrasings they used and the language they used in that particular letter, because it undercuts the CBC&#39;s objectives and mission. And they should have played it a lot more straight. Great.</span>

We meet with everybody. We want to make sure that everybody understands our mission as we understand it. We want to make sure that any questions are answered. Be completely earnest and over-the-top earnest. And I think that that gives you the opportunity then to to be above any political fray. Corey has spent quite a bit of time talking about how the CBC needs to be seen to be above the political fray. And again, as much as it pains me to to agree with him, I find myself just in this one instance thinking that he may, in fact, be correct. So sorry about that, Corey.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is the relative silence that we have seen from the opposition parties. Has Trudeau just put out a $13 billion deal that at least in the short term is going to face very little scrutiny? Pierre Polyev is focusing his attention elsewhere on the PSAC strike, and I&#39;m going to talk about that in a second. And Jagmeet Singh is kind of trying to change the channel from it too. Are you surprised? Give me the strategy check. What&#39;s going on here that no one is really going after this?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that in every political conversation, you need to say, okay, what votes am I getting by taking this action? What votes am I giving up by taking this action? And I think that this may be one of those situations where you just don&#39;t want to give up any of those particular votes. Ontario is going to be super important in any coming election. As much as anti-government funding and anti-government rhetoric may play super well for</span>

            <span class="text">for Pierre Polyev out here in the West, it may not play quite so well in vote-rich Ontario, as they lovingly say when talking about it. So it seems to me that Pierre, I mean, I mean, we give Pierre kind of a hard time because we always feel like he&#39;s very immature in his communication strategies. But maybe in this particular case, he&#39;s matured a little bit and isn&#39;t just taking the bite of the apple every opportunity he gets.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, to that point, he hasn&#39;t taken a big swing. He&#39;s referred it to the PBO, if I&#39;m not mistaken, to say, go do your estimates on this. And, you know, kind of the version of kicking it to committee sort of thing. and then focused on other things that he feels like are more fruitful political pastors for him. Are you surprised at the political silence of the opposition leaders? Give me your take on what&#39;s happening here.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No, I think when we sit here in Calgary, it&#39;s pretty easy to forget what a big deal the PSAC strike is and just how all-encompassing that is to the conversation in Ottawa. When you&#39;ve got a third of the public service in a strike position, that obviously is going to have a material effect on day-to-day operations in ways that we don&#39;t necessarily feel right it&#39;s not in our city it&#39;s not i mean there are obviously federal public servants in our city but you know what i&#39;m saying it&#39;s not like the heart of the federal government and uh the other thing is i think that in some ways i know we&#39;re not talking about the arena deal here in calgary but there is there&#39;s a similar tactic that was available to pierre polyev which is to say i&#39;m not so sure about this right and And that&#39;s part of how he throws it to, you know, PBO to get different numbers. It&#39;s kind of a buy time strategy that we saw Rachel Notley somewhat deploy the first day of the arena too, saying, well, you know, love hockey, can&#39;t help but notice that these numbers are a little bit different. Pierre Polyev saying, this</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this seems like a lot of money. I&#39;d like the PBO to weigh in on that. And there&#39;s two benefits. One is it does kick the can to outside of this PSAC strike, potentially, right? Because that&#39;s, you know, that is going to consume activity right now. And the other is it allows them to buy time and see how this deal lands and see how the conversation goes. But don&#39;t kid yourself. The conversation is unfolding and trial balloons are being floated. Tires are being kicked. Messages being tested. Just today, Jack Mintz had a column about we&#39;ve got to stop this almost green race to the bottom where we are all just throwing as much subsidy money as possible against these projects, you know, ally versus ally. You know, we actually kind of talked a little bit about</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">about it. We did talk about that. And I think if I&#39;m not mistaken, you kind of supported that broader sort of stream of thinking, if it&#39;s fair to say.</span>

Is it that the conservatives have flown federally, have just gone too far to the right, and that the PC version that Ford is selling domestically, where he has to snipe off votes from the more progressive parties, has to align with Trudeau? Give me a strategy check on what&#39;s happening with Ontario provincial politics and the Trudeau relationship? Because to many, this is another proof point that are they getting chummier or is this just simply transactional politics? Carter, you first. Corey, I want you to jump in on this.</span>

He is a good politician. I think that that needs to be said now after, you know, the years of governing that he&#39;s put in and how he&#39;s being seen.

There&#39;s Alberta and there&#39;s Quebec, right? And I think we forget pretty quickly that it&#39;s a different situation and a different feeling and different expectations from the electorate in other provinces. And they don&#39;t want, by and large, their provincial government to be in a state of perpetual warfare with the federal government. They expect their provincial government to find ways to work with the federal government to the benefit of the province. And Doug Ford understands that. But to underline what Stephen said, it</span>

            <span class="text">yeah we want to talk okay we want to talk about it guys it&#39;s entered its second week this is the the the strike that has public sector workers out on the streets continuing their strategic demonstrations outside of government locations. The delivery of federal services, Corey, continues to be affected. You just saw the immigration minister earlier this week say that 70,000 immigration files that should have been processed were put on hold. We&#39;re now seeing reports of passports being slowed down. There&#39;s many things at stake here. We&#39;ll get into some of the details, but I want to really use this segment to talk about the strategy of winning a labor war in the public, the strategy of winning public opinion. And we&#39;ve seen success on this in the not so sort of distant past, Carter, with the CUPE Ontario campaign against Doug Ford, who seemed to be caught blindsided. This has different dynamics. This has got different players. It&#39;s a different union. The size and scope is different. um the the perhaps the texture and the diversity of the employees across this this container that are being represented uh is different and the grievances are different but</span>

You also have a government that has a few sticking points as it relates to maybe not wanting to legislate in the bargaining agreement or enshrining it within the bargaining agreement, the right to remote work, which seems to be a big sort of pusher. So there&#39;s some of the interesting dynamics here. I want to start with the most top line of questions to</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I said this in an episode not too long ago. I don&#39;t think that as strikes go on, anybody wins, right? Ultimately, there is ill will that is built on both sides. It&#39;s difficult. for management and workers to get back together and to bury the acrimony after the strike is resolved, because it&#39;s put pressure on both parties in different ways. It&#39;s difficult to make up the wages you lose on a strike, right? If you&#39;re on strike for a week, that&#39;s effectively 2% of your salary for the year. If you&#39;re on a strike for two weeks, that&#39;s 4%. Three weeks, 6%. You&#39;re only asking for 9% over three years. Now, some of that&#39;s backdated, right? But But, you know, that money disappears for a lot of people who maybe are going to leave before they&#39;ll ever recoup it. Or, you know, ultimately every week that goes on is really chewing in to even what that would mean. Like, it&#39;s not so simple. I don&#39;t want to pretend it is. But if you were asking for 9% and you were on strike for three weeks, I mean, in some ways, if you were only going to be there for the next year or something, you&#39;d be better off having accepted 3% before you get into the strike. just in like crass calculation terms which is not to say that that is actually what they should have done i want to be really clear on that but my point is it becomes difficult for victory to be truly victory as strikes go on for both sides strikes or lockouts any kind of work action here and um on the flip side those 70 000 uh you know immigration applications they&#39;re not fucking going away they&#39;re still there that work is still waiting that&#39;s a backlog that&#39;s going to be be affecting people it becomes frustrating across the board for the government for the managers in government for the for the workers who come back to work presumably after a strike so strikes are tough and and it&#39;s exactly why these things should be avoided and again that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t go on strike right it means that it&#39;s a real incentive for all parties to work together through mediation uh through through coming to terms and um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s unfortunate that we&#39;re here and um there&#39;s a lot of reasons we&#39;re here and people will read into it different different things but the reality is for a very long time we have rather</span>

That is your role in the next question that I&#39;m going to ask you. Carter, you are a long-respected labor strategist. You have seen these public relations fights you have seen, and you have won over the public. It&#39;s a grind out. No one may win, quote, unquote. I accept that initial answer by both of you, but someone could lose more. And so what I want to kind of think about is we enter week two right now. We&#39;re in the second week. Carter, the way I see it, tell me if you guys, and this is a question to both of you to maybe establish the terrain before I kind of give you your assignment, so to speak. Okay.</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to go to Corey in a second, but I&#39;ll give you some food for thought, Carter. While I go to Corey, maybe think about some of these questions, maybe even tactically. Okay. Are you doing advertising? Are you doing any sort of community relations? I don&#39;t have to answer yet. I&#39;m going to go to Corey. Are you doing media relations? Are you trying to go, how are you trying to provide? You said trying to provide value. Are you doing anything else to provide a warm hug or a halo to your brand, to your workers? Think about that while I go to Corey, who&#39;s working with the minister on this one. and the minister seems to say we&#39;re not doing any back to work legislation the sticking points are still the wages cory this gets precarious and you also have an added dimension beyond the public you got a snipey pierre pauliev who&#39;s told you that your government can&#39;t do the fucking basics and as soon as more passports get more delayed in the summer vacation season you also have to factor in for that so you&#39;re there&#39;s another sort of political element to it too just one of them I&#39;m just spitballing with you here.

            <span class="text">you, you being the Canadian out there who&#39;s hearing about this. because i think in kind of a general sense people are sympathetic and we know from polling uh to the the wage requests from public sector workers and i think if you look over the long term you can really see what the erosion has been in public sector wages over time right but if</span>

            <span class="text">if you can narrow it you know to this deal in this moment what you are offering is the federal government is nine 9% over three years, but 9% is a lot more than what a lot of people have gotten in this moment. And I think that you have the ability to say, we support our public sector unions. We always have. That&#39;s why we&#39;re offering like a very generous 9%. But that&#39;s kind of the upper threshold of the generosity we can provide. And don&#39;t get us wrong. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s not a gift. These These people work hard and that&#39;s why we found, we scraped, you know, we got into the couch cushions, we found the money for 9%, but 9% is, is as far as we can go because we&#39;ve got a challenge with inflation in this country. We can&#39;t exacerbate it by paying public sector employees more. You see how you tie it to an anxiety about cost of living that</span>

            <span class="text">you know, is very generous. It&#39;s far more than what the average Canadian is finding at this particular moment. And we think it&#39;s the right thing to do. We think it&#39;s important that the public sector pays good wages, but this is as far as we can go. So limit it, tie it to the issues of the day, the anxiety. And the other thing, because one of the other big legs of this stool, at least the other one people is talking about, is remote work.</span>

            <span class="text">most Canadians cannot work remotely. quarter of Canadians work in sales and service, you know, when you start layering in all of the other areas, the majority of Canadians do not have the ability to work remotely. And so again, I think you make it about them, them being Canadians, and you say, we want a flexible workplace. And we&#39;re looking at ways we can increase flexibility. But let&#39;s be really clear, public sector employees are there to serve the public. And we need to make sure that there&#39;s the ability to meet the public the way they want to be met and serve the public the way they want to be served. So no, we can&#39;t enshrine the right, you know, to work remotely. That&#39;s just that we can&#39;t do that because that would be failing you as Canadians and failing our mission as public service. So these are the two tactics I would take. I also think that I would lean a lot more on that second one in some ways, because I think that that&#39;s probably the one that the</span>

So unlike Carter, who if, you know, wisely or not, if he chose to take out advertising, government probably can&#39;t do that.

I may even add another one. Would you go and recruit opposite shooting party MPs and leaders and ask them to join forces to find soft tissue within the government? What are you doing? The strategic Strategic goal. Objective is simple. Get blamed less, lose less when this situation goes on and on. You are trying to ensure you do not necessarily get the blame and ergo perhaps have the better negotiating position and perhaps a little bit more of the leverage. Corey&#39;s just mentioned you are the smaller guy in the situation. At least it relates to the two players. Are you using that to your advantage?

But what the general population can do by choosing to take the other side would scare the crap out of me. Because as soon as the government feels like they&#39;ve got the wind in their sails, that just avails them other opportunities. communities um as soon as you know this isn&#39;t necessarily a government that is ideologically uh you know kind of prone to legislate peace act back to work but if it goes on long enough and the general population kind of demands that type of action then this government will do what the general population demands and that that&#39;s probably what i&#39;m the most concerned about i&#39;m not really worried about any stunts or any communications or anything like that i just don&#39;t feel like Like, that&#39;s</span>

But I&#39;m just, you know, I just don&#39;t want public opinion to turn against us. That&#39;s the thing that would be the most upsetting, the most challenging for the members.

            <span class="text">What is one thing that as the government, as you sit there, as you kind of look at this, that you see that Carter and his crew at PSAC could do in this war of public opinion that you&#39;d be like, I need to prepare for this.

            <span class="text">you yeah the problem my i it&#39;s a bit of a cop-out but it&#39;s i think this really does come down to public opinion for this particular government for us too you know if i was uh on the minister&#39;s side because if steven gets to a point where 70 of canadians think the government is being unreasonable right uh that&#39;s a real challenge because that means anything even that i would legislate back in probably in order to maintain public opinion and not really risk bleeding to the ndp in some key areas would require a generosity that risks burning the chance of the conservatives supporting it and and kind of a fundamental chaos that might occur from there too and the breakdowns matter a lot it&#39;s tough to pull from a government point of view but i&#39;m sure their parties are pulling as well to understand what the party support is and how it aligns and you know in a way if the majority of the public is with um is with peace act that&#39;s irrelevant if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a group of the public that&#39;s not movable and not a consideration in an election. So it&#39;s understanding the nuances of public opinion and understanding where it might be causing long-term pain and breaking some long-term coalition building. The other thing that I think from a tactic would cause a lot of pressure on the government would be actually finding those coalitions with other public sector unions, with other unions more generally. This thing&#39;s spreading in some way, shape, or form. You</span>

            <span class="text">I mean, I think that would be the most extreme manifestation of it. But I actually just mean that more aggressive action in solidarity from labor in terms of perhaps even other unions running ads about how poorly the government is treating PSAC, right? And, you know, it&#39;s important that Canadians know that the stakes are here. And just in general, burning that labor relationship that Justin Trudeau has worked pretty hard to try to develop, right? And start eroding that. So I actually think those would be pretty sensible tactics for PSAC to be really leaning into pretty heavily, too, and say, like, listen, I know there are direct actions we can take, but we also know that in some ways, having other people take direct actions and us, you know, down the road, maybe doing the same would be very powerful as well. and the labor movement should act as one here. I think that would cause a little bit more heartburn for the government. We&#39;re</span>
