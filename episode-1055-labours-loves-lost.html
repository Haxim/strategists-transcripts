        <div class="desc"><p>The gang talk go through a grab-bag of political issues that include A.I. generated ads, the muted response by opposition leaders on the VW battery plant and the CBC president's letter to Pierre Poilievre before diving into the ongoing public sector strike.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter perform a “strategy check-in” on the CBC, A.I. in politics and more before turning to the ongoing PSAC strike in the federal public service. Are Justin Trudeau and Doug Ford in a full-blown “bromance”? Can PSAC keep the public on their side during a prolonged strike? And where can we find the audio files Stephen Carter is creating of Zain and Corey? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">Well, because so much of what you watch on television, whether that be Hollywood produced or whether it be a slick advertisement, it might not be AI generated, but it&#39;s fiction. You know, when you see a hamburger that looks delicious, it&#39;s fiction. There&#39;s a lot of fiction there. And this is just a different tool to provide that.

          <div class="said">Yes. And I think the bigger problem is that politics can get away with not being truthful in their advertisements. But, but ultimately, I think that there&#39;s a certain art to it. And I don&#39;t really care if you used AI, or if you rotoscoped it, or if you animated it, or you used any of the other number of storytelling tools we use, that&#39;s not of concern to me. And your eyes deceive you all the time. Frankly, AI is a little easier to see that you&#39;re being deceived than than a lot of the other more sophisticated tools that we use currently. Carter,</div>

I think if the letter had been actually truly neutral and said like, hey, congratulations, we&#39;d love to talk to you about the CBC, followed up three months later being like, hey, just don&#39;t want this to fall off your radar, we want to talk to you about the CBC, that&#39;d be fine. But there&#39;s There&#39;s no requirement that Pierre Poliev meet with the CBC, just as there&#39;s no requirement that Pierre Poliev meet with the head of any crown corporation in Canada, or, you know, who might have concerns about what he might do. Tradition be damned. So, yeah, I think it&#39;s unfortunate the phrasings they used and the language they used in that particular letter, because it undercuts the CBC&#39;s objectives and mission. And they should have played it a lot more straight. Great.</div>

Be completely earnest and over-the-top earnest. And I think that that gives you the opportunity then to to be above any political fray. Corey has spent quite a bit of time talking about how the CBC needs to be seen to be above the political fray.

When you&#39;ve got a third of the public service in a strike position, that obviously is going to have a material effect on day-to-day operations in ways that we don&#39;t necessarily feel right it&#39;s not in our city it&#39;s not i mean there are obviously federal public servants in our city but you know what i&#39;m saying it&#39;s not like the heart of the federal government and uh the other thing is i think that in some ways i know we&#39;re not talking about the arena deal here in calgary but there is there&#39;s a similar tactic that was available to pierre polyev which is to say i&#39;m not so sure about this right and And that&#39;s part of how he throws it to, you know, PBO to get different numbers. It&#39;s kind of a buy time strategy that we saw Rachel Notley somewhat deploy the first day of the arena too, saying, well, you know, love hockey, can&#39;t help but notice that these numbers are a little bit different.

One is it does kick the can to outside of this PSAC strike, potentially, right? Because that&#39;s, you know, that is going to consume activity right now. And the other is it allows them to buy time and see how this deal lands and see how the conversation goes. But don&#39;t kid yourself. The conversation is unfolding and trial balloons are being floated. Tires are being kicked. Messages being tested.

There&#39;s Alberta and there&#39;s Quebec, right? And I think we forget pretty quickly that it&#39;s a different situation and a different feeling and different expectations from the electorate in other provinces. And they don&#39;t want, by and large, their provincial government to be in a state of perpetual warfare with the federal government. They expect their provincial government to find ways to work with the federal government to the benefit of the province. And Doug Ford understands that. But to underline what Stephen said, it</div>

The delivery of federal services, Corey, continues to be affected. You just saw the immigration minister earlier this week say that 70,000 immigration files that should have been processed were put on hold. We&#39;re now seeing reports of passports being slowed down. There&#39;s many things at stake here. We&#39;ll get into some of the details, but I want to really use this segment to talk about the strategy of winning a labor war in the public, the strategy of winning public opinion. And we&#39;ve seen success on this in the not so sort of distant past, Carter, with the CUPE Ontario campaign against Doug Ford, who seemed to be caught blindsided. This has different dynamics. This has got different players. It&#39;s a different union. The size and scope is different. um the the perhaps the texture and the diversity of the employees across this this container that are being represented uh is different and the grievances are different but</div>

You also have a government that has a few sticking points as it relates to maybe not wanting to legislate in the bargaining agreement or enshrining it within the bargaining agreement, the right to remote work, which seems to be a big sort of pusher.

          <div class="said">Well, I said this in an episode not too long ago. I don&#39;t think that as strikes go on, anybody wins, right? Ultimately, there is ill will that is built on both sides. It&#39;s difficult. for management and workers to get back together and to bury the acrimony after the strike is resolved, because it&#39;s put pressure on both parties in different ways. It&#39;s difficult to make up the wages you lose on a strike, right? If you&#39;re on strike for a week, that&#39;s effectively 2% of your salary for the year. If you&#39;re on a strike for two weeks, that&#39;s 4%. Three weeks, 6%. You&#39;re only asking for 9% over three years. Now, some of that&#39;s backdated, right? But But, you know, that money disappears for a lot of people who maybe are going to leave before they&#39;ll ever recoup it. Or, you know, ultimately every week that goes on is really chewing in to even what that would mean. Like, it&#39;s not so simple. I don&#39;t want to pretend it is. But if you were asking for 9% and you were on strike for three weeks, I mean, in some ways, if you were only going to be there for the next year or something, you&#39;d be better off having accepted 3% before you get into the strike. just in like crass calculation terms which is not to say that that is actually what they should have done i want to be really clear on that but my point is it becomes difficult for victory to be truly victory as strikes go on for both sides strikes or lockouts any kind of work action here and um on the flip side those 70 000 uh you know immigration applications they&#39;re not fucking going away they&#39;re still there that work is still waiting that&#39;s a backlog that&#39;s going to be be affecting people it becomes frustrating across the board for the government for the managers in government for the for the workers who come back to work presumably after a strike so strikes are tough and and it&#39;s exactly why these things should be avoided and again that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t go on strike right it means that it&#39;s a real incentive for all parties to work together through mediation uh through through coming to terms and um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s unfortunate that we&#39;re here and um there&#39;s a lot of reasons we&#39;re here and people will read into it different different things but the reality is for a very long time we have rather</div>

That is your role in the next question that I&#39;m going to ask you. Carter, you are a long-respected labor strategist. You have seen these public relations fights you have seen, and you have won over the public. It&#39;s a grind out. No one may win, quote, unquote. I accept that initial answer by both of you, but someone could lose more. And so what I want to kind of think about is we enter week two right now. We&#39;re in the second week. Carter, the way I see it, tell me if you guys, and this is a question to both of you to maybe establish the terrain before I kind of give you your assignment, so to speak. Okay.</div>

I&#39;m going to go to Corey. Are you doing media relations? Are you trying to go, how are you trying to provide? You said trying to provide value. Are you doing anything else to provide a warm hug or a halo to your brand, to your workers? Think about that while I go to Corey, who&#39;s working with the minister on this one. and the minister seems to say we&#39;re not doing any back to work legislation the sticking points are still the wages cory this gets precarious and you also have an added dimension beyond the public you got a snipey pierre pauliev who&#39;s told you that your government can&#39;t do the fucking basics and as soon as more passports get more delayed in the summer vacation season you also have to factor in for that so you&#39;re there&#39;s another sort of political element to it too just one of them I&#39;m just spitballing with you here.

These These people work hard and that&#39;s why we found, we scraped, you know, we got into the couch cushions, we found the money for 9%, but 9% is, is as far as we can go because we&#39;ve got a challenge with inflation in this country.

And so again, I think you make it about them, them being Canadians, and you say, we want a flexible workplace. And we&#39;re looking at ways we can increase flexibility. But let&#39;s be really clear, public sector employees are there to serve the public. And we need to make sure that there&#39;s the ability to meet the public the way they want to be met and serve the public the way they want to be served. So no, we can&#39;t enshrine the right, you know, to work remotely. That&#39;s just that we can&#39;t do that because that would be failing you as Canadians and failing our mission as public service.

          <div class="said">Carter, what do you think? Tell me about your strategy. I asked you to think about some tactics. I said, community relations, media relations, advertising. I may even add another one. Would you go and recruit opposite shooting party MPs and leaders and ask them to join forces to find soft tissue within the government? What are you doing? The strategic Strategic goal. Objective is simple. Get blamed less, lose less when this situation goes on and on. You are trying to ensure you do not necessarily get the blame and ergo perhaps have the better negotiating position and perhaps a little bit more of the leverage. Corey&#39;s just mentioned you are the smaller guy in the situation. At least it relates to the two players. Are you using that to your advantage? Talk to me about some of your tactics now that you&#39;ve had some time to think about it.</div>

          <div class="said">you yeah the problem my i it&#39;s a bit of a cop-out but it&#39;s i think this really does come down to public opinion for this particular government for us too you know if i was uh on the minister&#39;s side because if steven gets to a point where 70 of canadians think the government is being unreasonable right uh that&#39;s a real challenge because that means anything even that i would legislate back in probably in order to maintain public opinion and not really risk bleeding to the ndp in some key areas would require a generosity that risks burning the chance of the conservatives supporting it and and kind of a fundamental chaos that might occur from there too and the breakdowns matter a lot it&#39;s tough to pull from a government point of view but i&#39;m sure their parties are pulling as well to understand what the party support is and how it aligns and you know in a way if the majority of the public is with um is with peace act that&#39;s irrelevant if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a group of the public that&#39;s not movable and not a consideration in an election. So it&#39;s understanding the nuances of public opinion and understanding where it might be causing long-term pain and breaking some long-term coalition building. The other thing that I think from a tactic would cause a lot of pressure on the government would be actually finding those coalitions with other public sector unions, with other unions more generally. This thing&#39;s spreading in some way, shape, or form. You</div>

But I actually just mean that more aggressive action in solidarity from labor in terms of perhaps even other unions running ads about how poorly the government is treating PSAC, right? And, you know, it&#39;s important that Canadians know that the stakes are here. And just in general, burning that labor relationship that Justin Trudeau has worked pretty hard to try to develop, right? And start eroding that. So I actually think those would be pretty sensible tactics for PSAC to be really leaning into pretty heavily, too, and say, like, listen, I know there are direct actions we can take, but we also know that in some ways, having other people take direct actions and us, you know, down the road, maybe doing the same would be very powerful as well. and the labor movement should act as one here.
