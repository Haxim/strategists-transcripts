        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the launch of the Conservative party platform, Justin Trudeau's dismissal of monetary policy and spend some time in the elevator with Jagmeet Singh. Was there method to the CPC platform's front cover madness? Should the Nova Scotia election results keep the Liberals up at night? And why, God, did anybody let Justin Trudeau or Corey Hogan talk macroeconomics? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

And more specifically, Corey, are you enjoying our side-by-side villas on O&#39;Toole Island? Because I feel like there&#39;s some people that might want to pay us a bit more than we originally purchased this property</div>

It&#39;s that Trudeau Island off in the distance appears to be sinking into the water three inches at a time and people are beginning to take notice. And at the end of the day, if you want the highest property, it might end up being O&#39;Toole Island.</div>

Unless, unless, unless you guys genuinely think there was like like a strategic thought behind it. And if you do, let&#39;s discuss it.

What do you kind of make first, first, Carter, of the design, the visual, the brand? Was there a strategic reason behind it? Because I want to get this out of the way by what they tried to do there with O&#39;Toole in almost a Men&#39;s Health Magazine style cover? Or was this just, you know, bad design, bad strategy in your mind? Lay it on me and let&#39;s hit that question first before we move on to the more substantive of things.</div>

And I think that O&#39;Toole in a, in a black t-shirt, uh, with his arms crossed, you know, kind of looking like the everyman, uh, was designed to appeal to that. Um, and he, he did, he looked like the, in fact, I&#39;m not gonna lie to you. I looked at the cover of</div>

          <div class="said">that is probably a fairly strong possibility that they were looking at it as casting O&#39;Toole as the everyman. That makes sense to me. I didn&#39;t think it was the abomination that some of the immediate punditry did. I thought that people would see themselves in that cover. And I didn&#39;t mind the men&#39;s health kind of feel or the McLean&#39;s version. I mean, geez, you know, remember when Justin Trudeau got his 12-page spread in the middle of McLean&#39;s magazine? No one was complaining about that. So, well, some people were complaining about that. And that was the people that were campaigning against him.</div>

And perhaps that was the idea, that they just wanted to have on social media the low-information cover that they think people are just not going to click through on.

          </div>
          <div class="said">I think there were a couple of reasons for it. One of the most obvious ones for me is that by putting out your entire platform right away, you sort of take away the ability for the other guy to have boogeyman about what&#39;s going to be in your platform and what&#39;s going to be there. It&#39;s just all out there and you&#39;re able to reference back to it and there&#39;s some value in that. I also do believe a lot of it is this make a strong first appearance. If you are trying to put yourself out there as a credible, substantive candidate, you don&#39;t want to be teasing out, you know, the napkin version that you had with Doug Ford in Ontario there with five bullets. You want to show you&#39;re different from Doug Ford, in fact, and by putting out such a meaty document at the start of the campaign, you are in fact doing that, right? That&#39;s a very clear difference with the sort of shallow conservatism of the Doug Ford PC party or, you know, the Donald Trumps of the world who didn&#39;t even have a platform, right? Their platform was we just re-endorse everything Donald Trump does and we had a platform in 2016 and isn&#39;t that good enough for you people? So there was also kind of that positioning things on there. This is an interesting one as well, because it really harkens back to the platforms of the 90s. You know, these really long platforms that were put out by the Liberal Party of Canada, the Reform Party had all of those bullets, many of you will recall, the PCs had, I mean, they all had really long platforms back then. And we&#39;ve talked about this in the context of short platforms, but I&#39;ll just sort of say it again, and maybe put the emphasis elsewhere here, which is that in really charged times, platforms get shorter, because everybody knows what they&#39;re fighting about.</div>

          <div class="said">there&#39;s some psychology here that I want to just put on the table. There are a couple of ways people update prior beliefs. Like if you believed one thing and you change your mind, right? If you already have an opinion and it&#39;s a strong opinion, you got to work hard to change your mind. There&#39;s all sorts of tactics to do that. There&#39;s no point in unpacking them all. But if you don&#39;t care, if you don&#39;t care, there is a body of research that says volume alone works. In fact, it appears to be the primary determinant. Like, I don&#39;t really care. They&#39;ve got this massive plan. Whatever, we&#39;ll do it their way.</div>

Carter, before you give me your analysis on what stuck out for you, talk to me about Corey&#39;s point. Does this micro-targeting of policy, cooking up several different boxed meals and delivering specific flavors and versions of that meal to different swing writings. Does that work? We know the technology&#39;s there. We know that you&#39;re able to kind of serve it up and deliver it. But does it work from an outcomes perspective? Have we seen it actually deliver? Or do you need that big, stitched story that kind of groundswells people to kind of be like, I&#39;m buying into something bigger rather than I&#39;m getting this little thing that&#39;s specifically for me in my region?

Yes, of course, we&#39;re going to talk about Justin Trudeau using the very famous lines, campaigns are no time for policy. But before I get into how things have gone for Justin Trudeau, maybe I&#39;ll start here. Maybe this is an a natural spot to start. But Corey, I&#39;ll start with you. While Justin Trudeau launched his election, the Nova Scotia Liberals, the governing Nova Scotia Liberals, lost their election. This was a premier that had never been elected before, so a premier who took over as leader in Rankin, was blessed by Trudeau. Trudeau came, poured a lot of, you know, dump truck some money in Nova Scotia, you know, gave Rankin a pat on the back and said, this is your guy. He got you through COVID. He&#39;s the guy that you need to reelect. Trudeau then left and Rankin then lost. If I, and we can talk about Nova Scotia and what happened there. I don&#39;t really want to talk about it in depth, but let&#39;s talk about it through the prism of if that is the blessing you you gave in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia is not the country. Maybe let&#39;s start with a feeling rather than a strategy. How are you feeling this week overall, using Nova Scotia as perhaps a bit of a bit of a litmus test if you are in the Trudeau liberal camp, federally anywhere in this country?</div>

Like if that is your definition of conservative party, and if that&#39;s the conservative party, or progressive conservatives, then surely, there will be ways to simply keep the number of seats that liberals are hoping to keep in the coming election. And, you know, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s this tremendous doom. You know, you&#39;re seeing a two-point drop, a three-point drop, a two-point gain, a three-point gain in one province. And I&#39;ve long held that people vote federally for very, very different reasons than they vote provincially. It&#39;s one of the things that I hung my hat on in provincial politics here in Alberta. You know, because if you look at the number of people who vote for the Conservative Party, whatever it may be, whether it&#39;s the Reform Party or the Conservative Party, it is a it&#39;s huge compared to the number of people that would vote even in the landslide victories for, you know, whatever the Conservative Party of Alberta is, whether it&#39;s the, you know, the UCP or the PCs or whatever it may be. And there&#39;s many different ways to interpret that. But the way I interpret it is simply we&#39;re voting for different things. We&#39;re voting for a federal government and we&#39;re voting for a provincial government. And those two things are different. So let&#39;s not try and read too much into it. The federal government touches individuals in very different ways than the provincial government does. And that means that we&#39;re going to vote differently and we&#39;re going to have different matrices in our heads.</div>

Tim, your leverage of this GAF, your making hay of this GAF, what does it look like? And one additional factor I will add just as context for the listeners is while this monetary policy GAF was happening, we see two polls come out that say affordability is climbing in the ranks and issue salience for Canadians. So, Corey, you&#39;re working for Timo Thule. You already have him doing that first video today. Are you hitting on this more? Are you moving on it? Are you expanding the scope?

Yeah, easier for their friends, for sure. Harder for the rest of us. So I think about monetary policy. I think about how hard it is for you to balance your checkbook after five years of liberal government. I think about affordability.

Something that Albertans are sort of digesting right now and people in many parts of the country. Or how all of a sudden you&#39;ve got to worry about additional fees coming And if you want something that&#39;s a little bit more on his platform, maybe the fact that the GST, I could use a GST holiday, personally, but I&#39;m saying, you know, it&#39;s it becomes an opportunity to talk about these things.

You can build on it, you can build on it, you can understand more down the road. And when you&#39;ve been prime minister for five years, you can&#39;t help but learn things, and you can&#39;t help but become pedantic about certain things. And this is probably a pretty good example of that, where all of a sudden he&#39;s asked about monetary policy. And he&#39;s like, that&#39;s not my fucking job.

But then we had a second round on this conversation and are currently still actively in that second round as we speak on candidates getting vaccines and almost all parties saying, yep, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. Doug Ford coming out today saying, if you&#39;re an MPP in my caucus, you better be fucking vaccinated. In fact, kicks one person out today, has another person who has a medical exemption.

And I said, nah, this isn&#39;t so novel. People have been thinking about it for a while. But I think Stephen was right, and I think I was wrong. Because there are...</div>

You, of course, are trying to go up to the 30th floor of this very tall tower. Both of you are together. You hit the button. You&#39;re getting in the elevator.

I can add some, you know, texture to it if you&#39;d like. You guys can take it from your perspectives of how you think his week has gone. But this is the guy on the left that is the most likable in the race in many ways, that it&#39;s almost been getting a free ride, many would say. Corey, to your point, no real, using the military term, guns pointed at Jagmeet Singh as the liberals and the conservatives square off. So, you know, he says, I think I&#39;m doing OK, guys, but tell me, where do you see the deficits? What should I be doing that I&#39;m not doing? And of course, he turns to Stephen first because he wants to make sure with Corey he can gut check it. So, Stephen, give it to Jagmeet Singh. What is he doing good? What is he doing bad? What should he consider changing? A quick plus minus delta for Jagmeet Singh and your 30 second elevator ride campaign strategy. It</div>

All of those things used to be so cheap. And now it&#39;s balanced off. And the digital ad campaign is now as expensive on many levels as a well-thought-through radio campaign. I know I&#39;ve moved a lot more to direct mail because it&#39;s turning out to be a much more cost-effective medium. medium so i don&#39;t know i mean i think that i think that uh facebook has obviously you know back in the day there was political advertisers and no one else um now you&#39;re competing with gm uh to get the same eyeballs and and it turns out to gm and and toyota have a shit ton more money than we do yeah</div>

I want to talk to you about that composite of the everyman. Is it overrated or underrated in your mind? The campaigns that always strive for the relatable everyman approach, some campaigns less so than other, but it&#39;s something that every campaign talks about. How do we become relatable? How do we ensure that people see themselves in the candidate? Relatability. So that everyman end quote unquote slash relatability overrated or underrated in your mind?</div>

You know, again, it&#39;s like there&#39;s a limited poll set at this point, but it doesn&#39;t, he&#39;s not going lower. He&#39;s not going lower. But what we are seeing is that the liberals are going a little bit lower. And that has got to make me worried because my entire campaign was based around one fight. And I&#39;m seeing Jagmeet Singh, just showing up in my rearview mirror here, making the same arguments I&#39;m making for the same audience I&#39;m going for, and he seems to be having a better time of it than I am.</div>
