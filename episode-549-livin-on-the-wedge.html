            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">that was much fun you missed all the texture they did they did miss all the texture absolutely okay let&#39;s get into our first segment there&#39;s a lot to talk about our first segment today the signal and the noise and the bell i want to go over what what was considered to be and we talked about this on stage in our in our last episode the live show uh the debate but i think there&#39;s more commentary that&#39;s come out there&#39;s more analysis that&#39;s come Corey, you at one point, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on this podcast or otherwise, said that this debate&#39;s going to really be about the analysis of the analysis. So I want to go dig into that a little bit more. So give me your take. We&#39;re a few days removed from the debate. What do you think right now? What are you feeling right now about this debate and the analysis that&#39;s come from it? Corey?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Corey? Well, before we even get there, top line, in 2011, the English language debate had 11 million viewers, okay? Okay.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">And this time around, depending on whose statistics you want to use, it had somewhere between 60,000 and 300,000 viewers. But there&#39;s just as many words being written about it. There&#39;s just as many pundits sounding off about it. Exhibit A right here, us talking about it. so amazingly this more than any debate that&#39;s come since including the mclean&#39;s debate which had higher viewership it was on television at least that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s correct yeah uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">people aren&#39;t watching the debate they&#39;re watching the analysis of the debate so i guess when i think about the debate and the analysis of the analysis and whatnot when i was watching it i anybody who listened last episode knows i thought while trudeau was good on substance i really thought thought he was shaky on pretty much any other metric you could come across but when you&#39;re just getting it through what the globe and mail thinks and they thought he won and the national post and they thought mulcair won it starts to look like a split ticket and on top of that uh the sound bites the quotes that came out of it trudeau probably did the best on rerun right like those 30 second quotes that came after he had the motorcade line he had that just killer line about you run deficits in good times you run deficits in bad times the only years you don&#39;t run deficits are election years right yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">i i don&#39;t think he won the debate i want to be clear i still don&#39;t think he won the debate but i do think the liberals have won the post of it carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">carter who&#39;s won the post debate you were very high on justin trudeau on our live show during the debate what</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well what cory is trying desperately to avoid is that i was right and he was wrong No, no,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">no, no, no. He chose the wrong leader who won the debate. I chose the right leader who won the debate. And he&#39;s trying to look the globe in the National Post, chose the wrong leader. No, they chose the right leader who won the debate because they chose the one-eyed. Most people said</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">said Tom Mulcair won that debate. No, they didn&#39;t. Most people did. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">So is that one in the same today, guys? I mean, in this day and age where Corey makes a very good point. No, he didn&#39;t. Well, let me get to the point. Well, Corey makes a good point saying that there&#39;s as many words written about this debate as there were previous debates. Does it make a difference if you win the debate or win the post-debate? Are they one and the same today or are they as split</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">split as they were? Well, the post-debate is way more important because you don&#39;t have your own opinion about it. You&#39;ve taken other people&#39;s opinions and you&#39;ve decided if they&#39;re valid or not. And in many ways, that&#39;s backed up by the biases you bring into it. So are parties</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">parties or strategists or people in the back room trying to position their leaders and their candidates to win the post-debate even before the debate starts? I don&#39;t want to get too</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">can talk about polls in a minute, but I&#39;m not seeing big bounces out of that debate because no one developed their own opinion. They only saw the media opinion. But even in 2012, Alison Redford resoundingly lost the 2012 leaders&#39; debate. Correct. Except the general population didn&#39;t believe it.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t want to detour on 2012, but one of the things in 2012 was Don Braid, of all people, said that Raj Sherman won the debate. Right. And I think that he did exceptional relative to all of our expectations. Yes, but it is. And I think that&#39;s the scorecard on which Braid was. Well, that&#39;s how Braid was measuring him, right? And when you&#39;re a pundit, especially in a province like Alberta, when we all know all of the personalities involved, it&#39;s very easy to measure them relative to a baseline. That&#39;s not necessarily their public persona. So that&#39;s why I think a lot of the pundits said that Redford lost.</span>

But I think the interesting thing here is that for years, all the public, the media all asked for a freeform debate. Let the candidates go after each other. Let them ask each other questions.

I think that term, if I&#39;m not mistaken, has been used by people like Justin Trudeau, NDP MPs in the past.

            <span class="text">huge part of you. Corey&#39;s all the dad humor. Okay. We&#39;ve been talking about this term, you know, wedge issues and wedge politics. And we&#39;ve almost been throwing it out in a pedestrian pace. I want to spend a little bit of time on this segment talking about what wedge issues really are, how you find them. And then we&#39;ll discuss a few that are currently in the zeitgeist and maybe ask you guys for your opinions on if you were in the shoes of strategists on the side, whether you&#39;d use them. So before we kind of get into it, into those specifics, Carter, how about you give us like a 101 on what wedge issues are, how they kind of emerge, and when do you use them? I want to have like a general sort of discourse on this because I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve necessarily talked about their applicability in a political campaign.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so I&#39;ll start off with a really simple definition. wedge politics is the politics of of taking a single idea that has got kind of black white characterization so you are either for it or you&#39;re against it so</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">takes about 36 38 to win so all you need to do is find an issue where 36 of the population agrees with you and you can wedge it against the the balance of the population right even if they all don&#39;t agree in</span>

            <span class="text">in our system where we&#39;ve got a couple of other parties splitting the vote right and in the canadian context so in the american context these issues tend to be thought of more as like so this separates me to this side and you to that side right and there&#39;s there&#39;s advantages and there&#39;s ways you can pull that in the canadian context we think about it more and like that separates me to this side and everybody else to that side yeah right right and and we think about wedges as what differentiates you from the herd right</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">right the rest of the gang is doing and in here one of the classic wedges we have of this election is this issue of a deficit so and harper have both said they would not run a deficit trudeau has said i&#39;m going to run a deficit and to carter&#39;s point the majority of the canadian population probably doesn&#39;t want a deficit but a strong minority probably does correct</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I know. I&#39;m entirely on board. I think most Canadians would see Canada as a whole being really opposed to how the government has handled this refugee issue. And you&#39;d probably be right. It would probably be 70-30. But there&#39;s still 30 that are supporting the government on this. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. I want to get into the specifics. And both of those items that you guys mentioned are what I want to discuss. Corey, how about you help me answer, what does the applicability of a wedge look like? How do you know it&#39;s time to use it? Do you use it early and often? Is it something that we do in the tail end? The reason I&#39;m bringing this topic up is because we&#39;re going to see the term a lot more over the next 25, 26 days that we have left. We&#39;re hearing about it a lot more, and the wedge politics issues are going to become a lot more apparent. But when do you use it, and how do you use it? Well,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Well, a wedge is not a bullet. It&#39;s a building block. So you&#39;ve got to construct things early on and kind of find ways that down the road you&#39;ll have those cleaves. I know that when we were constructing the platform provincially for the liberals in 2012, 12 it was a lot of polling because we&#39;ve talked about wedges as though there was only one issue in an election and of course we&#39;ve talked at other times about ballot box questions and you&#39;re trying to get it down to one issue for correct correct the fact of the matter is you&#39;re stacking wedge upon wedge upon wedge and you need to make sure that your wedges aren&#39;t splitting half of your people one way and the other way at any right so that you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">lot. I believe the whole reason that the liberals supported C-51 is it polled huge at the beginning. And they didn&#39;t want to be on the small end of the wedge. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">problem is the math changed for them pretty remarkably over time and sometimes you do make the you know so as much as we were saying zane this is me i&#39;m on this side and you guys are all on the other side sometimes you make the calculated decision when constructing your wedges to be on the same side as somebody else it&#39;s a big enough thing that you want to share it with another party and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">and so a wedge can emerge in in in a few ways right you can you can create yourself take a strong position on it or in terms of the syrian refugee crisis being an example it&#39;s thrown at you and you have to sit somewhere on the spectrum is that correct to to categorize it that way well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i mean thrown at you would be a bit of a challenge i mean okay if that hits you as a big surprise you you&#39;re probably in trouble okay i don&#39;t think the biggest wedges hit you as a surprise well</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">those those things came from a place of philosophy of the parties if the parties had taken wildly different positions than the one they did like for example imagine if the liberals and new democrats said well yeah we want to shut the borders to refugees still that would be so off of their dna it&#39;s not a bullet right you can&#39;t just pull this gun out and fire it it&#39;s got to be something that you&#39;ve laid the foundation okay that helps me so</span>

First, let&#39;s talk about deficits. Corey, if you are the liberals right now, do you welcome the position that you&#39;re in? Are you happy if you&#39;re overseeing this campaign that you&#39;ve chosen this as a wedge issue? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">They don&#39;t want to run deficits for the sake of deficits. And to that point, they think they can take the hit on deficits even if Canadians don&#39;t want to run them because they can pay for things Canadians actually want. Which is the stronger wedge.</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">when we talk about wedges, it has to be considered in the context of a lot of other things. And one of them is where people feel the parties naturally rest and what they think about those parties as sort of preconceived biases. And I think one of the reasons why Canadians as a whole have discounted the New Democrats in the past has been a lack of seriousness in economic planning. I get a kick out of this, by the way. The New Democrats are now asked to be costed. They have to do all of these things. Sometimes they seem almost surprised by it, because when you&#39;re the third party, nobody cares if your numbers make sense. Nobody cares.</span>

This is a race between Justin Trudeau and Tom Mulcair. As it stands today, there are competing polls coming out that one is ahead of the other. And I want to talk very quickly in this segment about how you guys, if you&#39;re in the position, would start making the case that we are going to be the party of change. Because they need to start doing it now so that it ultimately ends up 26, 25 days from today that they&#39;re going to be the party of change. Okay, so how do you start making that case today?

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s set the table. The polls are tied in some of the polls. Ipsos, for example, actually shows the Liberals with a significant lead over the Conservatives, who are back in third six points back from the Liberals. Correct,</span>

            <span class="text">that&#39;s just top line. How many votes are you going to get nationwide? Nonsense. That doesn&#39;t tell us anything about government. And there&#39;s two big caveats I want to put on it. One, as we&#39;ve put on before, is that because the undecided seem to be wavering between the liberals and the New Democrats, the conservative number is actually probably a little lower than reported. The other really big caveat I want to put on, and you knew it was coming, is seats are not necessarily given out in the same proportion as percent of the vote. And I&#39;ve run a lot of seat projections in the past week. and the liberals have to win by like six points over either the new democrats or the conservatives to win uh a government right there&#39;s just so many their vote is not very efficient at all at this point and and maybe six is an exaggeration but it&#39;s probably four or five points we could very easily have a situation right now where the liberals end up with four points more than the next party and end up in third place it&#39;s possible yeah</span>
