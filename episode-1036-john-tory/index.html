        <p>Zain Velji returns with his signature "let's just do one segment" attitude. John Tory's scandal and resignation are deconstructed as the gang dives deep into how politicians make big, career-ending decisions.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss John Tory's sudden resignation and how politicians approach life-altering/career ending decisions. Why did Tory resign when others might have tried to hold on? How does politician consult with staff on such decisions? And how long until Zain's son replaces Stephen Carter? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

He called it consensual. The staffer no longer works for his office as a political staffer, to be clear, a former political staffer. They decided to end it earlier this year, and he called it an error of judgment. He said, because of that, I&#39;m stepping down as mayor.</div>

And I want to talk about that a bit. And then I want to talk about some of the what goes on before a big political decision or a life altering political decisions.

          <div class="said">generally speaking, they will. I think that if he acts perfectly from the point of time that this was discovered and moves forward, there&#39;s another act for John Tory returning to the corporate boardrooms of Canada. And I would imagine that he&#39;s quite used to that level of, of, uh, success and would want to hold onto it. So if you want to hold onto that, then he is acting exactly the right way. And Corey&#39;s also raised an interesting point that I think sometimes we take for granted and that his, he may actually want something really old fashioned, like his marriage to stay together. Um, you know, like it is one thing to be caught to be having an affair. It is another thing entirely to have that affair splashed across across the front pages of the Toronto Star and other national newspapers. That is a different type of humiliation. And I suspect that for him to save his marriage, it required immediate action. But I do think that both of those paths are the same path, right? You stick to, if you want to save your marriage, you get the hell out of office as soon as you can. If you want to be a corporate player, you get out of office and you make sure that you clean this up as best you possibly can. So I imagine that that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing.</div>

Carter, how many times, what I find interesting is dynamics here, right? There&#39;s power dynamics, so let&#39;s peel this back, right? There&#39;s clearly power dynamics in this Tory situation with him and the staffer, right? And we talked, you know, Corey, you gave a hat tip to this, and I know other outlets and podcasts are talking about the ongoing nature of consent, the power dynamics, you we&#39;re focusing on using this as a strategy conversation, but the power dynamics between the principal and the staff.

You know, I mean, I suspect most people will answer with, no, we don&#39;t expect there to be any more ethical politicians, and may look and be more accepting of a little bit more of the deviant, the deviance, which is something that if you&#39;re going to campaign, I agree with Corey as well, getting yourself out there as soon as possible. um it would be super important can</div>

Is there a chance that whether it&#39;s strategic or by accident that the last thing people talk about John Tory will be his budget versus the scandal? Or is that wishful thinking? I understand what Corey&#39;s saying. It&#39;ll color it a bit. It won&#39;t dominate. It won&#39;t be the headline, but I get the point.

The city of Toronto wouldn&#39;t be served. I think you could easily make that case. And, um, this, again, it doesn&#39;t look premeditated.

It doesn&#39;t have to be elected office but carter i like the public eye i like being on a talk show maybe they&#39;ll invite me to a panel maybe they&#39;ll maybe i can have the patrick brown arc in some ways um you know sans the the the elected office if that&#39;s the loose sort of like this is what i want to do what are some of the things you&#39;d be you&#39;d be telling someone like like john tory in in in in the immediate future carter help</div>
