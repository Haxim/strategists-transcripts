I&#39;m just walking around. I&#39;m like, this is a ton of freedom for me right now. So I was walking around the streets in New York, 9-11, not getting pneumonia. It was amazing. It was just – it was probably one of the best experiences.</span>

            <span class="text">that. Did we talk about you not being able to get tickets to the game here in Calgary? Oh, that was so bad. I was right there at the start of those tickets being available. Yeah,</span>

But the time that it took for Ticketmaster to sell out of those tickets and them to appear on the secondary market was just offensive. Offensive. It actually broke my spirit, so I went and I bought Courtside at a Portland Blazers game, which requires me to go to Portland in March. So you&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, buddy. You like to make websites, don&#39;t you? Tell</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Tell us what&#39;s going on. Sometimes I like to make a point through a domain name. So, Corey Hogan, let&#39;s start this. The discussion on minimum wage seems to have picked up quite fortuitously with the discussion here in Alberta with the minimum wage at $15. But you have put together what I&#39;d call a white paper turned website slash proposal as to how we can, let&#39;s say, federalize this concept of a living minimum wage.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I put together a white paper slash proposal turned website because one of the things that has always bothered me is the discussion around labor law federally is essentially can&#39;t do it, throw up our hands, there&#39;s nothing to be done. which um is based on the idea that you know courts long ago decided that labor law was largely a provincial domain not exclusively but largely uh although courts long ago also decided things like health care and education were and i don&#39;t see the federal government butting out to the same extent there what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what i wanted to do was was not so much like detail and highlight the issue although it does go over some of the reasons why i think the minimum wage should be increased across across the board. But, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, there is something adrift in Canada, I think, as far as federalism goes, this notion of what the government can do and can&#39;t do. And it turns out right now, it&#39;s cutting checks and posing for selfies. And I propose a bit more for our government. I think that maybe there&#39;s a new federalism, where you go back to what the actual problem is, you see what tools you have available, and you tackle it with gusto after trying to work with the provinces. That&#39;s what that paper is about. I think everybody should go read it. Canada15.com.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">A mere 5,500 words. Yeah, I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">started to read it. So,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So, Carter, what is pissing you off more? Is it the filing cabinet sitting in your office right now, or is it this website? Did you see my body</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">body language? I mean, I don&#39;t mind the website, right? I mean, Corey&#39;s just wrong, but whatever. What I mind is the overarching idea that everything needs to be solved by the federal government. We can&#39;t have the separation of government. And in fact, Corey and I could have a great argument about fluoride on this this particular issue as well, not because of the fluoride. I&#39;m not anti-science. Don&#39;t try and put me in that frickin&#39; box, my little friend. What I am is that we have a differentiation of responsibilities for each level of government. And each level of government needs to respect those. In fact, in this little province we call Alberta, we had a decades-long fight with the federal government who wanted to just take over resource development, wanted to take over resource revenue, wanted to take it all for themselves. And we stop them because it&#39;s clearly articulated that that&#39;s our responsibility and our purview. Oh, yeah. And fluoride, my friend, is the health. And wages is provinces. And you just want the government to come in and tread on our rights and tread on our Constitution. And I say no more, friend. No more. All</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

We give tax credits. We provide services directly. We have an awful lot of money that is transferred to the provincial governments to deal with this, as well as money that the provinces and the municipalities also spend, not to count what private interests are doing. doing.

What we need to keep in mind is that if we&#39;re all burdening the cost of poverty, maybe we should also be looking at what the quote-unquote benefit of poverty is. And it&#39;s that you get cheap wages for your workers. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right that we&#39;ve socialized the risk and we&#39;ve privatized the benefit. So when you look at it in that lens, maybe it&#39;s time to act on poverty. Maybe it&#39;s time to go forward. We can talk about whether the provincial government or the federal government&#39;s the right right course of action or the right way to do it. But I&#39;ll say the</span>

What you need to do is, if you&#39;re doing this from the outside, create a two-step approach to it. One is convince the people the federal government can do something, because right now the federal government&#39;s position is, no, we can&#39;t do anything.

This is 300,000 people that you get to go back to in the next election and say, promise made, promise delivered. Were they not with you anyways because of where you stand on the political spectrum? I don&#39;t think they were. I think that Corey made a point earlier that I didn&#39;t immediately jump on, which makes me sad. And that is that this is a group that can be politically mobilized. Historically, this isn&#39;t a group that&#39;s politically mobilized. But I think that more important than this particular group is the unionized environment. The group of people who look and say, who are fighting the corporations, who believe that the corporations are the wrong side. You can point to this group and say, see, we&#39;re not only standing up for the unions. We&#39;re standing up for those who are non-unionized and making sure that they have a living wage. I think that that has a lot of power for the people that you&#39;re trying to appeal to in the larger scope than the 300,000 people that are directly impacted. So I think Fournautley,</span>

            <span class="text">No, I mean I would have maybe thought so, but you&#39;re the one who made the point to give you a plug. But it&#39;s very interesting. And it is part of a broader rebranding of Alberta. When you talk about Alberta and Alberta&#39;s image in the rest of the country, it hasn&#39;t always been particularly shiny, I think is fair to say. And even this charm offensive around pipelines and we&#39;re good for the environment can&#39;t</span>

Alberta hasn&#39;t changed. Alberta&#39;s just put a new spin on things. Could be very easily a feeling that you carry. It&#39;s pretty easy to be cynical about a move like a carbon tax if you think it&#39;s tied to just trying to get more carbon out, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, but because we also have the economy, the largest economy that can support this. I mean, this is the other side of this particular coin is if you were working at Tim Hortons in Fort McMurray, you&#39;re making more than $15 an hour anyways, because supply and demand, they required us to have a higher range.

We are not perfectly rational. I know you didn&#39;t, but I do want to say there is an argument to be made that it is a bit of a market failure that people were being paid less than that right now, and it was creating a lock of productivity</span>
