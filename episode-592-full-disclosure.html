        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan discuss minimum wage, the Alberta PC leadership race and the recent missteps by candidates in the US. What are the impacts of Alberta raising the minimum wage? Is it a cause the federal government can embrace? And are Colin Powell's emails best set to electronica or soft jazz? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

What I mind is the overarching idea that everything needs to be solved by the federal government. We can&#39;t have the separation of government. And in fact, Corey and I could have a great argument about fluoride on this this particular issue as well, not because of the fluoride. I&#39;m not anti-science. Don&#39;t try and put me in that frickin&#39; box, my little friend. What I am is that we have a differentiation of responsibilities for each level of government. And each level of government needs to respect those. In fact, in this little province we call Alberta, we had a decades-long fight with the federal government who wanted to just take over resource development, wanted to take over resource revenue, wanted to take it all for themselves. And we stop them because it&#39;s clearly articulated that that&#39;s our responsibility and our purview. Oh, yeah. And fluoride, my friend, is the health. And wages is provinces. And you just want the government to come in and tread on our rights and tread on our Constitution. And I say no more, friend. No more. All</div>

And it&#39;s that you get cheap wages for your workers. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right that we&#39;ve socialized the risk and we&#39;ve privatized the benefit. So when you look at it in that lens, maybe it&#39;s time to act on poverty. Maybe it&#39;s time to go forward.

This is appealing to the base, growing your base, building. I think there&#39;s 300,000 Albertans or so who are impacted by this. This is 300,000 people that you get to go back to in the next election and say, promise made, promise delivered. Were they not with you anyways because of where you stand on the political spectrum? I don&#39;t think they were. I think that Corey made a point earlier that I didn&#39;t immediately jump on, which makes me sad. And that is that this is a group that can be politically mobilized. Historically, this isn&#39;t a group that&#39;s politically mobilized. But I think that more important than this particular group is the unionized environment. The group of people who look and say, who are fighting the corporations, who believe that the corporations are the wrong side. You can point to this group and say, see, we&#39;re not only standing up for the unions. We&#39;re standing up for those who are non-unionized and making sure that they have a living wage. I think that that has a lot of power for the people that you&#39;re trying to appeal to in the larger scope than the 300,000 people that are directly impacted. So I think Fournautley,</div>
