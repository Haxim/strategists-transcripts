        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the federal budget. But not here - because Thursday episodes of The Strategists are now Patreon exclusive. Will you go to TheStrategistsPatreon.com to sign up for the $6 level and continue to get Thursday shows? Is the value at the $10 or $20 level just too much to pass up? And how many folk do you need until it becomes folks? Zain Velji, as always, tries to sell you things you really need. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
