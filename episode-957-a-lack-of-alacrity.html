            <span class="text">This is a strategist episode 957. My name is Zain Velji with me as always Corey Hogan, Stephen Carter. Guys, we are back to the masses. We are done our obligatory Microsoft Zune run for the last what however many was it was a three episodes was three episodes three episodes.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;ve covered this before. I mean, people don&#39;t understand, but Chester has put us basically indentured servitude to Bill Gates. I mean, how many episodes did we lose? 522? And then three every year. 526. Yeah. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So to fill you all in, every year we have to do a certain number of episodes on the Zune platform owned by Microsoft. Now, as much as the platform sucks, we always enjoy doing it. So we do want to give a shout out to the Microsoft team, to everyone there, once again, for the studio space, for the John Turner hologram. That&#39;s always fun. It&#39;s like Carter said.</span>
          </div>

But could this be something you want to give someone in your life or frankly yourself? Carter, you wanted to jump in. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, against excellent airlines like Flair Airlines. Once again, thank you, Corey. We will, of course, be taking nominations. Flair Airlines, there&#39;s a difference between going and getting somewhere. All right, guys, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Fine, Fabulous, or Fucked. You know, we do this as a roundup of so many stories, and especially for those who&#39;ve missed our Microsoft Zoom run. We want to take some of the stories that we may have missed covering in the masses. We want to cover some of the stories that are being talked about right now. We&#39;ll use our very simple, very fun scale of fine, fabulous, or fucked. You will answer the question based on a bit of a blurb that I&#39;ll give you about the situation. You&#39;ll tell me whether it&#39;s fine, whether it&#39;s fabulous, or whether it&#39;s fucked for a party, a political figure, a person that I highlight for you. And there&#39;s no better way to start than to start. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. The liberals on their border closures being criticized heavily that the border closures for the new Omicron variant aren&#39;t very useful, don&#39;t really work, are performative, being criticized, of course, for the broader conversations on vaccine equity. We&#39;ll get to that. But, Carter, on border closures and the politics for the liberals, are they fine? Is it actually fabulous, the border closures that they&#39;ve done? If one of the metrics you&#39;re keeping time with is they&#39;ve done it a lot quicker than they have in the past, or is this fucked?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s fucked. I mean, you&#39;re punishing the wrong people. Omicron or Omicron or however we want to say it. I think it&#39;s supposed to be Omicron because it&#39;s the opposite of Omega. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think that it&#39;s everywhere. It&#39;s obviously still in Alberta or it&#39;s already in Alberta. The travel restrictions appear to be taken so quickly, again, in part because I think of kind of a systemic, I want to say systemic racism, but maybe that&#39;s too far. Maybe it&#39;s just a systemic degradation</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">degradation of Africa because it was first identified in South Africa. It became very easy just to say no one can travel from there. It also didn&#39;t hurt that we don&#39;t have any direct flights from South Africa at this time. so it was a relatively easy play to make but of course it was the wrong play because south africa detected it but i don&#39;t think that south africa had the uh had</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">had the you know the only micron uh variants in the world as we&#39;re seeing now uh they are of course uh now that everybody knows what to look for uh it&#39;s being found around the globe and uh here we are even even in our Our sainted Alberta, where we&#39;ve never had a case of coronavirus,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">coronavirus, we still have some of those cases. So, you know, things aren&#39;t great.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And I think that shutting down travel was just an overreaction that was made easier by a lack of direct flights and systemic racism towards Africa.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you know, this is a government that in the early stages of 2020 was side by side with the WHO saying border closures don&#39;t work. We&#39;re not going to do them. Throughout the course of the pandemic, they&#39;ve been hit hard on the question of border closures by the conservatives, federally, by Doug Ford, provincially. Quicker reaction time as it relates to the criticism and this strategy of the quick border closures. Fine, fabulous, or fucked for the Trudeau liberals? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think it&#39;s going to be fine for them politically, if only because I feel that people after two years have a combination of fatigue and confusion on this entire matter. Lord knows I do. I&#39;m not throwing stones. owns. Do border closers work or not? I don&#39;t know. The quicker reaction time is noteworthy. I think in many ways, governments are input-output devices, and because they got hammered previously for not acting quickly, they decided to act quickly in this case. Was it the right move? I don&#39;t know. It might actually be more popular than what could be the right move, which is to keep borders open and have people moving around. So do I think that they&#39;re fucked? Not politically, no. But this does does sort of underline a couple of other problems that we&#39;re all digesting right now one is here we go again around that roller coaster you know just as there was delta now there&#39;s omicron which i&#39;ll pronounce that way even if it&#39;s the wrong way because um you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know same reason i don&#39;t call an antithesis an antithesis i suppose you know i got a little bit of flair here uh i&#39;m going very comfortable doing things wrong personally</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um but yeah this this is just another thing that&#39;s piled on top where the government needs to be careful is it does invite the kind of cynicism that nobody has a clue what&#39;s going on which is of course the case right yeah</span>

The only thing I guess that I could say that our governments aren&#39;t doing enough of is targeting the areas that aren&#39;t vaccinated at all and getting the vaccines out.

Was the plan going to be entirely different if they had gotten a majority government in September? Was there going to be some major spring of activity that we&#39;re just not seeing now? Or was it always planned to be at this particular cadence? Because, you know, I understand, especially coming out of an election that you went in thinking you were going to get a majority at the midway point you were thinking oh my god we could lose this and then managing to pull it out and ending up in roughly the same spot you were before that there&#39;d be a certain decompression i suppose i will say that has to happen there um but you wouldn&#39;t think that there would have to be a full reimagining</span>

Inflation is something everybody is talking about. People are being critical about the decisions that the government is making on travel. well, the government seems a little bit more responsive to the conservatives than I would have thought. Now, admittedly, inflation is a thing everywhere, right? You know, in political discourse, but they rode that horse early and they&#39;re riding it hard. And you saw it show up in the throne speech, which is not necessarily something that I think a government that was more in control of the agenda would have allowed at least the way and as strongly as it came out.</span>

However, do you feel like for the two of you that this could be a result of the command and conquer style of government that not just the liberals, but others have used in the past, the PMO centric, the bottleneck, the potential bottleneck strategy that everything goes through Carter, is that what you were alluding to with the transition planning? And by extension, do you feel like this could just be the nature of modern governments that have structurally designed themselves to go through a very small group of people for yays and nays on every single thing?</span>

Making sure that the government&#39;s running through, you know, to match the prime minister&#39;s vision. And it does slow everything down. You don&#39;t get to just get a simple yes or no. You have to wait until it&#39;s all cleared by the center and the center makes sure that everything is actually working the way it&#39;s supposed to.

Some of the cabinet positions that he&#39;s assigned to ministers have been split into two parlsecs. I mean, at this point, who isn&#39;t a parliamentary secretary?

And the past couple of cadres of parliamentary secretaries, including the ones in the late Harper days, have been similarly robust, shall we say. Unwieldy. Yeah, unwieldy. That&#39;s a great word for it. It does sort of blow my mind. The Canadian cabinet is very big relative to other countries. And I think part of that is you create a big cabinet to balance all of those regional pressures we&#39;ve talked about in the past, those demographic pressures. Is there every pressure that you can imagine as a prime minister you&#39;re trying to address? But then to sort of double it up by having all of these bloody parliamentary secretaries as well, who I have no doubt are doing good work, but it&#39;s</span>

And you create all sorts of additional pressures as you as you build out these titles. And I have no doubt that there are governments all over this country that are that are feeling that and there are organizers all over this country who are sort of nodding with fuck, do I feel that right now? Right? Because it&#39;s a it&#39;s a short term fix.</span>

So, you know, if I ruled the world, there There would be a cabinet that was probably two-thirds the size the cabinet is, and almost no parliamentary secretaries. I think that there&#39;s ways to manage it otherwise. Really, what&#39;s happened is you&#39;ve weakened the individual member to the point where they&#39;re bored.</span>

He is, you know, one can&#39;t argue he&#39;s making it an issue, but he&#39;s running, you know, pretty loose with the facts, trying to use selective facts on Switzerland, talking about hyperinflation, which is something that happens when we have got 10 times the amount of inflation that we have right now. as a political strategy for Pauly Everett. Clearly, he&#39;s making an impact, making this an issue. It&#39;s something we&#39;re talking about, inflation as a consequence. But playing hard and loose with the facts, fine, fabulous, or fucked in your mind is a political strategy for the conservatives. I</span>

            <span class="text">I think that this is, you know, it might be a short term gain as everything Pierre touches is a short term gain. He always pushes it too far.

Clearly he&#39;s trying to like bolster this argument that Canada&#39;s inflation is unique, that this sort of global thing that&#39;s happening should not weather Trudeau from the criticism and the political damage that he deserves. From your perspective, his strategy of kind of playing hard and loose with the facts here, fine, fabulous or fucked?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So you kind of put a bit of English on it at the end there. His strategy on making inflation like his cause celeb I think is fabulous and it&#39;s really worked for him. And when I think back a couple of months, and he had that video of like the two pieces of lumber, and we were making fun of that. And we thought, what an ass, right? But I mean, he has managed to tie the cautionary tale of inflation as a common to the Conservative Party. And they look somewhat prescient on this issue because of his efforts here. Because, yeah, it is a thing that is happening internationally. But lest we forget, you know, credit where credit&#39;s due. And I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m a Pierre Polyev enthusiast on an average day, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">When he started that issue, economists were the ones telling him he was wrong. You know, inflation was still within the guardrails. It was between 2% and 4%. What the hell are you doing, you jackass? But, of course, inflation has now gone outside of those guardrails, and it&#39;s gone further than that. And while it is a problem across the world, and while it seems to be driven largely by the supply side and, you know, supply chain problems, even things like the Ever Given going sideways in the Suez Canal are exacerbating it, right?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">You know, there is a reason why this election that just occurred, as inflation was coming up, the conservatives were the benefactor of that. That didn&#39;t mean that they won the election, but it was certainly a strong issue for them.</span>

He&#39;s reminding people that he and, by extension, the Conservative Party were the inflation hawks before anybody was worried about inflation. And let me tell you something. While inflation itself may be a somewhat esoteric concept most of the time,</span>

I&#39;m not letting milk slip by again. I probably I will for the next year. Carter, you know, any, I guess the point The point here is, Corey, to what you&#39;re saying, yes, they made an issue. And I think credit to the conservatives for making an issue, for keeping it alive, for putting something in their message box that is clearly considered a historical strength for conservative parties. I guess, Carter, my concern for the conservatives is that when they try to make this case, is this sort of hyperbolic version that Pierre Polyarif is trying to put out there going to pay – is it going to diminish that case? Is it actually going to be something that costs them politically at the end of the day? That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get to.</span>

Fine, fabulous, or fucked, a new poll saying that 18% of Albertans who responded to this poll would vote for Brian Jean as the next premier of this province if there was an Alberta provincial election. 15% would choose Jason Kenney. 51% would not vote for the UCP at all.

Now we&#39;ve got Gene on the quote-unquote polling ballot, if I can call it that. So maybe I&#39;ll ask you this question, Corey.

You had Brian Jean at 18 percent, Jason Kenney, 15 percent, Daniel Smith, 11 percent, Lila here, 3 percent, Derek Filderbrandt, 2 percent. I would not vote for the UCP, 51 percent. So interesting question. But, you know, a great example of kind of first past the post here, too, because another way to read that poll is only 15 percent of Albertans would vote for Jason Kenney. But because, you know, in a way, Daniel Smith split the vote, you know, Brian Jean, Jason Kenney, and Daniel Smith are so clustered at the top that I actually think that it&#39;s fine for Jason Kenney that this poll came out this way. Because in many ways, it looks like he&#39;s right there, just a point or two off Brian Jean.

Corey says you can&#39;t go over the top, but take me to the natural conclusion of where he might end up regardless in this particular lane he&#39;s picked on economy. Because what it&#39;s clearly trying to do, and it&#39;s very clear to political observers, is that the economy&#39;s coming back. He&#39;s trying to obviously position him being a big part of it. That because of me, the economy is coming back. I&#39;m laying out some very distilled elemental pieces. But that&#39;s ultimately what he wants people to think is, here&#39;s the facts. Here&#39;s my association with the facts. And if that&#39;s his goal, what do you kind of think this strategy might lead him to?</span>

If you&#39;re not ready to go into a tech job, then tech jobs aren&#39;t great. Right now, a significant part of our downturn was because of the downturn of oil and gas. We were hit by the double whammy, right? Right. The downturn in oil and gas starting in 2014 and then being hit with the pandemic starting in 2019, 2020. So that that leads us to twice, two times down. Right. What appears to be picking up is the pandemic losses. Great. But that doesn&#39;t address the oil and gas losses. Oil and gas is a great price. We shipped more barrels of oil last month than we&#39;ve ever shipped before. Fantastic. The provincial treasury is moving from $20 billion in deficits to $2 and $3 billion in deficits. This is unprecedented shifting since we lost natural gas in 2007. We can do a whole episode on natural gas surpluses versus heavy oil surpluses, which this could be the very first time that we&#39;ve seen. This is the most heavy oil royalties we&#39;ve ever seen.

Overrated or underrated, a group of young Canadians has launched a court challenge to lower Canada&#39;s minimum age for voting in federal elections. They&#39;re saying that the Canada Elections Act, which bars Canadians under 18 from voting in federal elections, is unconstitutional. This movement we&#39;ve seen before, this particular sort of wave of it, from your perspective in this particular time where they&#39;re arguing that the policies that our leaders are debating and implementing will affect their futures disproportionately, overrated or underrated this movement to lower the voting age as it stands in a 2021 world in your mind?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">watch this conversation with interest, right? The idea of where should the voting age be? And, you know, we&#39;ve all, and I say we&#39;ve all, but most of the world has gravitated to some range between the age of 16 and 21, and only very few nations on either 16 or 21. Most seem to have just sort of floated to 18 as a bit of a basis here. And that&#39;s always been interesting to me. There&#39;s nothing magical that happens to you as a human being when you turn 18, except we&#39;ve agreed this is the age when you can enter into contracts. So that seems like a pretty natural trigger for also being allowed to vote. And in many ways, a vote is a bit like a contract, right? That&#39;s one way to look at it. But when you think about it from a physiological point of view, maybe 25 would be a better age, right? Because all of a sudden, you know, that&#39;s when you&#39;re done fully developing.</span>

            <span class="text">But maybe that&#39;s not a great indicator, because on the other end, you start to degrade at a certain point. So maybe we need a maximum voting age at this point. Maybe on the younger side, it should be more about interest and capacity. But then how do you measure that? And how do you allow somebody to do that? Right? I just find it a fascinating conversation. I often wonder, is</span>

            <span class="text">I want to get this last topic on the agenda for tonight&#39;s show. But I want to mention, I want to spend a considerable amount of time on it going forward. What&#39;s happening in the States with the American Supreme Court ready to or on the verge, one might say, of overturning Roe v. Wade? Corey, from your perspective in terms of what this might mean to just democracy watchers everywhere, what it might have in terms of implications for Canada, I&#39;m going to frame it in our classic overrated, underrated way. But any thoughts you might have as we, you know, maybe do a more deeper dive later on this week or next? The question, overrated, underrated, the implications for broader democracy and human rights conversations in this country?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t know. I mean, there&#39;s two schools of thought. One is that something that happens in the United States becomes popular here with some leg, right? You know, Barack Obama in 2008, Justin Trudeau in 2015, that kind of vibe. So you might say if abortion rights go down in the United States, there&#39;s reason to believe they could go down here. Although, because in both cases, both in the United States and Canada, it was the courts that brought in the right to an abortion. Canada much later than the United States, by</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">way. It&#39;s somewhat hard to believe that we would end up in the same circumstance here because our court has not been gamed the way the American court has over the years. And like the years, right? This goes way back. There was belief by Republicans that Roe v. Wade would be overturned in 89 or 90, I can&#39;t remember the year. But we&#39;ve</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ve not followed that track in many, many senses here. The other thing is it could in many ways enshrine support for abortion because you&#39;re going to see, thanks to trigger laws that are on the books, and I believe 22 states in the United States, if Roe v. Wade goes down, abortion is illegal like the</span>

            <span class="text">and so um you are going to get a lot of human misery stories coming out of that and it could be a cautionary tale for canadians um as as we sort of look south of the border as as unfortunately America has become in many, many cases right now. So tough to say, but obviously something to watch carefully. And, you know, people will be affected by this. People will be affected dramatically. And I wonder how many Americans are thinking about it in too abstract of terms right now, because it&#39;s about to become very non-abstract for a lot of people, a lot of people&#39;s families, a lot of people&#39;s friends.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, same question to you. I know we wanted to spend more time on it, and we will, but But Roe v. Wade, as it relates to perhaps implications here in Canada, overrated, underrated in your mind?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s underrated. I think it&#39;s underrated for a couple of reasons. First of all, I mean, I don&#39;t want to predict a backlash because it makes me nervous in the States. I never know what&#39;s going to happen down there. But about 65% of Americans don&#39;t want this decision to go away. They don&#39;t want to lose Roe v. Wade. So this is actually probably going to be a pretty unpopular decision. And it could, in fact, spike up Democratic support for 2022, which would be very helpful for Biden and, of course, very helpful for the Democrats and arguably, I would suggest, for the United States in general. I&#39;m not hoping for this, though. I think that this will hurt many women&#39;s lives and more than we are perhaps willing to understand. understand. This is one of those still secret things that happens to people that we don&#39;t talk about and we pretend doesn&#39;t exist. We all pretend like we don&#39;t know anybody that&#39;s been in this situation. We all do know someone. We just may not know the specifics of it.</span>
