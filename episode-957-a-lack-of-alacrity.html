        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the slow start to Trudeau's third term, the state of the Conservative Party and Kenney's messaging going into 2022. Does Canada have enough Parliamentary Secretaries? Was Erin O'Toole's "free vote" pledge wise? And when is the live show in Abbotsford? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

Flair Airlines, there&#39;s a difference between going and getting somewhere. All right, guys, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Our first segment, Fine, Fabulous, or Fucked. You know, we do this as a roundup of so many stories, and especially for those who&#39;ve missed our Microsoft Zoom run. We want to take some of the stories that we may have missed covering in the masses. We want to cover some of the stories that are being talked about right now. We&#39;ll use our very simple, very fun scale of fine, fabulous, or fucked. You will answer the question based on a bit of a blurb that I&#39;ll give you about the situation. You&#39;ll tell me whether it&#39;s fine, whether it&#39;s fabulous, or whether it&#39;s fucked for a party, a political figure, a person that I highlight for you. And there&#39;s no better way to start than to start. Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. The liberals on their border closures being criticized heavily that the border closures for the new Omicron variant aren&#39;t very useful, don&#39;t really work, are performative, being criticized, of course, for the broader conversations on vaccine equity. We&#39;ll get to that. But, Carter, on border closures and the politics for the liberals, are they fine? Is it actually fabulous, the border closures that they&#39;ve done? If one of the metrics you&#39;re keeping time with is they&#39;ve done it a lot quicker than they have in the past, or is this fucked?</div>

Throughout the course of the pandemic, they&#39;ve been hit hard on the question of border closures by the conservatives, federally, by Doug Ford, provincially.

I think in many ways, governments are input-output devices, and because they got hammered previously for not acting quickly, they decided to act quickly in this case. Was it the right move? I don&#39;t know. It might actually be more popular than what could be the right move, which is to keep borders open and have people moving around. So do I think that they&#39;re fucked?

What would you have structured it, Stephen? Maybe I&#39;ll start with you, then Corey, go to you. Same question.

Inflation is something everybody is talking about.

Now, admittedly, inflation is a thing everywhere, right? You know, in political discourse, but they rode that horse early and they&#39;re riding it hard. And you saw it show up in the throne speech, which is not necessarily something that I think a government that was more in control of the agenda would have allowed at least the way and as strongly as it came out.</div>

However, do you feel like for the two of you that this could be a result of the command and conquer style of government that not just the liberals, but others have used in the past, the PMO centric, the bottleneck, the potential bottleneck strategy that everything goes through Carter, is that what you were alluding to with the transition planning? And by extension, do you feel like this could just be the nature of modern governments that have structurally designed themselves to go through a very small group of people for yays and nays on every single thing?</div>

Making sure that the government&#39;s running through, you know, to match the prime minister&#39;s vision. And it does slow everything down. You don&#39;t get to just get a simple yes or no. You have to wait until it&#39;s all cleared by the center and the center makes sure that everything is actually working the way it&#39;s supposed to.

The Liberals on Friday, the prime minister&#39;s office, as we were just chatting about, introducing their parliamentary secretaries, long awaited, 37 of them on the list. Some of the cabinet positions that he&#39;s assigned to ministers have been split into two parlsecs. I mean, at this point, who isn&#39;t a parliamentary secretary?

That&#39;s a great word for it. It does sort of blow my mind. The Canadian cabinet is very big relative to other countries. And I think part of that is you create a big cabinet to balance all of those regional pressures we&#39;ve talked about in the past, those demographic pressures. Is there every pressure that you can imagine as a prime minister you&#39;re trying to address?

And I have no doubt that there are governments all over this country that are that are feeling that and there are organizers all over this country who are sort of nodding with fuck, do I feel that right now?

But I mean, he has managed to tie the cautionary tale of inflation as a common to the Conservative Party. And they look somewhat prescient on this issue because of his efforts here.

It&#39;s clearly not the case here, Carter, that, you know, at least for O&#39;Toole&#39;s enemies within the party, they haven&#39;t ousted him yet. And it seems like they may not between now and the end of the year. I might ask you that same question, but maybe tag on a cousin of it, which is we&#39;ve seen a version of this movie so many times. What is kind of the next scene in this movie or what&#39;s the next act in this movie that if you are whispering in O&#39;Toole&#39;s ear that he should be aware of? It kind of seems like, you know, the waters are not very aggressive right now, but there will be another chapter here. What do you think it will be for him?</div>

Now we&#39;ve got Gene on the quote-unquote polling ballot, if I can call it that. So maybe I&#39;ll ask you this question, Corey.

          <div class="said">Yeah. So which potential UCP leadership candidate would you be most likely to vote for in the next Alberta provincial election? You had Brian Jean at 18 percent, Jason Kenney, 15 percent, Daniel Smith, 11 percent, Lila here, 3 percent, Derek Filderbrandt, 2 percent. I would not vote for the UCP, 51 percent. So interesting question. But, you know, a great example of kind of first past the post here, too, because another way to read that poll is only 15 percent of Albertans would vote for Jason Kenney. But because, you know, in a way, Daniel Smith split the vote, you know, Brian Jean, Jason Kenney, and Daniel Smith are so clustered at the top that I actually think that it&#39;s fine for Jason Kenney that this poll came out this way. Because in many ways, it looks like he&#39;s right there, just a point or two off Brian Jean.

And I don&#39;t mean like a chilling effect, but I mean, like the Gen Z version of have chill on when you&#39;re talking about the the economy heating up, like, you know, be confident? Or do you would you have suggested his very boisterous, positive, like fire breathing, it&#39;s back, we&#39;re back, we&#39;re going to lead the country approach that he has right now. What do you think would be the most effective for his political fortunes? I see you heading towards perhaps the version that he&#39;s not doing right now, but perhaps justified for me a bit.</div>

That&#39;s a big number of people who are currently being left behind and a large number of those people may be left behind for longer. Because of course, the industries that are coming back may not be the ones that they had left. So you can currently get a job in retail. Good. Lots of people need retail jobs. I&#39;m pleased that it&#39;s coming back. But if you were a former oil and gas geologist, and now you&#39;re being asked to be a retail specialist at the Gap, you know, you&#39;re not thinking that&#39;s necessarily a step forward for you.

Corey says you can&#39;t go over the top, but take me to the natural conclusion of where he might end up regardless in this particular lane he&#39;s picked on economy. Because what it&#39;s clearly trying to do, and it&#39;s very clear to political observers, is that the economy&#39;s coming back. He&#39;s trying to obviously position him being a big part of it. That because of me, the economy is coming back. I&#39;m laying out some very distilled elemental pieces. But that&#39;s ultimately what he wants people to think is, here&#39;s the facts. Here&#39;s my association with the facts. And if that&#39;s his goal, what do you kind of think this strategy might lead him to?</div>

You know, the jobs that are coming in, I mentioned retail before, but let&#39;s throw in tech. Tech jobs are great if you&#39;re tech trained, if you&#39;re ready to go into a tech job. If you&#39;re not ready to go into a tech job, then tech jobs aren&#39;t great. Right now, a significant part of our downturn was because of the downturn of oil and gas. We were hit by the double whammy, right? Right. The downturn in oil and gas starting in 2014 and then being hit with the pandemic starting in 2019, 2020. So that that leads us to twice, two times down. Right. What appears to be picking up is the pandemic losses. Great. But that doesn&#39;t address the oil and gas losses. Oil and gas is a great price. We shipped more barrels of oil last month than we&#39;ve ever shipped before. Fantastic. The provincial treasury is moving from $20 billion in deficits to $2 and $3 billion in deficits. This is unprecedented shifting since we lost natural gas in 2007. We can do a whole episode on natural gas surpluses versus heavy oil surpluses, which this could be the very first time that we&#39;ve seen. This is the most heavy oil royalties we&#39;ve ever seen.

Overrated or underrated, a group of young Canadians has launched a court challenge to lower Canada&#39;s minimum age for voting in federal elections. They&#39;re saying that the Canada Elections Act, which bars Canadians under 18 from voting in federal elections, is unconstitutional. This movement we&#39;ve seen before, this particular sort of wave of it, from your perspective in this particular time where they&#39;re arguing that the policies that our leaders are debating and implementing will affect their futures disproportionately, overrated or underrated this movement to lower the voting age as it stands in a 2021 world in your mind?

          <div class="said">watch this conversation with interest, right? The idea of where should the voting age be? And, you know, we&#39;ve all, and I say we&#39;ve all, but most of the world has gravitated to some range between the age of 16 and 21, and only very few nations on either 16 or 21. Most seem to have just sort of floated to 18 as a bit of a basis here. And that&#39;s always been interesting to me. There&#39;s nothing magical that happens to you as a human being when you turn 18, except we&#39;ve agreed this is the age when you can enter into contracts. So that seems like a pretty natural trigger for also being allowed to vote. And in many ways, a vote is a bit like a contract, right? That&#39;s one way to look at it. But when you think about it from a physiological point of view, maybe 25 would be a better age, right? Because all of a sudden, you know, that&#39;s when you&#39;re done fully developing.</div>

          <div class="said">But maybe that&#39;s not a great indicator, because on the other end, you start to degrade at a certain point. So maybe we need a maximum voting age at this point. Maybe on the younger side, it should be more about interest and capacity. But then how do you measure that? And how do you allow somebody to do that? Right? I just find it a fascinating conversation.

What&#39;s happening in the States with the American Supreme Court ready to or on the verge, one might say, of overturning Roe v. Wade? Corey, from your perspective in terms of what this might mean to just democracy watchers everywhere, what it might have in terms of implications for Canada, I&#39;m going to frame it in our classic overrated, underrated way. But any thoughts you might have as we, you know, maybe do a more deeper dive later on this week or next?

          <div class="said">Well, I don&#39;t know. I mean, there&#39;s two schools of thought. One is that something that happens in the United States becomes popular here with some leg, right? You know, Barack Obama in 2008, Justin Trudeau in 2015, that kind of vibe. So you might say if abortion rights go down in the United States, there&#39;s reason to believe they could go down here. Although, because in both cases, both in the United States and Canada, it was the courts that brought in the right to an abortion. Canada much later than the United States, by</div>

          <div class="said">way. It&#39;s somewhat hard to believe that we would end up in the same circumstance here because our court has not been gamed the way the American court has over the years. And like the years, right? This goes way back. There was belief by Republicans that Roe v. Wade would be overturned in 89 or 90, I can&#39;t remember the year. But we&#39;ve</div>

So tough to say, but obviously something to watch carefully. And, you know, people will be affected by this. People will be affected dramatically. And I wonder how many Americans are thinking about it in too abstract of terms right now, because it&#39;s about to become very non-abstract for a lot of people, a lot of people&#39;s families, a lot of people&#39;s friends.</div>

          <div class="said">I think it&#39;s underrated. I think it&#39;s underrated for a couple of reasons. First of all, I mean, I don&#39;t want to predict a backlash because it makes me nervous in the States. I never know what&#39;s going to happen down there. But about 65% of Americans don&#39;t want this decision to go away. They don&#39;t want to lose Roe v. Wade. So this is actually probably going to be a pretty unpopular decision. And it could, in fact, spike up Democratic support for 2022, which would be very helpful for Biden and, of course, very helpful for the Democrats and arguably, I would suggest, for the United States in general. I&#39;m not hoping for this, though. I think that this will hurt many women&#39;s lives and more than we are perhaps willing to understand. understand. This is one of those still secret things that happens to people that we don&#39;t talk about and we pretend doesn&#39;t exist.
