            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We call that white noise, and it is an acceptable term on this podcast that Stephen has approved of. He has given the stamp of approval to white noise, which is what he emanates from his mouth and other orifices. He wanted the other orifices part included. Did</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Did we really have to do that part? No, no, he did. He</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">No, no, he did want it this way. He, in fact, signed off on it this way. I do like talking about Stephen as if he&#39;s dead. See live episode. episode. But that&#39;s just part and parcel of elements of his political career, which I&#39;m sure he&#39;s trying to revive right now in some backroom corner, which is why he&#39;s not here, Shannon. By the way, before we get started, let&#39;s put bets on what Stephen Carter&#39;s next project will be. And what do you think it should be? Since he&#39;s not here, I&#39;m calling an audible. What do you think Stephen Carter&#39;s next project will be? And what do you think Stephen Carter&#39;s next project should be? Now, for those that know Stephen only as the voice, the white noise, previously mentioned of this podcast, Nahid Nenshi,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Alison Redford, Jyoti Gondak has taken swings outside of this province that have not gone so well, but he&#39;s tried. Marla Hall-Finley for Liberal Leadership Price, the one won by Justin Trudeau, taking some swings in British Columbia, I believe also in Ontario. So what I&#39;m trying to say there, Shannon, is that the world is Stephen Carter&#39;s oyster.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Where will he go and where should he go next?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t know if if it&#39;s a will or should but uh the ontario liberals are in quite a pickle uh and uh not that i wish them success um because i wish my own orange team success there uh but they could sure use some some focused work uh and who they are what they stand for and where they need to communicate into so uh that&#39;s that&#39;s a political operation that could use some life um newfoundland Non-liberals, similarly, could use some life. And there I would wish Carter a bit more success than I would in Ontario. But those are two political organizations that could use help. If he spoke French, the Quebec liberals are imploding currently</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">currently over a corruption scandal. So I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">want him to go from a human level to go into that, but could certainly use some crisis management support. support?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So we&#39;ve got, this is good. I like this, Shannon. So we&#39;ve got the Newfoundland Liberals, the Quebec Liberals with an asterisk, the Ontario Liberals. I&#39;m going to add Carter&#39;s Vengeance Act. I don&#39;t know when this is, but I believe it should be coming up soon. Vancouver Municipal. Vancouver. I think Carter wants a second go at that. And then the final thing I&#39;ll add back on the table is, even though there&#39;s no election, I think Carter wants to run in Calgary again. So I think I think I&#39;m going to say revive the Calgary party for an election that he sets and tries to mobilize his supporters for. I feel like that&#39;s what Carter might do next.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not sure if reviving the Calgary party is possible, aren&#39;t they? We&#39;ve got t-shirts.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t even know where mine is. I think it went in the Value Village pile. I&#39;ll be honest.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">By the way, great marketplace expose on Value Village. I would suggest watching. It was part of my algorithm yesterday on YouTube. Not always a a deal not always a deal but you can find things like calgary party t-shirts which i&#39;m not sure you can find anywhere else uh haxum we&#39;ll do a poll on this we&#39;ll ask we&#39;ll ask the patreon listeners where should carter go next i&#39;m sure that&#39;s a domain name we can purchase at where should carter go next.ca um just very close by to his uh offer of speaking gigs uh which are either i believe ten thousand dollars or free for the exact same speech yeah which is good uh shannon it&#39;s just you and i carter has officially bailed although we&#39;ve spent five minutes talking about about him. I wanted to talk about the most important story in Canadian politics. No, it is not the prime minister stalking the First Nations. It is not the fact that the feds gave Stellantis more than $200 million or that Algoma Steel is now revealing that the feds knew about their plans to lay off before giving them half a million, half a billion, I&#39;m sorry, not half a million, half a billion dollars. No, Shannon, it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s the National press gallery dinner.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It is the celebration that is perhaps most equivalent to what we&#39;ve seen in the United States, where the White House correspondents come together. It&#39;s something called the White House Correspondents Dinner. But this is different. And I want to talk in particular about one speaker that I think is making the rounds, at least in media. But I For those that may not be aware, Shannon, what are these press gallery dinners? Like give folks that may have vaguely heard about them what they are. Who&#39;s invited? What&#39;s the tone? Who hosts it? And I suspect you&#39;ve been a part of one or two yourself, if I&#39;m not mistaken.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;ve never been to a federal one. So all of my experiences are going to be at the Alberta level where I&#39;ve attended them going back to the Klein years. I haven&#39;t been in the last few years, but maybe I went a couple of years ago. But the Alberta ones are, of course, a lot smaller. But federally, they&#39;re a lot more fancy. They&#39;re a lot bigger. And the press gallery are the organizations that pay to be part of the press gallery. It&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">actual membership organization, or at least it is here. And so you have to be a member of the press gallery. So that&#39;s all the major media outlets. And then some others that are smaller or more niche, like Politico or those kinds of folks. Right. In addition to the big broadcasters, the big newspapers. And so they throw an annual party. And in Canada, it usually involves either leaders getting up to make individual speeches in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">in which they are expected to be funny. And everyone&#39;s decked out in their finest, like literally men in tuxes, right? This is not just, you know, put on your Moors everyday suit. It&#39;s quite a bit fancier than that. The women are in literal gowns. And the leaders get up and make fun of themselves. Their speech is typically in the eight minute range, eight to 10, seven to nine kind of deal. deal um if it goes longer it uh usually sucks uh uh see francois blanchett this year and who went like 20 plus minutes i think 30 uh and you know to the point where people are yelling at him to get off the stage um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">um but they&#39;re supposed to be like um they&#39;re not off the record federally they are in alberta oh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah so the broadcast that we like the the reason i&#39;m bringing this up is because one speaker, and I&#39;m not going to bury the lead, Don Davies, I think, absolutely crushed it. And it&#39;s now making the social media rounds. That&#39;s not the case in Alberta. We actually don&#39;t get to see what happens there. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">And so we can get into what they do because they are infinitely more hilarious and risque because they are meant to be off the record. Like, I have seen wild jokes. Like, I have seen the emcee do jokes at, you know, Ralph Klein&#39;s drinking habit expense with him in the room when he was premier. year right well obviously he was premier uh but uh like yeah just um really like over the line stuff uh and which is fine right uh but um it&#39;s off the record for a reason um but in in uh federally they broadcasted on cpac and i mean my experience of these uh things of watching them over the years or watching coverage or hearing people talk about them was the jack was never ever all that funny you would think that jack layton with the kind of personality was he was very given to making fun of himself he was fine with all of that right a very affable person a very authentic person he was just he just never could i don&#39;t know if it was timing or whatever like he he never quite landed it um other uh unexpected leaders could uh you know sort of of land the jokes. And not surprisingly, this year, Carney is pretty, he&#39;s known for being quite dry and, and being able to poke a little bit of fun of himself up to a point. He did a good job. But Don, who as interim leader, really kind of, you know, almost let people behind</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">the curtain of what it&#39;s like to be a new Democrat these days. And I think that&#39;s why it was was successful yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah i i tend to agree with that and i think he started this his clip which is about like five minutes or so you can find it online um and it&#39;s being praised by his political opponents and the media and and of course himself alike um he starts with my pronouns are broken and relevant which i think just sets the tone for for what that um speech looks like good</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">thinking behind it. There is strategy behind it. There is goals that folks have. Frankly, there&#39;s a balancing act behind it, which is, in Davey&#39;s case, and some may think he may have broken the barrier between saying this is self-deprecation and I have no confidence in the institution I represent sort of thing, you know, to each their own. But let&#39;s talk about that in a second. But, Shannon, I have to hear about Alberta. So it&#39;s not recorded. Like, the jokes are risque. Tell me about, like, the setting, the format. like give me the the almost the the narrative fiction sort of setup here like what what does the room look like who attends uh do all mlas attend is is is it almost expected uh give me like a a sense of of of the room and and what happens then further on etc yeah</span>

Did you learn from this in terms of who should make fun of themselves in the sense that, is there a limitation on certain folks that shouldn&#39;t? Or did you feel like your experience here was that this was net benefits? Because I will then translate this to the federal side of things with the Davies speech in particular and Pierre Pauliev, who, by the way, made an appearance in a skit like format and then in the subsequent speech. But did it kind of teach you about like who should make fun of themselves, who didn&#39;t or who couldn&#39;t? And I guess my follow up question to that is, did the press treat you any differently or better or sympathetically based on this? Like, did the moments of that off the record evening have any sort of ramifications in terms of how folks were seen? I&#39;m just I&#39;m curious. I mean, we&#39;re human at the end of the day. I think the media would probably end up saying, no, of course not. But I&#39;m curious to get your reaction to both of those things.</span>

And so people didn&#39;t have a problem being nice to us. And it&#39;s different now. But I think it is so, so important. And it is one of those moments in the year when people can come together. And quite frankly, who should make fun of themselves? Literally everyone, except for maybe the sergeant at arms. like everyone uh should be um able to to do this because at the end of the day you are in close proximity to one another you know the floor of the house isn&#39;t that big you&#39;re there for hours at a time uh in the old days the press used to be on site as well right uh being able to um see each other as people uh there is a tone there that goes out to the public i and</span>

Broadcast the Alberta version of this, because even if people have to downgrade their sense of you, assuming it&#39;s still a version of what you&#39;ve attended, which is hilarious, self-deprecating about civility and camaraderie at the end of the day. broadcast the alberta version even if that means people censor themselves a bit because the democratic upside in terms of what that broadcasts to people even if it&#39;s a narrow group of people within the province is more helpful than keeping that thing off the record and gated it</span>

I am curious as to whether like the NDP would even agree in that sense, because I agree with you. I think they could be funny. I think that has an extremely witty person to start with. And you&#39;ve got our entire caucus that could probably do a great job. And some try to on a daily basis evoke a sense of humor. So to be clear, I think I agree with you on that premise. But from a strategy perspective, there might be, I don&#39;t want to give any opportunity to humanize Daniel Smith at all.

I&#39;m curious to get your take on this. Was this a net W for him and the party? and does it have any level of long tail beyond this conversation which might be the last one that someone is going to have publicly about it before we head into the christmas season and forget that it ever happened or would you say that you know there could be a there there in terms of what this could mean for for the party and how it&#39;s seen well</span>

Or do you feel like self-deprecating day-to-day is just handing yourself a meme to the other side based on our culture? It&#39;s a question I fundamentally struggle with, if I&#39;m being honest. There&#39;s parts of me that says, fuck it, what do you have to lose? If they want to disingenuously try to use what you&#39;ve said in a self-deprecating fashion as clickbait or an attack meme, let them. Probably doesn&#39;t have much mileage. The other part of me is like, why would you do that when it doesn&#39;t sort of meet the moment? And it&#39;s so offside, so zagging when everyone&#39;s zigging on how they communicate sort of thing.

            <span class="text">And it&#39;s absolutely true. Mamdani found a playbook, which we&#39;ve used quite often in Canadian politics. See Nenshi 2010, when he ran a very negative campaign for mayor as an underdog, but had a smile on his face the whole time while doing it, looking like a joyful, witty, young, sub-40-something orator, but like running a very negative campaign saying some extremely harsh things with a smile on your face lets you get away with stuff so i think there&#39;s a pathway in our politics for that i think maybe it&#39;s been abandoned or perhaps needs a bit of a revival it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">right so right like so i mean how jack did it was the top two-thirds of his message was just blisteringly negative uh but then he would uh be able to exit out of that and do an offer to people or an optimism that seemed genuine because it was. And in a product of his 20 plus years in politics prior to that, people forget that, right? That before he became leader of the NDP, he had been in Toronto, like elected in Toronto politics since the early 80s. So he had done so much of this and he was able to deliver that bottom third happy part in a way that seemed authentic to him. uh and and sometimes he was funny uh but just not at the press gallery dinner</span>

I don&#39;t think I&#39;m outing her stand-up comedy career on this podcast, but that brought me a tremendous amount of joy and a back-and-forth conversation with her around our favorite comedians, which, by the way, I will say, rebutting Shannon&#39;s extremely sexist take that women are not funny, the funniest comedian in the world, Maria</span>

Polyev, long seen as the guy who couldn&#39;t take a joke, but then shows up while Chris Wilson, Canadian gem of 22 Minutes, is doing a Pierre Polyev impersonation. And the two of them have a bit together where they put on glasses and bite into an apple. And then Polyev shows up and does his thing. I&#39;m curious what you think Team Polyev was trying to do here. I always add an added calculation. calculation. I don&#39;t think it was just to be funny, because if he wanted to be funny, there was many avenues and many opportunities. And this platform was available to him many, many times to do so. Do you think there was a this moment calculation that Pierre-Paul Lievre walked into within that room? I certainly do. But I&#39;m curious to get... What</span>

But the fact that he was aided by by someone who often plays him on on skit television and then gives a pretty like not as good as Davies and I think not as good as some of the other leaders. But, you know, down the middle speech attends, you know, and kind of gives an A for effort, I think does enough for at least a momentary portion to add a couple of grains of sand into that container that they need to fill on likability. Maybe to me, if I&#39;m reading tea leaves or in this case grains of sand, it is an acknowledgment that likability isn&#39;t bullshit and that people do care about it. I&#39;m not saying pure poly of changing who he is. don&#39;t get me wrong but that they&#39;re they&#39;re trying they&#39;re going to try with some set pieces to make that happen this is this is my my take</span>

And then, you know, Don Davies goes and steals the show, which is funny. He had some stuff in his bit that was kind of for his space, right?</span>

I&#39;m talking to the media. I actually am kind of funny. You know, I can participate in the usual trappings of how the institutions govern themselves, you know, i.e. the press gallery and their rhythms and their traditions and all of that. Uh, uh, and I mean, if anything, it&#39;s a message to the media that like Pierre Polyever is maybe doing things differently, right? So it&#39;s just a, an ability for, for them to weave that in to, you know, uh, as a proof point of maybe he&#39;s changing a little bit. I</span>

I also think there&#39;s just something to be said about Katie Merrifield, who&#39;s now joined as Pierre Polyever&#39;s communications directors as his friend of the show, former, um, you BC operative and strategist, and if I&#39;m not mistaken, also worked in Alberta as the executive director of communications and</span>

            <span class="text">Polyev&#39;s DCOM. I think it&#39;s been five, six months on that. This might be an element, and maybe she was brought in for this purpose to kind of highlight this as well. So I think there&#39;s something to be said there. Shannon, look at this. We&#39;ve hit 40 minutes on this topic that I thought we&#39;d probably have five minutes for.</span>

Yeah, we don&#39;t care about them. I bet they&#39;ve taken nothing away. And you know what? At least we&#39;ve been white noise, which is what Stephen would have wanted while they do their dishes. It is what Stephen would have wanted. We&#39;re going to leave it there. That&#39;s a wrap on episode 1897 of The Strategist.
