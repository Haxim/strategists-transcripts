          <p>Zain Velji and Shannon Phillips dive into the weird, wonderful world of press-gallery comedy, from Don Davies’ viral self-roast to Pierre Poilievre’s carefully staged moment. How does the Press Gallery dinner work and does it still matter? What does "joyful negativity" look like in practice? And does the lack of "white noise" make the podcast any easier to listen to? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p>

By the way, before we get started, let&#39;s put bets on what Stephen Carter&#39;s next project will be. And what do you think it should be? Since he&#39;s not here, I&#39;m calling an audible.

And then the final thing I&#39;ll add back on the table is, even though there&#39;s no election, I think Carter wants to run in Calgary again. So I think I think I&#39;m going to say revive the Calgary party for an election that he sets and tries to mobilize his supporters for. I feel like that&#39;s what Carter might do next.</div>

I wanted to talk about the most important story in Canadian politics. No, it is not the prime minister stalking the First Nations. It is not the fact that the feds gave Stellantis more than $200 million or that Algoma Steel is now revealing that the feds knew about their plans to lay off before giving them half a million, half a billion, I&#39;m sorry, not half a million, half a billion dollars.

It&#39;s something called the White House Correspondents Dinner. But this is different. And I want to talk in particular about one speaker that I think is making the rounds, at least in media. But I For those that may not be aware, Shannon, what are these press gallery dinners? Like give folks that may have vaguely heard about them what they are. Who&#39;s invited? What&#39;s the tone? Who hosts it? And I suspect you&#39;ve been a part of one or two yourself, if I&#39;m not mistaken.</div>

I haven&#39;t been in the last few years, but maybe I went a couple of years ago. But the Alberta ones are, of course, a lot smaller. But federally, they&#39;re a lot more fancy.

Their speech is typically in the eight minute range, eight to 10, seven to nine kind of deal. deal um if it goes longer it uh usually sucks uh uh see francois blanchett this year and who went like 20 plus minutes i think 30 uh and you know to the point where people are yelling at him to get off the stage um</div>

Like, I have seen the emcee do jokes at, you know, Ralph Klein&#39;s drinking habit expense with him in the room when he was premier. year right well obviously he was premier uh but uh like yeah just um really like over the line stuff uh and which is fine right uh but um it&#39;s off the record for a reason um but in in uh federally they broadcasted on cpac and i mean my experience of these uh things of watching them over the years or watching coverage or hearing people talk about them was the jack was never ever all that funny you would think that jack layton with the kind of personality was he was very given to making fun of himself he was fine with all of that right a very affable person a very authentic person he was just he just never could i don&#39;t know if it was timing or whatever like he he never quite landed it um other uh unexpected leaders could uh you know sort of of land the jokes. And not surprisingly, this year, Carney is pretty, he&#39;s known for being quite dry and, and being able to poke a little bit of fun of himself up to a point. He did a good job.

Did you learn from this in terms of who should make fun of themselves in the sense that, is there a limitation on certain folks that shouldn&#39;t? Or did you feel like your experience here was that this was net benefits? Because I will then translate this to the federal side of things with the Davies speech in particular and Pierre Pauliev, who, by the way, made an appearance in a skit like format and then in the subsequent speech. But did it kind of teach you about like who should make fun of themselves, who didn&#39;t or who couldn&#39;t? And I guess my follow up question to that is, did the press treat you any differently or better or sympathetically based on this? Like, did the moments of that off the record evening have any sort of ramifications in terms of how folks were seen? I&#39;m just I&#39;m curious. I mean, we&#39;re human at the end of the day. I think the media would probably end up saying, no, of course not. But I&#39;m curious to get your reaction to both of those things.</div>

And you&#39;ve got our entire caucus that could probably do a great job. And some try to on a daily basis evoke a sense of humor. So to be clear, I think I agree with you on that premise. But from a strategy perspective, there might be, I don&#39;t want to give any opportunity to humanize Daniel Smith at all.

There&#39;s parts of me that says, fuck it, what do you have to lose? If they want to disingenuously try to use what you&#39;ve said in a self-deprecating fashion as clickbait or an attack meme, let them. Probably doesn&#39;t have much mileage. The other part of me is like, why would you do that when it doesn&#39;t sort of meet the moment? And it&#39;s so offside, so zagging when everyone&#39;s zigging on how they communicate sort of thing.

See Nenshi 2010, when he ran a very negative campaign for mayor as an underdog, but had a smile on his face the whole time while doing it, looking like a joyful, witty, young, sub-40-something orator, but like running a very negative campaign saying some extremely harsh things with a smile on your face lets you get away with stuff so i think there&#39;s a pathway in our politics for that i think maybe it&#39;s been abandoned or perhaps needs a bit of a revival it&#39;s</div>

And in a product of his 20 plus years in politics prior to that, people forget that, right? That before he became leader of the NDP, he had been in Toronto, like elected in Toronto politics since the early 80s. So he had done so much of this and he was able to deliver that bottom third happy part in a way that seemed authentic to him. uh and and sometimes he was funny uh but just not at the press gallery dinner</div>

But, you know, down the middle speech attends, you know, and kind of gives an A for effort, I think does enough for at least a momentary portion to add a couple of grains of sand into that container that they need to fill on likability.
