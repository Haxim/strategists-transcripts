            <span class="text">okay let&#39;s let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about this let&#39;s move it on to our first segment our first segment moving the goalposts steven carter this is your time what are we doing today late late on to people we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we are going to talk about democracy we&#39;re going to talk about how democracy works the types of democracy that are available to us what the pros and cons are of each different type and why you would choose one over the other. Because there&#39;s this kind of mythology that if you have a certain type of representation, it&#39;s going to be better than another type of representation. The proportional representation advocates are out there saying, PR will change our world. Yeah, it will change our world, but will it change it for the better? And the people who like single transferable vote, Or my favorite, the guys who love direct democracy.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">favorite guys because they know that their system would be better. So Stephen, you&#39;re clearly on a high. This means a lot to you. This is your be all end all. This is your everything. I know there&#39;s probably some listeners right now being like, I don&#39;t give a shit about this. But let&#39;s tease them into it because this is an issue that matters more than just the one out of the 1400 days that you vote every four years. This is a huge, huge issue with implications politically, strategically, everywhere. Is that not true, Stephen?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Stephen? Well, I mean, I cannot remember, and Corey, you&#39;ll help me on this. I cannot remember the last time a governing party got a majority of votes.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I honestly don&#39;t know when the last time it happened in Canada was. I don&#39;t think it happened since the advent, essentially, of the NDP, and I&#39;m not even sure that it happened before then. So we&#39;re talking at least 60 years. I mean, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, Corey&#39;s busy Googling. So at some point, we&#39;ll have an answer to this question. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we are not governed by a majority of the people when</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">when we are governed by a majority in government.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And that changes your outcomes. So in Alberta, we&#39;re used to majority governments where a majority gets the, you know, like oftentimes the progressive conservatives get the majority of the votes.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But in the federal level, that is not the case. It hasn&#39;t been since. Corey is silent.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">1984. It actually hasn&#39;t been that. Oh, it hasn&#39;t been that long. But before that, I mean, it has been a very long time. The last election before that. So the only two times in kind of modern history have been Diefenbaker&#39;s big majority and then, of course, the big Mulroney majority. The big Mulroney win.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So only Tories can get over half the vote, apparently. So maybe they shouldn&#39;t be so concerned about proportional representation. We&#39;ll</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;ll get into the models, but I want people to all be on the same page because I think that&#39;s really important. So, Corey, tease us a little bit. Give us a little bit of an understanding as to why this is a big deal. what&#39;s currently broken with the system carter told us a little bit about the majority but what else needs remedying in the current system i don&#39;t know i don&#39;t know about</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">about broken i mean that almost prejudges the issue but right now the liberals won an election and part of it was on a platform that included among other things that this would be the last quote first past the post election in in canadian history like we we were only going to elect first past the post one more time the liberals were pretty clear they were then going to change it to something else was Was it proportional? Was it a single transferable vote? We&#39;ll talk more about that mouthful in a minute, I&#39;m sure. But Trudeau said, I think my preference is towards STV, single transferable vote. But it may be proportional. Who knows? And that was one of the promises that he was elected on. And if you believe that people vote for more than just hair, then you have to sort of say, OK, the liberals did say that was part of their platform. And they didn&#39;t say after a referendum. Actually, they said quite the opposite. No, this is it. This is done. This is the last election. This is going to happen. So now the conservatives are saying, murder,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">murder, murder, murder. This is awful. How could you do this? We need to go to a referendum. What a bloody outrage. Well, which I think, by the way, and we can talk a bit more about this in a bit, is a little rich. First of all, internally, the conservatives elect by like a ranked ballot their leadership candidates. Yeah. It&#39;s funny. Right? So good enough for the party but not the nation. And the other thing is they tried to impose it on the nation.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">We&#39;re not talking about 50 years ago, 40 years ago, 30 years ago. We&#39;re talking less than 10 years ago. the bill that was going to create Senate elections, the Senate elections were going to be by single transferable vote. Very interesting. There&#39;s no referendum on that. In fact, it was we&#39;re just putting some legislation forward. And let&#39;s see how it goes. Okay,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, that&#39;s helpful. So for those who don&#39;t have the current modern day context, we&#39;ve got the liberals who promised us we&#39;ve got the conservatives against it. But Corey, you raised a very interesting point. I want to peel back for one second here, because you said I prejudged it when I said the system was broken. Stephen Carter, is the current first-past-the-post system broken? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think so. You don&#39;t think so? I don&#39;t think so, because ultimately what we&#39;re trying to do is, you know, what are we trying to do with democracy?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s a sense that what we&#39;re trying to do is reflect the will of the people. But the will of the people is such that they can&#39;t project or predict what&#39;s going to happen within a four-year term. Okay.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So this idea that we&#39;re going to have a perfect democracy that represents our whims and our likes moving forward isn&#39;t the way it&#39;s supposed to work. It&#39;s supposed to work where we elect certain people, there&#39;s certain areas of conflict, and then that representative democracy works through those conflicts together.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">With a majority system, we just have a far more efficient system. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think it does. It slows things down. It surely slows things down, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily make things better. Okay, so Corey, are we going from fine to better?</span>

But there are stable versions of this as well. Germany has been ruled by a center-right coalition for a while now, which is one big party plus a couple of smaller ones they broker with. Most other nations have some way of reflecting that popular will. But I do want to say, and I just want to put this on the table right now, this is not an evolutionary thing.

We ran it from the 20s to the 50s when social credit got rid of it. We had STV in the cities, we had instant runoff in every other riding. By the way, when the Socrids got rid of it, there wasn&#39;t any damn referendum about it. They just did it. Now, part of the reason they did it quite crassly was that it was not in their favor to continue. There were a number of seats where they got the most votes on round one, but then lost. And that was a pretty obvious reason why they&#39;d want to deal with that. However, there were some real pragmatic issues that also needed to be addressed. rest one was this was not the age of computers and instant balloting it took days to figure out who won an alberta election right</span>

Let&#39;s talk about what&#39;s at play. And I don&#39;t think we can do that without talking very quickly about our current system, First Past the Post. Correct, Stephen Carter? So</span>

And basically what it is, is the person who gets the most votes in a single riding is elected. I don&#39;t know exactly why it&#39;s called First Past the Post. It&#39;s like some sort of post that would be in the ground. But bottom line, person who&#39;s got the most votes wins. And it&#39;s a very simple democratic concept. The problem is when you have a majority versus a plurality of votes cast for you. So a large number of MLMPs this year would have had a majority of the votes cast for them, 50% plus one. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then the problem is of course people argue that maybe the person who got that 35 percent was the last choice of the other 65 percent and if they&#39;d had the chance to be like well</span>

            <span class="text">well if there was a runoff election right the 35 percent guy would have gotten 35 percent and lost and so the argument is is it really a good system if uh you&#39;re only getting the person who was the first choice of 35 percent but the last choice of 65 percent okay</span>

So there is something to be said in a democracy for ideas. I think – is that fair to say? I mean I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an outrageous concept. And having a way that somebody can put forward ideas like that boldly without absolutely hanging themselves is maybe not something we want to totally dissuade.

And in fact, you see a large number of people who vote for who they perceive to be the winner. And I&#39;m not sure. I think that single transferable vote will cloud how that will work better. You know, like we won&#39;t necessarily know who the winner is going to be in any particular riding because it&#39;s not necessarily going to be clear from our polling structures. Now, we&#39;ve been polling on second choice, third choice for a long, long time.</span>

And now the controversy erupts in the political world. People are saying, how dare the liberals with 40% of the vote just make this happen? And that&#39;s where we get into people wanting a referendum, which in its own right, in a very meta fashion, is direct democracy. So people want direct democracy to choose their system, with direct democracy not being one of the popular choices on the table well i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">listen, do you think that the best law is direct law, like cut out the lawyers? I mean the reason we hire representatives to do things is that they have the time and inclination and skill set to do those things. They can go through and consider the nuances. They can spend their days meeting with people to think about the other side. On your behalf. That&#39;s right. On your behalf. And this is somebody you put your trust into. Yeah.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that to me is a pretty good system. Direct democracy is, of course, famous for referenda, right? Yeah. uh plebiscites on whether it be anything from uh fluoride to should quebec be a sovereign nation after you know that incredibly long crazy question but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but incredibly long crazy questions is the problem you can game a question i mean steven how many times have we done a poll where we have asked a question five different ways and gotten five different responses based on what</span>

            <span class="text">how you craft the question dictates the results pollsters know this uh we know this as political uh operatives um i think anybody who&#39;s ever worked in marketing knows this yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s well somebody picks the question and so there are a lot of great examples in canadian history of people picking the question and either changing the result or coming damn close 95 in quebec yeah obviously a great example we were within just a few votes of this country ceasing to exist at least as we know it today uh but newfoundland when newfoundland joined confederation by the way also a runoff election uh pretty fun but it was gamed in such a way that they they</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so by playing those games someone has to set up the balloting right and they&#39;ve got their thumb on the scale so direct democracy is not as clean as everybody thinks and it really kind of bothers me when when people say, like, that&#39;s the purest form of democracy. In fact, that is the most gameable form of democracy.</span>

Sure, they didn&#39;t change the way that we voted but they brought in the Fair Elections Act which had significant changes in terms of the way that voting happened.

The constitutional argument is there on this one that they&#39;re trying to make, that this is a constitutional change. And for that, we need to ask the people directly.

Like, you know, they say, look, you got 40% of the vote. You&#39;re talking about changing how 100% of votes are cast going forward. And I get that. And I actually think that there&#39;s some legitimacy to that point of view. I think, however, there are a great number of people abusing that legitimate concern for equally selfish aims,</span>

You guys have both said that, you know, think again, this is not the progressive solution of voting. But in that sense, Carter, what do you tell them? Someone</span>

Just be thoughtful about it. Think about it. I don&#39;t know if the NDP necessarily lose in either system. I mean I think there&#39;s reasons that both of them could work for them.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? The reason that they like the proportional representation before is because they knew that there&#39;d be a lot of minority parliaments where the NDP would essentially be the swing vote. And that is self-serving. And I think that Canadian voters and Canadians understand when parties are simply trying to do something that is self-serving to them. The liberals would be well advised not to choose a system that is tremendously self-serving. And the New Democrats would be well advised not to push a self-serving agenda as well.</span>
