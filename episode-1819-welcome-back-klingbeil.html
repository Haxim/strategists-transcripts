        <div class="desc"><p>The gang* reunites to talk about fires, floods, hail, Zain being a successful campaign manager and other natural disasters.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the growing place in politics for disaster management and the biggest stories Annalise missed in the return of The Strategists' missing host. Is emergency management now an essential political skill? Can governments afford our new era of crisis? And how is Donald Trump being shot not the biggest story in American politics from the past six months? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

Guys, I&#39;ve been kind of tuned out lately. As you know, I&#39;ve had my hands full with some other things. But there&#39;s lots that has happened, especially in recent weeks when it comes to natural disasters across Canada. Massive wildfire in Jasper. There&#39;s recent flooding in Montreal and across southern Quebec. A big old hailstorm in Calgary. were, what, mid-August, still kind of the big months for wild weather. There&#39;s also been, not that it&#39;s a natural disaster, but it has to do with water, the pipe in Calgary, which is still drama around that. So I want to dive into this topic. There&#39;s kind of different angles that I think are interesting. There&#39;s political implications, and there&#39;s different levels of government that this hits. Jasper specifically, you&#39;re talking about local, provincial, as well as federal. So I&#39;ve got a bunch of questions. I want to start with the town of Jasper.</div>

          <div class="said">You know, there is definitely a team because the nature of an emergency like this, a disaster like this, is it becomes provincialized and even nationalized because of where it is and there&#39;s a park. And it is one of those interesting things where we talk about him as though he&#39;s a leader. And, of course, he is, right? But this is not why you elect a mayor in a town like Jasper, right, to deal with a disaster, once in a generation disaster like this. So the team for the mayor becomes the team that would manage it for the premier, the team that would manage it for the prime minister. And there&#39;s an awful lot of support and infrastructure, I hope, that is being provided to allow him to be the messenger and carry the message in a way that people in Jasper will understand and resonate, rather than it having to come from a faceless federal official, for example. So the job is really being a conduit, but I suspect on a certain level, he&#39;s never had such a big team, right? Because of the nature of it and everybody that&#39;s involved. One of the things I think is interesting and that I&#39;m going to be looking to see here is if a third of Calgary burned down, there&#39;s like nowhere for them to go. And it&#39;s nothing about the size of the city. That&#39;s the composition of the city. But you&#39;ve already mentioned it. The population of Jasper can quadruple in the summertime, right? There are other accommodations there. So one of the things that will be interesting to watch, both the tension that it creates and the opportunity it provides, is that there are lodgings in the town of Jasper that are maybe available for some of these people who would otherwise be unhoused, have to live in Hinton or Edson or any of the other centers that are nearby. But what&#39;s nearby when you&#39;re in rural areas, right? And that&#39;s going to create some logistics too, but all</div>

We&#39;ve seen Danielle Smith suggest that the feds are responsible for this. Maybe they are, maybe they aren&#39;t. It&#39;s weird to do it during the moment of crisis, though, to suggest that&#39;s the case. And then say that the federal government would want to rebuild in a fashion that would be unacceptable to the province, based more on rumor, I think, than anything else, innuendo more than anything else. But then we&#39;ve also seen Justin Trudeau come to town and, through some of his body language, make it pretty clear he doesn&#39;t have a lot of time for the conservative politicians. Everybody will, well, I suspect many of our listeners will have seen the clip of him effectively blasting past Danielle Smith, offering her hand for a handshake, and the Prime Minister going and shaking the hand of, you know, the other person that&#39;s in the room first, right? right?</div>

So if a disaster took out one of these provinces, it was the communications team of the other province that had to like log into Twitter and say, hey, BC&#39;s not here anymore, right? RT, like and subscribe. But yeah, as the mayor with all of these people, and the biggest risk, I think, being confusion, upset expectations, people not knowing what&#39;s going on, people leaving with different ideas of what&#39;s supposed to be happening next.

You should always be the person who says, okay, I get the sense that you, Danielle, and you, Justin, are thinking about this a bit different. can i clarify what you mean by rebuild main street or whatever it is right and then really forcing people to get very specific about things for your community um because there&#39;s a lot of kiting that occurs at moments like this is everybody just goes about and tries to do their own thing and if people don&#39;t trust each other they might be using coded language they might be suggesting they&#39;re going to do something but picking those words very carefully to not specifically say what they&#39;re going to do you call them on it you get it out there you get a common understanding i think that would be a great role for the mayor of jasper do</div>

So if you&#39;ve ever walked past a house and they&#39;ve got all that wood stacked against the house, not great. If you&#39;ve got bushes that kind of lead up to the front of the house, dry bushes, dry grass, not great. So if you want to have a fireproof home, you have to remove some of these materials and you have to put them in different places. You have to move them further away. You keep, you know, less logs on your property, those types types of things. And the answer that I came up with, and this is probably why I didn&#39;t get the contract, the only thing that people are responding to in today&#39;s world is shame.</div>

And I don&#39;t fucking need that. Like, in some ways, I think we do need to keep this at the administrative level. And what politicians need to do is say it is the municipal government equivalent of just paying your fucking taxes. Nobody loves doing it, but you know, you got to do it. A certain amount of money needs to be set aside for this. And what could really help municipalities in that space is if the higher order of government could mandate a certain requirement for this, maybe even mandate that money goes into a pool for this. And yeah, nobody loves that lack of municipal sovereignty, but the fact of the matter is, if it&#39;s unglamorous and if nobody wants to do it,</div>

There are people there who are going to be dealing with this the rest of their lives. And if you&#39;re the mayor of a place like Jasper, you need to be elbows up and making sure that there are commitments for those supports for as long as those people need them, when those people need them. These things are wild. And I&#39;ve never lost my house to a fire. I&#39;m not going to pretend I understand it. But you get kind of an unfortunate perch when you&#39;ve worked in some of these government jobs, and you see some of the consequences, and you see some of the pain and the frustration and, you know, the long-term health problems that come and people just need to be ready for that as well. Like we don&#39;t get to dust our hands and say Jasper&#39;s rebuilt. That never happens at this point. Jasper, the people in Jasper will never be fully rebuilt from this.
