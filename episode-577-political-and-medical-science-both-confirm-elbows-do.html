            <span class="text">what&#39;s the first thing you do there was a There was a quote in the Calgary Sun where Kent Hare was asked about this and his response was, I thought, oh, this is going to be interesting.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think it has to be your response, right? I mean, you know nothing good is going to come of this altercation, which is part of why I don&#39;t understand why he went over in the first place. yeah so to sort of flesh out the story here you walk over there you you kind of in a huff are mad that things are not progressing on your timeline which is not a good look for any prime minister because you have effectively unlimited power except for the fact that they have a very modest power to delay to delay and debate maybe don&#39;t rob them of that if you want to look like you&#39;re kind of the man of the people you claim to be but let&#39;s not get sidetracked on that then you move back you know elbows hands grabbing i can&#39;t wait in a certain sense to talk about the opposition because it is we&#39;ll get there</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, the reason I asked that question is what you would do if you were a staffer working for the prime minister. Because Corey is right. It is a bad situation for you. And what they ultimately did end up doing was – and I&#39;m going to count here – issue about 29 apologies on behalf of Justin Trudeau. There&#39;s like – so I&#39;m being – there&#39;s hyperbole there. But there was so many apology after apology after apology. What was there?</span>
