        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about how #Elbowgate, Hillary Clinton's perfect storm and the art of political conventioneering. When elbows were thrown in the House of Commons, who won and who lost? Is Donald Trump going to pull off the greatest political caper since Nick Cage stole the Declaration of Independence? And are we ready for the return of the "Legit-meter"? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
