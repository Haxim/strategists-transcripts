And frankly, you might just say, well, sounds bad, but isn&#39;t every race and every by-election a referendum on the leader? Is there something extra worrisome for Trudeau here, if we&#39;re to believe that, maybe not universally, but for a good chunk of voters, that&#39;s what they&#39;re thinking about when they&#39;re voting in toronto st paul&#39;s on monday</span>

            <span class="text">you&#39;re absolutely right in that every every election every by-election in the canadian system at this point is a referendum on the leader&#39;s popularity but there are certain uh points in the leader in a leader&#39;s career where it becomes more important and this i think is one of those points where it just simply is more important for Justin Trudeau to perform or to outperform the critics and this the referendum isn&#39;t just going to be an up and down straight win or loss the the question is how much do you win by so I think that this is a significant referendum on Justin Trudeau&#39;s leadership and it will be interesting to see if the people of Toronto St. Paul rally to him or if they leave him out in the cold.</span>

            <span class="text">so i have to say as much as like the cabinet shuffle is a card you only get to play once i&#39;ve named a bunch of other cards you only get to play once and there&#39;s not very many cards left in the deck for for justin trudeau in terms of i guess the hope that he can turn it around i&#39;m not saying that like he&#39;s going to be deposed if this this thing goes awry but there&#39;s not a lot of reason to believe he&#39;s going to turn it around now and so We&#39;re getting to the place where a by-election is occurring in an absolute liberal mortal lock, and there&#39;s a chance he might lose it. I just don&#39;t know. For me, it&#39;s not so much, will his party turn on him if he loses? I think that those things happen incrementally, and they happen in ways that are sort of hard to describe sometimes. But it&#39;s, what is this story you are going to tell your supporters that&#39;s going to keep keep them from being utterly despondent and politically suicidal if you manage to lose Toronto St. Paul&#39;s. Because you&#39;re not going to be able to offer them that cabinet shuffle. You&#39;re not going to be able to offer them our messaging will turn it around. You&#39;re not going to be able to offer them policy, as we&#39;ve described. We&#39;re at a point where people are just tuning out what he says because it&#39;s him who&#39;s saying it. And there&#39;s just not a lot of reason even for false hope at this point. So that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s such an important by-election for him. It&#39;s not It&#39;s not because by-elections mean everything. It&#39;s not because if you lose a by-election, you&#39;re destined to lose this leader. It&#39;s because this is a man at the end of his rope. And this by-election comes at a critical point. And if this goes bad for him, I</span>

We&#39;re going to stand up in the House of Commons.

And so they pooled their votes with the Conservatives. But we know that&#39;s not where their hearts are. We know that ultimately Canadians are progressive. Canadians want environmental action. They don&#39;t want the inaction of a Polyev government. Canadians want social justice. They don&#39;t want the injustice of a Polyev government. Canadians want economic fairness. They don&#39;t want the cronyism of a Polyev government. So we&#39;re going to be bringing that message everywhere over the next bit. We are the alternative to the Pierre Polyev conservatives.
