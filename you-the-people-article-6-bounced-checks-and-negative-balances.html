          <div class="said">ultimately, those are all about optimizations relative to where opinion rests. You&#39;re trying to make something more popular or less popular. And so the argument that this is a leading indicator is the national polls are picking up fundamental changes in the support for Joe Biden versus Donald Trump in areas where they&#39;re not particularly active, which says at a resting state, Joe Biden is getting more popular, right, and Donald Trump less.
