The then-President apparently told the arresting officer that, quote, he would not get into any trouble for making the arrest as he admired a man who did his duty, unquote. $20 in bail was paid, consequences were doled out, it was reinforced that no one, not even the President, was above the law. law. Fast forward 151 years. In 2023, Donald Trump got to be the second US president put under arrest. And then the third. Four arraignments, 88 charges, none as trivial as speeding. And that might seem like a problem in a country where no one, not even the president, is above the law. But just wait. Oral arguments on Thursday, April 25th made it seem like those conservative originalists on the Supreme Court aren&#39;t so sure that it&#39;s so cut and dry. Maybe Maybe a president is above the law, the majority seem to muse, at least when he&#39;s presidenting. Maybe consequences won&#39;t be doled out, at</span>

            <span class="text">That&#39;s great, Corey. Thanks very much. I mean, at the heart of this is the idea of presidential immunity. Now, you may have alluded to the Grant case, President Grant, where presidential immunity was never actually taken to the Supreme Court. One of the things that is interesting is that Grant himself enabled the question</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">question to continue about presidential immunity because he subjected himself to the law. Donald Trump is the first president not to really subject himself to the law. And here&#39;s where we wind up at the heart of the case. The heart of the case is whether or not a president, through either his unofficial business or his official business, should be immune from prosecution. and i would suggest that the questioning today focused on a couple of different points first point was what is an official action and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and the second point is um what happens when it&#39;s not an official action or what if that official action is unlawful making it in fact not an official action so that&#39;s kind of the the case that was heard today and it was interesting watching the judges uh the justices i suppose um go through their gymnastics trying to make</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">make this case bigger than it is so that they&#39;re not just approving whether or not trump faces trial but they&#39;re uh trying to make this about future presidents</span>

Holding people accountable under the system of law, like it&#39;s called a check and balance system, right? There&#39;s supposed to be checks and balances within there. And one of the checks is that you don&#39;t get to write all the laws that&#39;s done by congress the other check is that the justice system applies the laws uh it doesn&#39;t say you as the president as the administration you know the administrator of all of these laws gets to be immune from those laws that&#39;s why they wrote it as three different sections if they wanted a king washington was there to be their king and they chose not to have that.

And I think we can all sort of acknowledge and agree that those resourcing decisions can have a significant effect on how people feel about the campaign. Yeah, it&#39;s pretty fundamental. We&#39;d agree that&#39;s a 101 thing. But</span>

            <span class="text">ultimately, those are all about optimizations relative to where opinion rests. You&#39;re trying to make something more popular or less popular. And so the argument that this is a leading indicator is the national polls are picking up fundamental changes in the support for Joe Biden versus Donald Trump in areas where they&#39;re not particularly active, which says at a resting state, Joe Biden is getting more popular, right, and Donald Trump less. And in fact, when you sort of consider all of the areas where you&#39;re not seeing the fundamental changes and you are seeing them in the national polls, you can make the case that there&#39;s a significant change there, right?</span>
