And then there&#39;s a group of people that pay and are very rude. And we like them the most, Carter, to be clear. Yeah. And those are the people attending the VIP event, which, by the way, I&#39;m not going to talk about. 6.30 p.m. There&#39;ll be a whole thing. It&#39;s catered, apparently. The economics make no sense. Carter&#39;s explained it to us off-air. They make no sense whatsoever. No, but it&#39;s cater.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">True. I vote promo. Speaking of things, speaking of someone, let&#39;s spend the entire, my plan is to spend the entire episode on someone that could use a little promo, that could use a little bit of TLC. Okay. That person, Shannon, is one Pierre Polyev.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">He has not had a good week, has he, Shannon?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">He has not. He has had a terrible week, in fact. No good, very bad time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, listen, there&#39;s process and then there&#39;s outcome. Let&#39;s talk about outcome first, and then we can talk about the shitty process week that he&#39;s had as well. The outcome is that he&#39;s lost one MP. He had another resign who I suspect they&#39;ve convinced to stay, last i have heard unless you guys have heard otherwise this is matt generu yeah to stay until april so generu&#39;s sticking around until april not leaving so you know as we relate it to the majority minority math for mr mark carney that number does not play the role we thought it did when we recorded our breaking news episode on matt generu and then they&#39;ve also had a really shitty process week with articles coming out around their culture their bullying culture And let&#39;s not forget Andrew Scheer also coming out and saying the reason that one Mr. Matt Gennaro left is liberal scare tactics, that the liberals finally got to him. The people who are incompetent in politics became very good at it and picked off Matt Gennaro off the conservative caucus. Carter, not a good week.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, it&#39;s a no good, horrible, terrible week for Pierre Polyev. And it&#39;s on top of kind of a not-so-great time since the election. I mean, as we know, he lost his seat. He had to seek a new seat in the liberal stronghold of Battle River Crowfoot. Battle</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Battle River Crowfoot. Liberals go battling there, and they lose. They get 5% to 6% generally.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, it was pathetic that that&#39;s where he was, where he found himself. But that&#39;s that&#39;s been his year. It&#39;s not like this is a guy who&#39;s been riding a high who all of a sudden had a bad week. This is a guy who was 20 points ahead prior to the election, who lost the election and who is continuing to have bad time.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, and I want to spend a bit of time with the two of you helping Pierre Polyev out. But I guess before we help him out, like we could help him out for this week. Like that&#39;s an episode we could do, right? How to help Pierre Polyev with the Matt Jenner to ruin Chris D&#39;Entremont situation. That is a thing we could do. But I want to almost leave it up to the two of you in terms of how and what help you think this guy needs. I&#39;m always kind of asking you to put your consulting hats on, your strategist hats on to say, what is the core problem with Pierre-Paul Lievre before we jump into what the solution to Pierre-Paul Lievre needs to be? So let&#39;s spend like at least a couple of minutes. And Shannon, maybe I&#39;ll start with you to give me like a problem definition. What it is this week? Is this just an inflamed version of the core problem? Is this a symptom of a larger problem than what we saw this week? How would you like to define the problem that we helped solve for one Pierre-Paul Lievre? Devin Carter, I&#39;ll give you a shake at it right after Shannon.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">So in the summer of 2024, I guess, I was looking at some federal polling. And, you know, Pierre Poliova was riding high. Justin Trudeau was generationally unpopular. And here we had, we were looking at Pierre Poliova&#39;s strengths and so on. And I saw even in that polling that</span>

          <div class="turn">

You know, when he was acting leader in the House about the, you know, some of the RCMP stuff, like, it&#39;s possible that some of these folks that are that are cranky in the caucus are actual, like, well, moderates, whatever that means in the Conservative Party of Canada anymore.

            <span class="text">carter shen brings up a really good point i think one you&#39;ve talked about historically which is we&#39;ve we&#39;ve seen in political history that that you know politics isn&#39;t always a selfish transactional act that there are leaders that pull low that are not destined for victory but their teammates stick with them right their teammates are like i&#39;m loyal to you man like we&#39;ll ride or die together i get it right like uh you know i&#39;m not i&#39;m not leaving you high and dry uh we&#39;ve seen that historically despite the rap that politics gets of being extremely transactional of people biting stabbing each other in the back and kind of jumping ship. Yes, that is a more commonly told story, but that loyalty piece is really interesting. I would challenge, though, that Pierre-Paul Lievre Carter has really promoted himself as, like, we&#39;re asking him to flex muscles that he&#39;s A, not used, but B, we do not know if he has. We know he can make the calls because he&#39;s done that historically. That&#39;s been well reported that people have talked about that. However, as it relates to being more than a transactional leader that can get through point one of your message, which is we can win together, I have a hard time kind of seeing Pierre Polyev add sweetness, both in terms of rhetoric, but also in terms of roles and responsibilities for anyone that already isn&#39;t in his very, very tight orbit. What do you, what do you kind of, I don&#39;t mean to be skeptical of what Shannon&#39;s saying, but I&#39;m trying to right-size the advice to the guy that we have here.</span>

We always kind of, I think of, of, of circles of influence is just kind of of like a target with the bullseye is is your close uh set of advisors peer probably does not have a problem with this close set of advisors they are loyal to him they have always been loyal to him it is the next target out this caucus that we&#39;ve got a problem in the next one after that is is you know caucus staff the the the board all of those kinds of you know people who are insiders and then you get to general population or i&#39;m sorry members of the party members of the party think he walks on water he may survive his his leadership review on nothing more than he&#39;s pierre pauliev and he&#39;s a fighter and i love fighters but</span>

How do you deal with those things? Because these are also, you know, 100 plus people who feel like they should be the leader and are not coming at this completely naive to the world of politics themselves.

            <span class="text">Here&#39;s what I mean. He doesn&#39;t care about the external environment at all. He continues to be a prick. Let Carney get his win on Trump. Let Carney sour on himself. Be pugilist against Carney. But do one thing that you did exceptionally well that I still don&#39;t think Pierre-Paul Lievre gets enough credit for, which is see into the future. Pierre Poliev was the first person on, and we were making fun of him, you and I, Carter, when he did that lumber video on inflation. He was the first guy that brought up cost of living. And he saw into the future. It&#39;s a tough task, but if you&#39;re not likable, Pierre Poliev, you better be able to look into the fucking future. And what if that is a strategy for Pierre Poliev over the course of the next two and a half years? Generate, find, do whatever you need to, to find the next big thing to rally this country around that you are first and on the right side of because you&#39;ve got really no other path with Carney because you&#39;re not a good fit. Trump, you&#39;re not a good fit. Likeability, we&#39;ve seen it. You&#39;re not a good fit. Tell me if there&#39;s any value in what I&#39;ve put on the table, Carter. Tell me what the holes are.</span>

I remember people, you know, just talking about how expensive it was compared to prior in 22, like compared to, you know, 21 or 20. money um so for sure there&#39;s that uh and you can see that that affordability is not going away anytime soon right uh that um you know there&#39;s been a bit of softening of interest rates and stuff but like uh you know uh housing mortgage isn&#39;t going to change the grocery store is not you know going to go down in price for christ&#39;s sakes my wages are stagnant or a lot of people&#39;s right like that&#39;s that&#39;s the calculation for people so that that part is going to get worse so sure you can predict the future on that that housing affordability uh probably</span>

            <span class="text">except the liberals have completely taken that off the table now right and so the the thing that he had was an explanation of why it&#39;s the government&#39;s fault that lumber is too expensive right when it was demonstrably not justin trudeau&#39;s fault it wasn&#39;t the fucking carbon tax it wasn&#39;t anything that came out of a federal budget that made lumber more expensive and same goes for you know trying to buy a bag of chips in the grocery store or anything else it wasn&#39;t justin trudeau&#39;s fault but he had a convenient cudgel that the liberals did not take out of his hand he was coming at them with the nail the carbon tax every day all day because he had a reason why you could blame the government right right now he doesn&#39;t have a reason to blame the government the problems are obvious and they&#39;re going to remain obvious um but he needs like and and everywhere he&#39;s reaching the government is just thank you very much and taking the nail bat out of his hand right whether it&#39;s carbon tax or Or whether it&#39;s immigration or whether it&#39;s, you know, we&#39;ll see what happens with housing or defense or any of these other things. You know, they&#39;ve neutralized him on every explanation for your woes.
