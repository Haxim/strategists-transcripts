Let&#39;s talk about outcome first, and then we can talk about the shitty process week that he&#39;s had as well. The outcome is that he&#39;s lost one MP. He had another resign who I suspect they&#39;ve convinced to stay, last i have heard unless you guys have heard otherwise this is matt generu yeah to stay until april so generu&#39;s sticking around until april not leaving so you know as we relate it to the majority minority math for mr mark carney that number does not play the role we thought it did when we recorded our breaking news episode on matt generu and then they&#39;ve also had a really shitty process week with articles coming out around their culture their bullying culture And let&#39;s not forget Andrew Scheer also coming out and saying the reason that one Mr. Matt Gennaro left is liberal scare tactics, that the liberals finally got to him. The people who are incompetent in politics became very good at it and picked off Matt Gennaro off the conservative caucus. Carter, not a good week.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, and I want to spend a bit of time with the two of you helping Pierre Polyev out. But I guess before we help him out, like we could help him out for this week. Like that&#39;s an episode we could do, right? How to help Pierre Polyev with the Matt Jenner to ruin Chris D&#39;Entremont situation. That is a thing we could do. But I want to almost leave it up to the two of you in terms of how and what help you think this guy needs. I&#39;m always kind of asking you to put your consulting hats on, your strategist hats on to say, what is the core problem with Pierre-Paul Lievre before we jump into what the solution to Pierre-Paul Lievre needs to be? So let&#39;s spend like at least a couple of minutes. And Shannon, maybe I&#39;ll start with you to give me like a problem definition. What it is this week? Is this just an inflamed version of the core problem? Is this a symptom of a larger problem than what we saw this week? How would you like to define the problem that we helped solve for one Pierre-Paul Lievre? Devin Carter, I&#39;ll give you a shake at it right after Shannon.</div>

          <div class="said">carter shen brings up a really good point i think one you&#39;ve talked about historically which is we&#39;ve we&#39;ve seen in political history that that you know politics isn&#39;t always a selfish transactional act that there are leaders that pull low that are not destined for victory but their teammates stick with them right their teammates are like i&#39;m loyal to you man like we&#39;ll ride or die together i get it right like uh you know i&#39;m not i&#39;m not leaving you high and dry uh we&#39;ve seen that historically despite the rap that politics gets of being extremely transactional of people biting stabbing each other in the back and kind of jumping ship. Yes, that is a more commonly told story, but that loyalty piece is really interesting. I would challenge, though, that Pierre-Paul Lievre Carter has really promoted himself as, like, we&#39;re asking him to flex muscles that he&#39;s A, not used, but B, we do not know if he has. We know he can make the calls because he&#39;s done that historically. That&#39;s been well reported that people have talked about that. However, as it relates to being more than a transactional leader that can get through point one of your message, which is we can win together, I have a hard time kind of seeing Pierre Polyev add sweetness, both in terms of rhetoric, but also in terms of roles and responsibilities for anyone that already isn&#39;t in his very, very tight orbit. What do you, what do you kind of, I don&#39;t mean to be skeptical of what Shannon&#39;s saying, but I&#39;m trying to right-size the advice to the guy that we have here.</div>

Be pugilist against Carney. But do one thing that you did exceptionally well that I still don&#39;t think Pierre-Paul Lievre gets enough credit for, which is see into the future. Pierre Poliev was the first person on, and we were making fun of him, you and I, Carter, when he did that lumber video on inflation. He was the first guy that brought up cost of living. And he saw into the future. It&#39;s a tough task, but if you&#39;re not likable, Pierre Poliev, you better be able to look into the fucking future. And what if that is a strategy for Pierre Poliev over the course of the next two and a half years? Generate, find, do whatever you need to, to find the next big thing to rally this country around that you are first and on the right side of because you&#39;ve got really no other path with Carney because you&#39;re not a good fit. Trump, you&#39;re not a good fit. Likeability, we&#39;ve seen it. You&#39;re not a good fit. Tell me if there&#39;s any value in what I&#39;ve put on the table, Carter.
