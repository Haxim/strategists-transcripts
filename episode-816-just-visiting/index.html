        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss whether Mark Carney will be jumping into Canadian politics and what's going on in Alberta education before being subjected to the return of the dreaded "strategy session" segment. Does Carney have his eyes on the Prime Ministership? Is Alberta's UCP government trying to bite off too much? And who's care are we gonna take? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Mark Carney has reached our shores again. The former governor of the Bank of Canada, the former governor of the Bank of England, which, by the way, if I check my facts, that would make him the head of state. I just want to let you know that actually technically makes him the head of state. He is back and he&#39;s now acting as an informal advisor to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as part of the COVID-19 response. This is interesting for a few reasons. Number one, prior to him leaving for England, Mark Carney was touted by many political observers as being a potential candidate for the liberal leadership to become the next prime minister. And of course, now that he is back, he comes at a very interesting time when current finance minister Bill Morneau seems to be having some clearly some issues. But now it&#39;s been revealed seems to be having some policy disagreements with Prime Minister Trudeau as well. So Corey, I&#39;ll go to you first. Do you buy into the hype? Do you buy into the speculation speculation that Carney&#39;s here for anything more than informal advisership to the prime minister?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s impossible. There&#39;s certainly been enough rumblings that Carney was at least intrigued by the notion of the liberal leadership back when, by the way, they were the third party that that I think you have to take it seriously that he harbors somewhere deep in his soul political ambitions in some way, shape or form. Now, a lot of people do and never pull the trigger. I mean, see Bernard Lord, right? You know, who was, you know, proposed as a potential McKenna as a potential leadership candidate, you know, forever. And that&#39;s because when you get to the realm of finance and the realm of business that those three names I&#39;ve just mentioned, including Carney, got to, you</div>

Just likes to be around, likes to have his name in the mix. is not interested in finally taking the plunge.

Stephen Carter, I want to go to you for a second, because let&#39;s go down the path that that Corey started of reckless speculation. speculation. Help me write the Carney story. Help me write the Carney, either finance minister story, the Carney running in the by-election in York Center story, the Carney in public office story. What does that look like right now? Because one of the biggest things to contend with is ensuring you don&#39;t fall into the Ignatieff trap of coming from away as an elite, educated white dude and then being outright rejected.

          <div class="said">Well, stories are written for the time in which they&#39;re created. And the time in which we were created right now is one of economic requirement. We require a strong economic leader. That is different than the Ignatiev. I mean, what was the story that Ignatiev was trying to tell us when he was coming back? There was no story. And it certainly didn&#39;t fit within our time. I think it would be very easy to craft a story for Mark Carney that he&#39;s coming back because we need to focus on economics. We need to get Canada back started again. We need to move ourselves out of double-digit unemployment across the country. And here&#39;s a guy who was successful in navigating one of the most amazing periods of economic growth in Canada&#39;s history. And yes, he is coming back because this is where he&#39;s from. This is what he believes in. And he&#39;s going to help us out. I think you can counter his coming back from a broad type of narrative. Was he not born in the Northwest Territories in a small town? Like this is a small town Canadian who has, you know, is returning to Canada. He&#39;s achieved all of these great things. I mean, I think the story, if you write the story for the time, and this is one of the things that I think political strategists really struggle with is we all want to write But we want to write a story and we don&#39;t match it to the audience and the audience&#39;s expectation of that particular moment. Right. So Trudeau&#39;s story of 2015 happened to fit with the moment of 2015. It was economic, you know, economically we were doing great. He was coming in. We wanted to have a younger leader. We wanted to have a generational change. He fit all of the boxes of that moment with his story, even if it was rather, you</div>

And that&#39;s a bigger problem the more money you make. When you&#39;re governor of the Bank of England, you make the equivalent of $1.5 million a year Canadian. That&#39;s a lot of money. We are not talking about a guy who&#39;s well off and you can quibble about, like, is that, you know, he&#39;s like a one percenter and then some.

          <div class="said">So, Carter, before I go back to you, Corey, I want you to start on this one because you&#39;re a little bit more skeptical. Carney gives you a shout, right? His people give you a shout saying, okay, Corey, I&#39;m trying to onboard into politics. I&#39;m in this informal advisor capacity. I have a book coming out. You know my creds. What does my onboarding look like? Like, how do I make it look like that I&#39;m not too crass and not too opportunistic to just jump in when I see weakness with our finance minister, when I see that our prime minister might be, you know, at the end of perhaps his leadership run in the next half decade or so? What does it look like to you? How are you advising Mark Carney or Mark Carney&#39;s people to onboard into politics? I think it&#39;s quite an interesting live wire experiment of perhaps what he might do should he have those ambitions. Yeah.</div>

You&#39;re there to help and you want to give back after doing so well internationally. And so, yeah, you&#39;re going to use your expertise and your connections to help Canada with COVID. And hey, you know, maybe if politics calls at a certain point, maybe if there&#39;s a by-election and he could get into there as a humble MP, he&#39;d be happy to serve. Oh, you want to put him in cabinet? Well, I&#39;m just, I&#39;m tickled pink, but all I really want is to be there to serve the people. And on every step of the way, Jimmer, right? Do a little bit less at a little slower speed than your resume suggests you would be able to do. A guy like Mark Carney doesn&#39;t need to do anything. Like even the idea that he would come in and do the COVID stuff, he could literally announce for the liberal leadership the day it comes open, whenever it comes open, whether it&#39;s this year or five years from now. But if you can kind of show that humility and earn back some of that, you know, I was always a Southie boy at heart. I never really left. I think that that is the play. And you want to be doing a little bit less than you&#39;re qualified to do for the next year or so. So I</div>

So when York Centre or the next by-election opens, don&#39;t run. Don&#39;t put yourself in that position. Think long. This is not a short game. Justin Trudeau is not heading out of leadership this year. He is, you know, I would suggest at the very earliest would be heading out of the leadership, you know, a year before, you know, the next scheduled election, I think, 2023.</div>

But the social sector is a little underrepresented there, and there&#39;s maybe an opportunity. opportunity the benefit of being an mp is less these days than it was in the past if you have leadership ambitions because it used to be that the caucus was a very significant um component of of any any leadership drive that&#39;s we we&#39;ve seen time again that&#39;s not necessarily the case anymore um but by the way i will say now that carter has said jt&#39;s not heading out of the leadership this year it feels like he&#39;s doomed uh just as a carter prediction but i do generally really agree i think it&#39;s hard to imagine rex murphy columns notwithstanding that justin trudeau is is on the edge of losing his job so so you do need to think about this in terms of the long game and you have to be careful because a finance minister for the next two years is not going to be a particularly popular job you&#39;re going to be rolling down winding up a lot of programs that put money in people&#39;s pockets you will have to run a bunch of austerity budgets to help us undo the fiscal hit that we&#39;ve taken in the last year here.

My experience has has been that those two those two cabinet positions have the most negative interaction between one another. Because finance is where everything hits. Every department, everything goes and needs to be, you know, part of Treasury Board or finance so that it can be funded and things can happen. So it has a lot of power within the government. I have seen the interactions between finance ministers and their first ministers. And it is challenging. Now, having said that, the first minister is the first minister. And usually if there&#39;s a, if there&#39;s a conflict in, in the, you know, the premier of the prime minister&#39;s office with any of their ministers, the person walking out with their tail between their legs or the person walking out saying, uh, yes, madam premier, or yes, Mr. Prime minister is the finance minister. Um, so I suspect that there probably were a lot of disagreements over the last six months. Why wouldn&#39;t there be, there was no playbook. There is no expect expected outcomes. I suspect that this is overblown, but it probably has been real. But if Bill Morneau wishes to remain in the government and wishes to remain a minister, this</div>

First of all, the Wee scandal was two weeks ago, you know, which is forever in politics. It feels like it finally has ended. I don&#39;t know if it sparks back up again in September, but I&#39;m not sure that you get the anticipated bounce by forcing the finance minister out. You know, but I do think that Corey&#39;s point about Morneau not wanting to leave due to scandal is pretty solid. I mean, you certainly don&#39;t want to go down with scandal. You&#39;d much rather have it be with, I have a conflict with this, I think, universally recognized as or universally branded as a not particularly deep thinker in the prime minister. And I don&#39;t say that to say that the prime minister is not a deep thinker. I just, that&#39;s the brand. And that brand, if you were going out and shopping your resume around to take</div>

I think that you&#39;ve got other pieces on your chessboard that aren&#39;t as valuable. There&#39;s lots of departments where Mark Carney could be. Finance seems to make the most sense, but why wouldn&#39;t you create a special Department of COVID recovery. It&#39;s been done before. I mean, given a minister without portfolio acting almost as a second deputy prime minister, why wouldn&#39;t you do that? Why would you think inside of the box at this particular moment when you&#39;re facing the largest economic recovery and all of your economic ministers reporting to him, right? Like you create a little economic task force led by mark carney that can be really interesting so i just don&#39;t think you take one of your stronger pieces in morneau and trade it straight across for one of your you know the next strongest piece there&#39;s there&#39;s lots of weaker pieces and there&#39;s lots of other places you can put either of them frankly carter</div>

I&#39;d start making the, you know, pushing on the fact that right now I think people are feeling two distinct pressures.

First of all, the school openings, which we know that there are parents as well as the Alberta Teachers Union, as well as teachers themselves kicking and screaming. Layer on top of that, doctors who are also talking about the safety precautions that are not in place regarding back to school. Oh, by the way, they&#39;re having their own fight with the government. So there&#39;s also that layer. And then layering on top of the school situation here, this government at the UCP government that is here in Alberta has indicated that they&#39;re going to have a curriculum review and have just appointed their new committee of all dudes to do that committee review. So, Corey, maybe I&#39;ll throw it to you to get started. I know you finished this off last segment, but lay out the context here. What do you think is happening in Alberta as related to education and school? And is COVID being used as cloud cover?

There was, of course, stories that came out about him that signaled his not reckless spending, but perhaps his inappropriate spending as party leader. How are you spinning a solid goodbye that the Andrew Scheer era was not a wasted space for the conservatives, but that it was a helpful, constructive time for the party? What are you saying? How are you spinning this to the media and giving them the send off that he needs in order for your party to get that bump when the new leader steps in? too</div>

You&#39;re halfway through talking about your political strategy of Harris, how that bump is all going so well. And you love it. You&#39;re obviously crediting the You the People podcast for providing you great insight about, you know, her digital army that she&#39;s now being able to put into action. Halfway through the conversation, however, they ask you, they say, listen, there&#39;s a a really deeply reported piece by Politico today saying that Barack Obama wasn&#39;t too hot on Joe Biden being the nominee and wasn&#39;t exactly too hot on him while he was in office. How are you reconciling, like using that term again, but how are you kind of pivoting from hearing that the guy your boss reported to as president didn&#39;t necessarily want him to capture the nomination, so to speak?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, that&#39;s one report, and I think it&#39;s pretty suspect. When you look at that the former president and the vice president and their interactions, you can see that they have a rapport that is not erased because of one poorly sourced political article here. Joe Biden was deeply involved in a number of Obama initiatives. He was always right there. The president gave him the Medal of Freedom. He obviously has very high regard for him.

And I think that if we want people to have the confidence to come forward with the other crimes that the Democrats have done, that we know they are too scared to come forward because of the threat that they might be put in jail by Democratic AGs or Hillary Clinton&#39;s goons out there, then we need to show them that we&#39;ve got their back.

          <div class="said">you&#39;re looking to sell the concept and you&#39;re looking to pilot these things more broadly, I think CERB has offered you a great window, a great opportunity. Carter said earlier CERB is winding up imminently. It&#39;s October 3rd, I believe. It&#39;s still a couple of months away. But that does provide a bit of opportunity to say, OK, well, in a post-CERB world, what kind of supports are we going to have for people? And I think that COVID has exposed that there is a bit of a bit of a need here and a bit of a gap. And, you know, there are people on the conservative side of the spectrum who are big fans of a minimum income as well, because it could be an opportunity to wind up a lot of boutique social programs and just say, OK, well, we&#39;re not we&#39;re not providing this, that or the other thing. You&#39;re just going to get a check. And it&#39;s a little bit easier, you know, from a government management point of view. So there is the possibility maybe even to strike in this minority parliament, a version of the pilot that says, OK, you do this, but you don&#39;t get that. And pilot in this context could be like a whole bloody province or something. It could be expanded pretty dramatically. If you want to take the opportunity that CERB presents, if you are either the liberals exploring it, well, really just the liberals, but I guess if the conservatives were interested in some</div>

          <div class="said">Drop the word universal and and jump right into what Corey was talking about of replacing a number of different programs. The bureaucratic loss that occurs during all the programs is something that supporters of UBI talk about all the time. All of these programs that are in government that are really inefficient.</div>

          <div class="said">inefficient. Well, that&#39;s true. Let&#39;s eliminate all those different programs. You don&#39;t need an AISH, Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped. You don&#39;t need an EI. you don&#39;t need a you know you can just merge all those programs into one but it shouldn&#39;t be universal and no one no one&#39;s going to buy that it&#39;s going to be universal because the what you have to do in taxes to tax it all back so that you can actually pay for it is just unpalatable to the canadian population so draw a line in the sand and say at this line below it you get whatever you want to call it a variant of serb i think serb is the jumping off point not everybody was eligible for CERB and you can just jump off of it and say we&#39;re going to find people we&#39;re not going to let people fall between the cracks we&#39;re going to give people $2,000 a month if they&#39;re severely handicapped if they&#39;re unemployed whatever the situation is and it&#39;s a simple number that is indexed to go up with inflation and maybe indexed by the cost of living in the local jurisdiction but the idea of it being universal is its primary stumbling block I&#39;d drop it and I&#39;d move to just basic income come we&#39;ll</div>
