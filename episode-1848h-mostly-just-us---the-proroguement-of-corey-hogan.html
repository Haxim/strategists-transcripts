            <span class="text">Here&#39;s the thing. One of the things I admire about you, and I have for a long time, is that unlike Corey, who gives very long and cogent analysis, he often comes to the wrong conclusions. You, on the other hand, Stephen Carter, you&#39;re not one for the analysis. You feel political strategy in your bones, in your gut. And so what I want to do is I want to race through or run through as many as we can of strategic things happening right now. I&#39;m going to give you strategic statements, and you&#39;re going to tell me whether they&#39;re right or they&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re going to justify a bit why, but you&#39;re going to give me where the Stephen Carter political strategy gut is. And I say this may sound like a shtick and like everything on the show. It is. But I do think this is one of your superpowers. I do think this is one of the things you have a keen and unique ability to do, is tell us which direction to go. Is it left or is it right? Why? You&#39;ve got it very quickly. You don&#39;t need a lot of time to think it through. Often you don&#39;t think it through. Often I don&#39;t think at all,</span>

I know you&#39;ve argued both of those should go away, but it&#39;s enough to get the leader of the opposition who&#39;s been on the same track to respond and read the room.

Less so concrete, here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do, here&#39;s what the counter tariffs look like, here&#39;s what&#39;s on, none of that. But they both kind of gave their rhetoric. They said, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to secure, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do, here&#39;s what&#39;s on the table.
