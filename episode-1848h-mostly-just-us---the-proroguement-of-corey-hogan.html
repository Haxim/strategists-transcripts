We cover Trump, the Liberals, Axe the Tax, Canada First, Carney, Gould, Crombie, and more—plus an insensitive sponsor ad and doxxing of family members.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Note from Corey: I can't be held responsible for the word "proroguement".</em></p>

            <div class="said">Here&#39;s the thing. One of the things I admire about you, and I have for a long time, is that unlike Corey, who gives very long and cogent analysis, he often comes to the wrong conclusions. You, on the other hand, Stephen Carter, you&#39;re not one for the analysis. You feel political strategy in your bones, in your gut. And so what I want to do is I want to race through or run through as many as we can of strategic things happening right now. I&#39;m going to give you strategic statements, and you&#39;re going to tell me whether they&#39;re right or they&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re going to justify a bit why, but you&#39;re going to give me where the Stephen Carter political strategy gut is. And I say this may sound like a shtick and like everything on the show. It is. But I do think this is one of your superpowers. I do think this is one of the things you have a keen and unique ability to do, is tell us which direction to go. Is it left or is it right? Why? You&#39;ve got it very quickly. You don&#39;t need a lot of time to think it through. Often you don&#39;t think it through. Often I don&#39;t think at all,</div>

And tell me about how you assess the window. If you agree that there&#39;s an appetite, which I hear you saying, how big, how wide, how narrow is this window? How do you figure out when people have reached there? Because it&#39;s not like natural convention where people want to be like, my local domestic politician is like Trump.

So both Pierre Polyev and Mark Carney kind of gave their plans against Trump, against tariffs, and gave their rhetorical sort of plans, right? Less so concrete, here&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do, here&#39;s what the counter tariffs look like, here&#39;s what&#39;s on, none of that. But they both kind of gave their rhetoric. They said, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to secure, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do, here&#39;s what&#39;s on the table. They both talked about in different ways, you know, where we&#39;d be open to feeling the maximum amount of pain, because this is what it takes to defend the country, we will never be a 51st state, right?
