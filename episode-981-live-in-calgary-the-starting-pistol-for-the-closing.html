That resulted in them trying to, well, let&#39;s be fair. They were trying to game the system a bit and make sure that Jason Kenney could get a preferential result. So they held the special general meeting in Red Deer. So inconvenient for everybody. An hour and a half from Calgary, an hour and a half from Edmonton, an hour and a half from Red Deer.

            <span class="text">Well, no, because we&#39;ve never seen anything where the rules change in the middle. I mean, Ralph Klein was facing down, you know, a very difficult result. People told him to his face that he was likely to win. He didn&#39;t win. They said they&#39;d vote one way, and then they voted another way. Stelmack and Redford were both able to kind of game their systems, wind up with 78%. And I mean, gaming their systems by bringing in their supporters. It wasn&#39;t going to be over 2,000 people at their events. They were able to manage their outcomes a lot more effectively. But</span>

            <span class="text">political event like that. And secondly, where they changed the rules to try and find some way. Because I think that the first thinking was if we game the rules, as Corey was explaining, to have them everybody an hour and a half away from the balloting station, then that was their first gaming of the rules. Right. Now they&#39;ve decided after Cynthia Moore said, you know, there&#39;s no way. The only way we can have a vote we can count on is having it in person.</span>

Talk to them about the fact that he disappeared for three weeks as Omicron was ramping up. And we crashed into all of these, keep in mind, if you&#39;re Brian Jean, you&#39;re on the more conservative side, right? We crashed into all of these additional restrictions. And think of the businesses that failed because of that, because Jason Kenney was asleep at the switch. And Jason Kenney did all of these things in a way where he didn&#39;t engage people and he didn&#39;t think about the programs and their construction in a way that would protect ordinary good people in Ponoka, in Fort McMurray, in High River, wherever it is that you think you&#39;ve got your votes coming from.</span>

It&#39;s more true on the right, I think it&#39;s fair to say. But it&#39;s true in both cases. And you see people everywhere saying the reason we lose is because my party just, they&#39;ve watered down too much. They&#39;ve moderated too much. We just need strong conviction of our values. We do that. We&#39;ll move the Overton window. People will be talking about things. We&#39;ll win some elections because people just want fighters. People want conviction. Nothing here is unique to the right wing. And it&#39;s something that&#39;s just going on more generally across society right now. So if I&#39;m the liberals and I&#39;m sitting there and I&#39;m thinking about that, I&#39;m thinking about how do I, as Justin Trudeau, the leader of a purportedly centrist party, deal with a world that is polarizing like that? Now, we&#39;ve seen the liberals move to the left on quite a few issues, and maybe that&#39;s the liberal solution to it. But that&#39;s still leaving an awful lot of people perhaps feeling a little bit squeamish, a little bit uncomfortable.
