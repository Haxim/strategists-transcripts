      <h1>Episode 981: Live in Calgary: The starting pistol for the closing arguments</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">April 11, 2022</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Alberta UCP's leadership review (and more) in this live show recorded in Calgary, Alberta. Will Jason Kenney's "unity vs division" ballot question work? How should progressives react to increased polarization in Alberta, Canada and beyond? And did Carter really open with an STD joke? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.  <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

People told him to his face that he was likely to win. He didn&#39;t win. They said they&#39;d vote one way, and then they voted another way. Stelmack and Redford were both able to kind of game their systems, wind up with 78%. And I mean, gaming their systems by bringing in their supporters. It wasn&#39;t going to be over 2,000 people at their events. They were able to manage their outcomes a lot more effectively. But</div>

And you see people everywhere saying the reason we lose is because my party just, they&#39;ve watered down too much. They&#39;ve moderated too much. We just need strong conviction of our values. We do that. We&#39;ll move the Overton window. People will be talking about things. We&#39;ll win some elections because people just want fighters. People want conviction. Nothing here is unique to the right wing. And it&#39;s something that&#39;s just going on more generally across society right now. So if I&#39;m the liberals and I&#39;m sitting there and I&#39;m thinking about that, I&#39;m thinking about how do I, as Justin Trudeau, the leader of a purportedly centrist party, deal with a world that is polarizing like that? Now, we&#39;ve seen the liberals move to the left on quite a few issues, and maybe that&#39;s the liberal solution to it.
