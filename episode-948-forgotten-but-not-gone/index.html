        <p>Stephen Carter, campaign manager and incoming chief of staff to mayor-elect Jyoti Gondek of Calgary, talks about the strategy, the inflection points and the story that propelled his candidate to victory. How did they move from 2% to 45% in the polls? When were the moments where it all seemed in doubt? And how long until Stephen asks Corey to take this episode down? Corey Hogan and Zain Velji ask the questions. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

It was bigger than that which supported it. it and again in 20 2021 um especially in the last 10 days we were supported primarily by myth because we didn&#39;t have the same number of signs out that everybody else had we didn&#39;t have any tv ads we didn&#39;t have any radio ads we didn&#39;t have ads in in like we had digital and you know i think cory you saw a graph of our digital spend that you you retweeted out at one point um our digital spend was off the charts compared to everybody else&#39;s digital spend but in part that&#39;s because because I had to make a strategic decision on which medium to buy because I could not afford to buy three different mediums.

There was a race for mayor in Calgary that Nahid Nenshi ultimately won. And at just this moment over the summer, Kent Hare, the former MP, former MLA here, he was in the race for mayor and he was leading. And Kent&#39;s a good friend of mine. I&#39;ve known Kent for many, many years. And all of a sudden, Nahid Nenshi is in the race. And, you know, at one point, I think the hope was Nahid Nenshi would sort of help out Ken&#39;s campaign.

And this was before Barb Higgins joined the race, which added a whole element, for those of you who remember that and lived through that.

And I won&#39;t go blow by blow because I wouldn&#39;t do it justice, but Stephen then sits there for the next 10 minutes and tells me milestones, where they&#39;re going to be. Not total actual percents, but kind of like horse race numbers, you know, directionally where people are going to be. I&#39;ll be in the mix here, like all of a sudden polling in the crowd. And then just before this date, he&#39;ll be second or third. And then the idea is that will propel us going forward. And he just like really spelled it out.

Has this changed from Redford? Has this changed from any of your other successes or failures in terms of how you&#39;ve scripted this thing? Was it you and the candidate? Was it you? Do you refine it with the team? I&#39;m curious what you did this time. I know you use sounding boards and smart folks around you, but how did this come together as a process?

The lesson we learned from the Olympics was that was not a left-right coalition. It was a top-bottom. If you were, you know, in the lower socioeconomic brackets of the city, you pretty much told the Olympics to go fuck themselves because you had shit to worry about that was not throwing a party. And we were congratulating ourselves during that campaign being like, look at this, we got like NDPers and like hardcore UC peers in the same room. There&#39;s no way this thing doesn&#39;t win. And I think it kind of showcased that there was a huge class divide. And that was something I expected Farkas to tap into extensively and often, especially considering, frankly, where he&#39;s come from geographically and the background. Like, I thought that was totally untapped potential, especially considering you&#39;re a candidate. Yes, well, a South Asian woman doesn&#39;t have the lived experience of perhaps someone from East Calgary, a very different sort of immigration and sort of educational trajectory in terms of that relatability.
