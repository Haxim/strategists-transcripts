          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the possible airline bailout and sabre rattling by conservatives around Line 5's looming deadline to end operations.

We&#39;ve we&#39;ve got him saying earlier this week that Texas, I believe his quote was 100% open, that that all businesses, you know, can can resume opening Mississippi has followed suit. In response, Gavin Newsom has tweeted and is now kind of, you know, using Texas as a punching bag. Joe Biden has said this is Neanderthal thinking. I want to just start here just getting your initial reaction with what&#39;s going on in Texas. And then let&#39;s talk a little bit more about it.

That&#39;s part of the national response, but that&#39;s not part of his response because the governor of Texas ain&#39;t noted for jumping in and doing helping hand type stuff.

It&#39;s not easy sailing for him as he heads towards – as he comes out of some scandals of his own, including some hypocrisy that we&#39;d mentioned on earlier episodes of this podcast and You the People.

            <div class="said">In 1972, researchers at Stanford did an experiment where they would have a child in a room and</div>

            <div class="said">they would say, here&#39;s a marshmallow. And they would then leave the room, but tell the child if they went 15 minutes without eating the marshmallow, they could have two marshmallows. Very famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, it&#39;s called. Well, this is exactly like that, except instead of marshmallows, it&#39;s alive people. And I don&#39;t understand what the fuck Texas is doing. They are so close. America is so close. All they have to do is wait a couple more months and everybody will be vaccinated. The fact that they are deciding to call the game in the middle of the third quarter is absolutely nuts to me. It&#39;s crazy. Now, I agree with everything Carter said about California. I also don&#39;t think you need two masks when you have two states. Arizona and New Mexico should be protection enough from Texas.</div>

It&#39;s kind of interesting to see, like, there does seem to be a bit of Newsom gunning for a national spotlight, which has always been a part of his subtext of the Gavin Newsom story. But do you feel like it&#39;s that? Or do you feel like it&#39;s just strict opportunism?</div>

It&#39;s just like the Canadian provinces, there&#39;s this expectation of collegiality to a certain extent or stay the fuck out of my yard is probably a more accurate way to put it but um when they are looking at the next job if they are looking at national profile if they&#39;re looking to be a leader in their party more generally and if you&#39;re like both of these governors have a reason to have this fight i think zane is the important thing uh to talk about here um abbott it just got through this terrible ice storm wants to change the story wouldn&#39;t mind actually if people are arguing about whether this mask because eliminating the mask uh rules is more popular than his performance during the you know the the blast of winter that texas got meanwhile in california newsom as you&#39;ve mentioned is facing all sorts of problems he&#39;s trying to get the democrats to rally to him as a leader as a democrat in the fight with republicans because in california the opposite is true you will never go wrong as a democrat if you can get all of the democrats behind you fighting with republicans so um it&#39;s unusual but it serves both of their purposes and in a way i doubt either of them is that fussed with it which by the way is why we should all be kind of pissed with it yeah</div>

            <div class="said">it did change the channel. It changed the channel to something that he actually wins on. Corey has pointed out that this is more popular than he is. The mask mandate is, you know, wearing a mask is part of being of your political identity in the United States and, frankly, here in Canada to a lesser extent. So when you can win like this on an issue, it&#39;s actually really good politics. And Governor Abbott changed the channel. Didn&#39;t help anybody. didn&#39;t help anybody. He&#39;s going to kill more people. And now I&#39;m worried about the potential of a Texas strain of the coronavirus. The problem with more spread is that there&#39;s more variation and more variation could mean something that comes out that&#39;s vaccine resistant. Even if it&#39;s for a few more months until we get a new variant of the vaccinations, this could be a real problem. problem and you</div>

Because we have Jerry Diaz of Unifor who&#39;s saying that $7 billion is now the floor on this thing because of how tenuous and tough the negotiations have been with the government. I&#39;ll add further context. It being other countries across the world have already, I should say, dealt with their airline industry by forking over some money. In your estimation, why did this take so long in the sense of, and I&#39;m not saying right or wrong, we&#39;ll discuss right or wrong on strategy, but why do you think we&#39;re perhaps an outlier in that scheme of things?

            <div class="said">challenge, I mean, I think that part of it is waiting to see what the size of the problem is. You know, will we be backflying this summer? Will we be backflying next fall? I mean, there&#39;s many, many questions about how long it&#39;s going to take for the airline industry to resume something vaguely resembling normalcy. I don&#39;t think the federal government knows that. I don&#39;t think Unifor knows that. I don&#39;t think WestJet and Air Canada know that. So understanding the depth of the problem is probably one of the reasons that it&#39;s taking so long. And the other is the solution started almost on day one when the federal government stepped in with wage subsidies to keep the airlines whole and keep their employees actually getting paid. You know, over a billion dollars being put into wage subsidies basically for two companies is not insignificant. And it should be noted, unfortunately, Unifor has decided to make that a negative for the government. But I think that this is actually a positive. They could have gotten a much smaller bailout six months ago. But we&#39;d be right back in the exact same problem that we&#39;re in right now.</div>

This has to be equity in Air Canada and WestJet, right? Right. Onyx has to give up some of its position in WestJet for the recovery or they don&#39;t get the money that that has to be part of the of the structure. Now, there&#39;s many ways of doing that. You can issue more capital there. You can take bonds that turn into equity. There&#39;s many different ways of doing that structure.

            <div class="said">Let&#39;s step back a bit and talk about what&#39;s really on the table here, which is that 1% interest on $9 billion of loans. Well, there&#39;s a cost to that. I don&#39;t know what Air Canada and WestJet can borrow at on the open market right now. But let&#39;s just say for fun, it&#39;s 4%, which would be pretty good, I think, given all of the challenges they have. Yeah. So we&#39;re giving them 3% lower. To put that in real dollar terms, that&#39;s saving them almost $300 million a year at the full size of the loan. And then obviously, if they&#39;re paying it off over time, it&#39;s less.

A recovery program suggests, like, we just want to get back on our feet faster. The economy needs to spin a little bit faster. And that&#39;s where I think as a government you get into trouble with people lacking sympathy for airlines. It&#39;s like, yeah, great. Help them back on their feet faster instead of me. fuck you but if you start talking in terms of well we need to be able to travel across this enormous country of ours without going through chicago then i then you know the situation becomes a little more real for people i think and so that&#39;s why if i&#39;m the government i&#39;m talking about it in terms of bailout because the implication is i don&#39;t have a choice right this is what i&#39;ve got to do and um i i can understand why deus would say that but i actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to get what he wants if anything i would be trying to raise the stakes on I understand why Air Canada would not want to raise the stakes on this.

We don&#39;t actually know how this all plays out. All we can look at is the recessions of the past.

And isn&#39;t it the right of the premier or the governor to say, hey, this doesn&#39;t meet the standards that we have? And then, you know, the national government in the case of Trans Mountain and likely the national government in the case down in Michigan, too, say, no, sorry, this is crossing some boundaries.

            <div class="said">taking a wiffle ball bat to the federal government will be politically advantageous to him in the province of Alberta. I think Albertans by and large will like that. All of the polling I&#39;ve ever seen on this matter suggests that Canadians think the federal government doesn&#39;t do enough, that the provincial government has got it right. And while that is not kind of the monolith it was in years past, the reality is the economic interests of this province are so closely tied up, there&#39;s probably not enough that the federal government could do. So, yeah, he may find that that&#39;s a great thing to argue on and fight on, but it might be a Pyrrhic victory because in 2023, if not only do we not have KXL, but Line 5 is shut down, well, I mean, that&#39;s just fucked.
