We are going to start a Kickstarter to buy Carter another $30 microphone, anything to help him get back on his feet. Or</span>

People don&#39;t know this. We schedule these episodes two years in advance because it&#39;s very hard to book me. So we schedule these episodes two years in advance. We also schedule the subject matter in advance, which is what makes for the uneven nature of this podcast.

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">wouldn&#39;t you just co-brand it or something like that like to to take two sets of money and two two different sets of branding um it just strikes It strikes me that they were either overselling the benefit to the donor, which is probably what they were doing, right? They&#39;d build something for $200,000 that they took a donation for $100,000, just making up numbers completely, in</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">either way, I mean, one is kind of unethical. The other is virtually fraudulent. So I&#39;m interested to the continuing series of how the Strategist podcast unpacks the We Charity as we learn more about this rather dubious practice. I just think it was a stupid move. They&#39;ve been caught. Now they&#39;re going to suffer a little bit more. But ultimately, they are going to be the whipping boy for charities for a little while to go.</span>

That&#39;s part of the national response, but that&#39;s not part of his response because the governor of Texas ain&#39;t noted for jumping in and doing helping hand type stuff.

            <span class="text">they would say, here&#39;s a marshmallow. And they would then leave the room, but tell the child if they went 15 minutes without eating the marshmallow, they could have two marshmallows. Very famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, it&#39;s called. Well, this is exactly like that, except instead of marshmallows, it&#39;s alive people. And I don&#39;t understand what the fuck Texas is doing. They are so close. America is so close. All they have to do is wait a couple more months and everybody will be vaccinated. The fact that they are deciding to call the game in the middle of the third quarter is absolutely nuts to me. It&#39;s crazy. Now, I agree with everything Carter said about California. I also don&#39;t think you need two masks when you have two states. Arizona and New Mexico should be protection enough from Texas.</span>

It&#39;s kind of interesting to see, like, there does seem to be a bit of Newsom gunning for a national spotlight, which has always been a part of his subtext of the Gavin Newsom story.

            <span class="text">Where do I start with this? Why is this happening so late? Maybe let&#39;s start here. Because we have Jerry Diaz of Unifor who&#39;s saying that $7 billion is now the floor on this thing because of how tenuous and tough the negotiations have been with the government. I&#39;ll add further context. It being other countries across the world have already, I should say, dealt with their airline industry by forking over some money. In your estimation, why did this take so long in the sense of, and I&#39;m not saying right or wrong, we&#39;ll discuss right or wrong on strategy, but why do you think we&#39;re perhaps an outlier in that scheme of things? Over</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Over $1 billion has been paid to the airlines already in wage subsidies. So to pretend like this is taking a long time and that the airlines are in some sort of challenge,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">challenge, I mean, I think that part of it is waiting to see what the size of the problem is. You know, will we be backflying this summer? Will we be backflying next fall? I mean, there&#39;s many, many questions about how long it&#39;s going to take for the airline industry to resume something vaguely resembling normalcy. I don&#39;t think the federal government knows that. I don&#39;t think Unifor knows that. I don&#39;t think WestJet and Air Canada know that. So understanding the depth of the problem is probably one of the reasons that it&#39;s taking so long. And the other is the solution started almost on day one when the federal government stepped in with wage subsidies to keep the airlines whole and keep their employees actually getting paid. You know, over a billion dollars being put into wage subsidies basically for two companies is not insignificant. And it should be noted, unfortunately, Unifor has decided to make that a negative for the government. But I think that this is actually a positive. They could have gotten a much smaller bailout six months ago. But we&#39;d be right back in the exact same problem that we&#39;re in right now.</span>

We do need to have WestJet. They&#39;re it. That&#39;s all we&#39;ve got as far as domestic travel, and this is a big country. So the 1% interest, deal of that size, perhaps getting equity in return, that&#39;s all pretty reasonable to me. And I would worry that six months ago, we would have been</span>

This has to be equity in Air Canada and WestJet, right? Right. Onyx has to give up some of its position in WestJet for the recovery or they don&#39;t get the money that that has to be part of the of the structure. Now, there&#39;s many ways of doing that. You can issue more capital there. You can take bonds that turn into equity. There&#39;s many different ways of doing that structure. But at the end of the day, the people of Canada should be I don&#39;t think we need to be made whole because Corey mentioned the importance of the airline industry. industry.

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s step back a bit and talk about what&#39;s really on the table here, which is that 1% interest on $9 billion of loans. Well, there&#39;s a cost to that. I don&#39;t know what Air Canada and WestJet can borrow at on the open market right now. But let&#39;s just say for fun, it&#39;s 4%, which would be pretty good, I think, given all of the challenges they have. Yeah. So we&#39;re giving them 3% lower. To put that in real dollar terms, that&#39;s saving them almost $300 million a year at the full size of the loan. And then obviously, if they&#39;re paying it off over time, it&#39;s less. If it&#39;s a bullet loan, it&#39;s over $3 billion when it&#39;s all said and done.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, before I let you substantiate your thoughts on this as well, this isn&#39;t a bailout. I would argue this is a loan to the industry based on the time that has gone on and added the complexity to the negotiations. I suggest $7 billion is now the floor, not the ceiling. Close quote by Jerry Diaz of Unifor. So he&#39;s arguing against the concept of bailout. You also suggested that the government should be framing this as a bailout.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think it should be a bailout because the implication is if you don&#39;t do it, the business will fail. That&#39;s what&#39;s inherent in a bailout. A recovery program suggests, like, we just want to get back on our feet faster. The economy needs to spin a little bit faster. And that&#39;s where I think as a government you get into trouble with people lacking sympathy for airlines. It&#39;s like, yeah, great. Help them back on their feet faster instead of me. fuck you but if you start talking in terms of well we need to be able to travel across this enormous country of ours without going through chicago then i then you know the situation becomes a little more real for people i think and so that&#39;s why if i&#39;m the government i&#39;m talking about it in terms of bailout because the implication is i don&#39;t have a choice right this is what i&#39;ve got to do and um i i can understand why deus would say that but i actually don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to get what he wants if anything i would be trying to raise the stakes on I understand why Air Canada would not want to raise the stakes on this. I think their union should be thinking about this a bit more. The reason the union doesn&#39;t want to, I suspect, Zane, is because if</span>

We don&#39;t actually know how this all plays out. All we can look at is the recessions of the past. And in general, governments have been punished more for not taking action than they have been punished for taking action. so my thinking is that more action is better um i think that in general that has worked over the last year and i don&#39;t see that changing um now that might be like obviously every industry is going to run up to the government after this right we need to bail out too yeah right um but</span>

Of course, as some of our early listeners know, our podcast was considered a public utility in the early days. We were actually an extension of the government. We didn&#39;t say much. We couldn&#39;t say much. We were pretty much praising the government of the day, the strategists talking about how excellent the strategy was reinforcing.

In November, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer ordered Line 5 to be shut down by May, accusing Calgary-based Enbridge of violating the terms of the deal that allowed the line to traverse the Straits in Michigan there. The federal government today said they won&#39;t let Michigan shut down the Line 5 pipeline. Seamus O&#39;Regan, the Minister of Natural Resources, dismissed opposition comparisons to the thwarted Keystone XL project. Carter, simple and straightforward question for you first. Is</span>

We were musing about the challenges of dealing with China in our last episode. That&#39;s challenging. It could be challenging to deal with an American first recovery plan. That&#39;s challenging.

You can&#39;t have individual states making up individual rules of engagement of international trade. That&#39;s the nation-state responsibility. We have international government relations to do that, and we have to protect those rights that we have earned and negotiated from the federal government in the United States.</span>

And isn&#39;t it the right of the premier or the governor to say, hey, this doesn&#39;t meet the standards that we have? And then, you know, the national government in the case of Trans Mountain and likely the national government in the case down in Michigan, too, say, no, sorry, this is crossing some boundaries. This is not your responsibility. We got this. Your responsibility is</span>

I mean, holy cow. I mean, it&#39;s been a wild enough ride just on the proposed pipelines. It&#39;s going to get a bit weird. And 500,000 barrels a day, over 500,000, that&#39;s a lot of barrels a day.

And I&#39;m fairly confident that the federal government in Canada and the federal government in the United States are going to work this out. I would be floored if the governor of Michigan had their way on this one because of the ramifications to the economy, to political power within the United States, to diplomacy between the United States and Canada. It would be quite something if the governor was successful here. But you never know. You never know what the courts are going to say. Well,</span>

            <span class="text">might – the other thing I will stress to people is these are rarely binaries, right? So if Joe Biden has to weigh in and he&#39;ll say like, no, no, no, the governor of Michigan cannot do that, but I can do that, and I&#39;m telling them they&#39;ve got to restrict their flows over the Great Lakes. Like that&#39;s a possibility. People need to appreciate that those are the things that happen when people start trying to shore up their positions like that. And so it would be much better off if Enbridge and Michigan can come to an accord on this, and everybody can walk away with their heads held high.</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, you know, politics, as we&#39;ve said on this show and elsewhere often is just about pattern, developing patterns, showcasing patterns. The conservatives have hit on the fact that this is no different than Keystone XL. This is no different than Justin Trudeau having no power or leverage with the new president of the United States, that he has no skill in this domain, no ability in this domain. Conservative MP Strahl noted that the federal government has failed to prevent the U.S. president from canceling Keystone XL and says that this is no different, quote unquote. Is that the right calm strategy for the conservatives here? Is that what you&#39;d be trying to do? Link this to Keystone XL? Or do you have perhaps a different take that they should be considering to make the most potent attack out of this current situation for the government? Well,</span>

We&#39;ve already talked about how that may cause different, you&#39;ve got some uncertainty with that avenue, right? If it becomes a big drawn out political fight, if everybody draws lines, if the governor feels like them backing down is a defeat, then you&#39;ve got a real problem here. I do think that that the government of Canada needs to signal, yes, we have other avenues here. This will not be concluded there because that&#39;s a good way to pressure people to the table. That&#39;s a good way to get that conclusion that we&#39;re looking for here.

            <span class="text">taking a wiffle ball bat to the federal government will be politically advantageous to him in the province of Alberta. I think Albertans by and large will like that. All of the polling I&#39;ve ever seen on this matter suggests that Canadians think the federal government doesn&#39;t do enough, that the provincial government has got it right. And while that is not kind of the monolith it was in years past, the reality is the economic interests of this province are so closely tied up, there&#39;s probably not enough that the federal government could do. So, yeah, he may find that that&#39;s a great thing to argue on and fight on, but it might be a Pyrrhic victory because in 2023, if not only do we not have KXL, but Line 5 is shut down, well, I mean, that&#39;s just fucked.

Why you would want to tie Line 5, an existing pipeline that&#39;s been running safely for almost 70 years, to KXL, which was a big political dust up and knockout down in the United States that we have lost, and we have lost unequivocally, it&#39;s just beyond me. Why you would want to conflate those two issues and invite the kind of response that is possible when those two issues are conflated is it&#39;s sheer madness it is sheer madness and uh if we are all very lucky it will not register at all in the united states and everything will move on but if this gets dragged into the fight like i i mean i can like the people at enbridge in the c-suite must be just pulling out their hair i&#39;m sure they want this about as much as they want another six more weeks of winter it&#39;s just well actually enbridge might might want six more weeks of winter they sell natural gas but you get my point like this is this is not helpful to the situation as a whole cory</span>
