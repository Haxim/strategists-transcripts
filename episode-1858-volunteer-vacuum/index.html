Join Stephen and Zain as they figure out how to record and upload.</p><blockquote><p><em>Zain Velji and Stephen Carter strategize a potential NDP pivot, delve into the decline of political volunteerism, and share insights on expert polling panels. Can the NDP save the furniture? Does anyone besides political experts care what political experts think? And does it even count as a Burma-Shave if it's only 3 people? Corey Hogan is on the campaign trail. Zain and Stephen do their best.</em></p></blockquote>

And I do like to periodically check in with you in particular about if you were there right now, what would you be doing to the pivot for Jagmeet and Pierre? So maybe let me start there because I want to see if you&#39;ve got any fresh ideas. And if the answer is no, I&#39;ll move on to something else.

They&#39;re very Very interesting. They&#39;re like rock concerts now. So there is that particular sort of response</div>

We&#39;re going to make sure that we&#39;re there again at that table. Imagine if that had happened. It was a lot of their message going into this campaign. And I feel like they should own that. We&#39;re the party of being able to unearth and put together social supports. Now, I also see my own logical holes here in the sense that long term, Could this invalidate the party as ever touching a economic election ever again or invalidating them from from touching the economy? There&#39;s a good point there. Could they lose?
