Corey, is this something we need to start embracing? The more graphic, the more explicit political videos and political ads? Does this need to be part of our political culture here in Canada?

But you seem to get this sense that everybody is trying to one up each other on this total shock value that they can then drive into kind of national numbers and get get all sorts of fundraising that they can then funnel into their local campaign.

But this is the nature of U.S. politics. You have to kind of put yourself out there in some way, shape or form to try to win a primary, to try to win your spot in contention.

We&#39;ll talk about that. Minutes later, she was on Fox News, you know, talking about that. What do you kind of make of this in terms of our talent, our politics making its way into the United States? It&#39;s usually been a one-way street. Yeah,</span>

In two weeks, they&#39;ll go on to the next thing. I just sort of ping pong from issue of the week to issue of the week. And the worst case scenario is they&#39;re still talking about us because it feels like we are like six weeks of coverage away from US senators declaring an invasion of this country.

We&#39;re doing a draft for democracy. We&#39;re taking all of the characters, all of the politicians, the leaders, that have been involved in the saga for the last 20-some-odd days, and we&#39;re doing a draft. Who would you take to save democracy? Who would you have on your squad? Who would you want amongst the cast of characters to help you get out of this situation? And then we&#39;ll use that, as we often do on this show, as a jumping-off point to talk about some things. And there&#39;s a lot of things to talk about. It&#39;s kind of a way to keep things neatly organized so we don&#39;t miss some of them. But I&#39;ve given you the list of characters. We&#39;re going to do a snake draft. Carter, do you know what a snake draft is? Can I count on you to know the one thing in terms of what a snake draft format looks like?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">A snake draft is where when you get to the end of the draft order, you go back in reverse. So you basically get two draft picks in a row if you&#39;re either first or last draft pick. Since there&#39;s two of us, I guess that we both get two picks in a row. No,</span>

And then because he just went, Corey also goes again. And then at the end, it&#39;s just all of Corey. See, that&#39;s what I planned. And then you fucking showed up again, Carter.

            <span class="text">Well, she would have been my first draft pick, too. So I guess the consensus number one here. And again, it really is more about, as this thing goes on, I think it&#39;s a body count. People are just looking at who&#39;s screwed up the least when they&#39;re making these decisions. But Freeland did exude confidence on this. She certainly had a command of her file. There&#39;s just a way she carries herself, too, on matters like this, where she comes in with a big stack of papers and is like, okay, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. that, I mean, looks like an adult in a room that increasingly looks full of children. So I think that was a big part of it. And also it is the sparing use of her that is to her benefit. We&#39;re not mad</span>

Is it similar to Corey&#39;s here?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

Oh, that&#39;s a real consequence. consequence oh and so again it wasn&#39;t just this you know and i&#39;ve derided trudeau from day one about his tone and his tenor and when he speaks and it just sounds so forced and so fake and she comes in and she doesn&#39;t sound forced she doesn&#39;t sound faked she just comes in and she delivers it boom boom boom boom and each piece um stronger than the last from my point of view of something that was actually going to make an impact for Canadians.</span>

He&#39;s the premier of Ontario. He controls the jurisdictional space that you most need to clear this out. He somehow has gotten away with, I think not to the people of Ottawa, but to many rest of Canadians and even other Ontarians, of sort of pretending like Ottawa is not his problem, like Ottawa is somehow somebody else&#39;s problem.

Talk to me about those two things in terms of how they factored into you selecting Ford. And was that that good strategy on his part you think well</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, I think he would have been my next pick too because he came out and he didn&#39;t play petty politics. He didn&#39;t say, you know, I&#39;m not going to support this because it wasn&#39;t my idea, which is generally speaking, you know, how the conservatives have approached it, how Jason Kenney has approached it. He said, yes, I support this. Let&#39;s solve this problem. And he looks pragmatic. He looks like, if not a leader, I mean, not every moment of leadership needs to be, I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So the first person says, this is where we&#39;re going. The second person in is the actual leader. There was a video, a viral video about this, I don&#39;t know, five, six, seven hundred years ago when viral videos still mattered and there wasn&#39;t TikTok. But, you know, the idea was that the second person into the group was just as important as the first person. That was the person who signaled to the group, we are going to follow. And Doug Ford was the guy who went second in. He said, yes, I support this. Yes, we&#39;re going to solve this. And he&#39;s not solving it, but he&#39;s not getting tarnished by it. And I think that that partnership between Trudeau, Freeland, and Ford actually is working in Ontario.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, you often talked about in the corporate sense, the leading edge versus the bleeding edge situation. Do you feel like that&#39;s what what happened here with with Ford in some ways to Carter&#39;s point?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, not really. I mean, I guess I get the metaphor and the idea that he came in second to Stephen&#39;s point. But he</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he was second, but kind of first, like he was first to the premiers to come in. And what Stephen is saying is he, you know, he stood up and he said, Yeah, this is this good. This is fine. This is what we need to do. Willing to work with the federal government on this. I think we do need to acknowledge and like, let&#39;s not go nuts, patting Ford on the back.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So he&#39;s shifted blame. He&#39;s maybe gotten a political win, whether it was first or second. He&#39;s kind of come in with the value of being kind of on the leading and not bleeding edge, so to speak, not getting the cuts, so to speak, that Trudeau has. What does he need to do going forward? Because he can&#39;t just sit on his hands. Or can he, Carter? Like, can Ford sit on his hands now that the federal government has said, fuck it, we&#39;ll make this our problem?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to use Jason Kenney as a great example, right? Jason Kenney didn&#39;t do anything to get rid of the Coutts blockade. That was done by the RCMP.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But Jason Kenney gets to sit there and say, see, we didn&#39;t need the Emergencies Act or whatever the hell it was. No, you needed to arrest 13 people with guns and everybody else went, holy shit, this isn&#39;t the protest we thought it was. We&#39;re out of here. The people who did that and not getting too far ahead of myself and hope you&#39;ll allow me there are my next pick, which is the RCMP. they&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">they&#39;re the ones who cleared out coots and Jason Kenney didn&#39;t have to do a fucking thing and he looks like he&#39;s in control of the province when clearly he wasn&#39;t in control of the province until the RCMP took the action that they did, put themselves at risk and arrested 13 people who were plotting to hurt RCMP officers and others and then when regular quote unquote regular protesters saw the severity of what they were involved in, they all packed up and went home because they didn&#39;t think that this was the type of protest that they were involved in. So from my point of view, you know, Ford looks great because he, you know, Ford and Jason are in the same spot. Don&#39;t act and you still look good. The provincial governments are relatively powerless. The federal government, daddy&#39;s come in to clean it up or mommy, depending on what you want to do with your gender terms. But in they come, and now they&#39;re going to clean things up again.</span>

Corey, what do you think of that as that second pick, and even some reaction to what you heard from Carter in terms of what they did, their actions? And I&#39;ve got some follow-up questions on the RCMP front, unsurprisingly.</span>

            <span class="text">they&#39;re not they&#39;re not the provincial police there but yeah like there was kind of this sense of ignoring and maybe that&#39;s not even fair because obviously there were guns at coots and obviously there&#39;s tactical considerations that need to pull them down um but then even on the clearing out the hugging and whatnot and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well look i think that you know people can rightly say hey they&#39;re treating these protesters differently than they would treat other protesters maybe true but actually that&#39;s how i would kind of prefer they treat all protesters and all of the people in this tense moment and so i have a hard time saying like no be shitty to them, right? Like, that&#39;s not actually how I want my police force to act. So hopefully, you know, we can see that kind of sort of sympathy and compassion more generally, because I think we do have a big gap between policing and the police right now. And it&#39;s become quite a problem. But to get back to my main point about why I wouldn&#39;t draft the RCMP this high, it&#39;s</span>

And this is kind of an extrapolation of that. Like, in good faith, I don&#39;t know how to process the RCMP incident in Coutts with the hugging and the handshaking and being there for the national anthem. Part of me is like, what the actual fuck? They would never do this to people that look like me or people that were black or indigenous, religionists right in a similar protest like they just wouldn&#39;t i can i agree with you and</span>

Even here in Calgary, we see de-escalation choices every day when without parade permits, without protest permits, the police enable these folks to protest, to march on our streets.

React to that for me from your perspective. And if you kind of feel like that&#39;s what we witnessed here in some way, and we&#39;re still living in history, so commenting on it while living in it, as I mentioned on this podcast, not my favorite thing to do, but lay it on me as you hear that phrase and as you kind of look at the counterbalance here, Carter.

            <span class="text">Well, I think that that&#39;s true. But I also think that, you know, you can see it in multiple ways. The counter protesters are interesting because you can wind up in a false equivalency, right?</span>

            <span class="text">right? So if the counter protesters came out and they were actually, you know, like there was a protest today in British Columbia against coastal gas employees, and they were assaulted and RCMP officers were assaulted. So, you know, I&#39;m not going to characterize them left and right, but, you know, two groups of protesters, you could very easily wind up in a pox upon both their houses and the silent majority stays home, which I think we saw in 2016, right? When people created a false equivalency about how bad Trump would be versus how bad Hillary Clinton would be, that was a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">a disaster. And we wound up with Trump because we didn&#39;t get the voter turnout. People didn&#39;t come out and stop Trump because they were like, you know, they&#39;re all politicians. They&#39;re all the same. So if the counter-protest actually wound up being a net negative, you know, if they too turned out to be violent, Because there are people on both sides. And I got in trouble for the horseshoe theory last time I used it. So needless to say, I&#39;m bringing that back. You know, both sides are bad. And, you know, please don&#39;t just bring up the Nazis. You got to bring up Stalin. You know, every group of people that are ideologically motivated have the ability to become ideologically motivated in negative ways. And this group that rose up, the counter protesters that I&#39;ve drafted, not Corey, because he gave up on his opportunity, but the counter protesters that I drafted were very well behaved. They stood their ground and they have forced action without forcing violence, without forcing conflict. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve drafted them. That&#39;s why I&#39;m pleased to have them as number three on my team, the winning team.</span>

So I think it&#39;s necessary, but it&#39;s not sufficient. What do you do with that? When you break that false consensus, that doesn&#39;t immediately make people change their minds.

You have to find a way to bring people back together and sort of turn the other cheek. It&#39;s fucking tough. It&#39;s a reason why we look at these flashpoints throughout the world and they fester for decades, right? Centuries in some cases. It&#39;s because it&#39;s tough. It&#39;s really tough. But if we want to actually live up to those Canadian values we pretend to have so often, it does involve a certain amount of kindness. It involves bringing people back together.

But there have been a lot of very positive things that have come from the protests. There are a group of people who feel like they belong to something. And this is why the counter protests could be very, very powerful. If they were done properly, right? If you had people feeling like they belong to something, that creation of a new family type of feeling. Corey&#39;s talked about how we can&#39;t walk away from these people. Bring people in, bring people into the groups we are longing to be part of groups this is why i came back so quickly to the strategist podcast uh we</span>

I hope they go away on Monday. Like, I don&#39;t know what they were thinking when they made the decisions that they made, or more accurately, the decisions they didn&#39;t make, and let them entrench. I mean, Jesus, you know, if you ever listen to like kind of podcasts on the French Revolution, or read books about it, and you hear about how they created these, you</span>

And, you know, the answer is they did it in like a couple of hours. And even then you think that&#39;s pretty mental. It took weeks. They had hot tubs up, these guys. I mean, this is crazy. And the police just sort of let it happen. And listen, there&#39;s a lot of stuff behind the scenes. And you&#39;ve got to take all of this reporting with a grain of salt around what the OPP was willing to put up with, you know, what the OPS, you know, police were willing to do. regardless uh nobody loses in this thing more than the ottawa police service and by extension chief slowly carter</span>

They&#39;re being asked to allow people to have their say, and that&#39;s a direct result of overzealous policing, overly active policing choices that were made, especially in minority communities, visible minority communities that were protesting, BLM movements that have been squashed by actions of the police services. And so they&#39;ve been they&#39;ve been told move slower. And so that type of thinking is it was was driving them. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, if you think back to the Black Lives Matter movement and the Occupy movements, those movements were in some way, you know, they they allow them to happen. happen now there was some violent because there has been violence in the past they&#39;ve allowed these things to happen but they were controlled this was an uncontrolled thing you know the the occupy movement didn&#39;t come in and you know set up a hot tub they didn&#39;t set up a this is one of the more well-financed you know like bringing in their own porta potties bringing in their own hot tubs bringing in their own nightclub you know with with music and lights and and like these things things were totally different and because of that the police were caught flat-footed because the tactics changed on one side and they didn&#39;t change on the other side and as a result you know the the the end game for the police service is they look like uh incompetent buffoons but in general we&#39;ve asked the police services please don&#39;t break these things up please allow people to have their their right of their fundamental right of speech um and i think that we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gone too far in allowing that to happen. You are allowed to have your rights until such time as your rights infringe upon my rights. And that&#39;s when there&#39;s a conflict. And those conflicts, we have laws, we have laws and we have norms to govern those conflicts.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, you know, Carter last episode talked about police governance. I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on this. Like, do you think there&#39;ll be a fundamental shift in how we think about police governance from a civilian volunteer-led movement, in most of Canada, not all of Canada, I will say, that it&#39;s not the case everywhere. But that in moments of crisis, or in moments of peril, or where big, tough decisions need to be made, that we&#39;re just ill-equipped from a governance standpoint to do the right stuff.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so two thoughts on that. One is, I really do want to stress, like, when I pick slowly, it&#39;s, I&#39;m sort of by proxy picking the Ottawa police service the entire organization</span>

            <span class="text">you know frustration with how slowly was treated you know i want to say and i might have told this story in a different context before but i i have a friend who worked on cruise ships when he was younger and he was in charge of the children&#39;s programs on the cruise ships and he was an officer on the cruise ship as a result the equivalent of a lieutenant and that&#39;s not because kids are hard and it&#39;s not because children&#39;s programs normally demand like compensation at that level or anything it&#39;s because if something goes wrong they&#39;re on a cruise ship and they&#39;re in the middle of the ocean and he&#39;s responsible for children right and so the the kind of classification and the compensation reflected that you were there it&#39;s like most jobs you&#39;re paid for the bad days not the good days and so the ottawa police service probably a fine police service when things are fine but fundamentally the job of a police service is not to deal with things when they are fine and uh i think that a lot of us are asking the question you just asked saying at this point like is policing set up to deal with this kind of challenge is this challenge going to be more likely even if the answer to the second is not really pretty</span>

So I won&#39;t go into detail on it, but we&#39;re seeing the governance challenges. And I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time trying to think about what is the best solution for it.

Carter said something really interesting I want to jump on here. And I think it&#39;s a point that needs to be unpacked in the days, weeks and months to come here, which is that the Conservatives are a big part of why 30% of Canadians stand with the convoy. And I think that&#39;s 100% correct, right? Right. It&#39;s also, though, what made this such a weird and awkward situation and so challenging for me that the prime minister made his stand with Swastika&#39;s comment. Right.</span>

And part of why they see it that way is exactly that, like the Conservatives have gone and hugged this thing.

We should have had 10 provincial solutions to COVID. Arguably, it could have been better with individual mandates, you know, individual groups dealing with things. But because it was a national problem, it lands on the national desk. And the nature of this convoy, the way that it developed, the way that it unfolded, and then the way that we saw protests protests across the country, if you will, that forced the prime minister into an action position.

It was the weekend, the end of the first weekend. And at the time, I said, I thought it was smart that Trudeau kept his head down. And then the next time we talked about it was a week later. And I said, it&#39;s a little nuts to me, he still got his heads down. and uh but i said but i kind of refused to blame him because that&#39;s almost what people want to do like that&#39;s what his opponents want to do and now here we are again a week and a half after this and it&#39;s like you&#39;re you&#39;re kind of out of rope man of course they&#39;re going to blame you at this point and even if you sort of accept this sort of division of powers argument and that it&#39;s not really the prime minister&#39;s fault there</span>
