I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a story that has been Canadian-rooted that has gotten this much international press in the last half decade. Am I overstating that? This seems to be everywhere, and especially picked on by, you know, the conservative media in the United States. You know, MP Lassman yesterday in the House kind of had a back and forth with Trudeau. We&#39;ll talk about that. Minutes later, she was on Fox News, you know, talking about that. What do you kind of make of this in terms of our talent, our politics making its way into the United States? It&#39;s usually been a one-way street. Yeah,</div>

We&#39;re doing a draft for democracy. We&#39;re taking all of the characters, all of the politicians, the leaders, that have been involved in the saga for the last 20-some-odd days, and we&#39;re doing a draft. Who would you take to save democracy? Who would you have on your squad? Who would you want amongst the cast of characters to help you get out of this situation? And then we&#39;ll use that, as we often do on this show, as a jumping-off point to talk about some things. And there&#39;s a lot of things to talk about. It&#39;s kind of a way to keep things neatly organized so we don&#39;t miss some of them. But I&#39;ve given you the list of characters. We&#39;re going to do a snake draft.

            <div class="said">Well, she would have been my first draft pick, too. So I guess the consensus number one here. And again, it really is more about, as this thing goes on, I think it&#39;s a body count. People are just looking at who&#39;s screwed up the least when they&#39;re making these decisions. But Freeland did exude confidence on this. She certainly had a command of her file. There&#39;s just a way she carries herself, too, on matters like this, where she comes in with a big stack of papers and is like, okay, here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. that, I mean, looks like an adult in a room that increasingly looks full of children. So I think that was a big part of it. And also it is the sparing use of her that is to her benefit. We&#39;re not mad</div>

            <div class="said">So the first person says, this is where we&#39;re going. The second person in is the actual leader. There was a video, a viral video about this, I don&#39;t know, five, six, seven hundred years ago when viral videos still mattered and there wasn&#39;t TikTok. But, you know, the idea was that the second person into the group was just as important as the first person. That was the person who signaled to the group, we are going to follow. And Doug Ford was the guy who went second in. He said, yes, I support this. Yes, we&#39;re going to solve this. And he&#39;s not solving it, but he&#39;s not getting tarnished by it. And I think that that partnership between Trudeau, Freeland, and Ford actually is working in Ontario.</div>

So from my point of view, you know, Ford looks great because he, you know, Ford and Jason are in the same spot. Don&#39;t act and you still look good. The provincial governments are relatively powerless. The federal government, daddy&#39;s come in to clean it up or mommy, depending on what you want to do with your gender terms.

It&#39;s so much bigger. And if that group mobilizes, is it makes their voice heard and matches the intensity of the protesters, the protesters don&#39;t stand a goddamn chance because there are more of us than there are of them.

So if the counter protesters came out and they were actually, you know, like there was a protest today in British Columbia against coastal gas employees, and they were assaulted and RCMP officers were assaulted. So, you know, I&#39;m not going to characterize them left and right, but, you know, two groups of protesters, you could very easily wind up in a pox upon both their houses and the silent majority stays home, which I think we saw in 2016, right?

People didn&#39;t come out and stop Trump because they were like, you know, they&#39;re all politicians. They&#39;re all the same. So if the counter-protest actually wound up being a net negative, you know, if they too turned out to be violent, Because there are people on both sides. And I got in trouble for the horseshoe theory last time I used it. So needless to say, I&#39;m bringing that back. You know, both sides are bad. And, you know, please don&#39;t just bring up the Nazis. You got to bring up Stalin. You know, every group of people that are ideologically motivated have the ability to become ideologically motivated in negative ways. And this group that rose up, the counter protesters that I&#39;ve drafted, not Corey, because he gave up on his opportunity, but the counter protesters that I drafted were very well behaved. They stood their ground and they have forced action without forcing violence, without forcing conflict. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve drafted them. That&#39;s why I&#39;m pleased to have them as number three on my team, the winning team.</div>

In lots of other democracies, you will see large open air marches and demonstrations, I think, you know, literally called demonstrations of political support for their parties in open air in marches.

And this is why the counter protests could be very, very powerful. If they were done properly, right? If you had people feeling like they belong to something, that creation of a new family type of feeling. Corey&#39;s talked about how we can&#39;t walk away from these people.

Carter said something really interesting I want to jump on here. And I think it&#39;s a point that needs to be unpacked in the days, weeks and months to come here, which is that the Conservatives are a big part of why 30% of Canadians stand with the convoy. And I think that&#39;s 100% correct, right? Right.
