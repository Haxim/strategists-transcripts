        <div class="desc"><p>The "ask me thrice" campaign launch, the third-term Liberals and the United States of America have all seen better days. The gang discusses what's real, what's just optics and the strategy of it all.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Michelle Rempel Garner's UCP leadership bid, perceived Liberal malaise and the United States' continued slide into illiberalism. Is there value in teasing out leadership campaigns? Are the Liberals in trouble or is it just the usual pre-summertime commentary? And isn't laughter the best medicine? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

Well, justice is also kind of deaf and doesn&#39;t hear the crowd shouting for one outcome or another. And you&#39;ve got to kind of live that.
