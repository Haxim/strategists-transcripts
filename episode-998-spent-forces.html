And then, of course, Melanie Jolie and the bureaucrat within her department that attended a party with the russian embassy you know carter this is less about the facts of what&#39;s happening with the liberal government but more about the narrative in a sense and we see these every now and then right like you know in some days like as cory and i would would speak to in basketball terms like the the the basket seems like it&#39;s as big as the ocean you can&#39;t miss in other days in other months and other stretches carter you&#39;re like in this slump where you just can&#39;t make a shot and the media picks up on it. And there&#39;s a kind of a stench to what you&#39;re up to. There&#39;s almost even quasi-pression pieces right now out saying that this is going to be a summer of dismay for the liberals. I want to kind of get your insider&#39;s take on this, which is, this is a little bit fact, but a lot of bit story, Carter, in a sense. And how do we kind of get to these places where it just seems to coalesce, where you kind of look at, is there&#39;s this malaise or funk or sort of stink on the brand. Talk to me about this. Am I making this up in my head or is this kind of real? And do we witness this cyclically across whatever brand, color, whatever party in all orders of government?</span>

The second one we&#39;ll address second, which is the political effectiveness of this committee. But Corey, talk to me about the overarching question here, which is really the fact that this rule of law that you&#39;ve been discussing is now being kind of taken in through the political lens like, well, fucking everything else.

If we want to say we live in a a society with a rule of law. There&#39;s this notion that justice is blind. Well, justice is also kind of deaf and doesn&#39;t hear the crowd shouting for one outcome or another. And you&#39;ve got to kind of live that. And the more you drift from it, the more you&#39;re going to drift from it because you create all sorts of edge cases here.</span>
