My Spurs are not making any play-in, play-off, play-whatever. They are not. They are not. So I&#39;ll be cheering. Maybe I&#39;ll join you. Oh,</span>

            <span class="text">to our first segment here. Guys, you&#39;re ready for it. I know you&#39;re ready for it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Fine, fabulous, or fucked. Oh, good. It is back. Oh, I love this one. It is a classic, and like always, I add a fourth. So we&#39;ve got fine. Fine, that&#39;s a static term. We&#39;ve got fabulous, that&#39;s a static term. We&#39;ve also got fucked, a static term. Now, I need to add one to perhaps help us with making the distinction between fine and fabulous, and that is where I&#39;m adding foolish, Stephen Carter. We&#39;ve got fine,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Those are the four. Now, if you&#39;re new to the show, welcome. Welcome. Please leave a six-star review as part of our ongoing yearly six-star review pledge drive. Tune back to a few episodes ago, episode 934, to understand what I&#39;m talking about. But listen, welcome to the show. This is an ongoing segment that we do. And what we do with this segment is I run through a list of stories that are currently in our political zeitgeist. It&#39;s kind of a grab bag of things that are big and small, things that are meaningful and perhaps not. And I asked Stephen and Corey whether the participants at play, and often the singular participant who&#39;s faced with the decision or has to hold the proverbial bag, is it fine for them? Is it foolish for them? Is it fabulous or is it fucked? The best way to jump into this, Stephen Carter, is by jumping into this. And I&#39;m going to start with you. Yeah. Justin Trudeau, with his standing on the podium mentioning this term one-dose summer without necessarily any rudder. I mean, we got a bit of a rudder later in the week on Friday when we learned that 75% of first dose and 20% of second dose is perhaps what he was saying. But this whole concept, this verbiage, this marketing speak that is one-dose summer, fine, foolish, fabulous, or fucked for Justin Trudeau? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think it&#39;s foolish. I think that the problem is you have a situation where you&#39;ve now created a branding that can be used against you. And also it is it doesn&#39;t reflect the reality. We&#39;re in the middle of May right now. And we&#39;re seeing a significant step up in the number of vaccinations that are being delivered across the country. And frankly, I think more of us are going to have our second dose by the end of June than anybody would have reasonably predicted just a few months ago. So it just feels foolish to be putting the cart before the horse and also defining a failure. And One Dose Summer feels like a failure more than the success that I think we&#39;re actually heading towards.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, One Dose Summer, not the title of our cover band, although I think we would kill if we had a band named One Dose Summer. We would, of course, be performing exclusively on Zoom if it were One Dose Summer. But does this marketing speak? He&#39;s mentioned one-dose summer, and then he&#39;s also gone into mentioning two-dose fall.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Foolish? Fabulous? Fucked? I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s foolish, too, for all of the reasons Stephen said. He&#39;s managed to create a brand that nobody was calling for. This is an example of good advice taken to an absurd extreme. You do want to manage expectations.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s part of any good political communication strategy. You don&#39;t overcommit to things. But Stephen&#39;s exactly right. Right. By the end of June, we&#39;re going to be in a situation based on some of the projections where they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they have, you know, 75-25 end of June. And when you start thinking about the fact that, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know, by the end of July, we might be, you know, 75-50, that is by anybody&#39;s standard, a quote-unquote two-dose summer. So I don&#39;t really get it. It&#39;s sort of like if you&#39;re Pepsi and you&#39;ve got all of this data that shows you win the taste test, but your slogan becomes, people say it&#39;s good, but we feel it&#39;s not as good as Coke, right? Like, what the hell&#39;s the point of this? And I just think it was very unnecessary and foolish as a result. Do you, Carter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, agree with Corey&#39;s thesis that this is like good advice taken to an absurd, like good advice politically and then like wrapped up in marketing speak? Is that like, is that, first of all, is that what you think happened? And secondly, maybe I&#39;ll expand upon the point. Is this a common mistake that you guys have seen as strategists with like with politicians and political candidates and such that they try to be, to use a Corey term, like too cute by half to try to take something that&#39;s a good piece of advice and then turning it into like candidate or politician speak? speak?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think setting expectations is a good idea. So setting expectations that maybe we&#39;re not going to be getting the dose. I think we saw expectations set all through the vaccination structure, you know, and maybe it&#39;s going to take a little longer, blah, blah, blah, but we&#39;re going to catch up. Expectations were set all the way through and then we started to exceed those expectations. And once the expectations were exceeded, everybody started to feel happier. So setting the expectation would have been fine, but providing a slogan for your failure isn&#39;t fine. That&#39;s foolish. And that&#39;s where the problem is, is in this particular in this situation. He provided the slogan for his own failure. Fortunately, he&#39;s up against Aaron O&#39;Toole and the conservatives managed to, you know, well,</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">That Carter referring, of course, to the the meme fail of the O&#39;Toole conservatives, where they took a Trudeau summer and compared it to a Trudeau summer, which, as Carter mentioned, was last time a very white group of people enjoying summer as two-dose summer. And the meme underneath of a Trudeau summer was a man not on a ventilator, but an oxygen mask, boat stock images. Carter, before Corey jumps in. They</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That was also episode 934. That&#39;s right. Corey, to the broader question here, is this like a common mistake that we see amongst political candidates and politicians? Do you feel like this is something that you&#39;ve seen more than once, or is this just one of the rare examples in your mind?</span>

            <span class="text">Oh, I&#39;ve seen this all the time. I&#39;m sure Stephen has, too. You give them a chestnut, it becomes reasonable advice, and then all of a sudden they take it to the point where they just fall apart. Here in Alberta, we had a very notable example when our Minister of Health, in the pursuit of message discipline, somebody obviously told him, you can answer whatever you want, and they&#39;re going to have to use the clip that you&#39;ve got. took</span>

Is it just like, kill it, kill the phrase, stop using it, stop being, stop doing it? Or is there actual, like, other than just abort, is there actual, you know, advice to replace it with something, Carter? What would you suggest right now? Is it just a straight abandon it and move on? Or is there something else?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;d just abandon it and move on. I think we see in Alberta what happens when Jason Kenney, It was the greatest summer ever, the best summer, maybe something close to a good summer. It&#39;s not going to be a good summer. It&#39;s going to suck as a summer. I mean, so why are we branding this summer? Why don&#39;t we just let it unfold? I mean, no one really knows what this summer is going to look like. We are moving in the right direction, move to the right direction, and then brand it afterwards. When you&#39;re done, then remind everybody this is a way better summer than we were expecting.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that&#39;s the problem. By creating such a durable brand for this, this quote-unquote one-dose summer, even if the summer is great, even if, you know, PHAC has said effectively we can start reducing some of these restrictions when we hit a level we expect to hit in June, people may a year from now – let&#39;s just say this election doesn&#39;t happen for a year. You might actually start to think the summer was shittier than it was because it has this government-sanctioned branding of the one-dose summer. Well, you know, the United States went on with their lives. Yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, you know, I&#39;m just looking it up. And I was doing this during, of course, the Zane Velji show. But I believe OneDoseSummer.ca is taken. So I will not be surprised if, Corey, our competition band appears or this becomes a political attack site of some kind. Like, I would not be surprised at all if this is actually parked by the conservatives as we speak to hammer on Trudeau because of what you just said. The brand, in such a short duration of time, six days, five days, has become pretty durable, unfortunately, for the Trudeau government, as it says, as it stands right now, I should say. OK, let me move it on to our next one. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you on this one. It&#39;s a broad one, so let&#39;s spend a bit of time on it because we did a drive-by last week as well as the week before. For Bill C-10, as it stands for Minister Gilboa, I mean, he was on the hot seat Friday where he was speaking to, I believe, the Heritage Committee. They were asking him whether the bill would be able to regulate the algorithms on social media. So he&#39;s already tried to put a stop on, OK, it will not regulate your content as a user. We&#39;re going after the platforms, not the people. He&#39;s tried to make that distinction pretty clear. But now he&#39;s been thrown another wrench, another curveball regarding the algorithms. and wasn&#39;t able to say as it stands right now with a bit more time under our belt uh cory on c10 for minister gilbo find foolish fabulous or fucked right now it&#39;s</span>

This is just clumsy government. This is a very foolish approach to governing. And I cannot for the life of me fathom how after getting out of last week and kicking it away from committee, he somehow managed to step in another cow patty so very quickly. It&#39;s unfathomable to me how poorly they are managing this particular file. mile. And,</span>

            <span class="text">And, you know, amongst that, Carter, I&#39;m going to come to you in a second. Corey said foolish. I want to see if you agree. There&#39;s an article that came out just on Friday prior to him taking the hot seat at the Heritage Committee that said he ignored his own officials on the new controversial bill, where he kind of ignored some of the documents and almost kind of speaking to what we talked about last time, perhaps an overconfidence in saying that I can communicate this and maybe not doing his parliamentary duties there. Carter, do you also agree? Is this foolish or are you going with one of the other three Fs I&#39;m giving you on the scale? Would</span>

I&#39;m just absorbing that in terms of you had a ready-made enemy and somehow you turned it on, you know, you made yourself the enemy in that regard. Corey, I asked you guys last week, what would the natural sort of end to this? And you said languishing would be the worst thing that could happen to this particular bill.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, yeah. I want to kind of go down another path, which is let&#39;s zoom out for for Gilbo, but let&#39;s offer more general advice. What&#39;s the lesson here? Is it that as a parliamentarian, you need to know your shit, as simple as that? Is it that you need to have studied on this so that your job is not to just sit there and sit pretty, that you&#39;re actually advocating for a bill when you introduce it? What&#39;s the political lesson? I&#39;m just offering a few suggestions, but from your perspective, what&#39;s the political or even parliamentarian lesson that you would offer in broad terms based on this Gilbo example around C-10? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, Know Your Shit is a great start because so many of these things came out of almost, I think, what they perceived as a simple quick win. But really, I think that&#39;s the lesson. Beware of quick wins. Beware of easy wins. You&#39;ve got to understand the nuance of these particular issues. They are complicated. You are up against multi-billion dollar opponents here in these social media companies. They&#39;ve already lost a few rounds. They are getting more sophisticated. they are starting to use more pointed arguments that are likely to be more effective as they go down the road yeah australia may have surprised them they&#39;re not surprised by canada anymore so there&#39;s also kind of a lobbying notion in here and you can&#39;t walk like i said can&#39;t walk into this half-cocked this is this the idea that the like so i i&#39;m of two minds when i hear about ignoring the advice of his own officials right a briefing note went up and said this clause is here because of this reason and some official used language way beyond what they should have put put in a memo saying this is necessary for safeguarding. Like that&#39;s just bad briefing, no drafting for an official. They stated something in absolute terms and nothing in the world is that absolute. Right. And now they&#39;re, you know, elected officials embarrassed as a result. Their minister&#39;s embarrassed. They shouldn&#39;t have done that. So I don&#39;t I don&#39;t necessarily fault Gilbo as much on that as I think perhaps other people do. But there is kind of a fundamental reality here, which is there were flags on the field. There were people telling you there are complications here. you&#39;ve got to be aware of. And you can&#39;t just sort of, you or your chief of staff or your director of policy can&#39;t hand wave these away and say, oh, we fucking got this. This is popular. We&#39;re going to do this. Look what&#39;s happening in all these other jurisdictions.</span>

            <span class="text">That was a mistake. You&#39;ve got to understand your files, sure, but you&#39;ve also got to not lull yourself into this sense of complacency. I feel that the government thought because this wasn&#39;t a big issue, it wouldn&#39;t be a big issue. And that&#39;s a mistake.</span>

            <span class="text">Does this show the limits of communication? I know it&#39;s a very, like, simple thesis, but does this show that, like, there are things that you just can&#39;t massage through words, that you just can&#39;t massage through, like, well-spoken rhetoric? And I say this with this minister in particular, because not many of us know about him, but, you know, his history has been as an activist, where it&#39;s been really using the bully pulpit, you know, taking things that are very complex and making them very simple to understand from like that rhetoric and almost candidate perspective.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">place to look is a little further down the line earlier on the line right okay well if i&#39;m worried the communications might get dicey why is that what can i do to shore up the policy what can i do to shore up the implementation of said policy what can i do to shore up my stakeholder relationships on this all of that sort of hits before you get to the communications products you could argue stakeholder relationships is within communications but But I would argue it&#39;s deeper than that. And ultimately, you can&#39;t just sit there and say, hey, I got a poll. Hey, it says Canadians think that we should do something about this. Ergo, I&#39;m going to do something. I&#39;m going to be popular. Because this is also something we&#39;ve talked about in the past, this theory of novel concepts. And I used to always say this in polling context, right? Beware of polling on novel concepts. People have thought about it for 30 seconds. They can have their mind changed with 30 seconds of good arguments the other way, right? right? It&#39;s much different to poll on something that people have debated back and forth and sort of determined their whole political identity about. That&#39;s pretty durable. You&#39;re not going to change that with a billboard. You might change it with a billboard if nobody has thought about how you&#39;re going to regulate these companies before. So is it the limitations of communications?</span>

And maybe they&#39;re covering it a little bit too hard on the minister, because it turns out that it&#39;s not just Facebook. It&#39;s not just the social media platforms that now have become part of your adversary. It&#39;s part, it&#39;s the media that have become part of your adversary. We do this type of analysis all the time. You know, the media will always strive for fairness, but sometimes fairness doesn&#39;t look like equality, right?

Polling coming out by Leger saying 42% of those surveyed in Canada don&#39;t think Canadian athletes should compete in the Tokyo Olympics. 39% saying they should. And you also have polling out in Japan, which is, you know, while has limited their COVID spread quite significantly in terms of deaths as compared to our country and their population size per capita. They&#39;re doing amazing. Their vaccination rates are very poor right now. They&#39;re still in that 65 plus category. And so, you know, this particular question for Gilbo on Inheritage, and I know this is a decision by, you know, COC, but Inheritage has a play in it as well, is, you know, is his non-comment on this at this moment, not available for comment.

And this is foolish, because he is letting this get defined, defined in some ways by his own government, you know, why in a one dose summer where we are giving ourselves restraint, and we can&#39;t do all the things we&#39;re going to do, a certain percentage of the Canadian population will say, well, why are we doing sport then?</span>

Could this be a real question that almost unexpectedly hits the country, being like, oh, we&#39;re divided on this all of a sudden, and who knew there was these camps? To me, there&#39;s something about it. I can&#39;t explain it. Clearly, I&#39;m not the communicator that Corey is. But something about it feels like it could be one of those questions. It seems like these cultural questions are lightning rods.

Alberta is almost, when you look at number of people with one dose, number of people two doses, almost exactly two months behind the UK. So where&#39;s the UK right now? Well, they&#39;re opening up and they&#39;re expanding the ability to go to these events, to get out there, to go to pubs, to go to sporting venues.

Doug Ford&#39;s most recent political attack, because it clearly is as such, asserting that tighter federal borders will help drive Ontario&#39;s case counts down much faster. So he&#39;s extending lockdowns, giving a bit of a hat tip to community spread, but then is hitting hard on this federal jurisdiction of closing the borders. In fact, going so hard to now develop 30-second spots that they&#39;re running as the PC party of Ontario against the federal government, fundraising emails, all the like. It&#39;s a continued part of his rhetoric. It started probably about 10 days ago, extended to Friday when he said, oh, by the way, I think Friday or Thursday, just so I&#39;m clear, when he said, we&#39;re continuing the lockdown. But, you know, this is all about the variants and the borders and what the federal government could be doing here.

He&#39;s going to try to rile up people on an issue. And if he is lucky, they will forget he tried to do it. If he&#39;s not, they will remember he did and that he was wrong.

            <span class="text">I want to focus us back on what we did last week. I&#39;m not going to do a whole thing about Alberta, but we did touch on Alberta quite significantly last week, and there&#39;s been some developments. Drew Barnes, this is the leader of the now ousted two-person... Leader of the pack. Of the pack. Here&#39;s what he said from last week. He said that the decision makes it clear that Kenney does not accept dissenting voices despite repeatedly saying the opposite and goes against the grassroots of the UCP. He&#39;s quoted as saying, hundreds of our members have already quit the party. Hundreds of our members are not donating anymore. He said many of his constituents and people across the province have told him they envision a free, more prosperous Alberta that gets a better deal from Ottawa. And then he started talking about comparators of Jason Kenney&#39;s polling numbers versus Justin and Trudeau in the province of Alberta, just to rub that into the wound. Carter, as a message for Barnes, from the advice that we gave him last week, even reconciling with perhaps new advice you have for him, what do you make of this messaging? Fine, foolish, fabulous, or fucked, based on the two goals he might have, right? Let&#39;s be clear, once again, to remind listeners from episode 934, the two goals that he had was either, you know, being part of a takeover of the UCP and or forming a new political movement. Based on what you heard, fine, foolish, fabulous, or fucked. And please Please don&#39;t say foolish, or I&#39;ll just come across the screen and kill both of you. It&#39;s</span>

Something in that order was the advice for the weekend. We talked about the Thursday to Sunday advice. We don&#39;t know if he did any of that, but he did do an interview the next morning, right after that. Yeah, Zane, I&#39;m going to save you some time. It was foolish.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">the language and the volume. And I use volume in two ways, the volume of people that we are now seeing in the pro-Palestinian sort of protests and movements, movements uh and also the volume of this conversation it&#39;s it&#39;s becoming louder and louder like you know i&#39;d say i haven&#39;t seen before it certainly feels different to me and i want to talk about the domestic sort of activism that we&#39;re saying and and and how far you know perhaps are the activists from creating real change is one question but carter what do you make of let&#39;s start here top line and perhaps are you surprised with what you&#39;re seeing on the streets of let&#39;s just say our country let&#39;s limit it to the scope of our country whether that be be car parades or parades and protests in Nathan Phillips Square, etc. Are you surprised by, let&#39;s just go with the volume with both sides of that definition, and then let&#39;s expand it there to a strategy conversation of what perhaps is next and what should be next and some of the insights we may have around that?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m not surprised. And the reason I&#39;m not surprised is that global issues are becoming local issues. First of all, we have worldwide immigration, we have worldwide, you know, populations that exist in virtually every country that are from other countries and every region is going to be represented and every region is going to have allegiance to other region other areas and the other thing is that we literally have all the information at our fingertips there is no confirmation there&#39;s no uh there&#39;s not necessarily all the information that we&#39;re getting is entirely factual and people feel empowered to have a position right there is no uh you know leaving it to the experts there&#39;s no sense of well i&#39;m not not really sure what&#39;s going on, but I have confidence in my government. We don&#39;t have confidence in the governments. We don&#39;t have confidence in the actions or even the media that we&#39;re seeing.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So because of that lack of confidence, because of the shifting nature of the way that information flows and the kind of shrinking size of the world and the information that&#39;s presented to us, I&#39;m not at all surprised to see protests in the streets. I am not surprised at all to see the polarization of these issues. And I guess I&#39;m not surprised also, it&#39;s just a final thing to see, you know, the eternal conflict that is the Middle East flare up again, because</span>

            <span class="text">And there&#39;s a division growing between the position of the Canadian government and Canadians, and in particular, quote unquote, progressive Canadians here on this matter. And this is happening in the United States as well. It&#39;s much more documented in the United States, the fact that the Democrats have had a bit of a, you know, there used to be kind of this like hegemonic support for the state of Israel and the positions of the state of Israel, right, among</span>

            <span class="text">It&#39;s a complicated issue. Obviously, I mean, that&#39;s obviously the biggest dodge in the world. There are fundamental problems that go back a long time. But the fundamental problem is this. The status quo in Israel is untenable. I think everybody can accept that. And Gaza and the West Bank have been occupied for over 50 years. There&#39;s been generations, plural, born under occupation. and ultimately it results in flare-ups and then it results in people saying uh you know was was the catalyst of this the the rating of this mosque was that the shooting of these rockets whatever it is um when when the dust settles on each one what you&#39;re finding is by and large as these events are occurring right</span>

            <span class="text">is not in the right here, right? Not even necessarily Israel is in the wrong, but we&#39;re starting to see a division of Canadians. And maybe social media is part of that. We talk about the downside of social media a lot. One of the things social media has a lot of power in is it provides us pictures and human stories about what&#39;s occurring in other parts of the world. Maybe changing demographics. In 1991, more Jewish Canadians than Muslim Canadians. In 2011, there were three times as many Muslim Canadians as Jewish Canadians. That&#39;s going to change the tenor of the conversation and the tenor of the political conversation. conversation. But, or maybe it&#39;s just as this fundamental</span>

We&#39;ve got to try something different. This is not working for us.

Like constructing, almost going back to a previous point, almost letting the communications do the heavy lifting here, right? And ultimately, you can only do so much when you put pretty words together side by side, or $20 words side by side, when you don&#39;t really have much to say. And I think there&#39;s an increased demand from both, I&#39;d say, citizens in the United States and Canada to have their governments do more on it. Do you sense that as well? And if you&#39;re the government, let&#39;s get into strategy mode a bit. Are you not touching this with a 10-foot pole, or do you feel like this could flare up here to your earlier point of global movements becoming local movements very, very quickly and perhaps even more readily than we have seen in the past in our country?</span>

And where I think you have to be careful if you are really pushing for wholesale change of government positions here is that you don&#39;t overpush on this matter, right? Right. Because it will take it will take a little bit of time for government to change its position.
