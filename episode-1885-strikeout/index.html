        <p>PATREON EXCLUSIVE Shannon Phillips and Zain Velji talk municipal politics before doing a deep dive on the Alberta teachers' strike. How are the various players doing? Has anyone hit a home run yet? And with Carter out of the lineup, is this podcast finally playing error-free ball? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line, except when Shannon turns the tables on him.</p>

It looks like the progressive universe is understanding the assignment in Andrew Knack, Apogast, Tim Cartmell. I&#39;m seeing a little of that congealed. I&#39;m certainly not seeing it in Talgary at all, right? So there&#39;s no, there doesn&#39;t seem to be, with the exception of Ferkis, and I would say Sonia Sharpe is probably doing this too into the conservative universe, but they&#39;re not anchoring back</div>

          <div class="said">many folks, like, let me give you an anecdote. This is why I find this interesting, because I&#39;ve been trying to figure out for a while why this is such a sleepy election. In fact, I&#39;ve had people ask me, like, who should we vote for? What&#39;s going on? And I&#39;m in a text group of, you know, center left to progressive people. In that group for all Calgarians, there&#39;s probably four mayoral candidates people support of varying viability. But I think that&#39;s also part of the question is that no one really has a sense of who&#39;s viable in this election. No one knows if we have enough runway here for any of the candidates that are polling in single digits to make a breakthrough when half the city is undecided and the leader is at 16%, give or take, depending on which poll is your variety.

They already relied on, the assumption was, that if you were watching the show, you would have the context in order to engage with it deeply. And over the 25 years or 20-some years since that comment was made, that still seems to be the case with that format. The problem with that format is that without legacy media and without people having a baseline understanding of what&#39;s going on, they can&#39;t patch into it.

I forget the gentleman&#39;s name, but he&#39;s been fantastic on The Teacher Strike, which we&#39;ll get to in a second. I said Cole, and I apologize. I&#39;m sure people listening will know his name. But I see them all the time on Instagram, on Reels, getting several thousand hits. But the fact is, I think there&#39;s more content than ever before for the hyper-engaged. And we are part of that machinery. Like our content, like, you know, to make this meta is for the hyper-engaged, is for folks that are either already engaged, know the baseline effects. I mean, our next topic is just, we&#39;re going to be talking about like the tactics of an ATA strike. Like, fuck, there&#39;s some people who woke up on Monday morning realizing that there was a strike. And here we are making political content for a very sub-genre.

          <div class="said">the last half decade politics has become culture so when we started this podcast you know 10 years ago the idea that we would take politics and use it like a sports talk format was novel it&#39;s no longer novel because Because politics is now part of culture and culture has like a more, I hate to kind of lowest common denominator approach in terms of language and vernacular. Like politics in both other countries, USA and Canada, has entered that space. So our format is no longer novel. You add on the algorithmic element to it. So talking in a snippy, plain spoken language about big topics is part of it. So you&#39;re having this content machine kind of being produced. I think there&#39;s more people than ever before paying attention to politics because it is culture. It&#39;s embedded in everything. It&#39;s embedded in their identity. It&#39;s embedded in how they consume music and sports. Let the launch of the Taylor Swift album earlier this week, you know, be split on partisan grounds. Has she gone mega as an entire subcultural conversation right now? Now, so politics, I think, is like how it&#39;s the prism we slice and dice everything through. But I think it has not translated, A,</div>
