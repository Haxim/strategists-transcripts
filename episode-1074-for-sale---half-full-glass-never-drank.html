            <span class="text">So I&#39;ve read the indictment. I actually just got around to it this morning or this afternoon. I just seen kind of the news coverage before then. It&#39;s pretty damning. Not only does it create a pretty compelling case that he put, that he was incredibly careless with national security secrets and and the way it sort of lists them near the end yeah and like these are the classifications and this is the general contents you know american military secrets nuclear secrets more military secrets foreign intelligence secrets really really damning but the other part is it makes a very very strong case that there was criminal intent here the cover-up is well articulated in it and it&#39;s one of these classic situations where you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know the cover-up in many ways, almost seems worse than the crime, because there&#39;s a universe where he didn&#39;t do any of these concealing things, like getting his personal aid to move the boxes around and hide the boxes from his own lawyer and hide the boxes from the FBI and from the grand jury. And he just looks like an idiot who brought boxes without sort of understanding the consequences of that. But when you sort of follow the trail that has been laid out so clearly in this indictment, You know, it</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it just looks very bad for him. It shows the intent, it shows the action. And I guess this is one of the things that I think maybe we can unpack a bit as we go here, but that we&#39;re in a weird moment where Republicans are all hanging with this guy still. still.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But one of these things that I firmly believe, and we can argue about it, but there is a lot of evidence of this, is that reality wins in the long term. You can call this sort of a more localized version of the universe arcs toward justice. Don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true, but I do know reality wins in the long term. And I think if people get exposed more to these facts, like the general public, I mean, it&#39;s going to be harder and harder to stay with Donald Trump. And there&#39;s is a trial coming where this evidence is going to be laid out in long form and i don&#39;t i don&#39;t know i mean it seems like a very risky strategy for people to be standing this close to that guy accused with what he&#39;s been accused carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in the world. And there&#39;s patterns that develop in the world. And the first is that when a relatively popular president, popular at least with their own clique, if you will, their own side, is charged, or prime minister or minister or prominent politician, the first charged people tend to rally, right? They tend to rally around Maybe the second charge they&#39;ll rally around. But at some point, there is a tipping point where they no longer rally around. And I think</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think that Trump&#39;s not there yet, obviously. But there are still the charges to come in Georgia. There&#39;s still more charges probably to come in New York. There&#39;s other places where charges could be laid. And at some point, if world history serves as a guidepost, then at some point in the future, Trump will be seen as pigpen.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, there are exceptions to what he&#39;s described here, right? You can look at Israel, for example, for a place where a prime minister has taken a lot of legal hits and is still standing and in fact has come back from losing an election. So, you know, there are exceptions to the general rule that he&#39;s trying to discuss. us. But yeah, it is true that in a lot of other countries, this is a little more commonplace where you see somebody with all of the levers of power and the temptations that those have think that they are above the law and start to act that way. And then you do see this general trend that Stevens described. Now, Americans are big on American exceptionalism. So it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re going to follow a global trend. If the Europeans are doing it, they probably think it&#39;s not very cool. But I do think that the reason why that happens in most of the world is the same reason that i was alluding to at the start which is in the long term reality wins and the facts are pretty damning and when the facts come out and when that knee-jerk fight or flight i&#39;m going to defend these guys i&#39;m under attack because i defended this guy in the past when that&#39;s all laid out when you&#39;ve created the rationalizations that allow you to back away from the person</span>

            <span class="text">It can be years, it can be decades, it can be centuries. But in the long term, you know, the corollary in public health is is often said by public health experts, public health always wins, right? These things at the end of the day, you get on top of them, because you have to, right? And it&#39;s much easier to support the truth than it is to support court a lie, because the truth can&#39;t be called out for being a lie, like not in a real sense, right? And so, I think that in a world that spins so quickly, I don&#39;t think the long term&#39;s that that long. I think that we are years away, not decades away from people coming to grips with what Donald Trump was. But maybe that&#39;s wishful thinking. I mean, in a funny way, I think you&#39;re almost driving at this idea of we&#39;re in this post-truth time. But I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s There&#39;s a ton of evidence of that. I think that a lot of what we&#39;re seeing is a backlash towards a world that is changing and progressing very quickly. You know, you look at things that were very moderate opinions in the year 2000, right? Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada, liberal prime minister saying marriage was between a man and a woman, right?</span>

The faster it turns, the scarier it will be to a certain group of people. But in the long term, I think you&#39;ve got to look at this arc and say, you know, globally, people are living longer, people are wealthier, people have more opportunities than ever before. There are fewer corrupt politicians in a global context. And, you know, things are generally getting better because reality does win in the long term.</span>

And part of evolving as a human being is being able to discard your bad takes. And if you&#39;re going to be hung with them forever, you don&#39;t have a lot of incentive to discard your bad takes. And I think that the Democrats, I think that all of us need to be a little bit better at saying, all right, that was then, this is now, we can all move on. Obviously, scale based on the severity of the bad take, and Lindsey Graham has had some epically bad ones. But if you want to broaden it to the overall Republican movement, I do think that the Democrats should be thinking in terms of strategy, how they off-ramp peaceably these</span>

You know, if you&#39;re a UCP supporter and you&#39;re looking at the, you know, you might be outraged by the idea someone would vote for the NDP because you are so worried about the economy. How could you be so careless with the economy? You would hand it to the NDP. If you&#39;re an NDP supporter, you might think, how could you possibly trust Danielle Smith with healthcare, given everything she said about healthcare and just be really mad about the idea somebody might support it. But both those people are looking through very different lenses. And at the end end of the day, you do sort of need to kind of reconcile the fact that we all live in the same city, the all province, and you got to work together on these things. And you know, the Americans provide such an extreme example. We have a bad habit in Canada of just following them with five years leg. Why don&#39;t we try fucking learning from them at this point, saying, okay, we don&#39;t like what they&#39;re doing there. So let&#39;s try something a little bit different. And for me, that is putting aside the hyper partisanship. And inevitably, when someone says, yeah, but they&#39;re are actually awful saying you know what okay</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I, you know, more than scared child, I think he&#39;s a, he&#39;s a cornered animal. We&#39;ve described him this way in the past. And I believe it like he&#39;s just instinctual. He lashes out, he bites, he looks for windows to jump through. And that&#39;s all he knows how to do. He&#39;s, he&#39;s pure fight. And he&#39;s going to continue to just recreate the past in his image. He&#39;s going to talk about the, you know, one of the things that was so interesting about this indictment is the collision you know it makes even spin really hard because donald trump for the past i don&#39;t know how many months has been saying and it was a lame stupid line when he said it but he&#39;s like as president i could declassify anything just by thinking about it i could declassify it and now there&#39;s tape there&#39;s a recording of donald trump saying i could have declassified this but i didn&#39;t this is a secret document you can&#39;t look at it like literally the opposite of the thing he&#39;s been saying for the past couple of months you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know his challenge at this point is he&#39;s primed his supporters with these lines and part of why i think i&#39;m a bit of an optimist on this matter today that they&#39;re going to go out there and now they&#39;re going to have to deal with like for months the gullible water carriers of donald trump have been saying well he could have he just declassified it before he left it&#39;s like well we literally have the guy on tape saying he didn&#39;t declassify it what do you go from there like there&#39;s nowhere to go from there so you know And you&#39;re going to have to eat a lot of shit to just be licking that guy&#39;s boot that hard. And so, you know, I think that if I&#39;m Donald Trump, what I need to do is I just need to flip this table over and change the conversation entirely, which is what I believe he&#39;s going to try to do. And he&#39;s going to say, and this is the classic Donald Trump. He&#39;s like, it didn&#39;t happen to,</span>

And so imagine those stakes are going to be kind of framed further and farther. Like that&#39;s the conversation he&#39;s going to have over the next bit. He&#39;s going to create this false parallel between his actions and Hillary Clinton&#39;s actions. He probably won&#39;t even deny it. He&#39;ll create this parallel between himself and Joe Biden having documents in his garage. He&#39;s already been saying this. You&#39;re going to see an awful lot less from him that&#39;s arguing that what he did was okay and more of it&#39;s not a big deal and they&#39;re just being selective in their prosecution.</span>

Then the Clark government falls, and he basically rescinds his resignation. You know, the party executive blessed it, of course. And then he wins in the 1980 election, and he continues to be prime minister for four more years. So I think Stephen&#39;s point&#39;s a good one. Like, this is a pretty shaky, uncertain moment.

            <span class="text">Yes, the liberals still have the ability, I think, to say, well, those terms are junk. We&#39;re not going to do an inquiry. We&#39;re going to do a special rapporteur. But it felt like that was the sort of Damocles he was dangling over their heads. But kind of a plastic one, like a fake one, one I&#39;m not very worried about. And it does feel like this is all lining up towards, okay,</span>

You know, everybody was basically saying, we&#39;re going to try and get together on this. And I think that Canadians and the media really have to work hard to hold their feet to the fire because this isn&#39;t just, you know, the liberals have made this happen type of situation. This is us potentially having foreign interference in our elections. And And damn it, I&#39;d like to understand what&#39;s going on and make sure that it&#39;s not actually happening. So it&#39;s serious, and I was happy to see maturity from little baby Pee Pee.</span>

For like two hours on, I think it must have been Sunday night, my timeline was full of Zoom-ins on Danielle Smith&#39;s feet, which I did not need. But yes, this was a thing. And, you know, this idea that government is going to be so big and in your life that if you come in to help your husband run the restaurant and pull an emergency dishwasher shift and you&#39;re not wearing the right shoes, you&#39;re going to get a ticket. That&#39;s kind of like a parody of like this left wing state, right? Don&#39;t be those people. And, you know, this is again, like zoom out, look at the overall picture. It was a nice person helping out. Yes, it&#39;s a restaurant that she owns, but yes, she&#39;s premier of Alberta and I don&#39;t necessarily expect her to have to take dishwashing shifts.
