            <span class="text">or a convergence on. But then sometimes someone, one of the three, says some wacky, insane shit, and the other two have to do something about it. Carter? We&#39;ve seen that happen in Ontario, where one Doug Ford, standing as part of a federal government announcement on rebuilding Canada&#39;s biomanufacturing sector, suggested immigrants are to blame for shooting of anti-Jewish schools in Toronto over the weekend, despite what police saying they have little information on the suspects. I don&#39;t even want to talk about the details of the story. I want to talk about this political tactic, because Ford is now in hot water. By extension, people are asking Olivia Chow for a statement. Would they have if she was not around? Probably not. And by extension, they&#39;re asking Justin Trudeau, being like, what the hell? Do you support that forward comment in your in your press conference? So, Carter, why do we still do this? Why do we still have politicians who do post-announcement pressers with all three knowing that, you know, the questions can go any which way? They&#39;re probably not going to be on topic. And you have to then, quote unquote, own it if you&#39;re the other two, or at least defend your track record or disown the comments made if you&#39;re the other two people. In this case, we&#39;re flanking that that politician, who in this example was Doug Ford. Carter, why do we still do this? Do we need to get rid of it?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">calculus as much as anything and look most politicians aren&#39;t quick enough but they also don&#39;t know for sure so just imagine for example you&#39;re up there and the premier of ontario says the things that he said and you start thinking does</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">does he know something i don&#39;t know does he have facts i don&#39;t have here like what does that look like because imagine then if you&#39;re the prime minister and you say oh doug we don&#39;t know that and doug ford says well actually just just five minutes ago, we found out that was the case, Prime Minister, right? Like, you in the moment don&#39;t necessarily have confidence that you have perfect information about the situation either. Particularly when you&#39;re talking about, for example, a provincial premier who has a whole other stream of information you might not have. And you&#39;ve probably only turned your attention to this event in passing, if at all, right? So that&#39;s the other thing. Like, you&#39;re sitting in the moment, you&#39;re trying to calculate the probabilities that something happened, something something didn&#39;t happen, this is going to work, this is not going to work, this is the message you can use in that case, this is the message you&#39;re not going to use. So I think for very practical reasons, those being nobody can do it particularly well at the top of the list, every politician sort of agreed, you don&#39;t pile on each other answering questions to the media about their particular jurisdiction and asking about things that concern them specifically. That&#39;s just sort of a practical thing all of the politicians have done. Carter,</span>

We&#39;ve often seen press conferences where the premier goes up and the minister goes, like, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about here. To be clear, of different stripes or different orders of government, they&#39;ve got their own lane, their own sort of political agendas, their own, in this case, order of government that they reign over.

It gives you the ability to show intergovernmental effectiveness, which virtually every level of government is struggling to show almost at all times. So it works quite well for most of the use cases that you&#39;re going to see this particular type of press conference. It works really well.

Why not, when we do something like this, why not have three different podiums for folks to do their Q&amp;A afterwards? You isolate the images of someone kind of giving an answer on a particular, you know, press conference point, right? Because you&#39;re probably, Doug Ford&#39;s going to have a different line of questioning than Olivia Chow, than Justin Trudeau. The image I&#39;m conjuring up in my head is very much the American image of when a president is done with a foreign leader. They both have their own different lecterns where they&#39;re standing side by side. You can ask a question that interlaces both of them, or you can ask direct questions. And, you know, if you were none the wiser, the media image would almost just have Joe Biden on screen or the Swedish prime minister, because you wouldn&#39;t actually know the other was in the room in that answer. answer.</span>

            <span class="text">well yeah okay so let me throw a few things on on the table here. One is like, you&#39;re going to have one media team set this up, right? You&#39;re not going to have three separate media teams with three separate feeds. And so they&#39;re going to have considerations in terms of their boards and their media lines and all of that. The other thing you&#39;re going to have to contend with though, is like moving three lecterns takes a lot of work and you would need to kind of coordinate that in a way that would be fairly complicated because if you are the prime minister, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I doubt they&#39;re going to have the one that&#39;s appropriate for the Premier of Ontario. And I know they&#39;re not going to have one that&#39;s appropriate for like the Mayor of Toronto. So they&#39;re all going to need to bring those things. They&#39;re going to have their own equipment. Their equipment may or may not work with yours. Yeah, it probably is just a bunch of the same XLR things, but maybe not. You never know what kind of standards other people are going to. And so it just, it would take a lot. You need somebody to take the lead in that case. And that means you&#39;re also putting into the hands of, like, let&#39;s be clear when you have those like two lecterns, there&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a lot of work that happens behind the scenes to make sure everybody is comfortable with it, right? You would be adding a lot of complexity to make sure that the sign that you&#39;re putting in front of Doug Ford and the fact that his lectern has a riser behind it or not, depending on the height of him versus the prime minister, like, you know, all of a sudden things get complicated in a hurry. And so in</span>

            <span class="text">in the pursuit of simplicity and just getting the job done, a lot of people aren&#39;t going to bother with those details. They&#39;re just going to say one lectern, and we&#39;re going to figure it out. And even that, even that is a headache to coordinate, let me tell you. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I mean, I think that the idea, the problem with the idea is that it also gives everybody the exact, you know, like everybody&#39;s sitting at the same opportunity to speak. One of the things that is worked over before these things even start is who gets to speak and in what order they get to speak in. There&#39;s a relatively complex protocol that dictates who&#39;s going to speak at what time. And if I give it over to Doug Ford and I&#39;ve given him the same opportunity, the same infrastructure for speaking, he may stick to the script. He may not stick to the script. Very easy way to ensure that he sticks to the script, there&#39;s only one microphone. Prime Minister walks up first, then comes the Premier of Ontario, Then comes the mayor of Toronto. It is a logistics coordination, logistics control issue. And keep in mind, we still have a very significant history in this country where most of our media availabilities are done through scrums. The media themselves don&#39;t like these controlled environments. The less controlled the environment is, the more the media likes it, the more the media wants to be able to challenge and control the situation. situation they don&#39;t want three people standing at one lectern it also fucks up their shots like what are you going to do now take an extra wide of three you&#39;re going to bring two cameras and do a tight you know like three three</span>

But, you know, for folks that may not know, they&#39;ve probably seen it. But what&#39;s a scrum? And why is that the way we kind of do political media, for the most part, in terms of comment from the principal or comment from the leader?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, in the simplest terms, it&#39;s when the media surround a politician, usually they&#39;ve set up in like a semicircle, their cameras and their microphones, and a politician comes out and stands in the middle. and every organization gets their own shot and they&#39;re all just right there and that is the that is the infrastructure it is now all of the media&#39;s infrastructure just to continue this infrastructure point and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and often what happens is they will set up and one politician will talk and another one will if that&#39;s the kind of setup you&#39;re doing or more practically if it&#39;s a more free-flowing environment they will literally come with the cameras and they will you know they will all come to where the person is and they&#39;ll stand around it and there&#39;ll be a couple of minutes of adjusting mics and hey is this good does this work is this a good level and you&#39;ll often hop into it there so but but i guess the way it&#39;s it probably can be defined as simply when the media are surrounding and asking the questions and you&#39;ll often see a scrum like in television in the sense of like all of the microphones that are there and i&#39;m just looking at somebody&#39;s time i&#39;ve got</span>

You were talking about a lectern. Were you talking about just getting back to what I questioned in the first place? Would that make a Scrum better?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I think that what would make a Scrum better is a tight audio board where you&#39;re not speaking into multiple microphones. It&#39;s a single microphone. And I think that for the most part, they do the single microphone thing now. So in a perfect world, you would have a complete media setup where the media are able to plug into an audio board. They get their audio from a singular microphone. microphone that microphone has a clean backdrop whatever the backdrop is it could be the house of commons it could be logo to whatever it is carter&#39;s</span>

How do you shed something that you&#39;re under? How do you kind of get away from a brand that owns you or a brand that is in the moment not necessarily popular? And I know there&#39;s hacks to this, and I put hacks in air quotes. You could change your name. You could do constitutional stuff. He doesn&#39;t have time for any of that, Carter. I&#39;m talking about messaging. I&#39;m talking about strategy. I&#39;m talking about tactics that are not quick and easy. They don&#39;t have to be easy, but they have to not necessarily be be the long-term, let&#39;s disassociate with the federal party sort of tactics. What advice to start off with do you have for one Premier Fury on the heels of this? This by-election is behind him, but if you&#39;re walking into his office tomorrow and saying, sir, this is a problem that&#39;s going to be with you for, you know, a couple of months, but could be with you for a decade. So let me help you figure this problem out and think about it strategically. How are are you thinking about this carter around helping him um push what probably was an asset now and is now in the liability column uh devalue it for him or push it to the side well</span>

And all the issues that are federal in their nature are such that they just really don&#39;t have the same impact. So this is a you&#39;re not doing health care well enough problem. this is a, you&#39;re not doing education well enough problem. And to blame, uh, the federal liberals is just to totally miss what the opportunities are within your government. And I think that that would be my message that I carried to him. You&#39;re not doing healthcare well enough because people aren&#39;t talking about the fury plan for healthcare. And, you know, I would also, I mean, given that the man&#39;s name is fury, I mean, double down on that. Like it doesn&#39;t have to be the liberals, Man, like it can just be Fury&#39;s party. I mean, it&#39;s Ford&#39;s party. It&#39;s Smith&#39;s party. You know, these</span>

But the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador is associated, like it is part of the Federation, that is the Liberal Party of Canada.

But what ideas would you have for him as it relates to the fact that, you know, sir, you are tied to the federal liberals, you are tied to the current leader, as long as that remains Justin Trudeau. And frankly, even if it gets replaced in the meantime, before you head to the polls, you&#39;re still going to have the residue, if you can call it that, of Justin Trudeau on this party. What advice would you have from, Corey?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, the point that you end with, the residue one, is important. You are fooling yourself if you think that by having a big conversation about whether or not you should be associated with the federal liberals will help you distance yourself in the minds of Newfoundlanders from the federal liberals, right? You&#39;re going to have half your party say you can&#39;t fucking do that and you&#39;re going to have this big drawn-out debate about whether or not you should, uh you know defederate disassociate it&#39;s not something that a party in government should do that&#39;s stupid you know how to win you have one you have one with justin trudeau as prime minister even though he wasn&#39;t particularly popular even then i mean a little different in the in atlantic canada but still you</span>

            <span class="text">you got to have your own brand you got to carry it forward you just got to do the smart things and one of the smart things in this case is probably at least a variant of what steven said which is think about you how you control the brand locally and being team fury uh you know uh you know a newfoundland option for newfoundlanders whatever dumb tag you want to come up with there are ways that you can make that distinction separate without starting a big fucking fight and destabilizing your party one year before a planned election i think that would be it&#39;s</span>

This may not be a multi-year issue, quote unquote, and I mean that political popularity and viability for the federal liberals, so to speak. So can you overcorrect?
