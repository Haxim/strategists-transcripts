        <p>Stephen and Corey get together to talk about everything from the BC NDP leadership to the box Putin has put himself in. All without Zain's supervision.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. It's Saturday morning! Grab your coffee, pull up a chair and join us as Stephen Carter talks about getting a massage. Other topics include: Canada supporting Ukraine's NATO membership, bad polling for Danielle Smith and the UCP, how leadership contest construction determines the results and much, much more.
