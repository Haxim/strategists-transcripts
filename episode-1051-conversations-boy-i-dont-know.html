        <div class="desc"><p>A campaign period has been officially declared in Alberta, and as required by The Strategists' corporate bylaws, the gang starts recording three times a week. Join the gang as they talk about event invitations, power dynamics and more in the pre-election period.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter switch to Alberta election mode and an expanded release schedule just in time to discuss Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and Opposition Leader Rachel Notley's duelling "conversations" at an event in Calgary, the politics of crime and how politicians and parties approach the lead-up to an election more generally. Did Smith make a mistake in putting herself on the same stage as Rachel Notley? How useful are statistics when dealing with emotional issues such as crime? And did Corey just double-down on the CBC needing to be on Twitter? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

          <div class="said">Yeah. Well, especially two weeks before the election, as we&#39;re kind of in, you are in many ways testing your election footing and you&#39;re going out and you&#39;re treating things in a much more election-like sense than you would otherwise. So let&#39;s just start by saying six months ago, the idea of two of them on the stage would have been strange, but there&#39;s precedent for that. That&#39;s possible. You can imagine it. But two weeks before the election, you start saying things like, do I want them on stage at the same time? What does that mean? What&#39;s the dynamic? And I&#39;ll have to tell you, this event, I was supposed to go, but I&#39;m actually on vacation today, so I begged out of the event. But I was kind of sad too, because I thought, oh, this is going to be almost like the first debate of the election. And I almost couldn&#39;t believe that it was going to happen, because it seemed to me crazy that Danielle Smith would be willing to elevate</div>

          <div class="said">right? In a campaign, it&#39;s just party leader versus party leader. In this two weeks before, it&#39;s still premier and opposition leader. And if you&#39;re premier, you don&#39;t elevate opposition leader. That&#39;s like a cardinal rule, especially as you start thinking about how you can use that power dynamic to maximum advantage ahead of an election. So your question is like, what&#39;s going on? What&#39;s the conversation?</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">You&#39;re having that kind of conversation. You&#39;re definitely not giving the opposition leader that elevation to peer status before you have to. You&#39;re thinking very carefully about those events. You&#39;re thinking about how you use the power of the bully pulpit while you still have it in this kind of like nice liminal space where you are premier, but people are paying attention. And those two things don&#39;t always come together. So this is a very powerful moment in a campaign. Now, I&#39;ve also had experience</div>

          <div class="said">experience from the other side, where I was, you know, a campaign director for what was then the official opposition, but polling third, right, and ended up third coming out of the election. And you&#39;re desperate to get that elevation, and you&#39;re trying to pull it. And so the dynamic of this event is fascinating to me because it ended exactly where it should have begun. And I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a story about how it went from one conversation to two. But the fact of the matter is, Rachel Notley clearly wanting it to be a conversation amongst equals, and Danielle Smith clearly wanting to engage as minimally as possible so it was not a conversation among equals, is actually pretty optimal behavior by both of them. Now, a lot of suboptimal this around there, but they certainly seem to be playing their cards the way I would expect them to play.</div>

There&#39;s a tremendous, I mean, if you&#39;re putting yourself in the position there, you&#39;ve got three very powerful people going up onto that stage, each one of whom doesn&#39;t want to be made to look like an ass. And I would argue that the situation as it unfolded made each of them look like an ass. So when you&#39;re going through these negotiations, I can&#39;t tell you the number of event producers that are producing debates or things that they think are going to be debates or different structures that I&#39;ve just royally pissed off because they come at me and they think that this will be a great event for them.</div>

What I&#39;m in the business of doing is getting my candidate elected. So if that means that I get an opportunity to debate Jeremy Farkas one-on-one in the mayor&#39;s race, then I&#39;m making sure that it happens. If we get to put Nahid Denchi into debates day after day after day with Rick McIver and Barb Higgins, then I&#39;m doing it because he can slaughter them. But, you know, Jyoti wasn&#39;t that good in debates. Alison Redford wasn&#39;t that good in debates. You know, we picked and chose where we put people because if you just simply drop people into every situation, you can wind up with egg on your face. And I would argue that today&#39;s event put egg on just about everybody&#39;s face in that auditorium. I did an interview with CTV just before the event started.

And so really, if you&#39;re going to have them captured and captivated, you want to go last. Because the whole idea is you get to be the last thing they think about.

And I&#39;m really shocked that her team let her do this because all these things, all these considerations you&#39;re talking about, Annalise, all of them are highly variable. I mean, it sounds to me like everybody leaving that, you know, the event ran so long that you&#39;re not got a good, you know, you don&#39;t have that great audience. You don&#39;t have that. Everybody&#39;s sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for the premier to say what they&#39;re going to say. I mean, it was really set up almost as a lose for Danielle. I&#39;m also told that there was it was a very female heavy audience. Again, you know, fantastic for Calgary Economic Development. Great for the mayor. Great for Rachel Notley. Less good for for Danielle Smith. myth but this is another campaign mistake um that i think a more experienced campaign team would have just said you</div>

And you&#39;ve got to make the assessment on a case-by-case basis. And I like to tell people, and I usually do in the context of election day, like get out the vote, because I, well, Stephen, you&#39;ve worked with me on a get out the vote. I could be pretty aggressive. We&#39;ll call those people a dozen times if we need to, to get them out the door. And what I often say is they they got four years to get over it. And that&#39;s true of event RSVPs too, right? This is the moment. This is why you are building all that capital over four years. Don&#39;t blow it by being like overly courteous during the election.

The fact that we do have this television consortium that gets together and everybody discusses it and it&#39;s, you know, CTV and Global and CBC are there.

And so while door knocking is generally good for candidates, perhaps you&#39;ve got a candidate who doesn&#39;t perform on doors. And perhaps the individual strategy there is to pick formats where the candidate performs more strongly. Same basic logic for everything you&#39;re approaching in a campaign right now, and you asked us, Annalise, sort of to kick this off. It&#39;s two weeks before a campaign.

          <div class="said">know, the question of RSVPs in the month ahead and some of it&#39;s tied to what Stephen said in that, like, it feels like in normal times you would give an RSVP a month ahead like this. But if they&#39;re going to treat it like an election, they got to treat it like an election and they can&#39;t give that RSVP in advance. My suspicion is it probably went something like this. CED reached out to Rachel Notley and Danielle Smith. Rachel Notley and her team immediately jumped at it because, as I was saying, like, they want to elevate to like, okay, this is now two party leaders debating because that&#39;s better than premier versus opposition leader, right? That&#39;s wonderful for them. And then that either directly or indirectly caused the premier&#39;s office to then say, well, we better be there too, right? And by directly, I mean, like they heard Rachel Notley&#39;s in, so they&#39;re in. Indirectly, I mean, they probably didn&#39;t give even as much of a hedge as they should have. And I imagine having both been the person delivering that message and knowing that people hear what they want to hear, but also the one trying to get the answer from people about whether they&#39;re going to show up to something, that the premier&#39;s office probably said something along the lines of, yeah, that&#39;s certainly a really interesting event. We&#39;d love to be there. We&#39;ll try to make it happen. Yeah.</div>

Just kind of the whole crime, mental health, all that stuff has been in the news a lot.

One of the things that we looked at was the issues, and what were the top issues for people, and what were the issues that the UCP could win on or the NDP could win on. And it was like the next day, this big crime brigade from the UCP began. And it made me realize, like, crime was not on those lists. It wasn&#39;t even being polled as a top issue at the time and we didn&#39;t have solid polling on where they landed but i think that we would probably all intuit that this is an issue conservatives have historically done better than progressives on right and i thought well that&#39;s really interesting and at the live show i you know i think steven and i both made the comment like hey we we don&#39;t have party polling we just have access to the public polling but it made me wonder what their party polling says and i suspect that they saw it as an opportunity to really wrong Longfoot, the NDP, probably saw this as an issue two-to-one advantage over the NDP. And if they could elevate it and make it an issue that people were really concerned about, that could potentially pay huge dividends. And so they</div>

But regardless, they were just in the midst of shooting up. And it didn&#39;t make me feel particularly comfortable because, you know, I&#39;m not used to those types of things. And this is the type of social disorder that we now see where people are walking past more and more social disorder when they go downtown. And they&#39;re not necessarily seeing violent crime, but they&#39;re seeing crime that makes them fearful. And crime that makes you fearful is something that is really nebulous and hard to understand and hard to figure out. But you just if you don&#39;t feel good, if you don&#39;t feel comfortable, then it is it doesn&#39;t matter what the statistics say to what Corey says. And I didn&#39;t feel comfortable.

I&#39;m not sure why you need four officers walking together instead of two groups of two, but it didn&#39;t really reinforce the idea that everything is safer. But now the UCP has put more officers downtown. They put these cops, you know, the sheriffs are down there with the police officers. Now, when I saw them, they were all side by side, hand in hand, not solving a damn thing. You know, they were nowhere to be seen when I was walking past the folks that were shooting up.

They can talk about investments in police, they can talk about investments in prevention, but not going to spend all of her time and her megaphone to talk about an issue that is, if you elevate its importance, naturally going to lead people to the UCP, right? right?

          <div class="said">psychological safety is an element of safety i think we should acknowledge that and and it&#39;s part of why we can&#39;t dismiss people&#39;s anxieties about this particular matter and it&#39;s why you can&#39;t fact them to death it is important that people feel safe going about their lives that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty like i mean that&#39;s in some ways the foundation of society right this idea that you know we&#39;re governed by rules and laws and things will according go according to a plan somewhat and that we&#39;re all going to comport ourselves in a certain fashion right so like you do need to address the psychological safety component and governments do need to address the psychological safety component and i&#39;m personally of the opinion that even if you think crime statistics don&#39;t warrant it even if you believe that the better solution is long-term And the more fruitful solution is long term to deal like head these things off at the pass. There is societal value to putting police in the situations where people can regain their sense of comfort and safety, because in doing so, they will also regain a bit of their rationality and their ability to deal with these issues in a more forthright fashion. So you can&#39;t ignore the psychological safety. That&#39;s the only thing I wanted to put on the table before Stephen jumped in with whatever pearl of wisdom he had. yeah</div>

          <div class="said">my theory and it&#39;s a listen it&#39;s an absolute theory my theory is this my theory is that any polling the ucp has shows they have a massive advantage with albertans on the crime issue but that the crime issue is just not particularly salient probably rising in salience though because of you know just a lot of the things we&#39;ve talked about the fact that we&#39;ve had a couple of major incidents in the in the last couple of weeks and all of that and i mean this sounds just too dark and too cynical but i think that they would welcome the issue being a bigger deal because it would be strong ground for them so of course they&#39;re going to take the opportunities if they arise but what rachel notley did was the the first steps in a very strong inoculation strategy yeah</div>

B, she&#39;s got an NDP strategy that includes more police, which will provide that psychological safety. Is it new? Is it novel? No, it doesn&#39;t need to be, right? Yeah, we want to do the same thing in that particular context. It&#39;s fine if it&#39;s an issue that you don&#39;t want to be talking about for a long time. And C, it also does go a bit deeper and talks about the social challenges, which again, allows her to pivot to her strong suit, which is people trust the NDP on healthcare, people trust the NDP on social justice, and by making it about those issues pivoting to those issues she&#39;s got all of the ingredients for a very strong defense on that particular matter okay</div>

          <div class="said">69 like just embarrassing for him right embarrassing for him he should be embarrassed but cbc said they were going to pause their engagement on twitter right and they did it pretty broadly and they did it across english and french channels but they are just playing into this idea that they&#39;re acting in a political sense like we cannot lose sight of the fact that it was pierre poliev who wrote He wrote the letter to Elon Musk that seemed to be the catalyst for this particular thing. So they are effectively protesting an action of the Conservatives, which is going to play into the Conservatives mentality that the CBC is just out to get them. We talked about this on Sunday, but the fact that it says that they are 70% government funded, or even if it said government funded, most Canadians would say, yeah, sure, of course they are, because they are, right? Right. So like what they&#39;re arguing is like it is just the weakest, stupidest ground for the CBC to stand on and say they said we&#39;re government funded. And their definition of government funded implies an editorial control that they do not act like nobody&#39;s going to listen to you past like the first couple of words you said there. So you&#39;re not winning with a general population. You&#39;re trying to win with an elite class. But you&#39;re getting yourself out of the conversation on the channels that the elite class have this conversation. And by the way, you&#39;ve done it in a way you have basically two choices. You either slink back after the pause with nothing having changed, having utterly fucking failed, or you don&#39;t, and you&#39;re no longer on Twitter, and you&#39;ve just done that for what? Because they said you were government-funded? Which, again, you are. I know it&#39;s not with the editorial control that&#39;s implied by that label, but you are. And it&#39;s pointless, it&#39;s ridiculous, and it&#39;s self-defeating. so i i mean i&#39;m sorry cbc but like i just can&#39;t be with you on this one and and you know the more i see commentary along the lines of like masterstroke because they did it across reggio canada as well which which will hurt pierre pauliev in quebec because it&#39;s a political issue in quebec if cbc is thinking that way they are being political in the way that pierre pauliev is accusing them they are reconfirming the very fucking thing they&#39;re trying to not confirm firm this is a bad play by the cbc and they they&#39;ve blown it now they should just quietly slink back carter</div>

They&#39;re great journalists, but they&#39;re not necessarily great communicators. Political communications is different. And it&#39;s the same thing that we see when people who aren&#39;t campaigners put Daniel Smith up today in there in that event. You shouldn&#39;t be doing that if you want to be a good political communicator. Political communications is different than a lot of communications.

          <div class="said">so again there&#39;s the general advice and the specific advice generally i think that it&#39;s one of these things that tends to get a lot more inputs than it delivers and outputs specifically if it is a medium that you&#39;re comfortable with if um if it is something that you already have a large following with well then sure it makes sense it&#39;s a way to talk to people it&#39;s a way to galvanize um but it&#39;s going to be very dependent on your own strengths and the last thing anybody needs is a candidate with a generic campaign you know account that is not saying anything remotely interesting run by staff who have the potential to blow it but not give you any upside.</div>

I mean, I think there&#39;s a large population that think that Twitter was won on, you know, the Twitter is how you win a campaign, the way that Facebook used to be how you win a campaign. And you know what? There was probably a time when Twitter mattered. And I think that time was, ooh, Ooh, 2009 through 2011, 12,</div>

It&#39;s over now. If you don&#39;t have a presence, don&#39;t establish a presence. If you do have a presence, give the password over and just let the staff do their tweeting of the leader&#39;s stuff and retweet the leader stuff with comments like, oh, this is why I chose to run and crap like that. Just don&#39;t get yourself into trouble because there&#39;s no upside in it. There&#39;s only downside. You fuck up, you&#39;re gone.</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, I disagree that there&#39;s only downside. I think you&#39;re not going to win any votes on Twitter like those days are over. And the way we&#39;ve all kind of collapsed into our social media bubbles make that true. But there is kind of a message crucible element to twitter as well so you are providing your supporters with the messages that you want and you are all refining them together like you see the best version of the phrasing the one that seems to own the libs the most or really stick it to the ucp the most or whatever you want and and there&#39;s this iteration on twitter of messaging that i find fascinating like when an issue happens in the first six hours as the partisans all kind of feel their way to their key message there&#39;s value in that um i mean you&#39;ve got to be mindful that they may be feeling their way to a message for an audience that you&#39;re not after but it&#39;s an audience where they&#39;re engaged you might galvanize them you might get them out to do actual real work like door knocking and you can kind of test your messages in certain areas but is it is</div>
