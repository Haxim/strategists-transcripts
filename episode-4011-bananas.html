            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think in today&#39;s political environment everything is there&#39;s a there and everything because the outrage machine is is just so tuned and so on all the time that uh you know they&#39;ll this will be clipped and it will be cut and pasted and thrown all over the internet and elon musk&#39;s x will be uh awash with this type of clip because that&#39;s what we do now um regardless of the fairness of it it is uh it&#39;s what we do and you know what the the the question I would ask is why wouldn&#39;t liberals do the same thing to Pierre Polyev if Pierre Polyev made such a misstep? Absolutely, they would. Corey,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, is there, like, I get what Carter&#39;s saying that this is what we do now. We&#39;ve got a 24-hour, of course, news cycle for a long time, but we&#39;ve, of course, got a rapid-fire social media environment in which you&#39;re producing content all the time. You&#39;re always looking for content. There&#39;s really no penalty if it doesn&#39;t stick. So, yes, there are folks within the conservative movement, third-party groups that are going to make hay of this but i&#39;m really curious on the on the materiality of my question like you&#39;re in a debate with your in your second language um is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">there a there there from the public&#39;s perspective to like and how they&#39;re thinking about this and analyzing it well</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i i do think it&#39;s a bit of a stretch that any sane human being is going to think that mark carney&#39;s on the side of hamas and like accidentally said what he believed right if there is a there there it is it is exactly the second language point the question is is his french good enough right and i think that there are certainly times</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">times tonight that christia freeland was clearly trying to push in that direction trying to nudge you know it&#39;s finishing his sentences at a certain point i can&#39;t remember the exact context but being like oh the word you&#39;re looking for is whatever yeah</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um i&#39;m sure she would love it if people were saying is mark carney&#39;s french good enough but i don&#39;t know that there is a there there like i said it&#39;s a fairly innocuous mistake what i actually can&#39;t get over like the french thing is what the french thing is that was always going to be the hurdle that mark kearney had yeah sure and the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the reality is that is probably one of the bigger challenges he has you know none of the candidates french is like super fluid but But what I can&#39;t get over, what I can&#39;t understand is why would the liberals put on a debate where the liberals pick the moderator and that moderator throw gotcha questions at the liberals? Like, I think in many ways, the more egregious one was like the grocery question. Like, is this fucking bar trivia? Like, we&#39;re trying to just say like, oh, no, sorry, answer&#39;s wrong. You know, like, I don&#39;t, what&#39;s the benefit? How do you win that question? It&#39;s designed to make people look out of touch. I cannot agree with you more. I</span>

            <span class="text">you know i i think that the the moderator wanted to be seen as neutral and uh you know there&#39;s a degree of of acceptability in that because this is the person they&#39;re not just questioning the next leader of the liberal party they are questioning the next prime minister whoever wins this leadership will be the prime minister and and And by putting themselves forward as more objective, and I saw the body language. I thought the body language was interesting. But, you know, I think by making themselves more objective, more pushing on this person, I don&#39;t think that it was the slam-dunk opinion of Corey Hogan. I can see why they would have gone that way. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, why was it a mistake? Carter, you&#39;re not defending the decision per se. You&#39;re saying you see the strategic reason in terms of why. Why? Corey, you&#39;ve been the executive director of a party, right? You&#39;ve run a political party. Why was this not the right call to pursue? Let&#39;s just assume what they were going for was neutrality and objectivity with their moderator.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Because the thing that a party needs to do before anything else during a leadership contest is no harm, do no harm. And you want to make sure that no matter what happens, the party overall is strengthened coming out of it here. And I get the appeal of going to a like a journalist so this is like a former tva host pierre jobin right i get that because it seems like they should be able to ask questions but i actually think the alberta ndp did it better where they found people who were ndp aligned and came in i&#39;m just using that because it&#39;s the example that i can immediately most recently yeah yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">of the day they care about the party and i think that matters um there is going to be an awful lot of opportunity for the people on the stage to try to take a round out of the other people on the stage there&#39;s going going to be an awful lot of opportunity for the media to do media things. But in terms of what the party is trying to do, the party is not trying to embarrass anybody. It&#39;s the same reason why you wouldn&#39;t create a, you know what, the best way to think about it is take it outside of a debate frame. Would you create rules that would embarrass people from a membership standpoint? Would you create rules that would embarrass people from an appeal standpoint? You wouldn&#39;t. If you thought you was doing, like imagine if the party sent a questionnaire around to everybody or did a pop pop quiz on something like this in any other setting, you&#39;d say totally inappropriate. And I think parties need to think a little bit more about that because Carter is right. We do live in a world where everything gets taken out of context. And this isn&#39;t even that. This is taken in context. It&#39;s just an embarrassing thing. But parties need to be a little bit more guarded in 2025. This is not a clip that then dies. This is a clip that shows up everywhere. And it&#39;s not It&#39;s not a clip that one of the candidates foisted on the other. I think the liberals learned their lesson on that front from 2006 and Stéphane Dion and his, do you think it&#39;s easy to make priorities, right?</span>

I assume you don&#39;t have the ability to change your moderator. But Carter, Corey makes some good points. And frankly, I&#39;d say I&#39;m pretty aligned with him in the sense that you don&#39;t want to create content for the other team.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I think if the Liberal Party was worried about content being created tonight, it was worried about it from Chrystia Freeland, perhaps. And she didn&#39;t really give any big blows to Mark Carney. She didn&#39;t do what she did on the first week of the campaign going after Carney or saying certain things that could be clippable, usable by the conservatives. I believe that was a worry by quite a few in the Liberal establishment going into tonight and, frankly, heading into tomorrow night, too. And let&#39;s see. Maybe tonight people are going to take it easy. Tomorrow it&#39;s where the big barbs come out. So I&#39;m not, you know, calling</span>

            <span class="text">calling the game just yet. However, I don&#39;t think anyone was expecting the moderator&#39;s sort of question line to trip folks up or to produce any content. If you were looking at this and through the lens of the Liberal Party tonight, would you be worried heading into tomorrow, Carter, around your strategy and the instructions you give for folks tomorrow night where you expect viewership to be higher, clipability to be higher, and frankly, the throughput of anything that comes out of that debate to be magnified significantly more as well.</span>

And I hope that she does behave like she&#39;s moderating the prime minister&#39;s debate. I think that that&#39;s the the the the level that the this party should be aspiring to. And frankly, it means that the the candidates just need to do better. And so the only notes that I&#39;d be giving are to the candidates themselves and making sure that their performance is better, because I don&#39;t think that the moderator was the one who was being judged.</span>

Like he&#39;s been on enough big stages. You could say like, look, you&#39;re, you&#39;re over scripting yourself. Don&#39;t worry about it. Be loose. You got to be a little bit more loose, right?

Trying to show that she&#39;s the tough one to stand up to Polyev. And I think every time she tried to, Carney looked better at it than her, right? And so- Why? Why?

You ask why? Because of the experience he had, because of the way he was able to articulate his, you know, his expertise, because of the way he comported himself.

Which is, the Trump question helps the liberals, so we&#39;re going to lean into the Trump question. There hasn&#39;t tried to be a lot of nuance within the liberal leadership to say, which of the sub-Trump questions helps me, per se? Because I think they&#39;re all thankful that the question&#39;s not about the carbon tax, which, by the way, they&#39;ve all said they&#39;re getting rid of, except Gould, who says she&#39;s going to freeze at a current level, so to speak, right? So I don&#39;t think either of them kind of have tried to be like, well, which sub-question about Trump benefits me the most? If you&#39;re Freeland, Corey&#39;s question.

And now he seems to be doing this with tariffs. Like, it&#39;s not going to remotely surprise me if he once again backs down and gives once again another two weeks or 30 days, whatnot. But the risk at this point becomes we stop, you know, we stop actually paying attention. We stop believing anything&#39;s going to happen. And so that&#39;s</span>

It&#39;s very possible that because Trudeau can&#39;t go on the you know television and give that solemn like address every saturday you know between now and and you know whenever he&#39;s not prime minister anymore but trump can continue to just ping off crazy thoughts from his head so there&#39;s a bit of an asymmetry here and and canadian officials better be thinking right now about how they respond to this thing in an environment where his responses cost nothing and yours cost a lot of time and interest carter</span>

You don&#39;t necessarily want to do that. And so let&#39;s just see where this goes. And certainly there was probably a feeling that it wasn&#39;t a very serious run. And then it&#39;s like, well, she&#39;ll get the, if she gets the 50,000, then she gets the 50,000 and it becomes, well, if she pays the deposit. And at a certain point, they probably said, holy fuck, how is she paying these deposits? And I think that partly became a bit the issue, because then they start going into where&#39;s the fundraising for this campaign going or coming from? Where&#39;s the financing?

She was a big part of the liberal party and they just put her out of the way because she got in the way of carbon copy Carney and his carbon tax and all of the things he wanted to do. And he&#39;ll do it to you too. This is what the liberals do.

But they&#39;re, you know, I just think that that&#39;s a stronger like ground for them to stand on if you&#39;re the liberals but i think the strength one is an interesting variant on it because i do think that the conservatives come off as stronger by and large so and so i think they&#39;re moving there but i think they&#39;ve made the decision to walk not run to their new message track they know exactly how much time they have and they&#39;re going to get there bit by bit increment by increment over the next month so</span>

He wants to take away the crown jewel of Canada, health care. Are you in or out, given all the limitations and all the shit you&#39;ve given to Jagmeet Singh, are you in or out on this message track for Jagmeet Singh? And why?
