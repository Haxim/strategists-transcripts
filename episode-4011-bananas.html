        <p>The first Liberal leadership debate pits Carney against Freeland, Baylis against Gould, moderator against everybody and the gang is here to discuss. Plus: Trump's tariffs, Dhalla's DQ and Poilievre's pivot.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the French language Liberal Party of Canada leadership debate before turning their attention to Trump's new tariff threats, Poilievre's pivot (?) and Ruby Dhalla's disqualification. What should the candidates do differently in Tuesday's English language debate? Is Donald Trump the President who cried "tariff"? And why didn't Carney reply to the moderator by saying "I don't know, Pierre, how much does a hack question cost at the hack question store?" Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

I thought the body language was interesting. But, you know, I think by making themselves more objective, more pushing on this person, I don&#39;t think that it was the slam-dunk opinion of Corey Hogan.

And you want to make sure that no matter what happens, the party overall is strengthened coming out of it here. And I get the appeal of going to a like a journalist so this is like a former tva host pierre jobin right i get that because it seems like they should be able to ask questions but i actually think the alberta ndp did it better where they found people who were ndp aligned and came in i&#39;m just using that because it&#39;s the example that i can immediately most recently yeah yeah</div>

But in terms of what the party is trying to do, the party is not trying to embarrass anybody. It&#39;s the same reason why you wouldn&#39;t create a, you know what, the best way to think about it is take it outside of a debate frame. Would you create rules that would embarrass people from a membership standpoint? Would you create rules that would embarrass people from an appeal standpoint? You wouldn&#39;t. If you thought you was doing, like imagine if the party sent a questionnaire around to everybody or did a pop pop quiz on something like this in any other setting, you&#39;d say totally inappropriate. And I think parties need to think a little bit more about that because Carter is right. We do live in a world where everything gets taken out of context. And this isn&#39;t even that. This is taken in context. It&#39;s just an embarrassing thing. But parties need to be a little bit more guarded in 2025. This is not a clip that then dies. This is a clip that shows up everywhere. And it&#39;s not It&#39;s not a clip that one of the candidates foisted on the other. I think the liberals learned their lesson on that front from 2006 and Stéphane Dion and his, do you think it&#39;s easy to make priorities, right?</div>

And she didn&#39;t really give any big blows to Mark Carney. She didn&#39;t do what she did on the first week of the campaign going after Carney or saying certain things that could be clippable, usable by the conservatives. I believe that was a worry by quite a few in the Liberal establishment going into tonight and, frankly, heading into tomorrow night, too. And let&#39;s see. Maybe tonight people are going to take it easy. Tomorrow it&#39;s where the big barbs come out. So I&#39;m not, you know, calling</div>

If you were looking at this and through the lens of the Liberal Party tonight, would you be worried heading into tomorrow, Carter, around your strategy and the instructions you give for folks tomorrow night where you expect viewership to be higher, clipability to be higher, and frankly, the throughput of anything that comes out of that debate to be magnified significantly more as well.</div>

There hasn&#39;t tried to be a lot of nuance within the liberal leadership to say, which of the sub-Trump questions helps me, per se? Because I think they&#39;re all thankful that the question&#39;s not about the carbon tax, which, by the way, they&#39;ve all said they&#39;re getting rid of, except Gould, who says she&#39;s going to freeze at a current level, so to speak, right? So I don&#39;t think either of them kind of have tried to be like, well, which sub-question about Trump benefits me the most? If you&#39;re Freeland, Corey&#39;s question.

And now he seems to be doing this with tariffs. Like, it&#39;s not going to remotely surprise me if he once again backs down and gives once again another two weeks or 30 days, whatnot.

It&#39;s very possible that because Trudeau can&#39;t go on the you know television and give that solemn like address every saturday you know between now and and you know whenever he&#39;s not prime minister anymore but trump can continue to just ping off crazy thoughts from his head so there&#39;s a bit of an asymmetry here and and canadian officials better be thinking right now about how they respond to this thing in an environment where his responses cost nothing and yours cost a lot of time and interest carter</div>

Shows up on air, and while she&#39;s saying she doesn&#39;t know anything, they send him a statement in which he reads to her on air, which is an incredible moment that people should watch.

And that, to me, seems like a pretty sensible version of a ballot box question for the Conservatives. Like, if it&#39;s who can protect Canada more, who loves Canada more, people</div>

He thinks anybody under 35 thinks the Conservatives are the people who protect Canada. I think the people over 35 think it&#39;s the Liberals, and there&#39;s more of them. But they&#39;re, you know, I just think that that&#39;s a stronger like ground for them to stand on if you&#39;re the liberals but i think the strength one is an interesting variant on it because i do think that the conservatives come off as stronger by and large so and so i think they&#39;re moving there but i think they&#39;ve made the decision to walk not run to their new message track they know exactly how much time they have and they&#39;re going to get there bit by bit increment by increment over the next month so</div>
