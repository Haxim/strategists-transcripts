But with so much volatility in this election, I mean, I think this is kind of the germ to what Carter&#39;s, you know, question or issue was, is that, is polling today, your polling, anyone else&#39;s polling, a good tool for projecting forward, especially considering the volatility we have that you&#39;ve just described?</span>
