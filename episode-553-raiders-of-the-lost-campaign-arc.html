        <div class="meta">October 18, 2015</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk with pollster Quito Maggi and journalist Jen Gerson about the 2015 election. What do Quito's numbers say about election day? How has this campaign looked from Jen's vantage point at a national newspaper? And was Stephen Carter really not wearing pants for the entire episode? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

We just mentioned the Alberta election in the mayoral in Toronto. But with so much volatility in this election, I mean, I think this is kind of the germ to what Carter&#39;s, you know, question or issue was, is that, is polling today, your polling, anyone else&#39;s polling, a good tool for projecting forward, especially considering the volatility we have that you&#39;ve just described?</div>
