And in this case, we&#39;ll get specific on this particular case, guys. How do you try to, as best as you can, convert some of these Patrick Brown supporters, many of them, as the Brown camp have said, You know, from a racialized background, maybe communities that didn&#39;t see themselves historically in the conservatives party. How do you court them? Or do you spend any time courting them? Or are you focused directly on your strategies, but especially with your slim pathway to victory now getting blockaded, arguably. So Carter, let me start with you on this. I want to get your take on this. Because I don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ll last and how long you&#39;ll be alive here. So</span>
