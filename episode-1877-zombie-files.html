People would say to me, oh, people must, you know, like recognize you. And I was like, no, absolutely not. Outside of Lethbridge, nobody has any idea. Knows who you are. Sure. Because nobody knows who ministers are. That is a fantastic arrangement. But the only place where this was not true was the environment minister for the province was anytime I would go to a mountain equipment co-op at the time, people</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to ask you out for a second, because I think we&#39;ve got a scandal brewing that I need Shannon&#39;s opining opinion first, which is one young Corey Hogan, formerly of this podcast, now member of Parliament for Calgary Confederation. Shannon, you&#39;re familiar with this young gent. Carter, you&#39;re, of course, familiar with this young gent. He was on our most recent episode of Ministry of Podcasts. He is refusing to wear cowboy boots, Shannon, this stampede. There is pictorial evidence of this, and I&#39;m going to call him out, but I actually, before I call him out, I want to actually get your confirmation that I&#39;m right in calling him out for not wearing cowboy boots, Shannon. You</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">You are absolutely not right. They are high heels for men. They are extremely uncomfortable. I would usually wear them on the first day because I&#39;m not a high heels gal myself. I&#39;m a cowboy boots gal. Normally, all you Calgary people are not wearing them in your daily life, so they&#39;re not broken in. It&#39;s part of the costume. Costume.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Shannon</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s part of the costume. That&#39;s the whole point. The whole thing, the whole costume part of Stampede is silly and ridiculous. So while I enjoy them as an element of, you know, sort of like men having to know what it&#39;s like to wear uncomfortable footwear, I don&#39;t really wish it on a nice man such as Corey. And you can still pull off your cosplay without your high heels.</span>

Number three, you don&#39;t have to copy, you know, the policy offers, but you do have to have something that speaks to people and they need to be somewhat substantive he did that as well uh and uh he&#39;s also handled i think the attacks on him which are only going to get worse uh and more completely banana pants like the the the nonsense that showed up in the new york times yesterday i i i think um he&#39;s he&#39;s pushed them back in an effective way um</span>

I kind of faintly recall you guys gave some predictions for by-elections. Oh, how&#39;d we do? I don&#39;t know. We&#39;ll talk about that in a second. We&#39;ve had the resurgence, perhaps, of the Progressive Conservative Party. We&#39;ve had the Alberta Next panel. We now have a sovereignty referendum question, kind of. We&#39;ll talk about that.

Or is this fucked? And Shannon, as I always say, there&#39;s no better way to get started than to get started. And let&#39;s start with this. Let&#39;s start with the by-election results. results three provincial by-elections are now concluding including the high-profile alberta ndp leader naid nenshi he&#39;s now in edmonton strathcona 82 percent of the vote check the ndpl also uh held on to edmonton ellerslie though with a reduced margin and the ucp retain old disbury three hills amid a split opposition that including strong showing from the alberta republican party although i will say not that strong 20 to 30 percent showing carter that you and i had speculated about when we chatted last time so shannon the character and let&#39;s just make look at the Alberta NDP.</span>

So there were reasons to be a bit tetchy there. And it was fine, right? The reduced margin, I think, is fine. It&#39;s a by-election. It&#39;s fine. And the same margin in Edmonton-Strathcona is also fine. In other words, when the electorate was introduced to Nahed in Edmonton, when people switched switched on to the fact that there was a by-election because most people are normal and they didn&#39;t probably</span>

I mean, Scott Sinclair was like, I didn&#39;t get money for my highway, right? Like, I&#39;m out, can&#39;t support this budget. Like, it was a bit silly. And for Guthrie, I think it was a bit more substantive. But I mean, there&#39;s no policy</span>

That&#39;s what the coal town hall for her was as well. Right. When the premier shows up and and, you know, either accepts the criticism or pushes back on it or or, you know, hears people out. It&#39;s it&#39;s received well by local MLAs. I put it that way. So she&#39;s doing that. But she also there was some polling. It was it was done by Janet Brown and it was leaked out by</span>

Even Alberta Police Service was the only one that didn&#39;t have sort of like into majority territory.

He filed this question, which is a pro-Canada, I always get this confused, so you guys are going to help me out, right? Right. This pro-Canada referendum question, which is, do you agree that Alberta should remain in Canada? That petition question was now approved on June 20th, just before Canada Day. And now he must he must collect signatures that take effect on July 1st, must collect nearly 294,000 signatures within 90 days. Rather than the lower threshold that has been applied that the premier has made way for the separatists to kind of do their question. And Lukaszek is now got there first, got his question approved. Now is to collect signatures to put this on a ballot. OK, is</span>

Now, one could make the case, and I suspect the UCP will, will, or the separatists will, that because the legislation changed, this means that the timer should start again. So they&#39;ll submit their question under the second timer. But I think that they&#39;re really going to have a hard time getting this question through. And ultimately, it&#39;s going to remove it from the citizens part of the referendum. However, it doesn&#39;t necessarily stop the province from doing it. So the UCP is now going to have to bring the question themselves. themselves and now that there&#39;s been a positive framing of the question i suspect the ucp will have to bring the positive framing of the question so they&#39;re a bit fucked um because i i still believe that danielle smith wants to turn us into a u.s state uh this is my new it&#39;s my new theory</span>

So people are going to have to actually find out the number and then come back to us and show us that their work is right. It&#39;s not going to show up in coroner&#39;s reports. That&#39;s how you get my signed Swiss chalet hat that we&#39;re promising. Let&#39;s move it to our over, under, and our lightning round. I&#39;ve got two questions for you, and they&#39;re about two very different things. Question number one, Shannon, I want to start with you. And I want to go flash to the Alberta Next panel for a second, because I said we&#39;re going to address this, which is the amount of people and the quality of the people that Premier Smith has been able to wrangle into to this panel and my simple question is can one say no to the premier when the premier calls is the explanation for why someone with this credibility of i&#39;m not going to pick on these guys but tomb or leg who are public figures that we know just have to say yes when when the premier calls and the question is can you say no to the premier when the premier asks you to do something and phrases it and you know perhaps believably so that&#39;s for the good of the province</span>

            <span class="text">And I guess, and I should have phrased my question, but either a tactic in terms of what you&#39;ve seen from politicians, from political parties, from others. Shannon, I&#39;ll expand the scope to you to have you, you know, wide berth on here, wherever you&#39;d like to take it in terms of Stampede or Stampede-like event political tactics you&#39;ve seen that you find interesting, impressive, novel.</span>

And I&#39;m not doing any of it and proudly so. So but it is important to note that Carter is wrong on this because you don&#39;t have to do the traveling cocktail party after a couple of these things. You can stop into one or two of them and then you can leave that behind. You don&#39;t need to be looking, sitting there at two in the afternoon, watching the same, you know, vice president government relations get shit faced at two</span>

            <span class="text">don&#39;t have to do it. after you do a couple of them you should just leave and uh in my view the best tactics were once we got away from that glorified pedal bar that is uh those those um those the lobbyist circuit right they are just uh appalling uh after a little while just all these you know gr people getting shit faced at two in the afternoon on a wednesday it&#39;s stupid and it&#39;s not work and uh Nobody should subject themselves to it. Instead, what the New Democrats started doing a few years back that I thought was really smart was they started doing local, you know, out in the great beyond. So one at Killarney, one at the Glenmore Reservoir, one, you know, wherever, right up at Confederation Park, you name it, of community events with MLAs or candidates or, you know, writing association people. And it was a reason for the MLAs to go out and canvass and say, hey, I&#39;m having a thing, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="text">right? And there&#39;s food and sometimes it&#39;s morning and sometimes it&#39;s afternoon. noon um and uh because stampede is a time of of uh the community engaging in calgary in neighborhoods not necessarily down on</span>

            <span class="text">on stephen avenue and on the stampede grounds and in the associated uh bars where the you know you go eat canapes and and watch uh uh business people you know wear costumes and get drunk um and so there&#39;s much more to stampede than that and embedding oneself and community is a really important thing to do. Number two, fundraising. If all those drunk people are going to be there at 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, you can charge them $350 to come to an event in the evening. That is the best use of your time during Stampede. Wow.</span>

And after that, it is diminishing returns. turns um and so do one or two of them or three or four and stack them up and get out uh was my view on it because after a while you know and as the week goes on people get a little bit looser and drunker and that is i used to say to people i&#39;m like no i&#39;m not having a drink at two o&#39;clock in the afternoon on a wednesday i don&#39;t drink at work i don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing um like it got so your personal popularity</span>
