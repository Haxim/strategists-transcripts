Shannon, you&#39;re familiar with this young gent. Carter, you&#39;re, of course, familiar with this young gent. He was on our most recent episode of Ministry of Podcasts. He is refusing to wear cowboy boots, Shannon, this stampede. There is pictorial evidence of this, and I&#39;m going to call him out, but I actually, before I call him out, I want to actually get your confirmation that I&#39;m right in calling him out for not wearing cowboy boots, Shannon.

I would usually wear them on the first day because I&#39;m not a high heels gal myself. I&#39;m a cowboy boots gal. Normally, all you Calgary people are not wearing them in your daily life, so they&#39;re not broken in. It&#39;s part of the costume. Costume.</div>

We&#39;ve had the resurgence, perhaps, of the Progressive Conservative Party. We&#39;ve had the Alberta Next panel. We now have a sovereignty referendum question, kind of. We&#39;ll talk about that.

Or is this fucked? And Shannon, as I always say, there&#39;s no better way to get started than to get started. And let&#39;s start with this. Let&#39;s start with the by-election results. results three provincial by-elections are now concluding including the high-profile alberta ndp leader naid nenshi he&#39;s now in edmonton strathcona 82 percent of the vote check the ndpl also uh held on to edmonton ellerslie though with a reduced margin and the ucp retain old disbury three hills amid a split opposition that including strong showing from the alberta republican party although i will say not that strong 20 to 30 percent showing carter that you and i had speculated about when we chatted last time so shannon the character and let&#39;s just make look at the Alberta NDP.</div>

And the same margin in Edmonton-Strathcona is also fine. In other words, when the electorate was introduced to Nahed in Edmonton, when people switched switched on to the fact that there was a by-election because most people are normal and they didn&#39;t probably</div>

I think that ultimately Albertans are going to be more loyal to the province of Alberta than that. Yeah,</div>

Now, one could make the case, and I suspect the UCP will, will, or the separatists will, that because the legislation changed, this means that the timer should start again. So they&#39;ll submit their question under the second timer. But I think that they&#39;re really going to have a hard time getting this question through. And ultimately, it&#39;s going to remove it from the citizens part of the referendum. However, it doesn&#39;t necessarily stop the province from doing it. So the UCP is now going to have to bring the question themselves. themselves and now that there&#39;s been a positive framing of the question i suspect the ucp will have to bring the positive framing of the question so they&#39;re a bit fucked um because i i still believe that danielle smith wants to turn us into a u.s state uh this is my new it&#39;s my new theory</div>

I&#39;ve got two questions for you, and they&#39;re about two very different things. Question number one, Shannon, I want to start with you. And I want to go flash to the Alberta Next panel for a second, because I said we&#39;re going to address this, which is the amount of people and the quality of the people that Premier Smith has been able to wrangle into to this panel and my simple question is can one say no to the premier when the premier calls is the explanation for why someone with this credibility of i&#39;m not going to pick on these guys but tomb or leg who are public figures that we know just have to say yes when when the premier calls and the question is can you say no to the premier when the premier asks you to do something and phrases it and you know perhaps believably so that&#39;s for the good of the province</div>

And I&#39;m not doing any of it and proudly so. So but it is important to note that Carter is wrong on this because you don&#39;t have to do the traveling cocktail party after a couple of these things. You can stop into one or two of them and then you can leave that behind. You don&#39;t need to be looking, sitting there at two in the afternoon, watching the same, you know, vice president government relations get shit faced at two</div>

          <div class="said">don&#39;t have to do it. after you do a couple of them you should just leave and uh in my view the best tactics were once we got away from that glorified pedal bar that is uh those those um those the lobbyist circuit right they are just uh appalling uh after a little while just all these you know gr people getting shit faced at two in the afternoon on a wednesday it&#39;s stupid and it&#39;s not work and uh Nobody should subject themselves to it. Instead, what the New Democrats started doing a few years back that I thought was really smart was they started doing local, you know, out in the great beyond. So one at Killarney, one at the Glenmore Reservoir, one, you know, wherever, right up at Confederation Park, you name it, of community events with MLAs or candidates or, you know, writing association people. And it was a reason for the MLAs to go out and canvass and say, hey, I&#39;m having a thing, right?</div>

          <div class="said">on stephen avenue and on the stampede grounds and in the associated uh bars where the you know you go eat canapes and and watch uh uh business people you know wear costumes and get drunk um and so there&#39;s much more to stampede than that and embedding oneself and community is a really important thing to do. Number two, fundraising. If all those drunk people are going to be there at 2 o&#39;clock in the afternoon, you can charge them $350 to come to an event in the evening. That is the best use of your time during Stampede. Wow.</div>

And after that, it is diminishing returns. turns um and so do one or two of them or three or four and stack them up and get out uh was my view on it because after a while you know and as the week goes on people get a little bit looser and drunker and that is i used to say to people i&#39;m like no i&#39;m not having a drink at two o&#39;clock in the afternoon on a wednesday i don&#39;t drink at work i don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing um like it got so your personal popularity</div>
