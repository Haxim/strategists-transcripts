Trudeau faces the music. Stephen takes down numbers and intends to hold people to account for their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss a column where outgoing Alberta NDP leader Rachel Notley appears to attack incoming-with-83%-of-the-vote Alberta NDP leader Naheed Nenshi - before turning to the looming Toronto-St. Paul&#39;s byelection. How should Nenshi engage (or not) with Rachel Notley and Jagmeet Singh at Notley&#39;s farewell dinner? Is Toronto-St. Paul&#39;s a referendum on Justin Trudeau&#39;s leadership? And will &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://GOCalgary.ca&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GOCalgary.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; change Calgary politics forever?

Does Naheed Nenshi need to be in the Alberta Legislature? Is there ever a safe way for a politician to blame somebody else during a crisis? And why is Zain watching hockey when he&#39;s got to go out there and secure 83% of the vote?
