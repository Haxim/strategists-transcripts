So I&#39;m kind of glad that it just got close, that it didn&#39;t go over the top, because I don&#39;t have a lot of confidence that some of our more right-wing citizens would have have taken that particularly well uh but for the province of course i&#39;m completely devastated that the uh the ucp is back and daniel smith is going to remain our premier it&#39;s uh not</span>

And this is an NDP government. And that&#39;s pretty crazy. We&#39;ve never had an election that has gotten so close. So few votes would have fundamentally changed the outcome here.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there are a couple of things you got to keep in mind with that number first of all the ndp weren&#39;t trying to win the popular vote so their efforts were focused on winning seats. And it&#39;s the exact same as why I kind of roll my eyes whenever somebody says, Donald Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. Well, that&#39;s true. But if it was about trying to win the popular vote, his campaign would have made different decisions. That&#39;s the reality of campaigns. Campaigns gear themselves towards winning, not towards getting moral victories in terms of popular vote. That&#39;s just not a reality of things. Was the NDP likely ever to exceed the UCP popular vote? I don&#39;t know about that. But you know, in the rural areas, the NDP weren&#39;t even playing for by and large, right? They just</span>

            <span class="text">And the demographics of Alberta have fundamentally shifted. Our politics have fundamentally shifted with them. The NDP have gone from 5% of the vote in Calgary to 34% two elections in a row to 49% and counting. And this has kind of changed the game in Alberta, regardless of what the outcome was on Monday. This is now a competitive province. The UCP can&#39;t deny it. The NDP aren&#39;t going to deny it. and that&#39;s going to change the way even a ucp government has to approach things or else they&#39;re going to get fucking crushed in 2027 i think that&#39;s kind of interesting i think that in many ways you can make the case that alberta is a much more competitive landscape than quebec or</span>

            <span class="text">that party to me it looks an awful lot like the uh the uh conservative party of canada and insofar as you know it was brought together by one person um you know the conservative party of canada brought together by stephen harper the uh ucp brought together by Jason Kenney.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And since Stephen Harper has left, they&#39;ve lost every election. They don&#39;t really know how to appeal to the electorate. They do not have that momentum that others, you know, that Harper brought to the table. And they&#39;re a little bit lost. And I think that the same type of situation is going to exist here for the UCP. Because the UCP didn&#39;t do great. And there&#39;s going to be two arguments for why they didn&#39;t do great. One argument is going to be they went way too far to the right way too far to the right they lost calgary because they were so far to the right um you know danielle smith and and the take back alberta stuff was exceptionally damaging to them and their brand and that&#39;s one argument that&#39;s going to be told and the other argument that&#39;s going to be told is um we lost conservatives you know there was a hundred thousand conservatives that voted last time that didn&#39;t vote this time and the reason they didn&#39;t vote this time is they They didn&#39;t feel we were conservative enough. If we&#39;d only been more conservative, then we would have been able to bring in all of those people. And the reason I can say these things with such confidence, I&#39;ve heard these arguments before. I&#39;ve heard these arguments when the Wild Rose existed. I&#39;ve heard these arguments when the floor crossing happened and Jim Prentiss wound up losing in 2012. All of these arguments have been around for a long time. And the</span>

            <span class="text">And polling, numbers, data, none of those things matter. What matters is the way that people feel. And I think that this is going to be one of those splits that&#39;s very hard to reconcile, like what the Conservative Party of Canada is. I mean, maybe Pierre Pelliev is able to pull it all together, but I just don&#39;t think he will. So, you know, I think that that&#39;s the state of the UCP. Danielle Smith&#39;s going to be facing a mandatory leadership review sometime within the next year. When she faces that leadership review, she is going to have to either appeal to the moderate side or appeal to the take back Alberta side. And I don&#39;t know that appealing to both of those sides simultaneously would be available to her. if it is she&#39;s a hell of a talented politician um</span>

            <span class="text">want to push back a little bit, though, or I at least want to challenge it and get your reaction to a couple of things that I would observe. One is, if you actually read the UCP&#39;s platform this time around, pretty,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">pretty, pretty moderate, you know, most of the things that are the most aggressive, I think are reserved for the section on fighting with Ottawa, or like basically all of their commentary on that. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then otherwise, it&#39;s pretty middle of the road, you know, guarantees around healthcare, the language around education, it obfuscates perhaps their personal views, but it&#39;s not a really wild platform.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s one. Two is when I think about probably the most conservative platform in recent times, it&#39;s Jason Kenney&#39;s, which was also the largest majority in terms of votes, raw votes in Alberta&#39;s history and higher than this time. So maybe maybe some evidence supporting that argument that, you know, true conservatives wouldn&#39;t have stayed home. And then the third thing I&#39;ll say is</span>

They just don&#39;t care that much. They may hold on to their brand position, but their reasoning will shift from time to time. And I don&#39;t think that you can do that when you&#39;re talking about, you know, how secure is the UCP today? I think the UCP has still got two factions within it. And I still think those two factions are going to get a war with one another.</span>

What we discover is that we share, we have what can only be described as small L liberal values. So if we were to compare the values to the United States, we would say, what values do we have? Where do they compare to? And they compare more to Democrats than they do to Republicans. They compare more to people who who value society we value things like um collective health care we value things like uh collective social safety nets we value public education yeah</span>
