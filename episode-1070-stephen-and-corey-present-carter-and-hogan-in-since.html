And this is an NDP government. And that&#39;s pretty crazy. We&#39;ve never had an election that has gotten so close. So few votes would have fundamentally changed the outcome here.

They do not have that momentum that others, you know, that Harper brought to the table. And they&#39;re a little bit lost. And I think that the same type of situation is going to exist here for the UCP. Because the UCP didn&#39;t do great. And there&#39;s going to be two arguments for why they didn&#39;t do great. One argument is going to be they went way too far to the right way too far to the right they lost calgary because they were so far to the right um you know danielle smith and and the take back alberta stuff was exceptionally damaging to them and their brand and that&#39;s one argument that&#39;s going to be told and the other argument that&#39;s going to be told is um we lost conservatives you know there was a hundred thousand conservatives that voted last time that didn&#39;t vote this time and the reason they didn&#39;t vote this time is they They didn&#39;t feel we were conservative enough. If we&#39;d only been more conservative, then we would have been able to bring in all of those people. And the reason I can say these things with such confidence, I&#39;ve heard these arguments before. I&#39;ve heard these arguments when the Wild Rose existed. I&#39;ve heard these arguments when the floor crossing happened and Jim Prentiss wound up losing in 2012. All of these arguments have been around for a long time. And the</div>

And I think that this is going to be one of those splits that&#39;s very hard to reconcile, like what the Conservative Party of Canada is. I mean, maybe Pierre Pelliev is able to pull it all together, but I just don&#39;t think he will. So, you know, I think that that&#39;s the state of the UCP. Danielle Smith&#39;s going to be facing a mandatory leadership review sometime within the next year. When she faces that leadership review, she is going to have to either appeal to the moderate side or appeal to the take back Alberta side. And I don&#39;t know that appealing to both of those sides simultaneously would be available to her. if it is she&#39;s a hell of a talented politician um</div>
