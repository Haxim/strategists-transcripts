        <div class="desc"><p>The Zain-free gang talk Twitter's ongoing war with media outlets, Danielle Smith's ongoing war with media outlets, the UCP's ongoing war with the UCP's reputation on health care. Plus! An inordinate amount of content on the Alberta Party during the lightning round.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss "Government-funded media" labels on Twitter, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith denying reporters followup questions and the UCP health care push. Are followup questions essential to the media's role? Is there anything for the UCP to gain from "standing out in the health care field"? And why don't we just embrace 24 Sussex as a rodent mausoleum? Zain Velji, as always, isn't here. But Annalise Klingbeil is, and she's got you covered.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And then today, I think it&#39;s today, this evening, there it is. Twitter has labeled the CBC as government funded media. So far, as far as I can tell, it&#39;s like this at CBC account. It&#39;s not the CBC news news account, or Radio Canada. So CBC&#39;s director of media relations, they put out a statement this evening, just a little bit ago. It says, Twitter&#39;s own policy defines government-funded media as media where the government may have varying degrees of government involvement over editorial content. And that&#39;s clearly not the case with CBC.</div>

I mean, NPR, I&#39;m sure they have a small small, uh, revenue base from the government. Um, but the CBC is kind of like Canada as Canada&#39;s broadcaster, uh, keeping in mind that many of these, many of our communities wouldn&#39;t even have news access if it wasn&#39;t for the CBC. Uh, they have to, I think, stay on, on Twitter in order to, uh, share their, share their stuff a little bit more. Now they&#39;re not sharing a tremendous amount. I mean, I&#39;m sure that they get more listeners, uh, just, you know, from, and clicks just from clicking this stuff right like it it doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t drive their business twitter but i think that they have to stay on twitter and not pop off like uh like npr did but nonetheless uh this is kind of a gone show pause</div>

          <div class="said">i think it&#39;s The CBC feels that their mandate is to be communicating with Canadians on every medium possible to ensure that Canadians have the best opportunity to get information, to get news wherever they may be, keeping in mind that we are the second largest landmass of a country. So it&#39;s huge, right? Right.

CBC&#39;s mandate is to communicate, in my opinion, with as many people as possible, as many Canadians as possible. And that means doing it where they are to steal the phrase from Nenji&#39;s campaign. So I think that that&#39;s why it&#39;s a little bit different. I think, you know, why is the CBC so interested in podcasting? It&#39;s not just to make us angry, right? Not just to come in and upset us. It&#39;s because that&#39;s where people are.

          <div class="said">Yeah, I don&#39;t actually think that&#39;s, I don&#39;t agree with Stephen. I think the reason why CBC has to stay on Twitter is because it would seem like too much of a political statement if they left Twitter. So here&#39;s the irony, and here&#39;s the thing to unpack. CBC is actually publicly funded, right? It might not be a state broadcaster like RT, but it is publicly funded, and it would seem very political to walk away from twitter in these supercharged times so i think ultimately cbc&#39;s options are between bad and terrible and they&#39;re going to pick bad which is to sit there and take their lumps and have this stupid label applied to them that suggests something otherwise because leaving twitter is just going to rile up a whole other group of people it&#39;s just going to be ammunition for people saying see cbc doesn&#39;t even want to have you know truth in advertising talk to people who disagree with them all of that bullshit and as a result They&#39;re kind of stuck. They&#39;re stuck where they are. And it has very little to do with whether CBC needs to be in Iqaluit, frankly. It has everything to do with the fact that this is a tense moment. And let&#39;s not lose sight of the fact that the leader of the opposition sent a letter to Elon Musk saying, these guys are state media, make sure you label them state media. Well, why confirm all of that to Elon Musk? Why confirm that to Pierre Polyev? Why confirm that to Canadians? What a</div>

He may have made cuts, but it didn&#39;t amount to what Pierre Polyev is suggesting, which is essentially deconstructing it completely and turning it into some sort of a private broadcaster, or better yet, just leaving the space completely. completely so i i think that this is a um this</div>

Well, truth is we don&#39;t lie so much as we speak to people who are different than you. And this is, but this is a blatant lie. This, this, and some of the things he&#39;s been doing of late are just, just simply lies. That&#39;s it. There&#39;s no, there&#39;s no second, there&#39;s no second, uh, level to it.

          <div class="said">pierre polyev is doing it in a way that is a little off putting in my opinion the way he&#39;s approached these uh particular issues issues really is not um not that appealing to a lot of canadians but um but the reality is defunding the cbc reducing funding for the cbc that&#39;s more popular than not uh by about 10 points so it&#39;s an issue that the cbc wins on so put aside any of kind of the moral arguments the ethical arguments there&#39;s a political argument to be made here which is you don&#39;t fight on territory that is is better for the other guy so if you&#39;re justin trudeau you you don&#39;t take the bait you do not take the bait so</div>

          <div class="said">so but one question i have and maybe annalise you&#39;ll know this what is the cbc how&#39;s it doing in ratings like do people do canadians watch it because i certainly watch it and i certainly listen to it and it&#39;s one of my go-to locations for news it&#39;s not my only place but i certainly go to the cbc and i and i can get a really good sense of what&#39;s really happening happening what&#39;s it what are its numbers are it&#39;s declining does anybody know like i think one of the reasons that we struggle with this is we don&#39;t actually have openness about where the cbc is and how important it is to society i know it&#39;s the number number one rated um morning show but i don&#39;t know much more well</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">but i think it&#39;s also that changing environment right like all tv ratings are lower now than they used to be because people go online for their news so are we going to get all of these online sites to you know like before the the herald for example when i was there could you&#39;d have your nad bank or whatever they&#39;re called numbers that were like there are this many subscribers with clicks it&#39;s different it&#39;s a different measurement yeah</div>

          <div class="said">Well, it&#39;s a good question, because there are certainly outlets where, like, if you&#39;re the New York Times at NY Times, that means something. That&#39;s kind of, that&#39;s shareable, that&#39;s credible. But the reality is, in terms of actual social media engagement, I would bet, if you look right now that the more prominent media personalities are getting far more engagement on their social media activity than the cbc news posting of it right or the you know whatever corporate accounts that the cbc decides to put the content out through and that&#39;s because people want to mix it up with an actual personality they want to have conversations with the actual writers the actual pundits and um and so in a way you&#39;re right maybe they&#39;re not losing a lot by losing the official channel because these people can still share it and in fact it might be a better fit for these more personality driven times we find ourselves in anyhow yeah</div>

          <div class="said">well your Your point about frequencies is a good one, because there&#39;s another thing that CBC has been dealing with over decades now that has fundamentally changed the game, which is it used to be a combination of infrastructure and content, right?</div>

          <div class="said">internet protocols, I mean. And so that&#39;s an interesting shift. And that&#39;s an awkward shift. And the value of CBC in the future is much less about the fact that there is a physical station in the community, I suspect, than it is that the community is being covered. And those stories are being, you know, discussed because they&#39;re being supported by professional journalists who are looking into those things. And again, that changes the game a bit for CBC.

          <div class="said">Then it&#39;s time for media questions. And surprise! Smith says she&#39;s no longer taking follow-up questions. Every reporter who gets a question through, they only get one question. No follow-up. Why? It&#39;s an election. That&#39;s why. Direct quote. So there was some outrage about this. There There was a lot of upset reporters on Twitter. There was some headlines about it. And then she doubled down on this yesterday on her weekend radio show, saying, you know, the people who were standing behind her on Friday, they could have fainted if she stood up there and she took follow-ups. So the new policy, because it&#39;s the election, even though the election has not been called, is one question per media outlet per press conference. um i obviously have thoughts about this but strategy wise and cory i want to start with you because you did the the ucp strategy at our live show can you like walk me through what the thinking is here like what what the point at a time when you know um media</div>

          <div class="said">yeah this is an extreme version of something that politicians of both stripes all stripes really have been doing for a while which is trying to control the answers that they provide in a way that gets the stories that they want and look here&#39;s the simple reality um if you only have one question and no follow-up you can literally ask me anything i can literally say anything and we&#39;re not going to have any of that awkwardness of you saying you didn&#39;t answer my question and grinding me a little bit harder on it and and that&#39;s just it moves on to the next thing in some ways the questions are incidental to the answers right it becomes just a way for you to say the things you want to say for as long as you want to say before you call the end of the press conference and um the follow-up is really what makes it journalism in my opinion right it&#39;s you know it&#39;s i was saying on twitter it&#39;s the difference between journalism and stenography you asking me something and me telling you something and you writing it it is not particularly compelling journalism journalism has to probe and and figure out and part of why people sometimes think journalists are partisan is because their job is to to challenge assertions that are made by people and say well hold on that doesn&#39;t make any fucking sense that doesn&#39;t follow with the eight things you said before or this person over here says something entirely differently respond to it and and without that back and forth i think it&#39;s really it&#39;s barely journalism right you get the benefit of the t up but you don&#39;t get any of the volley you don&#39;t You don&#39;t get any of the back and forth that you need for it actually to be journalism. But to your question, how would you think the conservatives are going to do this, particularly with the media in the state they are? Because the media is in the state they are. Like, what&#39;s to lose? Do you think that there&#39;s going to be reduced opinions of Danielle Smith in the press corps because of this? I mean, I feel like they&#39;re already pretty low based on her actions to date. So, in</div>

          <div class="said">in for a penny, in for a pound might be the thinking here. I&#39;m not convinced it will work, but obviously they don&#39;t want any of the awkward back and forth. They don&#39;t want follow-ups. They think they can control the agenda more with just the one question. it obviously has nothing to do with the fact that we&#39;re in a election or a campaign period or anything like that at all because then you would just have fewer questions right or you would ask the press gallery what they want to do um but that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening this is to control message and i i think they&#39;re making the calculation people won&#39;t care or it&#39;s too much of a process story and the public&#39;s not going to pay attention carter</div>

The fine print is right in front of us though, folks. We look at it and that is the thing that the UCP has to deal with. And the reality is people don&#39;t really trust them on healthcare very much. Polling backs that up. And that gets to the point that Stephen was making at the end there, which I think is super important to underline. This is really bad ground for the UCP.</div>

Well, what it appears they got rid of was a $40, you know, charge for staying at an addiction center, $40 a day for like 500 beds. Total cost if every one of those beds was full and being paid full price would be like $8 million a year, right? Right. Yeah.</div>

Maybe they can see things that we can&#39;t see. We know they have more information than us. We have to assume they&#39;re at least halfway as competent.

But ultimately, I think that if that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s not, you know, the reality is, as much as we talk about campaigns matter and stuff, if they&#39;ve spent the last four weeks sliding, that&#39;s kind of campaign period light.

And they said, you know what, maybe we&#39;ll make it the prime minister&#39;s house. And they threw a bunch of 50s-style bolt-ons, asbestos-filled bolt-ons, in order to make it, quote-unquote, good enough for the prime minister. They took a not-special house, they added not-special additions at a very not-special time for construction, and it&#39;s fallen the fuck apart for the last 70 years. Tear it down. It means nothing. It means nothing. nothing it has had relatively few prime ministers in it and it just sucks it sucks architecturally it sucks from cultural standpoint it was like designed by like some scottish lumber magnate for his family it doesn&#39;t matter it&#39;s not a special building tear it down make a special building carter</div>

          <div class="said">Well, there was no strategy behind the Alberta Party thread. They thought that they were doing something that would gain them attention or sound, I guess, provocative. It did not. Nothing happened. No one cared. and I think that that really summarizes the Alberta party I also tweeted something about vote splitting I&#39;ve long maintained I don&#39;t believe in vote splitting multiple candidates just simply lowers the number of votes that are required for any other candidate to win and the Alberta party is all over it they are retweeting it, they think it&#39;s the best thing ever I did say that it only mattered if you had a competitive three competitive candidates the Alberta party will not be competitive it will not matter so</div>

You didn&#39;t win any seats in 2019. That didn&#39;t happen because you were too loud, because you were too much in the conversation in the month before the election. Like, is that the thesis that the Alberta party is carrying right now? They&#39;re like, shit, guys, you know what? Our problem was we were too relevant. Too many people talking about us. We peaked too early. And then everybody got tired and went to the UCP and NDP. That&#39;s not how I remember 2019. It&#39;s</div>

This is like, I&#39;m trying to think of a metaphor, an example, but let&#39;s just say, let&#39;s just be really clear about what it is without a metaphor. This is a party that has done absolutely nothing for a month and is now trying to make it into a virtue. They&#39;re trying to be like, oh, but that was always the strategy. Just wait until we knock your fucking socks off with our thinking about politics differently. We&#39;re so different with our politics. We don&#39;t even show up. We&#39;re the fucking Alberta party.
