You know what? I&#39;ve gotten such insight into the American psyche just by having to go through 50 plus days so far. Of course they&#39;re insane. Of course they&#39;re also polarized. like this is what happens you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">okay well there&#39;s a lot to talk about regardless of how you feel and how much time you you need on the couch because we&#39;ve got a few subjects that I want to cover today. So let&#39;s get it on with our first segment. Our first segment, Uptown Monk. Let&#39;s talk about the monk debates. This is our third major debate outside of the French language debate that was held, of course. Corey, I want to get your thoughts first. Just give me your overall sentiments, what you thought of this debate, and we&#39;ll take it from there. What did you make of last night?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">this election has given us, I think, one of the worst debates in recent memory with the globe debate and now with the monk debate one of the best in recent memory and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and it&#39;s funny how different they were right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right i mean the globe and mail was a lot of glitz uh you had the animated backgrounds the the topics flying in and out they played a bit with the format the notion that the moderator was going to be a little bit edgy and uh you know this this whole overall vibe that was like german techno yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah like a german porn set or something i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">love that you always go to what what you&#39;re familiar with no</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">comment but on the opposite side now talking about the monk debate this was about as traditional as it gets you had three guys on a stage in front of a large audience who had to actually debate one-on-one with the issues and and sometimes you know the free-for-all still but this was as traditional as a debate got and and yet you enjoyed this one the most i think a lot of people enjoyed this one the most having the audience there gave the people somebody can Can we back</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">up and say a lot of people enjoyed this? This is still not an easy-to-get-to debate. On the West Coast, it started at 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. No, 5 o&#39;clock on CPAC,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">On the West Coast, it started at 4 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. So the idea that a lot of people were watching this, this was difficult to watch. It&#39;s also probably the least accessible topic of any of the topics.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, I would agree with both points, which is why I thought the debate was going to be a bit of a bust. And I doubt many people PVR&#39;d the debate on CPAC like I did. I think that&#39;s a level of odd that most people don&#39;t reach. Well, that&#39;s the level that you&#39;re at.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But, yeah, and ultimately, how great can a debate be if nobody watched? Fair point. And I take that. But the actual execution in the format was fascinating. And as far as my overall take on it, this has been a very long way to answer your question. This was supposed to be the debate that Justin Trudeau was really going to be exposed on. right right foreign affairs he&#39;s not serious enough for it the just not ready mantra that&#39;s been repeated was supposed to be it applies to this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">this topic the most when some would argue some would argue yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah that didn&#39;t happen at all he was uh he was easily the winner when you consider expectations that&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s he may have been the winner on points regardless you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know it&#39;s it&#39;s always fun to hear cory repeat back my words uh because when i said the exact same thing about the global mail debate that everybody no one was expecting justin trudeau uh to have a great economic debate uh i said you know he won and again the</span>

            <span class="text">right and again one of those things that&#39;s murky and difficult to track in time time so i&#39;m going to come clean i didn&#39;t watch the debate i read the tweets and now i&#39;m reading the coverage so i think i&#39;m attacking now</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think i am now approaching this the way that most voters are approaching it in fact i&#39;m probably still much higher in level of engagement all i&#39;ve seen is trudeau won trudeau won trudeau won trudeau won people who said that he didn&#39;t win the first three debates are saying he&#39;s won this debate i&#39;m one of those people i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">he he had a really strong night and even when tom mulcair was being uh you know you know quaaludes tom has a bad reaction to medicine and snaps at you sort of thing because for most of the night he was very slow and measured almost to a fault</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">so carter you hit on a point and core you you touched on it too this was a debate on foreign affairs and foreign policy a subject matter that cory like you mentioned justin trudeau was supposed to not be as strong as he performed last night at if you are the trudeau campaign right now you see your guy perform above expectations do you try to get people to care about foreign affairs as as a way to attract votes for him or do you just knock this off as a win and stick on message card i&#39;ll go with with you on that one first i</span>

You know, when we did our CBC segment last week, Rob Brown was talking to me and talking to us about what he thought the conclusion of the last debate was, was not necessarily on content, but what he teased out in terms of behavior and energy. And I think that&#39;s a good question. Is there something that you guys saw that really spoke to you on behavior and energy? Mulcair had a bad night, and you could see it on his face that he had a bad night. Is there any takeaways that you as a campaign try to move forward as well?

            <span class="text">well i think this is the you know this is what the real takeaway of the four debates to this point have been is that we are still not in a place where more most people are are ready to make up their mind i mean we&#39;ve done a whole you know podcast on polling and and who answers the phone and those types of things i&#39;m not going going to go back into that but i&#39;m going to say this people are starting to pay attention</span>

But I also want to really acknowledge that point that you guys made about the celebrity trajectory versus the political trajectory and something to think about as we continue on with the remaining three weeks of this election. Okay, let&#39;s move it on to our next segment, our next segment, changing your vote for change. Okay. So we&#39;re in this position right now where we have – poll numbers indicate anywhere between 60 to 75 percent of this country wants to see a change in government in some way. And Corey, you&#39;ve mentioned this multiple times, even on the early – before the writ was even dropped, that this election will be about Mulcair</span>

            <span class="text">Mulcair versus Trudeau. And one of them will need to rise amongst the two to be able to be the consensus candidate for change. We see some polling that&#39;s coming out of Quebec right now. We see this debate performance by Tom Mulcair. What do you make of the NDP&#39;s chances of being that organization or being that party that can persuade people to be the party of change with their dipping poll numbers right now? Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;ve got to look at this more broadly and not overreact to smaller dips in the polls. But that said, you&#39;re starting to see a narrative accrue. And the fact is, these dips and these peaks mean an awful lot more the closer you are to an election. The day before an election, they&#39;re huge. A month out, less so. But even if this is just variation from a status quo that hasn&#39;t changed, you&#39;ve got to be concerned as the new Democrats.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, and I mean, we&#39;ve talked about parties having to make this case at a certain point. They can&#39;t make it the day before the election and say, we&#39;re the party of consensus. Look at last night&#39;s poll. We&#39;re three points up. They need to start painting a picture around this point. Is that not true, Carter? Absolutely. I mean,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

I mean, they&#39;re fighting each other, but they&#39;re still not. No one is establishing superiority. I&#39;m with Corey. We were talking about the dip in the Conservatives last week.

And when we talk about that 70% plus who want change, there is some variation as to are we just talking about a change in government or are we talking about dramatic fundamental overhaul of the country? Now, what&#39;s fascinating to me is right now, when you look at the polls, the dramatic overhaul people, the higher intensity change people are</span>

And we don&#39;t spend a lot of time talking about the local campaign and how you run a local campaign when you&#39;ve got a giant machine that is your party. So I&#39;m going to post you a hypothetical, which is probably not that outside of where reality may stand or has stood for some of these campaigns. You&#39;re a local NDP organization. The liberals are leading nationally. You know it&#39;s a changed election. As a local campaign manager, how exactly do you push that tide of people saying, oh, but I think Justin Trudeau is the guy that could make change versus saying, but look, my local NDP candidate is up. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get to. How do you make that process change?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">change? That is so different from riding to riding. Exactly. You latch on to the things that you have. Do you have a star candidate? If you&#39;re in Albertan, maybe you point to the Alberta NDP wave and how the local numbers impact and where those provincial ridings overlay. You can say like, hey, there&#39;s NDP vote here. Maybe you talk about your organization, the fundraising, the amount of money you&#39;ve raised, the number of signs, whatever you have that you can point to that suggests that you are the one to beat.</span>

He needs to be created in some sort of unbelievable media vortex that enables you to become the number one person in your region. So this is a lot easier to do in regions that are a little bit smaller, like Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina, where you might have a star local candidate. When you&#39;re trying to do this in downtown Toronto against a red wave, that&#39;s going to be – Or a perceived red</span>

So, I mean, part of it is can you make – I mean, we&#39;ve talked about viability how many times, Corey? I mean, you&#39;re going to get rich off of that saying. But this is ultimately what you have to do. You have to focus on viability. So in Calgary Confederation, right, you&#39;ve got Matt Grant as the liberal who is basically his entire campaign is I&#39;m the only one who can beat the conservatives. Right. Right. And</span>

There&#39;s three things I want to talk about that I feel like are taking over in some respect, maybe small or large. And let&#39;s talk about them through the lens of each of the parties as either distraction or death strategy. The first one, and I know Corey&#39;s burning to talk about this, is the revoking of the citizenship of one of the individuals from the Toronto 18. So looking at it from the three-party perspectives, give me your quick analysis. But if you want to discuss the issue a little bit more, I&#39;ll let you do that because you&#39;ve taken off your glasses. You&#39;re rubbing your eyes. Your hair looks crazier than ever.

If he doesn&#39;t like something you&#39;ve done. It frustrates me immensely. And it&#39;s so arbitrary. And where the lines have been drawn are so crassly political. It is just beneath us as a country. Look, terrorists are bad people. So we should take away their citizenship. Okay. Why not take away murderous citizenship? Why not arsonists? Why not jaywalkers?</span>

Everyone around this table only has one citizenship. but if i&#39;m convicted of terrorism my punishment is my jail time and that&#39;s it but if somebody else was born in a different country or has access to a different citizenship because of their parents never mind they may not have ever been to that country or speak the</span>
