          <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan break down the niqab debate - and its impact on Canadians. Are the Conservatives just running a fear campaign? What are parties doing right now to get out the vote? And who put that dead cat on the table? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

You know, when we did our CBC segment last week, Rob Brown was talking to me and talking to us about what he thought the conclusion of the last debate was, was not necessarily on content, but what he teased out in terms of behavior and energy. And I think that&#39;s a good question. Is there something that you guys saw that really spoke to you on behavior and energy? Mulcair had a bad night, and you could see it on his face that he had a bad night. Is there any takeaways that you as a campaign try to move forward as well?

So I&#39;m going to post you a hypothetical, which is probably not that outside of where reality may stand or has stood for some of these campaigns. You&#39;re a local NDP organization. The liberals are leading nationally. You know it&#39;s a changed election. As a local campaign manager, how exactly do you push that tide of people saying, oh, but I think Justin Trudeau is the guy that could make change versus saying, but look, my local NDP candidate is up. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to get to. How do you make that process change?</div>
