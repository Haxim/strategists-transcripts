        <p>Corey Hogan basks in the glory of his recent victory.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the Alberta NDP leadership results, lopsided leadership races and what the still-being-counted results in Toronto-St. Paul's mean for Justin Trudeau and Pierre Poilievre. When a result looks like it's going to skew heavily to one candidate, why do other candidates run? Do the Liberals win the expectations game if they squeak out a victory? And at Zain's Strategists Accountability Session, will we get to discuss the many ways he is like the Florida Panthers organization? Zain Velji, as always, gets distracted by songs about himself.</em></p></blockquote>

And it sort of ties into some of the bigger changes in politics where leaders&#39; offices have become so omnipotent and candidates are just little cogs in the machine. And it&#39;s interesting to me because I think if somebody actually wants to break that model down the road, they&#39;re going to need to, as an MLA, kind of take on for themselves the role of organizer again. Because I think the average MLA has abandoned the role of organizer. And so it&#39;s pretty tough for me to say that</div>

So I think that&#39;s one of the things that I&#39;m kind of interested in. And I think that when you have so many MLAs who were not on the kind of endorsement side, I do think it creates a dynamic, not one that&#39;s necessarily dangerous for Nahed Nenshi. Like I said, he won with 86% of the vote, but how many MLAs are fucking panicking right now? Like not, oh my God, I&#39;m going to lose my job, but I&#39;m no longer at the center of power in this party. So, you</div>

Make sure that they, you know, it&#39;s one thing to say these words in a speech. It&#39;s quite a different one for the leader to reach out and have sincere outreach and create those connections. And it&#39;s a big caucus. It&#39;s going to take a lot of work. But I think that&#39;s one of the dynamics I&#39;m looking at. And then the final one, frankly, is with a super, super majority like 86%, what&#39;s he got in mind? Because, yeah, we&#39;ve talked a little bit about the connection to the federal NDP. There&#39;s been models where it&#39;s as simple as a checkbox. There&#39;s obviously bigger disassociations possible, but fuck it, he could do anything with 86%. Like anything. He could make himself god king of the party with kind of perpetual mandate if he wants. That&#39;s a lot. a vote so is he going to use that in any kind of party sense or is that just not where his focus is going to be zane probably knows not asking him no no you know what i what i</div>

Now, did they get into the race thinking that they could win? Yeah, I think they did. And then when the Nenshi entered, um, the the math changed. And we saw that with Raki Pancholi. She decided not to run for the party. She decided to run to Nenji and that worked for her. So good for her and good for the others for staying in there and hopefully not leaving with debt.

And a lot of the people around Jason Kenney said, you&#39;ve got to run. You&#39;ve got to support basically this philosophy of the UCP. And so sometimes the cause is as simple as that. Sometimes the cause is the people around you and saying, you know, we&#39;re all going to be in this together because we&#39;ve always been in this together.

Problems in communications, problems in politics come from when two people have an entirely different understanding and yet the same end goal.

Maybe it&#39;s going to come in over three months or something like that, right? And you&#39;re spending multiple times money that&#39;s not even in the door yet. And political parties in general tend to have pretty lax financial controls. It&#39;s something political parties need to get way better at, and they&#39;re supposed to be better at it, but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re not very good at it because political parties are built, including leadership campaigns and leadership candidacies, are built to last for like a few months. They&#39;re not these rocks upon which you can build whatever the fuck you want. They are designed to fall to pieces in front of you after 30 days, after 90 days, after 120 days, because any time and money you spend in durability is wasted time and money because the thing doesn&#39;t need to exist the day after the election.</div>

          <div class="said">I know that. That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking the question. And do we need to do politics in this case differently? Because there&#39;s another interesting question that Carter talked about, which is this aspect of the limitations of money. If you&#39;re unpopular, 500 grand can do very little in certain cases to kind of boost that popularity or bridge that popularity towards viability. But talk to me about processes here, Carter. I know we&#39;re getting a bit nerdy on this, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve talked about this before. What would Stephen Carter do on his financial controls process in a leadership race?
