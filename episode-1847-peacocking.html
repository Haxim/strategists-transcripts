            <span class="text">You may not be right. Stephen Carter, one fact, Corey. It&#39;s coming back at 118%, but he&#39;s not wrong about FTX potentially recouping a lot of its investment for its investors. Well, of course, I&#39;m talking about Kevin O&#39;Leary, who is not Stephen Carter.</span>

            <span class="text">I haven&#39;t been traveling. Haven&#39;t been well looking at social media, seeing everything going on, I guess. I guess maybe I was a bit Freudian. What was the... Okay, so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so you guys, or at least one of you, I don&#39;t remember how long ago this was, was telling me that you were wanting to get off social media, but now you&#39;ve added this blue sky to your diet. what&#39;s going on here there&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a lot of questions being asked i mean i think that we have to have uh we have to figure out what&#39;s wrong with us uh we you know we should do this session lying down uh asking questions i&#39;m not sure what happened uh i was happy off twitter i was happy not participating and then cory cory dragged me back in into</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah how how has it been in is it i&#39;m not even is it a replacement is it a left wing uh what is it like what&#39;s going on here well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well i i think that it generally does skew a little bit left because the big surge of blue sky happened when everybody um everybody left x yeah slash twitter after the election right um but that said you know you you get to pick who you&#39;re following and so you can find right right-wing voices if you want. You can create a balanced media diet if that&#39;s your particular thing. It&#39;s not, you know, what&#39;s interesting about it is I have, I don&#39;t know, like 10,000 fewer followers on Blue Sky than I did on Twitter when I left Twitter. But I would say the engagement with like 3,000 followers, less than that, is more than it was on Twitter when I left Twitter. So it feels a little bit like Twitter of old. I think you could make an argument, nobody really needs to go back to 2010 but it it certainly has a bit more of that feel kind of like if you uh you know if you bought an ev early like you couldn&#39;t go to a charging station without the person there trying to talk to you and i was like you don&#39;t see that at a gas station right but it&#39;s the sense you&#39;re like early in and you&#39;re in a community and it&#39;s got a little bit of that zane to answer your question carter</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">carter let&#39;s let&#39;s use cory&#39;s 2010 analogy and let&#39;s talk about politicians who may have had their peak in 2010, but are resurging.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Stephen Carter, the West wants in. That&#39;s our first segment. We&#39;ve got two women I want to discuss from the West, one Danielle Smith and one Christy Clark. Two very different topics, connected-ish.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Where do you want to go first, Carter? Do you want to go Danielle Smith meeting with Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago, or do you want to go Christy Clark not fessing up to the fact that she was a conservative member to vote for Jean Charest. What is more interesting? We will hit both, but I will give you a dealer&#39;s choice. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I am personally very excited about Daniel Smith going to Florida. It&#39;s the same as Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Exact same. Isn&#39;t it, Corey?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think so. I think she did go there to fight for the Boy Scouts, if I remember correctly. Okay,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, let&#39;s talk about this. So in social media posts that initially did not include Daniel Smith&#39;s own post, which it eventually did, it was indicated that Daniel Smith was was that Mar-a-Lago, which was a bit of a surprise picture with Kevin O&#39;Leary, Stephen Carter, Jordan Peterson, and others. I added Stephen Carter as part of the list.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, no, it was in brackets, right? We saw it, yeah. Auto</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Auto-medium, but I needed people to know that in brackets. That could also be you.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And then she posted pictures of her and Donald Trump shaking hands, talking, and had a very long social media post about the type of discussion that she had. Corey, here&#39;s the thing.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Was this good strategy on her part?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">No. You know what? I think that if we would have thought it was good strategy a couple of months ago, what happened with Justin Trudeau&#39;s visit should probably have shaken that out of us, right? The idea that you&#39;re going to go down there and kiss the ring and have any control of the situation afterwards is ridiculous. It&#39;s foolish. And we often talk about these ideas of like, you know, high risk, low reward. This is what I would call high risk, high reward. Like if she somehow came out of it with exempting Canadian oil from any kind of tariffs, that obviously would be pretty meaningful to the province of Alberta. but one of the one of the complications here is even if she does that she&#39;s kind of fucked up things in other ways here too and it is a bit of a small selfish view of canada that we should be on the watch for uh as as the man is actively talking about annexing us and you know i mean that&#39;s probably where to start it&#39;s it&#39;s tough for me as a canadian to swallow her</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">In Mar-a-Lago, like he&#39;s going to go down to do that. So he&#39;s now there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The premier goes down there and meets with Donald Trump, a man who says he wants to economically conquer Canada. And so leaves</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Also, I don&#39;t think that Daniel Smith would take such an approach if say, Justin Trudeau was going to economically conquer Alberta, right? In fact, I can think of a number of situations where Justin Trudeau went far short of that, and that would not have been Danielle Smith&#39;s preferred tactic. I don&#39;t know how a woman who&#39;s made a career of saying, no, Alberta uses strength and does not negotiate with Ottawa says, oh, there&#39;s Donald Trump. We&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;re going to negotiate with him. It just doesn&#39;t actually track for me. and i guess a really long walk here to say she&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">she&#39;s no longer in control of this situation she&#39;s done things that are contradictory to her own message she&#39;s jeopardized the team canada approach i know that everyone around her will pretend she didn&#39;t and say oh this is just the premier working the contacts including like other premiers maybe the prime minister but also she&#39;s one tweet away from disaster we don&#39;t know what donald trump does next but</span>

Your utterly useless government clearly isn&#39;t. Suggesting Daniel Smith is now doing the thing that the Trudeau government can&#39;t. But he did this two months ago. He did this. He was the first guy to do this. He did this in November. And I would argue that it&#39;s quite possible that has precipitated this current moment of Trump&#39;s musings. He goes down, 51st governor jokes become a little more real, a little more real, a little more real. Now he is saying, shouldn&#39;t be a real country, arbitrary border. I mean, frankly, lines that Germany used talking about the Sudetenland, lines that Russia used talking about Ukraine and the Donbass.

I can understand why you would be concerned, but this is the Team Canada approach. This is what we&#39;ve talked about as First Ministers, including the Prime Minister. We will all work our contacts to, you know, advance the conversation through our particular channels. Justin Trudeau himself said that, right?

And yes, I understand that sometimes he can be a mercurial fellow, but we&#39;re not going to solve this problem by burying our head in the sand.

Oh, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, Quebec. But we&#39;re just as bad. We&#39;re out there doing, you know, spending all the money. We&#39;re flashing around our oil money and buying doctors and buying nurses. And now we&#39;re down in Mar-a-Lago trying to buy our way out of a trade embargo, our trade sanctions. This is ridiculous. If I was one of the other premiers, it doesn&#39;t matter if I share the word conservative in the title, I&#39;d be absolutely furious. You cannot put the needs of one province ahead of the Confederation. And Danielle Smith is doing that. She is desperately, desperately trying to keep oil out of this trade sanction.

            <span class="text">I&#39;m shocked. Well, talk to me about that, both in terms of where the NDP should be on this, but also in your mind, but also what this means for Smith. because there&#39;s many Albertans, I&#39;m not saying a majority, but we&#39;ve talked about this many times on this show, that there&#39;s many Albertans who pretty much care about the oil and gas issue, and that&#39;s it. And that might be a limited sort of worldview. But she&#39;ll look like a legend to them. And what does that kind of mean for the politics in this province?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, of course, she&#39;s going to look like a fucking legend if she continues to go unchallenged on this, as she has been for the past month by the official opposition here. This is incredibly frustrating to me for a couple of reasons. But let me throw a couple on the table right now. There seems to be this sense that you are only subject to the weather if you&#39;re the Alberta NDP. You&#39;re sitting there and saying, is this an issue? Oh, right now the premier looks pretty good on it. I guess I&#39;m not going to swing on it. You&#39;ve got to make a fucking, you make the swing. You make the weather. You&#39;re the official opposition. You got to go out there and you signal to all of your allies and all of your partners, whether official or not, that this is an issue you&#39;re going to stand on. This is an issue you&#39;re going to fight on. If you don&#39;t do that, of course they&#39;re going to fucking win on it. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy if you&#39;re not willing to stand up and say something. And frankly, if they had stood up and said something two weeks ago and created a little bit of pressure on the premier not to go to the inauguration, I seriously doubt the premier would have gone to Mar-a-Lago, right? So here we are because we have an opposition that&#39;s decided to hold their fire until way too fucking late, frankly. The second problem they have is that in politics, things drift towards 50-50. And in December, we know on this issue of Canada and the United States, I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re going to get there overnight. I just want to say that before I even say that. But we know 80% of Albertans want to be Canadians. 20%, they&#39;re willing to entertain this US offer, right? How</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">How often are you handed an 80-20 issue in politics? Like, holy fuck, people. You know, there&#39;s one thing to say, we want to have a message track, we want to drive a message, we want to drive a conversation. But when someone offers you a boatload of cotton candy, you don&#39;t say no, right? You go and you say, okay, well, this is a great issue for us to move on. And again, that&#39;s going to be diminishing. And if you don&#39;t fight for it, it&#39;s going to get down to a 50-50 issue faster rather than later. You got to fucking stand up and you got to say something. And then, I mean, I guess the final point here is, do you stand for nothing?</span>

And if you end up being one of the four active liberals in Grand Prairie, then you&#39;re Christy Clark, you pick up the phone and you call those four active liberals and you try to turn one of them into an activist for you. You arm them with how they can sign up in a hurry, 20, 30 members out of their neighbors, give them ways they can walk through it and think about who might be available to become registered. And then there you go. Fuck, there&#39;s 100 points for you. Congratulations. The race goes on. Or maybe maybe not a hundred, but 70 of the hundred. That&#39;s incredible. Like you&#39;re doing great work. And so the work of the next couple of weeks will be how do you optimize your leader&#39;s time and how do you optimize your caller&#39;s time? And all of this is going to push people towards areas where the liberals are not particularly strong because it&#39;s less effort per point. And that&#39;s the way everybody&#39;s going to be thinking about this. What is the effort per point over the next bit?

Yeah, I mean, so I think that&#39;s super smart because you still have people on the ground who are going to have the jam that they&#39;re going to get people out to those coffee shops and identify it. But then you are going to find them and you&#39;re going to make sure that those follow-up calls are happening from the candidate or from the candidate&#39;s inner circle, whatever needs to occur in order to kind of lock up the sale and then push the further registrations or the further conversions as necessary here.

            <span class="text">the good campaigns are going to look like bad campaigns and vice versa, right? Because the people who are investing in that peacocking, as you say, that&#39;s – peacocking is a great metaphor because peacocks have these big feathers because they&#39;re an ostentatious show of wasting energy, you know? They are. They&#39;re saying, I am so healthy, I&#39;ve got extra energy to burn on this, right? That&#39;s really dangerous if you actually don&#39;t have that energy to burn. And it&#39;s really fascinating, because we&#39;ll have to see how the dynamic unfolds with the existing supporters and the kind of the core liberal base that&#39;s there, because they might expect and want that Peacock. this is i&#39;m</span>

Well, so again, I&#39;m going to go back to that campaign because I think it might be more illustrative than people will want in this particular matter. But one of the things we did as Dave Taylor&#39;s campaign is we had this big, super long and elaborate thought piece about all of the changes that were going to be done to the party. We were by far the most polished of it. We definitely tried to show... Our whole strategy was we&#39;re going to show what a winning campaign looks like, and they&#39;re going to say, that&#39;s a winning campaign. That&#39;s going to take on the PCs. That&#39;s what we want. Yes,</span>

            <span class="text">Well, what&#39;s also interesting, Carter, to get your reaction to this is that part of it could be seductive, but the other part, you can argue to yourself is strategic, because in mere minutes, we&#39;re going to have to fight a general election. So might as well get started on that and flex some of those skills. Can Mark Carney fucking debate? Can Christy Clark have command of French? These are just throwing examples out there, right? Like, well, if we don&#39;t test some of those peacocking things in this race, even though that&#39;s not strategic, in mere minutes, we&#39;re going to have a general election against Pierre Polyev, and then all of a sudden you realize, oh, shit, this guy was really good at making phone calls from a cubicle and not necessarily having the political campaign no and i mean you&#39;re totally right you&#39;re totally right don&#39;t have any time to get to know that like literally we might have days carter yeah</span>

We&#39;re actually going to keep open minds and look at who can best win the election. I doubt that&#39;s 100% true. Are they going to say, well, we&#39;re going to do the classic signup thing? Because if that&#39;s the case, then that&#39;s going to push you to a different strategy. I don&#39;t know. I mean, nobody has done this before, right? And so I guess as much as we&#39;ve made statements about what should be right now, I guess that the major, major advice maybe to wrap on here is people are going to need to be fucking alive to a situation that is very different and not actually just rely on how they did things in the past. They&#39;re going to need to really invest in data. They&#39;re going to need to be really thoughtful.

And, you know, on the flip side, I know that – I know Christy Clark&#39;s trying hard to court Melanie Jolie. jolie but like if you are somebody like a melanie jolie or a champagne and you endorse a christy clark you might immediately be the number two in the party so you know don&#39;t count never count quebec out like quebec politicians quebecers are so good at making themselves relevant to a contest but um you know i do</span>
