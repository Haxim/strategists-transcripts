        <p>The gang assess the strategic pros and cons of Danielle Smith's visit to Mar-a-Lago, and whether it's consistent with a "Team Canada" approach before turning to the Liberal leadership race - Christy Clark's membership gaffe, the lack of launches to date, and just how different such a short leadership campaign will be.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Danielle Smith meeting Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the first days of the Liberal Party of Canada leadership campaign. Is it good for Smith that she got a meeting with Trump - or bad for Canada? Why are the Liberal leadership hopefuls waiting to launch their campaigns when there's such a compressed time frame? And should Zain and Corey have pushed Stephen to name two more names? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

          </div>
          <div class="said">well i i think that it generally does skew a little bit left because the big surge of blue sky happened when everybody um everybody left x yeah slash twitter after the election right um but that said you know you you get to pick who you&#39;re following and so you can find right right-wing voices if you want. You can create a balanced media diet if that&#39;s your particular thing. It&#39;s not, you know, what&#39;s interesting about it is I have, I don&#39;t know, like 10,000 fewer followers on Blue Sky than I did on Twitter when I left Twitter. But I would say the engagement with like 3,000 followers, less than that, is more than it was on Twitter when I left Twitter. So it feels a little bit like Twitter of old. I think you could make an argument, nobody really needs to go back to 2010 but it it certainly has a bit more of that feel kind of like if you uh you know if you bought an ev early like you couldn&#39;t go to a charging station without the person there trying to talk to you and i was like you don&#39;t see that at a gas station right but it&#39;s the sense you&#39;re like early in and you&#39;re in a community and it&#39;s got a little bit of that zane to answer your question carter</div>

          <div class="said">No. You know what? I think that if we would have thought it was good strategy a couple of months ago, what happened with Justin Trudeau&#39;s visit should probably have shaken that out of us, right? The idea that you&#39;re going to go down there and kiss the ring and have any control of the situation afterwards is ridiculous. It&#39;s foolish. And we often talk about these ideas of like, you know, high risk, low reward. This is what I would call high risk, high reward. Like if she somehow came out of it with exempting Canadian oil from any kind of tariffs, that obviously would be pretty meaningful to the province of Alberta. but one of the one of the complications here is even if she does that she&#39;s kind of fucked up things in other ways here too and it is a bit of a small selfish view of canada that we should be on the watch for uh as as the man is actively talking about annexing us and you know i mean that&#39;s probably where to start it&#39;s it&#39;s tough for me as a canadian to swallow her</div>

Your utterly useless government clearly isn&#39;t. Suggesting Daniel Smith is now doing the thing that the Trudeau government can&#39;t. But he did this two months ago. He did this. He was the first guy to do this. He did this in November. And I would argue that it&#39;s quite possible that has precipitated this current moment of Trump&#39;s musings. He goes down, 51st governor jokes become a little more real, a little more real, a little more real. Now he is saying, shouldn&#39;t be a real country, arbitrary border. I mean, frankly, lines that Germany used talking about the Sudetenland, lines that Russia used talking about Ukraine and the Donbass.

And that might be a limited sort of worldview. But she&#39;ll look like a legend to them. And what does that kind of mean for the politics in this province?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, of course, she&#39;s going to look like a fucking legend if she continues to go unchallenged on this, as she has been for the past month by the official opposition here. This is incredibly frustrating to me for a couple of reasons. But let me throw a couple on the table right now. There seems to be this sense that you are only subject to the weather if you&#39;re the Alberta NDP. You&#39;re sitting there and saying, is this an issue? Oh, right now the premier looks pretty good on it. I guess I&#39;m not going to swing on it. You&#39;ve got to make a fucking, you make the swing. You make the weather. You&#39;re the official opposition. You got to go out there and you signal to all of your allies and all of your partners, whether official or not, that this is an issue you&#39;re going to stand on. This is an issue you&#39;re going to fight on. If you don&#39;t do that, of course they&#39;re going to fucking win on it. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy if you&#39;re not willing to stand up and say something. And frankly, if they had stood up and said something two weeks ago and created a little bit of pressure on the premier not to go to the inauguration, I seriously doubt the premier would have gone to Mar-a-Lago, right? So here we are because we have an opposition that&#39;s decided to hold their fire until way too fucking late, frankly. The second problem they have is that in politics, things drift towards 50-50. And in December, we know on this issue of Canada and the United States, I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re going to get there overnight. I just want to say that before I even say that. But we know 80% of Albertans want to be Canadians. 20%, they&#39;re willing to entertain this US offer, right? How</div>

          <div class="said">How often are you handed an 80-20 issue in politics? Like, holy fuck, people. You know, there&#39;s one thing to say, we want to have a message track, we want to drive a message, we want to drive a conversation. But when someone offers you a boatload of cotton candy, you don&#39;t say no, right? You go and you say, okay, well, this is a great issue for us to move on. And again, that&#39;s going to be diminishing. And if you don&#39;t fight for it, it&#39;s going to get down to a 50-50 issue faster rather than later. You got to fucking stand up and you got to say something. And then, I mean, I guess the final point here is, do you stand for nothing?</div>

You arm them with how they can sign up in a hurry, 20, 30 members out of their neighbors, give them ways they can walk through it and think about who might be available to become registered.

And so then I tried to apply this to a party that had a much smaller membership base. And, you know, we were doing things that were, you know, I would argue, actually quite ahead of our time. We were doing innovative, custom mailouts, where based on what we knew about you, you&#39;re getting like totally different bundles of why you should vote for the guy. We were identifying all of these like, you know, caucus support, you know, we were doing everything that you&#39;re supposed to do. And then we lost because you know what happened?

We were by far the most polished of it. We definitely tried to show... Our whole strategy was we&#39;re going to show what a winning campaign looks like, and they&#39;re going to say, that&#39;s a winning campaign. That&#39;s going to take on the PCs.

So might as well get started on that and flex some of those skills. Can Mark Carney fucking debate? Can Christy Clark have command of French? These are just throwing examples out there, right? Like, well, if we don&#39;t test some of those peacocking things in this race, even though that&#39;s not strategic, in mere minutes, we&#39;re going to have a general election against Pierre Polyev, and then all of a sudden you realize, oh, shit, this guy was really good at making phone calls from a cubicle and not necessarily having the political campaign no and i mean you&#39;re totally right you&#39;re totally right don&#39;t have any time to get to know that like literally we might have days carter yeah</div>

And so I guess as much as we&#39;ve made statements about what should be right now, I guess that the major, major advice maybe to wrap on here is people are going to need to be fucking alive to a situation that is very different and not actually just rely on how they did things in the past. They&#39;re going to need to really invest in data. They&#39;re going to need to be really thoughtful.
