Like, the thing for me was always, yes, I have no doubt that there was a campaign advantage. I have no doubt that he wanted people to help support his campaign. But I also don&#39;t have any personal doubt that he wouldn&#39;t have been doing catch and kill and trying to control his reputation, even if he wasn&#39;t a candidate. And it just, it didn&#39;t seem like the thing he should go down by. You know, the Al Capone analogy, I think is apt, right? Al Capone was a murderer. And he went to jail for 11 years for tax evasion, or he was sentenced for 11 years. He got let out because he had untreated syphilis, that part&#39;s real.

And one of my big, big concerns, Stephen, and we talked about this, I think on the pod, but definitely off the air, is that it would just sort of reinforce the people who are already with Donald Trump saying like, oh, here we fucking go. Like, they have used the law, they have found a way to wedge it against him. This is like a novel application of, because in New York, it&#39;s only a felony if it&#39;s in service of another crime.

            <div class="said">um yeah but i think the man if he got got sentenced to 120 plus that&#39;d be amazing that&#39;d be amazing yeah that&#39;d be great um i mean i don&#39;t know if it&#39;d be great it would it would be something i think there&#39;s two things though politically i want to mention though number one korey&#39;s absolutely right as it relates to donald trump using this outlaw image he already has the mugshot is already being distributed prior to this uh uh you know um charge uh 34 time charge coming out uh today the the mugshot&#39;s already being being memefied in a way that is not being used by Democrats, but indeed by MAGA to support his fundraising and to support and galvanize his base. And that is only going to have an opportunity to continue. Secondly, and I think this might be the bigger political point from my perspective, and it&#39;s not about Donald Trump, it&#39;s about Joe Biden, is that this thing is, election is headed to a referendum on Joe Biden in its current trajectory. And the Biden camp cannot allow allow something like this, a 34 time felony charge to just speak by itself, which is one of the reasons I was actually a big fan of Robert De Niro the other day, as part of a campaign construct showing up to the trial and being like, you fucking and yes, he got into a fights with with mega and all that sort of stuff. And it became a bit of a sideshow. But it to me, it shows some effort on the part of the Democrats to kind of just be like, fuck it, we actually will need to explain to people why this matters versus just being like look right here 34 time you know 34 felony charges guys like isn&#39;t it obvious and the answer that they should be receiving after multiple times of trying isn&#39;t it obvious is it&#39;s fucking not obvious and tell a story around it and the person who tells an incredible story around it is donald trump he told the best version of the story today was it sloppy and sounded like a fourth grader absolutely but rigged corrupt soros back da and a judge who was not fit to preside in a jurisdiction in which we had 5%. Fuck, man, I just consumed all of that very quickly, because it&#39;s super easy to understand. And frankly, to the layperson, and of course, to his base, quite persuasive, if I will say. So, you know, at the end of the day, the Biden team has to do quite a bit of storytelling and narrative constructing beyond saying, isn&#39;t it fucking obvious that this guy can&#39;t fit to lead? He&#39;s a 34 time felon. The answer that the American public through poll poll after poll after poll is telling them is, no, it isn&#39;t because your guy is fucking old. And that&#39;s not fair, but that&#39;s life and that&#39;s politics right now.</div>

And it&#39;s in his, yeah, they need to talk about something, they need something, you know, and right now, this election is turning out to be a referendum on Biden, and more specifically his age. So like, you know, it can&#39;t just be like, great, they&#39;re ours, they need something to magnetize them over. And I don&#39;t mind the broader sort of democracy construct that they&#39;re trying to use, or the women&#39;s rights construct that they&#39;re trying to But we might see a very interesting tact by the Biden campaign, especially as they use advertising, especially as they try to target different states with topics that they haven&#39;t covered yet, if they have deep found insights that they&#39;re trying to create what would arguably be a multi-million, if not hundreds of millions of dollars targeting this small 7% of Trump voters in swing states and trying to bring them over to Biden. This is the type of hand-to-hand combat that we may not have seen on a presidential level so explicitly that is going to have to play out, ironically, over airwaves and advertising around multiple issues, depending on the diversity and the texture of this group and how deep the Biden research goes. But regardless, you know, they have an uphill battle here because this is already molding and hardening into a referendum on Biden without them necessarily having any sort of defense or immunity for it, despite the fact that there&#39;s three other indictments on the table against Donald Trump. This is just one of them that has come back with a guilty verdict.</div>

But now it&#39;s just not Donald Trump. Now it&#39;s 34 times convicted, felon Donald Trump. And I think that, you know, at the very least, that line needs to get trotted out and worked through.
