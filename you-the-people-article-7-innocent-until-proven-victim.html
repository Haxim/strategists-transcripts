            <span class="text">On October 17th, 1931, an American entrepreneur that led an entertainment and security conglomerate was found guilty of tax evasion. But you see, Al Capone wasn&#39;t just an entrepreneur. It turns out he was also a criminal and a mob boss. He died in Florida from complications due to syphilis. And that is where the similarities between Al Capone and Donald Trump, present and future, end. Because you see, Donald Trump was president of the United States. Donald Trump was facing his his own set of yes, you&#39;re guilty of that, but not the thing you should really be going down for charges. The man who followed up a career of lying and not paying bills with a second career of preying on people&#39;s anxieties, abuse of power, obstruction of Congress, attempting to overthrow American democracy, and stealing</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">stealing classified documents was also, it seems in the course of that, falsifying business records. And in New York on Thursday, May 30th, a jury of his peers found him guilty.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">For you see, there&#39;s one other difference between Al Capone and Donald Trump. Al Capone isn&#39;t the current frontrunner to be president. Al Capone didn&#39;t have an allegedly serious group of people take to the airwaves to defend him and say that his conviction marked nothing less than the end of rule of law.</span>

            <span class="text">Donald Trump still gets closer every day to proving that his supporters would stay with him if he shot somebody on Fifth Avenue, and Al Capone would be mighty impressed by that. That&#39;s America right now.</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s not really why he should be going to jail, right? It&#39;s a rule. He broke the rule. But it seems like a bit of a stretch. Like, the thing for me was always, yes, I have no doubt that there was a campaign advantage. I have no doubt that he wanted people to help support his campaign. But I also don&#39;t have any personal doubt that he wouldn&#39;t have been doing catch and kill and trying to control his reputation, even if he wasn&#39;t a candidate. And it just, it didn&#39;t seem like the thing he should go down by. You know, the Al Capone analogy, I think is apt, right? Al Capone was a murderer. And he went to jail for 11 years for tax evasion, or he was sentenced for 11 years. He got let out because he had untreated syphilis, that part&#39;s real. And, you know, and he ultimately died in Florida. And</span>

And one of my big, big concerns, Stephen, and we talked about this, I think on the pod, but definitely off the air, is that it would just sort of reinforce the people who are already with Donald Trump saying like, oh, here we fucking go. Like, they have used the law, they have found a way to wedge it against him. This is like a novel application of, because in New York, it&#39;s only a felony if it&#39;s in service of another crime.

And that is only going to have an opportunity to continue. Secondly, and I think this might be the bigger political point from my perspective, and it&#39;s not about Donald Trump, it&#39;s about Joe Biden, is that this thing is, election is headed to a referendum on Joe Biden in its current trajectory. And the Biden camp cannot allow allow something like this, a 34 time felony charge to just speak by itself, which is one of the reasons I was actually a big fan of Robert De Niro the other day, as part of a campaign construct showing up to the trial and being like, you fucking and yes, he got into a fights with with mega and all that sort of stuff. And it became a bit of a sideshow. But it to me, it shows some effort on the part of the Democrats to kind of just be like, fuck it, we actually will need to explain to people why this matters versus just being like look right here 34 time you know 34 felony charges guys like isn&#39;t it obvious and the answer that they should be receiving after multiple times of trying isn&#39;t it obvious is it&#39;s fucking not obvious and tell a story around it and the person who tells an incredible story around it is donald trump he told the best version of the story today was it sloppy and sounded like a fourth grader absolutely but rigged corrupt soros back da and a judge who was not fit to preside in a jurisdiction in which we had 5%. Fuck, man, I just consumed all of that very quickly, because it&#39;s super easy to understand. And frankly, to the layperson, and of course, to his base, quite persuasive, if I will say. So, you know, at the end of the day, the Biden team has to do quite a bit of storytelling and narrative constructing beyond saying, isn&#39;t it fucking obvious that this guy can&#39;t fit to lead? He&#39;s a 34 time felon. The answer that the American public through poll poll after poll after poll is telling them is, no, it isn&#39;t because your guy is fucking old. And that&#39;s not fair, but that&#39;s life and that&#39;s politics right now.</span>

So like, you know, it can&#39;t just be like, great, they&#39;re ours, they need something to magnetize them over. And I don&#39;t mind the broader sort of democracy construct that they&#39;re trying to use, or the women&#39;s rights construct that they&#39;re trying to But we might see a very interesting tact by the Biden campaign, especially as they use advertising, especially as they try to target different states with topics that they haven&#39;t covered yet, if they have deep found insights that they&#39;re trying to create what would arguably be a multi-million, if not hundreds of millions of dollars targeting this small 7% of Trump voters in swing states and trying to bring them over to Biden. This is the type of hand-to-hand combat that we may not have seen on a presidential level so explicitly that is going to have to play out, ironically, over airwaves and advertising around multiple issues, depending on the diversity and the texture of this group and how deep the Biden research goes. But regardless, you know, they have an uphill battle here because this is already molding and hardening into a referendum on Biden without them necessarily having any sort of defense or immunity for it, despite the fact that there&#39;s three other indictments on the table against Donald Trump. This is just one of them that has come back with a guilty verdict.</span>

Your recent campaign for Mayor Jyoti Gondek was a historic and come-from-behind victory against Jeremy Farkas. uh well documented even a podcast done on a different podcast about uh how you were able to win that carter uh what would you say to your own question well</span>

But now it&#39;s just not Donald Trump. Now it&#39;s 34 times convicted, felon Donald Trump. And I think that, you know, at the very least, that line needs to get trotted out and worked through. Right now, of course, the president of the United States has not weighed in on any of Donald Trump&#39;s problems. And I think that that&#39;s been a mistake. I think that this is the opportunity for them to actually weigh in and start talking about donald trump the felon uh versus you know keep in mind that donald trump the groper had legs had had so many legs that he actually had to uh commit election fraud so that the rest of the story didn&#39;t come out this is</span>

You know, there are a group of people, a small group of people who are going to jump in and say, you know what, that is okay. It&#39;s okay. We like him as a bad man. But I don&#39;t think that 50% of the population is going to vote for him because he&#39;s a good, you know, because he&#39;s an asshole. There&#39;s a small segment that like him as an asshole. The rest of them are going to see him as a convicted felon who may or may not even have had to go to jail prior to this election. I mean, that&#39;s the way this is going to work after July the 11th. I disagree with your assessment to Zane on the assessment around July 11th. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to get pushed. I think the motherfucker is going to be fucking sentenced on July the 11th.

So I agree on that side of things. I just think it needs to be more than, look, he&#39;s guilty. It needs to be, how the fuck does this matter to you, small percentage of people who have a chance to come over to us because our guy is fucking old and you also don&#39;t like him?
