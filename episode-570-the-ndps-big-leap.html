            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s true well we&#39;ve got some legitimate stuff to talk about with the ndp convention this weekend is that what you&#39;re fired up about cory is that fair to say or is it the the Warriors&#39; 73-win season on the verge.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">verge. The Warriors have taken this to the most dramatic point they can. They are going to get the 73rd win as the literal last game of the season. So this is not only the last game of the regular season in the NBA, but it&#39;s like the latest. It&#39;s the late game. This is so exciting. Like literally the last game played this year. Oh, it&#39;s incredible. You know what? And you contrast that with the Sixers who let go of Hinckley. The process is dead. Hey, guys, speaking of the process being dead, Tom Mulcair. Oh, yes.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yes. Great. Let&#39;s just talk about it. the leap to the front cory that&#39;s a segment i just made it up on the spot i&#39;ve got literally zero questions written this is an emergency episode because of your ranting and raving in the car you&#39;re all the way here your lack</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">planning is not that&#39;s fine i&#39;m understanding now</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">now why this was billed as an emergency it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s gonna go just as fine it&#39;s gonna go just as fine talk to me about this first of all let&#39;s just give everyone a synopsis of what happened over the weekend for those who were not glued to twitter i know you were over this convention Give us a synopsis of what was expected going in and what ultimately happened this weekend in Edmonton when the NDP met. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that expectations going into a convention are always a bit of a fool&#39;s game because those in the know don&#39;t know, right? I think the problem is we assume that everybody is going to be bringing into it the same sensitivities</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sensitivities and sentimentalities and concerns and thoughts about the future that strategists do. But the reality is when the rank and file get together, crazy</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">crazy beget crazy and things get a little out of control. And by rank</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">rank and file, you mean effectively the membership of this party? Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, no, I don&#39;t mean the membership. I mean the next level up. I mean the people who would actually go and be delegates at a convention during an off year after they lost an election are at 12% in the polls, right? That&#39;s a particular type of person.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">person. That&#39;s always a particular type of member. Yeah, it&#39;s very different than your average person. I mean an average person just does not go to a political convention. Average person may get sold a membership through the course of a year. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Right? For a leadership or for some sort of candidate selection or whatever. But</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But to go to a convention for a political party requires a certain level of insanity that very, very few people possess in the general public. An average</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">average person does not fly across the country to go to a convention. On</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">On their own time to go to effectively cast a vote or a couple of votes.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">votes. A couple of – a lot of votes. Yeah. They were a lot of things. A few big ones. And obviously the big ones we&#39;re going to be talking about are the Leap Manifesto Resolution and the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the Leadership Review of Tom Mulcair. Certainly.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Certainly. So is it fair to say, before we move forward, Corey, that what I&#39;m hearing you say, was there a self-selection bias in terms of who was present in Edmonton this weekend? There</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">remember when I was executive director of the Alberta Liberal Party, there was a resolution known as the cooperation resolution, which was that the party should cooperate with other progressive parties. And I remember looking at it as part of the review of policies going in because you aggregate them, you combine them, you do all of those things, make sure they&#39;re not duplicates. And there was discussion around the table on a lot of policies, a lot of in-depth being like, where should this go in the order? How should this be set up? How can we merge it with these other ones? Are these similar?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">This resolution came up, we should cooperate with other progressive parties. And I remember everyone around the table was like, oh, that&#39;s going nowhere. And we just moved on. And of course, for those of you familiar with the Alberta Liberal Party&#39;s history, all three of you who</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">who are left, I think, that resolution passed and it just shocked the hell out of everybody and by a lot. My point is simply, it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s tough to read what the delegation is going to do. They are a Roman mob in all parties. They are whipped up by one speech and then whipped the other way by the next speech. and uh yes there is also the fact that they are a certain type of party member who would go and spend their weekend to a convention particularly a convention after you lost which brings</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a different group still you know the people who are angry about the loss are more likely to show up there&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there&#39;s a group of politicians and uh political supporters in all parties who are not fair weather but they&#39;re like i&#39;m not going to go to a giant downer and i&#39;m not going to subject myself to that right because i&#39;m closer to being a normal human being than these so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">so i think the point here and thanks for that that synopsis cory this is a sub segment of a sub segment that was present here in edmonton well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you want to caveat that or let&#39;s not no i want to do the opposite let&#39;s not minimize it okay because i think there is actually something that says about the ndp that we need to talk about okay</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay so let&#39;s get right into that and let&#39;s start it through the first part of it which and i want to break this down into three separate parts the first one let&#39;s talk about the leap Leap Manifesto, the vote on that. This was something that was introduced during the election, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Is that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it came out during the election.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And it found legs to stand and make itself a big deal this weekend in Edmonton. Corey, do you want to give us a quick primer on that? And I&#39;ll go to you, Carter. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know. Give</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Give us a primer on what the Leap Manifesto is, and then we&#39;ll have a conversation about</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">about it. People are going to immediately disagree with me. But fundamentally, the Leap Manifesto is about a dramatic overhaul of our economy and And of our social system to address the challenges of climate change. And it&#39;s about taking that leap. And the long and the short of it is, and what everybody knows about it is, that means eliminating the use of, you know, reducing our carbon, eliminating the use of fossil fuels. They want to eliminate the use of fossil fuels entirely by 2050. Now,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">another thing everybody knows about it after this weekend is it means no more pipelines being built. So, infrastructure for oil is specifically called out as something not to be built in the Leap Manifesto. right what</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">what people are less aware of are some of the other components such as the nationalization of the energy sector energy controlled instead of you know money-hungry corporations or whatever words they use there but by the people i always by the way as an aside think it&#39;s hilarious that corporations can be attributed with like you know greediness and grubbiness but never the people right who have never acted in a right fashion and then greedy</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and then also there is some talk about about trade deals, about regulation. It is radical. It is very dramatic, but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but it&#39;s not precise. But also not officially</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

I hope that goes without saying, which are how should we address the problem of resources, which are huge jobs for labor. We&#39;re not just talking about oil and gas, by the way. We&#39;re talking about forestry. We are talking about infrastructure, you know, building, the building trades in general. And then we have environmental concerns. Sincere though they may be, largely removed from the working class realities that have traditionally been the NDP bread and butter. Interesting.</span>
