          <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the death of RBG, get subjected to the infamous political strategy session and then begin a discussion on Alberta's Premier. Will pushing through a Supreme Court nominee backfire on Trump? What is the strategy behind floating cuts to supports for the severely handicapped? And most importantly did Stephen Carter start the petition to remove Matt Wolf from office? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

But let&#39;s talk about, you know, what has now become the story of her death, which is what will happen going forward. So, Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you with the simplest of questions. Does her passing away have the potential to change this election? and if so, how?</div>

            <div class="said">this could really polarize and push the Republicans. The Republicans have made pro-life issues their central thesis of elections for probably coming on 40 years now, right? Where the issue of abortion is at the forefront forefront of their political identity. So they have been able to take election after election after election and say, if you want this judge, you&#39;ve got to make sure that you elect the Republicans. And what I&#39;m finding fascinating is that they&#39;re walking away from the strategy. You know, you&#39;ve got 40 some days left, you&#39;re able to dig in and make this all about appointing the next judge. And instead, they&#39;re going to ram the next judge in, which gives them an unassailable majority if they&#39;re successful. I&#39;m surprised by that strategy, because I thought that they would have been in a more comfortable place to try and actually win the Senate. This feels like they&#39;re on some fronts kind of conceding the Senate. They know they&#39;re going to lose. The only way they&#39;re going to get this justice is to push really hard and take Trump&#39;s appointment and just ram right through the process in the exact opposite manner than they did in 2015 with Merrick Garland.</div>

Do you see any advantage in potentially doing that? Of course, you having no powers to, you know, get that nominee through, but to almost dangle to the public that, you know, you&#39;ve got this choice and you&#39;ve got this choice.

We talked about the playbook of the past, that you could have really seen a fiery legislator with the experience that Mulcair had could have been a really interesting foil for Trudeau in that 19 election.

Guys, I want to now take a, not a bit of a deep dive, but a cursory start to a conversation I perhaps want to extend over a couple of episodes, which is to our listenership, providing some ideas and knowledge as to... Are we doing story arcs now? Like, what&#39;s going on? We are doing story arcs. And this is part one of a story arc using some of the situations that we&#39;re seeing this week in our home province of Alberta, and perhaps giving people a better sense of who Jason Kenney really is, you know, an interesting political figure in our country who&#39;s been on the federal side of things, but often compared to what I think and we&#39;ve discussed as misnomers, right? Donald Trump, Doug Ford, is he any of those things? Is he his own thing? And I think I want to start discussing that a little bit, especially with what we&#39;ve seen here in Alberta this week around Aish, around him going to Ottawa, around the rejuvenation of Fair Deal. So perhaps, Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. The comparison that&#39;s made about Chase and Kenny is the comparison to Trump or to Ford. Are either of those two accurate? Let&#39;s start here.</div>

You know, of course, Alberta going through hard times, everyone acknowledging that Kenny telegraphing, obviously, and for a long time that he&#39;s going to look at everything.

I don&#39;t know how he&#39;s been the last six months. Stephen, hold your thoughts. He&#39;s a very competent individual. He&#39;s also not such a bad guy, right? You know this caricature of Matt Wolfe. His job is not to tweet. Can we just start there? His job is not to tweet. You see his tweets. You think that&#39;s his job. That is not his job. Nobody works harder in any government of any stripe than the director of issues management. I swear to God that is the case. They are the first people in the office. They have read all of the news, and they&#39;ve come up with all of their rejoinders before 7 a.m., and then they are the last one to leave the office. They&#39;re a personality type,</div>

They both are workaholics, very funny, very tough, and they are very smart. So let me just start there. His job is not to tweet.
