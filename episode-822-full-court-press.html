Obviously, Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#39;s death is rattling us all. Aaron O&#39;Toole, positive for COVID. But, you know, of all of the bullshit we&#39;ve had to put up with for the past two days, I think the bullshittiest by far is when Pauly Lego said that the Hurley Burley was the best political podcast.

            <span class="text">cory i&#39;m not confusing anything we&#39;ve got a multi-front war we are fighting i don&#39;t think you understand how quickly you need to pivot the opponent uh you just don&#39;t understand okay let&#39;s take this let&#39;s take this energy into our first segment notorious indeed guys i want to talk about a massive, obviously, political development in the United States with the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. But let&#39;s talk about, you know, what has now become the story of her death, which is what will happen going forward. So, Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you with the simplest of questions. Does her passing away have the potential to change this election? and if so, how?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I do think it changes the election. I mean, I think that there&#39;s a couple of</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">ways of looking at this, and I haven&#39;t quite decided which way I&#39;m coming down on yet, because there&#39;s many different fronts, right? So you&#39;ve got, this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this could really polarize and push the Republicans. The Republicans have made pro-life issues their central thesis of elections for probably coming on 40 years now, right? Where the issue of abortion is at the forefront forefront of their political identity. So they have been able to take election after election after election and say, if you want this judge, you&#39;ve got to make sure that you elect the Republicans. And what I&#39;m finding fascinating is that they&#39;re walking away from the strategy. You know, you&#39;ve got 40 some days left, you&#39;re able to dig in and make this all about appointing the next judge. And instead, they&#39;re going to ram the next judge in, which gives them an unassailable majority if they&#39;re successful. I&#39;m surprised by that strategy, because I thought that they would have been in a more comfortable place to try and actually win the Senate. This feels like they&#39;re on some fronts kind of conceding the Senate. They know they&#39;re going to lose. The only way they&#39;re going to get this justice is to push really hard and take Trump&#39;s appointment and just ram right through the process in the exact opposite manner than they did in 2015 with Merrick Garland.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, do you see it the same as Carter? Do you feel like that this is the Republicans in some way conceding the Senate?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Not really, no. I think they are certainly live to the possibility that they could lose this Senate seat. But in many ways, this is gilding the lily. They already have a</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a 5-4 majority conservatives to liberals on the Supreme Court. Moving it to 6-3 does, to Carter&#39;s point, make it unassailable,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">unassailable, in a sense. We are seeing that Chief Justice Roberts is being much more of a swing vote than I think the Conservatives had hoped for. But they already have a majority on the court. It&#39;s not as though the court has been hard</span>

            <span class="text">Sticking with you, Corey, were you surprised to see, I guess, two big Senate figures for the Republicans, McConnell and then Graham? McConnell in his take of, you know, retracting what he ultimately said in 2016 and Graham multiple times saying, use my words against me if you need to. Were you surprised that both those senators, up for re-election, yet still solidly wanting to force Donald Trump and agree with Donald Trump to confirm someone immediately? immediately</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">no actually i think it makes perfect sense because the last thing they want is those words and uh well you know mcconnell didn&#39;t necessarily have words but he has the decision they didn&#39;t want that looming out there with a will they won&#39;t they and donald trump the craziest man in washington being able to lose</span>

            <span class="text">lose their lose his mind about them and have this major distraction so i&#39;m sure mcconnell made the calculation and i&#39;m sure by the way people had an inkling this was going to be the case that ruth bader ginsburg was going to die because</span>

            <span class="text">you know those things things don&#39;t tend to, you know, DC is a small town. These things leak out, right? I&#39;m sure they thought about it. I&#39;m sure they knew they would immediately say this was going to be the case. I&#39;m sure Lindsey Graham came out and immediately said he would support that because he didn&#39;t necessarily want people calling into question his vote and putting that additional pressure on him. So in many ways, it was the smart tactical move for them because, well, I mean, it was ghastly. It literally, in O&#39;Connell&#39;s remarks about her death, RBG&#39;s death, he&#39;s talking about bringing it for the nominee. But it&#39;s, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I don&#39;t think that you should allow a vote. And they certainly didn&#39;t want to have before McConnell came out and said, this vote&#39;s going to effing happen microphones put in front of every Republican senator asking would they or won&#39;t they? Because it only takes four. Yeah,</span>

He is absolutely prepared to use the Senate and wield the power that he has had. And he is a political animal. He wins at all costs. Lindsey Graham, I think, used to be a human being back in the day.

And it&#39;s this idea that if Trump names a nominee, would Biden be politically wise to perhaps do so as well? To telegraph to the people that if I become your president, this is who I would want. Do you see any advantage in potentially doing that? Of course, you having no powers to, you know, get that nominee through, but to almost dangle to the public that, you know, you&#39;ve got this choice and you&#39;ve got this choice. What do you kind of think of that political strategy as it may be?</span>

I go through a scenario and a live wire that is currently happening in our political conversation. I also tell you which party you&#39;re representing and how you&#39;re spinning the situation for that party. So it might be a a hole you find yourselves in. It might be a dilemma.

You want to, what, upplay expectations, downplay expectations? How are you communicating when the mic is put in front of you about how you&#39;re going to, you know, as government with the new agenda, the speech from the throne, how are you looking at these two by-elections and what they mean to your party?</span>

I think that they can, you know, they&#39;ll be fine. I haven&#39;t spent a ton of time looking at them, but the best way to manage it is to simply say it is imperative that these seats have representation in such a difficult time. We did not want to delay. We&#39;re moving forward and giving people their opportunity to have their say. It is always difficult for an incumbent government to hold a seat. It is more difficult for a minority</span>

I&#39;d be just saying that regardless of the outcome, it is essential that they have their day and the constituents have a say in how Canada is going to be managed.

York Center, it&#39;s not inconceivable the Conservatives could win that thing, particularly in a by-election environment. So you definitely don&#39;t want to be talking about these as must-win. You just can&#39;t, because it&#39;s actually pretty easy for me to see a path to the Conservatives winning York Center. So instead, you really want to be talking about the fact that you just think it&#39;s important that these seats have representation. You do not want to be setting expectations you&#39;re going to win this thing.</span>

We talked about the playbook of the past, that you could have really seen a fiery legislator with the experience that Mulcair had could have been a really interesting foil for Trudeau in that 19 election. If you were Tom Mulcair, you must be, and in my case, I was sitting next to him on election night, just looking at how Sig was being celebrated that night and thinking of what your political fortunes could have been had you been the leader on that particular evening.</span>

Guys, I want to now take a, not a bit of a deep dive, but a cursory start to a conversation I perhaps want to extend over a couple of episodes, which is to our listenership, providing some ideas and knowledge as to... Are we doing story arcs now? Like, what&#39;s going on? We are doing story arcs. And this is part one of a story arc using some of the situations that we&#39;re seeing this week in our home province of Alberta, and perhaps giving people a better sense of who Jason Kenney really is, you know, an interesting political figure in our country who&#39;s been on the federal side of things, but often compared to what I think and we&#39;ve discussed as misnomers, right? Donald Trump, Doug Ford, is he any of those things? Is he his own thing? And I think I want to start discussing that a little bit, especially with what we&#39;ve seen here in Alberta this week around Aish, around him going to Ottawa, around the rejuvenation of Fair Deal. So perhaps, Carter, I&#39;ll start with you. The comparison that&#39;s made about Chase and Kenny is the comparison to Trump or to Ford. Are either of those two accurate? Let&#39;s start here.</span>

I want to get back to that in a second because there&#39;s a listener question about it that I&#39;ll weave in. But Corey, Corey, let&#39;s start with the motivating factors. Are the comparisons to a Trump or a Ford in line with Jason Kenney? Is he what you&#39;d call, another word thrown around with him is populist? Would either of those labels apply in your mind in terms of perhaps his motivation or his political profile?</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, you know, maybe I&#39;ll stick with you because you started this thread. There&#39;s a listener question from Garrett here, where he talks about AISH, right, this recent development in Alberta. And he says, you know, why would the UCP and Jason Kenney hemorrhage so much much political capital on an edge case like Aish, which has so little to be gained from a budgetary standpoint. You know, of course, Alberta going through hard times, everyone acknowledging that Kenny telegraphing, obviously, and for a long time that he&#39;s going to look at everything.

Have I either through a combination of the level of the support that I&#39;m providing plus the accessibility of that support created a way for people who this was not meant to help, people have started using it in lieu of other things that they could be doing, whether it is getting support from their community, their church, their society around them to get back up on their feet. what what is going on and is this program actually being used right and um and</span>

Like, Albertans are just, they&#39;re not willing to have the conversation. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s not enough money. There&#39;s no one in Alberta who looks at it and says, yeah, two grand a month, Look at them living high on the hog, right? If anything, Albertans skew their minds the other way, and they think 100 grand is barely getting by, which is also ridiculous.

I want to talk about the Fair Deal panel, and I want to talk about the commission that Steve Allen is running on foreign interference. Do you think those are driven by the premier&#39;s sort of agenda and true belief that this is what we need? Or do you feel like that&#39;s something that he&#39;s doing as part of this, you know, this is what Albertans are like, and I want to kind of mimic that language.

I don&#39;t know how he&#39;s been the last six months. Stephen, hold your thoughts. He&#39;s a very competent individual. He&#39;s also not such a bad guy, right? You know this caricature of Matt Wolfe. His job is not to tweet. Can we just start there? His job is not to tweet. You see his tweets. You think that&#39;s his job. That is not his job. Nobody works harder in any government of any stripe than the director of issues management. I swear to God that is the case. They are the first people in the office. They have read all of the news, and they&#39;ve come up with all of their rejoinders before 7 a.m., and then they are the last one to leave the office. They&#39;re a personality type,</span>

They both are workaholics, very funny, very tough, and they are very smart. So let me just start there. His job is not to tweet. His job is to do a bunch of crap you never even get to see. he tweets on his random rejoinders waiting for somebody in the oval room you know uh who&#39;s going to meet with him or he&#39;s going to dress</span>

So as a tactic of riling people up, great. If you actually are trying to get Matt Wolfe removed, pretty dumb tactic.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, while I have you on this, I wasn&#39;t planning to, but let&#39;s just do it. Let&#39;s talk about the allegation that a lot of the people in Kenny&#39;s office were not in the previous office, they&#39;re net new employees. I know we&#39;ve driven past this, but it kind of bubbled up again this week. Do you want to quickly comment on that?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, well, so I saw this on Twitter as well. People have had a list of positions in Jason Kenny&#39;s premier&#39;s office, and they&#39;ve highlighted like these positions didn&#39;t exist under rachel notley&#39;s primers on well except they kind of did in some cases right i you know you can you can look at these things and you can cut them a thousand different ways but you know was a was a director of x now or previously called a deputy chief of staff was the was the director of policy or what was previously the director of policy has maybe become the principal advisor like they don&#39;t keep the same titles between these things sure Sure. But you&#39;ve got to look a little beyond that to the function. And I think it&#39;s kind of silly to sit there and say, look</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to you on this over under on seven, over under on seven. What you make of Rachel Notley&#39;s week? She had a poll late last week saying that she was effectively tied at a dead heat with the UCP. There&#39;s a solid write up for her in the Calgary Sun, kind of riding a bit of a high. And the message seems to have really kind of changed back to a premier in waiting, rather than, you know, gutsy opposition. What are you kind of making of her week over under on seven?</span>

That is when you&#39;re supposed to have good weeks when you&#39;re an opposition leader, because the government&#39;s trying to push through all the shit that they have to get through. You know, this is the middle of covid. This is, you know, Jason Kenney is the lowest ranked premier in the province in the country in terms of overall popularity. And, you</span>

            <span class="text">Jason Kenney&#39;s popularity is really not there. And on top of that, no one asked the second question, right? Right. This poll that was released didn&#39;t talk at all about how committed each voter was, you know, each each voter was to each of the parties. I have a suspicion that this is mostly a vote against the UCP that&#39;s with the NDP and a vote against the NDP that&#39;s with the UCP. I think that they&#39;re both way weak votes and the world could shift dramatically in the next two and a half years.</span>

            <span class="text">Phenomenal week. Phenomenal, phenomenal week. There&#39;s been rumors and chatter and murmurs of private polling showing a situation like this for quite some time, but it has not been reflected in public polling until now. And why that matters is as soon as it&#39;s public, narratives can shift on these things. And nothing wins like a winner, but nothing loses like a loser. And if it all of a sudden looks like the UCP is plummeting in the polls, that can create kind</span>

            <span class="text">kind of a vicious cycle where more people run away, more people start questioning the leader, more tensions happen behind the scenes and uh what was previously a united front can fall apart so even just setting aside the ink that she got if only because it is likely to make things more anxious for the ucp they will start to lose their nerve everybody talks tough when they&#39;re a new government they&#39;re going to come in they&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">that falls apart pretty quick when you start seeing poll numbers that question your existence as government right and now we have poll numbers that question the existence of the UCP going forward as government. Beyond that, I think you&#39;re absolutely right. You&#39;re starting to see some of the regular columnists, I wouldn&#39;t say running away yet, but Rick Bell, kind of hedging his bets. He&#39;s gone from the full-throated superstar champion of Jason Kenney to I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to give some good ink to Rachel Notley every now and then. And you&#39;re going to see a little bit more of that because the last thing that a columnist like Rick Bell wants is to prove himself irrelevant by not actually catching on to a populist wave. So he&#39;s going to start, you start seeing a bit of a cycle there. She had a great, great week. And I think that this is going to be quite a spur of activity for the NDP to come.</span>

There&#39;s no reason to merge. Everybody get on board with the NDP. That&#39;s the message from there.</span>

Are we going to see that ambitious green plan that the Trudeau government had floated? it seems like months ago now, but weeks, let&#39;s just say it was a week or two ago, but just prior to that retreat. Are we going to see that greening of the Canadian economy as part of this throne speech as what&#39;s once seemed almost guaranteed? Yes or no?</span>
