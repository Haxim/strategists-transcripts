            <span class="text">that much of a deviation to talking about like the tactics of politics that I was doing with Carter up front, because, Corey, something seems to be broken. Something seems to be either toxic. Something seems to be overly exploited in our political communications world. And you might be asking what I mean. Well, there&#39;s a couple of examples this week that I want to touch on. And they include a text message, a</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And they kind of highlight the nature of how political parties, political campaigns are communicating with their supporters. Let me start with the text message. The text message takes us to the Conservative Party of Canada, where when Alan Reyes, who was a member of Parliament, Conservative member of Parliament, he left the Conservative caucus, said, no, I&#39;m sitting as an independent. He was, of course, aligned with Jean Charest, for those who know.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right after that, that same day, the Conservative Party, which they had to apologize for this message, sent out a text to supporters in that writing, from what we can understand, that said, your MP, Alan Reyes, just quit the Conservative Party. He decided to not fight the inflation by Trudeau with the United team by Pierre Polyev. Call his office right now and tell him to resign from his member of parliament post. Call him. This is, of course, translated from French. The Conservative Party then said the Conservative Party of Canada apologized for an automatic automated text message sent out earlier today to party members in the riding automated. That&#39;s interesting. We&#39;ll get into that. We&#39;ll get it. We can get into each. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">well, let&#39;s get it. Let me let me actually paint the broader picture. and then if you want to go narrow on each of these you can</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">second one Brian Jean has been putting out here in Alberta some of the weirdest fucking like social media posts I have seen the most recent one and he does these graphics with Brian Jean in them and they&#39;re all did you knows about Brian Jean this sounds pretty innocuous but most recent one did you know Brian Jean dot dot dot here we go lost his 23 year old son to AHS medical malpractice we need to fix AHS and Brian Jean is a leader to get that done</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And like I said, we can get into each of these particular, because they&#39;re all relevant and they&#39;re all in the current sort of time horizon. The third one is also really interesting. This was a campaign email back here in Alberta sent by the Rebecca Schultz campaign, UCP candidate, where the email address is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is very clearly from her campaign. But the name on the email that you get, which a lot of these marketing email marketing platforms allow you to do, just swap the name out to whatever, says it&#39;s from your friendly neighborhood socialist. And then this entire email is phrased as if I&#39;m an NDP supporter sending out an email. And it says things like, I think all of the candidates have put forward their best foot saying pretty much the same thing, if you don&#39;t vote for me. But my biggest nightmare is Rebecca Schultz. She&#39;s the NDP&#39;s worst nightmare. So please do me a favor. Please do the NDP a favor and vote for Rebecca Schultz.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Right? And so this email that comes from her campaign, which identifies it at the bottom, right, but tries to use this tone and this voice.</span>

            <span class="text">kind of like spam best practices, this clickbait best practice that political parties have gotten into heavy. Because even though you have organizations Organizations like BuzzFeed who see over time those things stop working and your share value falls and the valuations you have for your companies fall. If you&#39;re a political party, you&#39;re running gun, right? You just try to burn your list as fast as possible in a way that soaks the most out of it before the next campaign. And you say, oh, we&#39;ll fucking figure it out for the next one. We&#39;ll go follow the next trends. And all of this is sort of feeding communications</span>

In its simplest form, burning a list means that you are treating it in such a way that you&#39;re increasing the amount of disengagement, unsubscribes, people who just do not open the emails anymore. You&#39;ve just flooded them so much that they&#39;re either shutting you out or actively getting themselves off of your lists. Even sometimes reporting it as spam, which of course reduces your ability to communicate to all of them because you might get caught up more in filters. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the idea is you hit a certain point in a campaign particularly if you&#39;re down and you think well fuck it this list is no good to me the day after the election so i will burn this list i will run through it and i will soak every dollar out of it every volunteer out of it and i&#39;ll confess even in my own life i had a kind of a regular saying especially around eday you guys know i used to like eday was my thing yeah</span>
