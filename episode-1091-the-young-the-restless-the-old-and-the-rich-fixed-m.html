            <span class="text">um we&#39;ve got lots to talk about a lot has happened this august week of the summer and uh let&#39;s let&#39;s dive into it let&#39;s start with trump um late monday in georgia trump was indicted again his fourth one since march uh i don&#39;t need to get into all the background we could kind of get into it i want to just start with like what stands out to you this time um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">um what is different this time what are you paying attention to let&#39;s uh carter i know you&#39;ve got some thoughts let&#39;s jump in well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">well i think that there&#39;s a couple of things uh the first thing that&#39;s standing out to me is that in Georgia, the governor cannot pardon. That is something that can&#39;t be done in terms of they can&#39;t preemptively pardon Trump or the co-conspirators. That&#39;s excellent. The second thing is that the president can&#39;t pardon. This is not a federal crime. It can&#39;t be pardoned by the president. So Trump himself couldn&#39;t pardon him. And the case that maybe Biden should, for the good of the nature nation pardon uh pardon trump in some level and although i&#39;ve heard a lot of that argument this now but i think it is an argument that should be made every once in a while um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um that can&#39;t be made either this he&#39;s on his own it is up to now the da and the the jury in in georgia to determine whether or not he&#39;s guilty or not and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and it looks like the da is going to be following through on this that&#39;s fantastic i think that&#39;s that&#39;s outstanding um so that&#39;s the the first thing that jumps out at me the second thing and uh maybe we&#39;ll get into this a little bit more in depth is the polling seems to be changing with these with the georgia uh charges as well and uh i think that that you know we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">we mentioned number of time i&#39;ve predicted a number of times that at some point the just the sheer volume of uh charges would result in trump dropping his poll numbers dropping because that&#39;s what tends to happen in other in other democracies uh when a leader it&#39;s not the first charges people rally around the first charges second charges but at some point there&#39;s just too many charges to ignore and um people start walking away from the leader uh almost like they&#39;re walking away from pigpen not not the leader themselves and i think we&#39;re starting to see that so that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s exciting to me trump is now pigpen okay</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">um should these go ahead well actually even before that rico charges like these were a 1970s federal statute to ultimately go after the fucking mafia and that is what they&#39;re charging him under him and 18 co-conspirators holy fuck with the an extremely, I shouldn&#39;t say vicious, I was about to say vicious, I&#39;d say thoughtful, talented, and deliberate use of these laws. If you hear the charges, and if you read the indictment coming out of the state of Georgia, the selection of this particular instrument, this RICO instrument, fascinating in terms of their justification of it. And I can&#39;t say airtight because nothing is is airtight, but the closest thing I as a layman and not having understanding of US law thought was airtight. That&#39;s what&#39;s interesting to me as point number one. Point number two, there are going to be assets in this trial, and it&#39;s going to be quick. What do I mean by assets? Fuck, we&#39;re going to see a mugshot. If Trump is arraigned by the end of this month, which is what the folks in Georgia are requesting i believe it&#39;s a end of august arraignment for a trial set no later than march or april um we&#39;re gonna see a fucking mugshot and then if all things go to plan trials in georgia are televised yeah so like this is now going to be like a reality show we&#39;re talking about talk about something circular where trump right is is is sitting there and kind of like his his show back in the day, curing his fate day to day, performing these tasks, at least having his lawyers talk about how he performed these tasks. The whole fucking thing is nuts. So Carter&#39;s right on the legal front, the lack of pardoning, but then the fact that there&#39;s a comms marketing political strategy element with assets entering place, and then this concept of the RICO laws, which were used for the mafia developed in the 70s so that the folks at the top of a ring could actually face accountability, even if it was just their foot soldiers carrying out the tasks, which is like a very simplified way of describing it. That is what&#39;s being used to charge Trump. I mean, this is, I shouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s novel, but it is different than the first three indictments that we have seen. And I would argue, and this is my layman sort of thought about it, this one might might be the most piercing and this maybe goes to carter&#39;s conversation about the polling numbers too yeah</span>

            <span class="text">The mugshot will come first, right? Naturally. And we don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be if Trump is going to comply, if he&#39;s going to get arraigned end of this month, but we suspect that will happen that will be released. They&#39;re going to treat him like any other sort of defendant in the state of Georgia, Fulton County, I believe is the county. So that comes first, that&#39;s going to get the meme treatment. Let&#39;s start there, like very simply, right? Like that&#39;s going to get the meme treatment all across the internet. It&#39;s going to be, you know, probably the most widely seen photo in in modern history like i say that without exaggeration like that is going because of how it&#39;s going to be spread where it is going to be so that there&#39;s something there to account for there&#39;s a there there right and and the question naturally that kind of flows is what the democrats do to kind of mold that into into um anything positive for them my just general advice on that i knowing you haven&#39;t asked that question is leave it the fuck alone there&#39;s a there there and it won&#39;t be used positively for trump so let that happen um and then the televised element of of it is fascinating. Like one thing I&#39;d love to just get an understanding of, because now we&#39;re getting into Carter&#39;s world and a bit of my world around like production, right? What does this production look like? And if I&#39;m the Democrats, I&#39;m starting trying to understand that. Will there be a constant camera on Trump the whole time? Is this a one camera from the back where you see the back of everyone&#39;s head trial? Is this a multi-camera sort of trial? Do these cameras move around? Is someone carrying like, there is a production element here. You, when you talk And I said assets broadly. It now becomes from like a political theater perspective, what am I getting? And</span>

            <span class="text">if I know what I&#39;m getting, then I can start thinking about what impact will language have? What impact will body language have? Because people will be watching and observing all of this. All of this to lead to what are we doing at the end of each night of a trial to clip certain things and tell a story, right? Something will be said by the defendant. How will we actually show Trump&#39;s reaction? Can we ourselves edit that back and forth? These are the questions. I bet, I bet you right now, someone in the DNC is charged with figuring out our trial comms strategy, both at a high level, how hard do we go at it? How much do we push on it? But also from a tactical level around what it is that we get from each trial, find this out. And so those are the questions, probably. I don&#39;t have the answers, but those are the questions. And I suspect those are some of the strategic and tactical questions that are being asked just now to prepare for this March, April trial.</span>

I think that what you what you&#39;re looking for in a perfect in a perfect scenario isn&#39;t necessarily the one camera kind of model, but a simple, simple camera with simple shots that remain relatively constant so that you know that you&#39;ve always going to get a Trump reaction shot. you know you&#39;re always going to get um you know kind of a wide shot of the courtroom and a tight shot of the of the uh of</span>

And on Carter&#39;s point around the commercialization, we have seen the TikTok sort of element, the commercial element of these things kind of swing public opinion on a trial.

Will Trump testify? I doubt it, but to be discussed, to be determined, which will also be a massive factor. He kind of turned the tide on that thing, at least in the public opinion. And of course, this was, I&#39;m not talking about the judge&#39;s credibility or the jury&#39;s credibility, because I forget if that was a bench trial or a jury trial, but</span>

So it&#39;s going to be really fascinating to see how the Republicans respond to this strategy, how they lean into the commercialization of this thing, both to call it fake news and call it like a spectacle and a drama, but also to kind of, you know, find moments that appeal to their base, to their sensibility, and to, frankly, they have an emerging base of younger men that really are distributing this information online.

And I think the fact is that because the verdict on this trial, it will be clear, right? But because of, you asked the question, what does our social media environment do? It numbs us. Yes. The verdict will be bonded very quickly because people will go into their echo chamber, spread the misinformation and disinformation, and the Dems will lose out on the overall opportunity here, which is, holy fuck, there&#39;s</span>

None of these other contenders are viable. There is a school of thought, and I don&#39;t know if this is where you&#39;re going, Carter, but I&#39;ll let you go there if this is where you are, that says that this will all pile up. Trump will still be up in the polls. He&#39;ll be unacceptable to the general public. So he&#39;ll make a deal either with Biden to like, you know, I&#39;ll trade in all these indictments for, you know, not running for president, right? Or I will do some sort of thing where I back out because it&#39;s for the good thing in the country and we&#39;ll have a brokered convention. I think all of that is horseshit.

He is losing the general election with each day of these ongoing legal problems. There are more indictments to come.</span>

It&#39;s that it&#39;s also someone that people do not want to be president. So the big sort of X factor in this race, if you can call it that, and it&#39;s an X factor we&#39;ve seen in so many races, but it&#39;s voter enthusiasm and voter enthusiasm relating to turnout. And if it&#39;s Trump, it&#39;s helpful to Biden and team. But once again, when you talk about the blunting of certain things and people just being tuned out on certain ways, I worry if I&#39;m the the Dems if I have two historically unpopular candidates that people want to be president for different reasons, right? One, because it&#39;s like, oh my God, can&#39;t the Dems do any better? And the other side is like, oh my God, the fascist is back, right? Those are very different reasons sort of thing. And I use that from a very left-wing piece of analysis, of course. But I feel like the biggest liability the Dems have towards expanding the map, which every indication says that they have an opportunity to do so if Trump is the nominee, is Biden and by extension it&#39;s voter enthusiasm so tbd we&#39;ll see okay</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">First of all, shout out to our children&#39;s trust, by the way. I&#39;ve had a chance to meet Julia before, who&#39;s the executive director, the chief legal counsel. They&#39;re the ones who put this litigation together with the 16 plaintiffs. They know what they&#39;re doing. I think the way this is a game changer, I might start with them as an organization first, because I think it&#39;s fascinating. On this show, we&#39;ve talked a lot about advocacy. We&#39;ve talked a lot about the strategy of advocacy, how you get into the public profile. We&#39;ve talked about your domain analyst, that media relations, public relations element. This, to me, is game-changing because it is trying to use litigation as an added advocacy measure that pairs very nicely with the overarching communications marketing strategy. And I would have said, win or lose, this trial would have been advancing. And one of the things I find interesting is that this general approach to use litigation, regardless of outcome, to change public perception is really, really smart if you have talented, energetic, largely young people who, rather than devoting their time to be in-house counsel at an oil and gas company, this is where I get on my high horse a bit, or go to big law, say, I&#39;m going to probably earn half as much. but I can make an impact because pairing litigation to move public opinion, so fucking smart. And do you know who believes that? Fucking</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Fucking the Biden government. So let me take a bit of a deviation, right? This is actually the Biden government strategy in some ways that relates to the FTC. Long story short, there&#39;s this young lawyer out of Yale Law School, Lina Khan, who writes this paper that&#39;s considered novel about antitrust, talks about how prices shouldn&#39;t be the only thing considered, market power of a firm should be considered. She goes goes after Amazon in this paper. Biden, a few years later, appoints her at the young age of 30-something as the chair of the FTC, as a chairwoman of FTC, to go after, to impose this strategy. And on the record, over the last half year, she has said, I&#39;m going to go after these big firms, and I&#39;m going to lose some of these cases. But the point here is I&#39;m in the position of pushing public opinion vis-a-vis litigation. Even if I lose, the fact that we&#39;re going up up against this fight, tells you how important this fight is, tells you how possible</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">possible the fight is, tells you the value of pushing the fight. And we haven&#39;t talked on the show enough about how litigation, win or lose, can really marry with your advocacy strategy. So Carter and I and Corey have done call-outs in the past. If you&#39;re a young legal mind, if you&#39;re a talented young person listening to this show, your efforts are needed on the legal front. That is also applying here in Canada. Litigation with advocacy, with public policy, with marketing is such a potent way of pushing the agenda. And I don&#39;t think we do it enough. We don&#39;t have a litigious culture here, but man, oh man, if you can, it does work. And I will give a shout out to a friend of mine, Avnish Nanda in Edmonton, someone who have political disagreements every now and then, but this guy is a lawyer who uses the slim assets that he has in his like three person shop to sue sue the government to push on certain things. And even if he doesn&#39;t win, he gets movement on the file in terms of public opinion. Really fucking smart, really fucking sharp. And I think win or lose in the grand scheme of things with the appeal that will come within the next 60 days within the Supreme Court within Montana. This is a landmark and it shows a pathway for other states, not just of litigation, but around public policy and moving the needle where we may have plateaued on using the traditional forces of pure sort of policy comms marketing.</span>

And so you could call this a trial balloon. You could call it safe space that has been created by our provincial government. But at the end of the day, to me, what matters here is from a straight regulation perspective, this is why we have to regulate more, not less. Because all this other stuff that companies use as performative or reputational laundromatting to make themselves greener, wiser, more thoughtful, full of more of the earth. Goldman Sachs has done this. JP Morgan Chase has done this. Jamie Diamond is a fucking prick who&#39;s done this for years with the Business Council of CEOs in the United States. All of this I find to be complete horseshit because left to their own devices, they will do what makes them money versus do what&#39;s right.

            <span class="text">I would pair legislation with something else, something more longstanding, right? Something that could take us into next summer, right? I&#39;d build a year-long plan because what will ultimately happen is you go into the fall, you get cooler conditions, and a lot of the stuff that we have seen regarding hail, smoke, etc. will be out of sight, out of mind until it&#39;s very much in sight and on top of mind back again in April and May, right? And so not to say that climate change doesn&#39;t exist in between. I don&#39;t want anyone misinterpreting me. But if this is about both legislation and making a point when people are attuned to that point, which is what you have to do, I would develop something that has a year-long strategy. Now, what that looks like, I don&#39;t necessarily have a good sense of, and I need to think a bit more about it. But to me, the one thing I would elongate here is something that can last beyond into next summer, right? What you could do, something that takes action there. Carter&#39;s right. Trudeau needs a bit of a jolt, a shot in the arm, a bit of a reinvention. Picking the fight has to be one part of a larger play, of a recommitment or a re-entrenchment. If these oil and gas companies, energy companies, and if Rich Kruger is just maybe one in a line of several that will either trial balloon the same sentiment or outright say it or or agree to it, or say it in quiet rooms, that this is where their heads are at as well. If they&#39;re not going to re-entrench to what they agreed to, I am, and even harder. And I would make that a core part of how he picks the fight. And I&#39;m going to be on a crusade for the next whatever bit, because the stakes are too high, and the timeline is too short for me to do this. So I would kind of use something like that as a bit of a re-entrenchment, re-emergence, maybe even and re-innovation of his focus as he moves along on this particular front. Because there is opportunity to be gained. There is votes to be potentially gained. My concern, if I&#39;m going to pull it out of the climate conversation for a second, is that are those votes simply NDP votes that aren&#39;t going to bleed to him? And does he look more vulnerable on issues that are also as pressing and need a wartime effort like housing? Maybe. But there is something to be said about this strategy having a longer rather than shorter window.</span>

It was also part of why Harper moved us from a 7% GST to a 2% GST. it was opening up points for provinces and municipalities to jump in on. And a one and two point penny tax with a defined outcome is a great way to generate a diverse set of income for cities</span>

So if I&#39;m them, I&#39;m thinking about a deal right now between them to be absolutely honest around like it&#39;s either you or me if it&#39;s not her and i&#39;m structuring that sort of arrangement campaign manager to campaign manager to figure out what&#39;s going on there so to me this is a bit of a wait and see and not to be like that&#39;s all they do they have to go after her on on these things but it&#39;s a wait and see to see if she crumbles if you are effective in the in that outright uh sort of attack and line of attack that you have against her but the numbers and the ordering don&#39;t really make sense i mean don&#39;t really surprise me and generally make sense in terms of what we&#39;re seeing so many thousands of kilometers away here.</span>
