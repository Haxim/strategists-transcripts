          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Jesus. Let&#39;s jump into it then. Let&#39;s jump into our first segment, which is called Dropping the Rit. You keep that energy, Carter, and we&#39;ll get into this. So Monday is the big day. The writ will be dropped in Alberta. It&#39;s going to be an interesting 28 days. I&#39;ve got a lot to kind of quiz you about here, but let&#39;s just start with, you&#39;ve both been there. What is the eve of, what are we calling it, like the eve of writ drop day? What is that like in a campaign? campaign</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">incredibly anticlimactic you&#39;ve been working for two to three months on the campaign structure all that&#39;s changed is that you&#39;re hoping that another 10 or 15 percent of the population wakes up and goes oh there&#39;s going to be an election uh because for for you and your network you&#39;ve been doing the election forever right you&#39;ve been pounding uh doors you&#39;ve been getting data you&#39;ve been doing strategy um data has been flowing in like from the from the pollsters you&#39;re You&#39;re trying to break down where you are, where you need to be, all your policy elements. All that&#39;s been happening for two to three months, sometimes longer. And then when the writ drops, it&#39;s like, okay,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">okay, now it&#39;s official. We get to go. But it&#39;s not like anything really fundamentally changes. It&#39;s just hopefully a few more people will wake up tomorrow and go, oh, yeah, that&#39;s really all you&#39;re open</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Do you agree with that assessment?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Yeah. The Rit Day Eve, Rit Day kind of is like New Year&#39;s Eve, New Year&#39;s. It never lives up to the hype. It&#39;s never this big moment you think it is for all of the reasons Stephen said. And in fact, even before we had these quasi-fixed election periods, we all generally knew by the weekend before the Rit dropped that the Rit was being dropped because things just happen, right? And in the olden days, you would look at campaign offices being leased and the government signs But the reality is, the weekend before the dropping of the writ, because the dropping of the writ is usually on a Monday or Tuesday, not always, and certainly other jurisdictions have gotten into different conventions. The election started on Saturday, in my opinion. This weekend, the election began, and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing signs. I saw all sorts of canvassing teams kicking around the various neighborhoods I saw. and uh yeah in a way it&#39;s just like it&#39;s the formality now it&#39;s the paperwork but this election has begun and um i think you can expect very little to be different about tomorrow than there is today except now everybody takes their place at the theater right um they&#39;re going to be on the stage they&#39;re going to be hitting their marks the media has a very kind of formal way of covering these things and at least you can probably talk more about this uh but i mean i can certainly tell you from observation on the campaign all of a sudden you know the premier becomes the party leader uh the the way it tends to occur is somebody is assigned to to follow one campaign somebody to the other campaign in the olden days maybe another person in the</span>

Like every day you can sort of expect, okay, there&#39;s going to be campaign events in the morning and then there&#39;s going to be another campaign event in the afternoon, but it&#39;s not really a media focused one because we&#39;re all trying to get in the media by the evening news and blah, blah, blah. And, and the, the rhythm of the campaign takes, takes over in a big way now, but</span>

But I would argue, especially given this period where everybody knows what the date is going to be, that Rachel Notley and Danielle Smith have been doing events pretty much nonstop. Right. This is, you know, we saw major policy announcements in the last couple of weeks. Nothing really changed. It just it just</span>

So that, I mean, that&#39;s a big material thing. But, you know, campaign cadence is a real thing. And maybe they&#39;ve been in it for a while. I suspect they&#39;ve been in modified versions. But every morning, probably at 7am or so, there&#39;ll be a call of all of the campaign managers with the central team or whatever the rhythm is that they set, saying these are the issues of the day, these are the things we&#39;re going to be doing. And that whole apparatus, apparatus. I mean, it, it just, it just moves, uh, once the Ritz dropped. And I think to me, that is kind of the, that&#39;s</span>

I mean, we talked about schedules being pretty much, you know, you&#39;re not going to do the events that you put on the board and the way in the order that you put them on the board um but your your campaign theme is your campaign theme now i mean you&#39;re you&#39;re</span>

And now we&#39;re going. So if it&#39;s the right direction, great, that&#39;s going to be fantastic. If it&#39;s the wrong direction, we&#39;re all going to suffer for 28 days.

It is what it is. And it would be, I don&#39;t get the sense either campaign would find themselves in that place. But when you start changing your tactics, you know what you call that? A flailing campaign. You are much better off to kind of run a suboptimal strategy, then switch strategy nine times out of 10. And so you&#39;re strapped in. Stephen&#39;s metaphor is well taken because it is what it is at this point. And we just don&#39;t know what it is. We just don&#39;t get to find out for 28 days. You</span>

            <span class="text">And that permission needs to be granted, not from the higher ups, not from the big brains in media or whatever in those situations, but from your peers, your neighbors, the people who are close to you. So this 20,000 sign strategy in Calgary feels like it will beget more signs, lead it to a growth. If you don&#39;t see more sign growth, then that wouldn&#39;t be great. But I think, and what I used, and I&#39;ve used this same technique a number of times, flood, then growth, growth almost always comes after flood. blood. And</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">And just to clarify, these are, I was talking about signs on private property. Corey, do you want to talk a little bit about, I guess, kind of same sort of strategy when it comes to the public property sign war?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, first off, that&#39;s a Calgary thing. Like, you can&#39;t put signs on public property in Edmonton. And I think ultimately, the signs on public property are of much less value. We&#39;re pretty aware that a field is not voting for somebody. It could show no organizational strength perhaps if there just seem to be everywhere but it is of much less value because it doesn&#39;t create that social pressure and that and that social permission that steven was talking about that comes with having lawn signs where all of a sudden it&#39;s like you see one that your neighbor has it&#39;s like oh i had no idea bob was was a ucp supporter maybe i&#39;ll get a ucp sign too or you know i had no idea that julia and her family were supporting ndp this time around They usually have a UCP sign up. Hmm, that gives me pause. That makes me think about things. And maybe I&#39;m going to change the way that I react as a result. And certainly it is not new for campaigns to say the writ&#39;s coming. We&#39;re going to go absolutely nuts on the weekend before and get out as many signs as possible. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. But to Stephen&#39;s point, the strategy that starts really big like this and then can often lead to other people asking for signs because they do see the people around them and it gives them permission to do it too. But, you know, there&#39;s a lot of considerations with signs here and it&#39;s not always clear that there&#39;s a great correlation between signs and outcomes. I think signs on private property have pretty strong correlation, but signs on public have almost none, is my understanding. And certainly I can think of at least one campaign in Northwest Edmonton where one candidate won the sign war massively,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Does the signs to like this early on speak to those candidates that have been door knocking a lot and have been making those connections? Like, do you want to kind of square that, Corey?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, it does. It for sure does. And obviously, the more work you do ahead of time, the more likely you&#39;re going to have those sign locations. There&#39;s other things too. Parties are getting a lot more comfortable just saying, oh, they&#39;re a party member, we&#39;re going to put a sign up, you know, and not necessarily ask for permission because they become well aware that most party members, maybe they won&#39;t ask for the sign, but they won&#39;t ask you to get rid of it once you put it up and they&#39;ll probably keep it up. So it can also speak to the overall strength of the organization of the political party as well and how many members there are out there. And in spirit of like that flood and that sense of momentum, parties are also often pretty savvy at this particular moment with how they target their walks, as we say, going out. So it&#39;s pretty common to really walk the main thoroughfares that have a lot of private houses on them because that means you can get all of those sign locations. You go back maybe even multiple times because the way that cities are built, particularly the suburbs, is it&#39;s small streets that kind of meander leading on to bigger streets that meander towards the biggest streets that connect as arteries, right? right? And so you find the ones that everybody has routed onto and you really focus your walks on there and you can get more signs, maybe not more votes, but if you kind of target the signs in that sense, you can create a sense that you&#39;re really a big deal.</span>

It was a very interesting thing, because if you were just in Edmonton, you would have thought that the UCP were going to get bloody crushed in the election, right? And so you can create, it&#39;s a very physical representation of the bubbles we sometimes find ourselves in. And yeah, I don&#39;t know how much value signage has in say Edmonton Gold Bar, which is going to go like what, 70% NDP. But you know, it&#39;s something something parties do. And that, that sense of momentum often can lead to fundraising and additional money that can then go to other writings and whatnot. But yeah, is, is it a great use of time? I mean, no, if, if volunteers and their time was totally portable, but the reality is people volunteer in their writings, they volunteer in their community. And so what else are they going to do? And, uh, it does afford an opportunity to show the strength of the organization. But</span>

            <span class="text">you know Sherwood Park I need you know you need to be out doing those places and keep in mind that if if we&#39;re talking about this level of signs if this level of signs is real i mean this is some somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,500 volunteers all focused on putting up signs today and that&#39;s actually a really good show i mean that&#39;s a great thing to be able to do is to put out um you know a thousand volunteers doing one thing on one day you know i&#39;m sure that there was still door knocking posses i think cory you mentioned that to me that you saw some some door knockers out as well i mean if you&#39;re able to do to put put up 50,000 signs through the province and do door knocking, then you&#39;re just flexing your organizational muscle. So and then I&#39;d add one more thing to Edmonton signs. And that is that a lot of the donut travels through Edmonton. I&#39;d be targeting as much as humanly possible, those major thoroughfares that bring people in from Sherwood Park into downtown Edmonton. You know, yes, they may be in a different community, but they do need to see that there&#39;s still a tremendous amount of support for the uh for the ndp and then and it does appear and i don&#39;t know for sure but it feels like the ndp have caught the ucp napping a little bit um the organizational structure uh even you know it it feels like uh and again we don&#39;t have a completely uh you know a complete view of everything but it feels like there was some napping done by the ucp this week which means that they&#39;ll be installing their signs over the next little while and it&#39;ll take some time for them is</span>

            <span class="text">voters yeah again you know you you want to be in a spot where you are competitive i think at this stage i I don&#39;t think you want to be winning by miles, and I don&#39;t think you want to be losing by miles. And there&#39;s a couple of reasons for that. The media have a tendency. I mean, I know that it&#39;s very hip for the right to say that we have a left-wing media and for the left to say we have a right-wing media, or I don&#39;t know, everybody&#39;s all over the place. Here&#39;s the truth. we have a media that reflects fairness and that reflects their ultimate end game which is competitiveness um they are for they root the media root for the story that&#39;s who they root for and that&#39;s why the nenshi come from behind victory you know who how did he do it that that that&#39;s a narrative that&#39;s a story they root for the story that&#39;s what they cared about they didn&#39;t care care about nenshi they weren&#39;t supporting nenshi they wanted a great story and and so this is part of the process that&#39;s now unfolding is that the media could very well you know if the ndp start walking away with it or the ucp they start rooting for a story and they suddenly find more negatives they work harder to find those negatives they they dig them up it&#39;s not because of a bias i think that people think that it&#39;s because of bias. The bias is only towards finding the story.</span>

            <span class="text">the ndp need to win by more than four points and so i think that they can make that story pretty clear and they can beat the complacency down by saying yeah but we&#39;ve got to win seats right like votes are one thing seats are another thing and for them almost four points up is is the even race in my opinion four points down for the ndp would be i mean i don&#39;t even think that&#39;s unrealistic I suspect there will probably be some polls like that, because I suspect we&#39;ll see multiple polls in the next bit here. But I think that four points down for the NDP is maybe worse in real terms than four points down for the UCP, just because of the way that this seems to be breaking down. And so, yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I think that a lot of organizers are pretty cynical about rallies for exactly the reason Stephen said. They&#39;re already there for you. They take so much effort. They take so much time off the doors. And ultimately, it&#39;s usually just in service of a pretty picture. And there&#39;s a lot of ways to get pretty pictures that don&#39;t require hundreds of people not doing things that win elections. But we talked about how in Edmonton, what&#39;s the point of the sign war? And we talked about the fact that in Edmonton, sometimes you&#39;ve just got volunteers who need to do stuff. So, you know, Rachel Notley&#39;s rally, the one we&#39;re talking about here, was in Edmonton Gold Bar. That writing that I was flippantly saying they&#39;re going to win with 70% of the vote.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">What else are you going to do in Edmonton Gold Bar? You know, you might as well drag volunteers out and have a good show and use that to show momentum across the organization. And yeah, if you can get the volunteers out there doing things too, all the better. But, you know, you don&#39;t want to have a rally in an area where you desperately need people on the doors. Right. And they didn&#39;t in the case of the NDP. What&#39;s confusing to me is that Danielle Smith also had a rally in Edmonton and she kind of did need them on the doors. Right. And instead she had a rally. And then there was this funny moment and it&#39;s an annoying moment and it&#39;s so exhausting for both sides. I just, I&#39;m, I&#39;m both sides in this one big time where people are like, oh, looks like our rally went a little bit nicer than your rally. And it&#39;s like, oh, looks like you looked at a bad picture of our rally because this picture of the rally shows everyone at the rally. And also they&#39;re all smiling. Oh, they&#39;re smiling because that looks like a grimace from that person back there. God, they&#39;re all so bored. And look, look how white that crowd is compared to our very diverse crowd. oh well that&#39;s just again that&#39;s that was the event that was just right here but if you turn the anyways and it always happens and it&#39;s so dumb nobody gives a shit the media just want their pretty picture most of the public doesn&#39;t really parse the rally pictures that deeply and everybody just needs to stop fighting online about whose rally looks better oh</span>

That&#39;s not the way that you necessarily want to think about things. You want to think about things like people are going to make mistakes when they&#39;re younger. And in fact, the people who&#39;ve made mistakes when when you&#39;re younger, may have way more to offer than people who just kind of felt like Pierre Pauliev. I&#39;m going to become some sort of, I will be your leader. And he&#39;s thought that. He&#39;s thought about being the prime minister since he was, you know, in diapers.

It probably would not have been particularly helpful either to her or the campaign. The reality is Deborah Drever won during a wave election, was not anticipated to win, was a</span>
