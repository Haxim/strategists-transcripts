            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there was a negotiation down and what the billing rates were on certain codes what was happening is some physicians were then saying well i&#39;m just going to use the longer building code the billing code the one that allows me a few extra dollars for it you know i can&#39;t remember the exact breakdowns but here in alberta it was basically you see a patient for less than 15 minutes you bill this if it&#39;s like 15 to 25 you bill that and then all of a sudden maybe there were more 15 to 25s because overall billings continued to climb despite the fact that the billing rates were declining right despite those being negotiated so pretty reasonable you think well maybe we just do like a database query we find out if all of a sudden there&#39;s because they&#39;re time-based are people all of a sudden seeing their patients allegedly for a lot more does that change our perception of their day because there&#39;s all of these codes that have time minute and uh you think you could do that no</span>
