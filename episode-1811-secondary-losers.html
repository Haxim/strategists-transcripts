I&#39;ve got the, I&#39;ve got the, uh, the special sauce. i&#39;ve got the ability when it&#39;s a 20 point 26 point shift when you lose nine points and the and the conservatives gain 17 points in toronto in</span>

Like, I think you have to take that we lost the battle, but not the war approach in your communications. But you have to acknowledge you lost the battle. Like, there&#39;s no polishing this turd to the point where you could say, no sweat, right? You will look out of touch. The panic in your caucus will become multiplied because people will say they don&#39;t even fucking understand how terrible this is. And that&#39;s a very dangerous place to be. One where it doesn&#39;t look like you can even properly assess the size of the hole that you&#39;re in. So you&#39;ve got to acknowledge the hole.

Does this have anything to do with the local candidates? Leslie Church today, you know, we talked about her in the past, because she&#39;s a former political staffer very close to Krista Freeland. Is there an element there around her not being from the riding? Or do you just kind of like Occam&#39;s razor, this was about the prime minister, very clearly, very cleanly in that regard. How do you kind of read those results, at least a few hours in retrospect right now?</span>

            <span class="text">I think that the candidate was a star candidate, at least as close to a star candidate as you&#39;re going to get in these circumstances. Leslie Church, on her own, is a very accomplished person. the connection to uh freeland makes her i think even even more of a star and uh the fact that she lost is a uh direct slap in the face to the party i mean this is the leaders and it doesn&#39;t take an awful lot of strategic advice or strategic reflection uh to see that what everybody is talking about is the leader right they&#39;re not talking about uh even the carbon tax uh they&#39;re talking about the leader and the leader&#39;s performance. So I think that this would be impossible to lay at the feet of Leslie Church. It&#39;s impossible to lay at the feet of those who are designing and executing the campaign. And instead, I would say that this is the natural outcome of the leader not being popular. That is Occam&#39;s razor. And I think that we need to uh to</span>

Maybe it would have made a difference of two points. You swing two points, you swing the election. And so that&#39;s an unfortunate consequence, and that&#39;s part of, that&#39;s not on Leslie Church, but that is maybe on the Liberal Party as a whole for not thinking about this thing in terms of what&#39;s most likely to win locally.

Now go show me you&#39;re a great lawyer, go show me you&#39;re a great community builder, and then you get to run, right? So it does feel like the liberals have turned into this permanent political machine, where you just work your way up the ranks in a way that, again, you can kind of, it&#39;s so easy at a moment like this to say, that model&#39;s broken.

            <span class="text">is the primary piece. And he wants Justin Trudeau to keep his unpopular positions on carbon tax, keep his unpopularity front and center. And so the attack that Pierre Palliev has put on the liberals has nothing to do with what we are suggesting is the reason that the liberals lost this by-election. And I think that that&#39;s very telling because it&#39;s showing exactly what Pierre Palliev does not want. He doesn&#39;t want to see a leadership—he doesn&#39;t want to oppose someone else. He wants to oppose Justin Trudeau, his unpopular carbon tax, and take this 27-point shift or 26-point shift all across the country. Corey,</span>

You don&#39;t need to run immediately on the budget, but I would. I&#39;d run right on the budget. You&#39;ve got lots of time. You&#39;ve got enough time to do it.

Now you can easily orchestrate your fall and go to the polls if you decide it&#39;s advantageous. But I think you want to start thinking now about how you create that future space. And let me tell you, I&#39;ve worked with a lot of governments and a lot of parties who have sat there in the fourth year and said, oh, we just can&#39;t do the fifth. We would look so weak. I hear that all the time. I see no evidence that the public gives a fuck about this. And by the way, you are weak. You are weak right now.

            <span class="text">have this balancing act right now. How do they weather themselves against something like we just chatted about? Can they? And, and how do they stay disciplined here? Because I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re suggesting this, but the sloganeering was simple and now it&#39;s becoming very long in some ways. And I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a tell, if they&#39;ve just got micro-targeted slogans for different audiences, but it is now starting to sound like a bunch of word salad. It used to just be axe to tax. Now it&#39;s starting to be every issue under the sun that the liberals are weak on. And guys, conservatives, I&#39;m speaking of, they&#39;re going to be weak on a lot of issues. So are we going to develop a three-word slogan for a lot of these issues? Like, do you feel like there&#39;s a lack of conservative discipline here? And what lessons would you have for them as we go down speculation lane around what we just chatted about, if the liberals try to manufacture what Carter just suggested here?</span>

Because in this democracy, they have to make decisions and people hold on to the decisions they disagree with more than the decisions they agree with. That&#39;s just life. That&#39;s reality. I wonder, as Stephen was was talking this out if there isn&#39;t um let&#39;s i don&#39;t know if i&#39;d call it an opportunity or a risk or both with the liberals given the demographic considerations in toronto st paul&#39;s right 15 percent uh vote of the jewish faith well if you&#39;re the trudeau liberals in a way does this help you hand wave it away say look we we obviously know this is a very charged matter israel hamas war we know that the liberal party has been hearing about it from from all</span>
