          <p>Voters in Toronto-St. Paul's have elected a Conservative MP for the first time in 30 years, putting into question Liberal viability everywhere - and Trudeau's leadership. Where from here? The gang brings that 8am energy to the discussion.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the results of the Toronto-St.Paul's byelection. How big of a deal is this? Is there a path forward for Justin Trudeau? What does it mean for Pierre Poilievre and Liberal leadership hopefuls? And how many Douglas mattresses will be sold as a consequence of this episode? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

            <div class="said">at least from some of the narrative leading into this election result, that this was going to be a referendum on the prime minister? Is this anything else? Does this have anything to do with the local candidates? Leslie Church today, you know, we talked about her in the past, because she&#39;s a former political staffer very close to Krista Freeland. Is there an element there around her not being from the riding? Or do you just kind of like Occam&#39;s razor, this was about the prime minister, very clearly, very cleanly in that regard. How do you kind of read those results, at least a few hours in retrospect right now?</div>

Leslie Church, on her own, is a very accomplished person. the connection to uh freeland makes her i think even even more of a star and uh the fact that she lost is a uh direct slap in the face to the party i mean this is the leaders and it doesn&#39;t take an awful lot of strategic advice or strategic reflection uh to see that what everybody is talking about is the leader right they&#39;re not talking about uh even the carbon tax uh they&#39;re talking about the leader and the leader&#39;s performance. So I think that this would be impossible to lay at the feet of Leslie Church. It&#39;s impossible to lay at the feet of those who are designing and executing the campaign. And instead, I would say that this is the natural outcome of the leader not being popular. That is Occam&#39;s razor. And I think that we need to uh to</div>

And so that&#39;s an unfortunate consequence, and that&#39;s part of, that&#39;s not on Leslie Church, but that is maybe on the Liberal Party as a whole for not thinking about this thing in terms of what&#39;s most likely to win locally.

And I think that that&#39;s very telling because it&#39;s showing exactly what Pierre Palliev does not want. He doesn&#39;t want to see a leadership—he doesn&#39;t want to oppose someone else. He wants to oppose Justin Trudeau, his unpopular carbon tax, and take this 27-point shift or 26-point shift all across the country. Corey,</div>

You don&#39;t need to run immediately on the budget, but I would. I&#39;d run right on the budget. You&#39;ve got lots of time. You&#39;ve got enough time to do it.

Now you can easily orchestrate your fall and go to the polls if you decide it&#39;s advantageous. But I think you want to start thinking now about how you create that future space. And let me tell you, I&#39;ve worked with a lot of governments and a lot of parties who have sat there in the fourth year and said, oh, we just can&#39;t do the fifth. We would look so weak. I hear that all the time. I see no evidence that the public gives a fuck about this. And by the way, you are weak. You are weak right now. So maybe try to find the time to get out of that hole.</div>

And I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a tell, if they&#39;ve just got micro-targeted slogans for different audiences, but it is now starting to sound like a bunch of word salad. It used to just be axe to tax. Now it&#39;s starting to be every issue under the sun that the liberals are weak on. And guys, conservatives, I&#39;m speaking of, they&#39;re going to be weak on a lot of issues. So are we going to develop a three-word slogan for a lot of these issues?

Because in this democracy, they have to make decisions and people hold on to the decisions they disagree with more than the decisions they agree with. That&#39;s just life. That&#39;s reality. I wonder, as Stephen was was talking this out if there isn&#39;t um let&#39;s i don&#39;t know if i&#39;d call it an opportunity or a risk or both with the liberals given the demographic considerations in toronto st paul&#39;s right 15 percent uh vote of the jewish faith well if you&#39;re the trudeau liberals in a way does this help you hand wave it away say look we we obviously know this is a very charged matter israel hamas war we know that the liberal party has been hearing about it from from all</div>
