            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Wall Street Journal called it the dumbest trade war in history. Like, they pulled no punches. But I think that it&#39;s only the dumbest trade war in history if you assume it&#39;s about trade, because it makes absolutely no sense, right? Like, this idea of a surplus that Canada enjoys with the United States, that&#39;s well-worn. You don&#39;t need to go to this podcast to understand that. It&#39;s nonsense. nonsense it&#39;s like saying that uh you know my grocery store has a surplus with me because i buy more groceries from it like it&#39;s not a subsidy it doesn&#39;t make any it doesn&#39;t track it seems unbelievable to me that donald trump at some point in the past i don&#39;t know his really ancient life hasn&#39;t been told hey man this is what tariffs actually are it&#39;s not the point he knows that he doesn&#39;t care this is not about trade this is not about equality of trade it&#39;s certainly not not about fucking fentanyl which there&#39;s very little of going across the border and i would i would argue as a canadian probably more troubling things coming across the border from the united states in volume than than this uh than this path and um really it&#39;s about two things in my mind it&#39;s it&#39;s about money he wants to have an awful lot of money so that he can move out of having an income tax or at least as as quote unquote high of one it&#39;s not a very high income tax in the United States, but still. And it&#39;s about control. It&#39;s about saying, I&#39;m going to push my weight around. Maybe if I play my cards right, I can get the 51st state. I can get my face put on Mount Rushmore. Everything that he&#39;s done since he&#39;s been reelected has been crazy town. And this is just one in a long line of crazy town. It has nothing to do with trade. We have to stop treating him like he&#39;s a rational actor with legitimate concerns, using trade as a legitimate tool.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, where do you think our Canadian leaders are on that particular wavelength you&#39;ve just mentioned in terms of accepting Trump&#39;s premise versus rejecting it? There&#39;s a spectrum of in terms of where our leaders are at, at least how we sense, but as a collective, where do you think we&#39;re at? And are we far enough down the track of rejecting his fentanyl border premise in some way? How do you think we&#39;re striking that? I shouldn&#39;t say balance, because that&#39;s not the goal. But how do you think we&#39;re doing on this?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, so this is old school diplomacy that the federal government has to do right now. And I&#39;m saying this because I want to preface it with one thing, which is the federal government&#39;s under no obligation to say what they mean. They&#39;re under no obligation to say the same thing in public as they&#39;re saying to the United States privately. privately and</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so if if you were going to judge things entirely by the actions of the canadian government in public you would have to say they&#39;re clearly not far enough along right like they don&#39;t seem to realize this is not a trade war they&#39;re using trade as as uh you know a punitive response here right but i just don&#39;t believe based on reporting around the edges based on some of the word choices that they made and the subtext in it some of the implied threats that are going on that they don&#39;t understand what this is actually about now the canadian government sort of almost has an obligation of trying to look reasonable it&#39;s funny it sucks it&#39;s annoying that we have to deal with donald trump where there&#39;s no such obligation but when it comes to the canadian government on round one at least they kind of have to take trump on his word and be like well it sounds like you&#39;ve got a problem with this well we&#39;ll we&#39;ll try to reasonably do that and it&#39;s not because uh the rest of the world expects it it&#39;s not because canadians want it it&#39;s because the audience if there is any audience that has a chance of reigning in donald trump it&#39;s the it&#39;s the republicans it&#39;s the republican governors it&#39;s the people around him and canada&#39;s trying to remove the the grievances from the table so all that&#39;s left is nonsense i mean it&#39;s nonsense right now but you know what i&#39;m saying and then hope that people will try to pull this thing back back onto the rails.</span>

I think Corey&#39;s point about that, you know, taking this in steps and understanding that our response is going to be kind of a tit for tat to begin with. but will ultimately shift as the knowledge becomes more known to all Canadians. I&#39;m anticipating lots of different shifts from various leaders, but I was really impressed to see David Eby&#39;s response in British Columbia and Doug Ford&#39;s response in Ontario. They both not only jumped on board with what Trudeau was doing, but they went further. um you know i i loved seeing the american alcohol being pulled off of the shelves um that to me it&#39;s it&#39;s just one little thing like it&#39;s not to a warehouse to</span>

            <span class="text">have all that alcohol back, aged one trade war, I&#39;m sure. But I think that the fact is Canadians and most of the politicians that Canadians are represented by seem to realize that the national mood is one of frustration and borderline rage. Like you, of course, have seen all of the sporting events, the hockey games that have happened coast to coast, the Raptors game that happened earlier earlier today the american anthem comes on people are booing they&#39;re booing in calgary they&#39;re booing in vancouver they&#39;re booing in montreal they&#39;re booing in toronto people</span>

You don&#39;t want to go all in before you&#39;ve seen the flop. You certainly have to know that Donald Trump has said he&#39;s going to retaliate to your retaliation.

            <span class="text">disagree with both of you a bit. I think Trudeau was clear on message. But I am curious about picking up on this aspect of, did he need to address Americans? And if so, and even if you disagree, did what he did in that moment punch through? And was that enough in terms of a tactic to reach the American audience? is. Because I will tell you, while we were having this wall-to-wall coverage on CBC and having all of our networks go live to this, including CTV News Channel and CBC and having us glued, CNN was running a Kobe Bryant documentary from the archives. MSNBC was not covering this wall-to-wall. Even this morning on the Sunday news programs, Christopher Freeland appeared on one of them, and tariffs was item number three or four behind the helicopter and FBI agents being smoked out by Trump. So this is, as an issue set, not necessarily registering with America. And I&#39;m adding that as a bit of context to go back to the question, which is, did Trudeau start doing enough to start punching through on it? Corey, I&#39;m curious to hear your, A, does he need to reach Americans? And B, what does he need to do? And is this the start of what he needs to do to punch through?</span>

            <span class="text">on everything but like but all to say it&#39;s never going to be that we&#39;re number one story in this particular matter like you remember the joke in the simpsons in like 1990 where elise is calling a line and uh she&#39;s He&#39;s listening to, you know, the Corey hotline about, because that&#39;s the name of, because it&#39;s a great name for a great celebrity, right? Corey. And he&#39;s reading the newspaper and the joke is supposed to be how boring it is. He&#39;s like, oh, Canada stalls on trade pact. Like that&#39;s, that&#39;s like the definition of a boring line. That&#39;s a punchline. And so Canada and trade is never going to be that interesting to Americans.

But he&#39;s trying to keep Team Canada, you know, including the premiers and all of the various people out there who have opinions and share them on one page. And he&#39;s trying to respond to the United States of America. And one of them is about building equity to allow him to do stronger things on number two.</span>

            <span class="text">give me your analysis on where they find themselves right now. Are they conveniently on an island with each other, or is one of them or two of them more on a mainland with the rest of Team Canada? How do you kind of assess their positioning and current position, either how they&#39;re trying to position themselves or by result of where everyone else has gone, where they find themselves? So I&#39;m going to kind of put them together. Maybe you want to tease them apart. Corey, can I start with you on this?</span>

            <span class="text">mean, you can. I think they have to be teased apart. I think Pierre Polyev is in a very different situation from Daniel Smith. Scott Moe is maybe a little bit in the middle, but I&#39;d put him more on Smith Island. And I&#39;d say Polyev is on a jet ski going by it saying, oh, fuck, I hope they don&#39;t see me. I hope they don&#39;t wave me down. Because he&#39;s in a lot of trouble on this particular one. He&#39;s in a box.

I think Lisa Young wrote a pretty good article about that today. And I just, Daniel Smith wrote in the National Post today about how, oh, they&#39;re an ally. I&#39;m going to talk to them like they&#39;re an ally. This was clearly written before yesterday, I&#39;m assuming, or certainly before Donald Trump started tweeting in response this morning about how really this is all a pretext and he wants us to be the 51st state. The disconnect between reality and the justification Smith is using right now is becoming so stark that even very diehard conservatives are having trouble with it. And so can</span>

But he&#39;s he&#39;s trying to to to show that he&#39;s part of the team while showing that he&#39;s not part of Justin Trudeau&#39;s team, which, frankly, I think I don&#39;t begrudge him that positioning. I think that that&#39;s the position that that he should have. He&#39;s the opposition leader, not the guy that he&#39;s not the deputy prime minister. and he should be in a position where he</span>

            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s interesting, because in some ways, it feels like they&#39;ve consciously taken the dynamic off the table. All of the leadership candidates signing that statement, effectively saying, yeah, we&#39;re with the prime minister. I&#39;m paraphrasing deeply, right? But it&#39;s effectively said, we&#39;re going to let the federal government do the analysis. And by the way, a bit of an aside here, that makes perfect sense. One of the things that I think people fail to appreciate is just how much more you know when you&#39;re in government than when you&#39;re out of government. And yeah, you can read all of the newspaper articles you want. You don&#39;t have a department of trade who&#39;s is going to tell you exactly the consequences of each of these choices for both yourself and your and your allies slash not allies down south you don&#39;t have the knowledge of what the conversations have been with great britain with germany with any of your other potential partners and so you&#39;ve got to sort of let the prime minister cook right you got to let him do his thing this is a time where you&#39;ve really got to rely on the analysis that the federal government is doing doesn&#39;t</span>

You know, that&#39;s a brand they&#39;ve built over decades, if not centuries at this point, or like century plus. It&#39;s a real challenge that he&#39;s got.

And then stemming from there, what sort of campaigns or tactics do we need to run? So, for example, a few things I want to throw out on the table. Do any of our provincial governments or our federal government need to take out a massive, you know, wrap yourself in the flag ad campaign? Do we need to take out specific tactical campaigns as it relates to products, services, common citizenship, civil society, helping one another, etc.? Do we need to go? Where do we need to go here, right?

And then the other part of the feeling is when we all just intuitively and instinctively went out on our front door, on our front step and banged our pots and pans for the frontline workers who are helping us through COVID. Both of those are the feelings that we need to be feeling right now, because we have to wrap ourselves in the flag. We have to understand that we as a collective are under attack we need to understand that we are part of that and we are the defense to it we are we&#39;re going to feel the the uh we are we are the their enemy at this point and then we also have to have this collective sense of it&#39;s going to be tough but we&#39;re going to get through it together because i i think that what we&#39;re not quite understanding yet is</span>

Well, the experience of every war, trade or otherwise, is both sides get hurt. And that hurt sucks. And I disagree that we&#39;re not going to hold a grudge on this. I actually think that one of the things that&#39;s likely to come out of this is a trepidation towards the United States going forward. And this is probably a time where a party could have a serious conversation about what it means to be economically sovereign, militarily sovereign, culturally sovereign. And those lead, again, to some answers that maybe take you away from the conservatives on two out of those three and one of those three the conservatives could very much take on like military sovereignty i mean so it&#39;s going to be interesting to see and and the answer is really quite dependent on who you are and we</span>

I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re actually considering. It&#39;s so funny, I was so in on this liberal leadership contest, I was talking to people, I was trying to figure it all out. And then Trump happened, I got pretty distracted. But I do know it will be a two step process where there is more gating. And that 200 400,000 is going to become 200,000 overnight is going to come to like 150 who who actually vote. This is my prediction. And so the liberal challenge now is going to be that that number is coming down. It&#39;s actually kind of a good add-on from Carter&#39;s last point. It&#39;s the momentum. It&#39;s the trajectory. If you had said to me, 150,000 people vote in this liberal leadership contest, I&#39;d be like, fuck, really? That&#39;s amazing. But now if you&#39;re like, it&#39;s 400. Actually, it&#39;s not going to be 400. It&#39;s 200. Actually, it&#39;s going to be 150.</span>
