        <div class="desc"><p>Some bad trade decisions this week by the Dallas Mavericks and Donald Trump. The gang unpack and build strategies for the Canadian players.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about America announcing tariffs and Canada announcing retaliation. How did the Prime Minister do? What do Poilievre, Smith and the Liberal leadership candidates need to do now? What kind of consensus needs to be built? And do you think Carter is going to try to undercut Hogan by offering to run the campaign for $39 million a month? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

But I think that it&#39;s only the dumbest trade war in history if you assume it&#39;s about trade, because it makes absolutely no sense, right? Like, this idea of a surplus that Canada enjoys with the United States, that&#39;s well-worn. You don&#39;t need to go to this podcast to understand that. It&#39;s nonsense. nonsense it&#39;s like saying that uh you know my grocery store has a surplus with me because i buy more groceries from it like it&#39;s not a subsidy it doesn&#39;t make any it doesn&#39;t track it seems unbelievable to me that donald trump at some point in the past i don&#39;t know his really ancient life hasn&#39;t been told hey man this is what tariffs actually are it&#39;s not the point he knows that he doesn&#39;t care this is not about trade this is not about equality of trade it&#39;s certainly not not about fucking fentanyl which there&#39;s very little of going across the border and i would i would argue as a canadian probably more troubling things coming across the border from the united states in volume than than this uh than this path and um really it&#39;s about two things in my mind it&#39;s it&#39;s about money he wants to have an awful lot of money so that he can move out of having an income tax or at least as as quote unquote high of one it&#39;s not a very high income tax in the United States, but still. And it&#39;s about control. It&#39;s about saying, I&#39;m going to push my weight around. Maybe if I play my cards right, I can get the 51st state. I can get my face put on Mount Rushmore. Everything that he&#39;s done since he&#39;s been reelected has been crazy town. And this is just one in a long line of crazy town. It has nothing to do with trade. We have to stop treating him like he&#39;s a rational actor with legitimate concerns, using trade as a legitimate tool.</div>

I&#39;m anticipating lots of different shifts from various leaders, but I was really impressed to see David Eby&#39;s response in British Columbia and Doug Ford&#39;s response in Ontario.

And if so, and even if you disagree, did what he did in that moment punch through? And was that enough in terms of a tactic to reach the American audience? is. Because I will tell you, while we were having this wall-to-wall coverage on CBC and having all of our networks go live to this, including CTV News Channel and CBC and having us glued, CNN was running a Kobe Bryant documentary from the archives. MSNBC was not covering this wall-to-wall. Even this morning on the Sunday news programs, Christopher Freeland appeared on one of them, and tariffs was item number three or four behind the helicopter and FBI agents being smoked out by Trump. So this is, as an issue set, not necessarily registering with America. And I&#39;m adding that as a bit of context to go back to the question, which is, did Trudeau start doing enough to start punching through on it? Corey, I&#39;m curious to hear your, A, does he need to reach Americans? And B, what does he need to do? And is this the start of what he needs to do to punch through?</div>

But it&#39;s effectively said, we&#39;re going to let the federal government do the analysis. And by the way, a bit of an aside here, that makes perfect sense. One of the things that I think people fail to appreciate is just how much more you know when you&#39;re in government than when you&#39;re out of government. And yeah, you can read all of the newspaper articles you want. You don&#39;t have a department of trade who&#39;s is going to tell you exactly the consequences of each of these choices for both yourself and your and your allies slash not allies down south you don&#39;t have the knowledge of what the conversations have been with great britain with germany with any of your other potential partners and so you&#39;ve got to sort of let the prime minister cook right you got to let him do his thing this is a time where you&#39;ve really got to rely on the analysis that the federal government is doing doesn&#39;t</div>

And then stemming from there, what sort of campaigns or tactics do we need to run? So, for example, a few things I want to throw out on the table. Do any of our provincial governments or our federal government need to take out a massive, you know, wrap yourself in the flag ad campaign? Do we need to take out specific tactical campaigns as it relates to products, services, common citizenship, civil society, helping one another, etc.? Do we need to go? Where do we need to go here, right? And I think we directionally and notionally know, but I&#39;d like to spend a few more minutes strategically talking about what our leaders need the Canadian public to feel.

Well, the experience of every war, trade or otherwise, is both sides get hurt. And that hurt sucks. And I disagree that we&#39;re not going to hold a grudge on this. I actually think that one of the things that&#39;s likely to come out of this is a trepidation towards the United States going forward.

I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re actually considering. It&#39;s so funny, I was so in on this liberal leadership contest, I was talking to people, I was trying to figure it all out. And then Trump happened, I got pretty distracted. But I do know it will be a two step process where there is more gating. And that 200 400,000 is going to become 200,000 overnight is going to come to like 150 who who actually vote. This is my prediction. And so the liberal challenge now is going to be that that number is coming down. It&#39;s actually kind of a good add-on from Carter&#39;s last point. It&#39;s the momentum. It&#39;s the trajectory. If you had said to me, 150,000 people vote in this liberal leadership contest, I&#39;d be like, fuck, really? That&#39;s amazing. But now if you&#39;re like, it&#39;s 400. Actually, it&#39;s not going to be 400. It&#39;s 200. Actually, it&#39;s going to be 150.</div>
