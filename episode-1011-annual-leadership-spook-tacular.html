And of course, those who may not be aware, the U.S. midterms happen in less than 10 days from now. On Tuesday the 8th, there&#39;s an open Senate seat. Pennsylvania is one of the big battlegrounds between Dr. Oz. Yes, that Dr. Oz is running as a Republican, a carpetbagging Republican who, you know, once may have been pro-choice, certainly is not anymore. Once may have been for gun legislation, certainly is not anymore. He&#39;s got the Trump endorsement. He&#39;s running as a Republican.</span>

            <span class="text">Pennsylvania, this guy who&#39;s larger than life, quite literally, over six feet tall, wears hoodies, relatable, blue collar vibe. The reason I bring all of this up, Corey, is that all of this triangulated to a debate where John Fetterman, who&#39;d suffered a stroke five months ago, was in this debate with Dr. Oz. Oz. And this debate did not go well for John Fetterman, mainly because of the fact that he&#39;s still recovering from a stroke. And what</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">what I want to talk about is really this concept of this debate. And in some ways, you might be asking, well, why did John Fetterman&#39;s team agree to this debate? Because it seemed like in some ways, perhaps turning down this debate was a worse option for them. And you had Dr. Oz for months, egging him on saying, you got to debate, you got to debate. This is how we showcase to the voters who&#39;s fit for office. I want to test that assumption after this debate, because for many, and normally, Corey, I would play a clip of this debate. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s appropriate. I don&#39;t want to do that. People can find it online. They can see exactly what happened. But I want to talk about this concept of a debate being an accurate litmus test. We&#39;ve talked about a version of this before. But Corey, give me your sense of it. After seeing clips of this or watching this debate, where Fetterman clearly struggled against Oz, where does the debate as a core construct of how we elect people, or at least a core part of a proof of how we elect people fit in your mind after watching this and experiencing this past week?</span>

Carter, you know, I don&#39;t want to get into that same conversation we always do around the importance of debates, et cetera, because this is different. And I&#39;ll get to what&#39;s different about this conversation in a second. But give me your thoughts here. After either witnessing clips or moments of this debate, whether you did or not, from the Fetterman-Oz debate, where do debates kind of stand in your mind? Give me your table set, and then I&#39;ll move on to the heart of the conversation that I want to focus on for this.</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;m not a really big fan of debates. I think that especially given that debates have been restaged now by media companies to try and make them into something more designed to capture a television audience. We&#39;re going to put 90-second answers with a 30-second rebuttal and no one&#39;s talking. They&#39;re either trying to contain it so that no one&#39;s talking over each other or they&#39;re trying to let it go so that everybody is talking over them. And, you know, I&#39;ve been lucky enough to, you know, Alison Redford went into a debate the Thursday before her leadership vote and her mother just passed on the Tuesday. So, you know, that was one of those types of debates where how is Alison Redford going to lose? You know, personally, I think that John Fetterman should not have stood for Senate this year. He had a massive stroke after the nomination. nation, um, he should have stood down and allowed someone who was healthier to, to, to, to run for this seat. Um,</span>

Uh, one argument coming out is that Fetterman showed that he was working through it. You know, there&#39;s lots of people who&#39;ve who&#39;ve</span>

How nice the takedown or how clean the takedown was of J.D. Vance in 45 seconds versus the rest of the 90 minutes.

            <span class="text">Is there ability to communicate on paper? Is there ability to kind of communicate? And it kind of leads into the conversation of synthesis and distilling. And I don&#39;t mean flowery rhetoric. I mean, clear-eyed sort of executive style thinking around how you would take that 100 pages and mount it down to the one paragraph conclusion. In your mind, how important is that from what you&#39;ve seen? And is there a way that we could test that for our leaders? And you might say, listen, it&#39;s less important in politics than in other executive jobs. But I want to open up that question for both of you and get your take on it. Because as many of us realize that it really comes down to, yes, your ability to orate one to a thousand, one to a million in certain cases. But it&#39;s two things. It&#39;s the one to small communication that we&#39;ve talked about before, the one to the room of 10, but then something we actually don&#39;t talk about a lot, which is your ability in the written word to be clear-eyed and persuasive with your communications.</span>

It&#39;s a very interesting point, but in some ways, Corey, you&#39;ve probably experienced this in your executive world that having a CEO or an executive who can be clear in their communications, super important in that world, whereas politics perhaps slightly different in that sense. I know there&#39;s caveats to all this. Carter, I want to get your take. Corey Corey makes a really good point here. From our workflow, I know how you work because we&#39;ve worked together for a while, but you&#39;re a phone call guy, right? You&#39;re like a short texting, but phone call guy. Yeah, you&#39;re not a writer. I&#39;m a writer. You&#39;re not a writer. I&#39;ve become that too in many ways. And to Carter&#39;s mold, even in my day to day, it&#39;s really about picking up the phone and being like, can we just hash this out? Because it&#39;s going to take me much longer to write it. And it probably won&#39;t be as clear eyed than I can probably explain it to you over the phone. But Carter, talk to me about this. Let&#39;s round out the conversation here. The written word as it relates to our leaders, Corey says, overrated in that sense in terms of a skill to perhaps test. Do you disagree or do you agree?</span>

And it seems to me credible reporting for a couple of reasons. Number one, the sourcing seems to be from a reputable sort of tech publication. But secondly, Carter, $20 a month to get verified seems very much, and keep your verification, seems very much in Elon Musk&#39;s sort of general wheelhouse of A, revenue generation, but B, it&#39;s free speech, right? Right. Like, you know, you got to you want to keep your verification, you</span>

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re one of the journalists who works at a small publication. You can&#39;t afford this. So you lose your verification, and now you don&#39;t get to rise above, so to speak, with your news stories, not in terms of viewership, but in terms of credibility about the information and the quality of your sourcing.

            <span class="text">Corey, there&#39;s a lot of lessons to be learned here around management, around philosophy, around that. You&#39;ve mentioned a few of them. There&#39;s also lessons to be learned here around what the future might hold for this platform. And one of the things I find quite interesting is a lot of individuals, and we&#39;ve seen waves of this in the past, I&#39;ll caveat, but a lot of individuals, some verified, some not, mostly with progressive leanings, are saying, I&#39;m not here for this shit. They&#39;re leaving the platform. Do you suspect that this is... Has Twitter become a public square? And I know this is an age-old question, and by age-old, I mean over the last decade. But is this an inflection moment where people leaving the platform, from a strict political perspective, as we now dig down into our area of expertise, would you advise people to leave this platform? Is it too much of a public square to have your voice heard and amplified and key points of either policy or or politics to be made that you would advise, whether it be a client, a political figure, a political party, to not leave the platform? What do you think?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like Twitter have been free, why things like Facebook are free. And there&#39;s the old cynical answer, you are the product, and that&#39;s sort of true, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true in the way that a lot of other people mean it. um these things have value because of their size it&#39;s what we call the network effect right</span>

You know, I mentioned earlier that next Tuesday, the United States goes to the polls, the Americans go to the polls for their midterms. You&#39;re hearing a lot around the end game strategy for the Democrats in particular, with this term that many people may not be familiar with, called deep canvassing. Have you guys heard of this, this this this term of rather than just simply door knocking in the final days, going door to door canvassing, but actually encouraging empathetic, deep conversations to shift people&#39;s beliefs, using this in the final week or so to kind of move the vote, especially in these close areas, including the Pennsylvanias, Ohio&#39;s and Georgia&#39;s that we&#39;ve talked about. Now, Corey, trick or treat, deep canvassing as a political tactic or strategy, is it a bit of a trick or is it actually quite a treat in the sense that it is a useful political tactic?</span>

            <span class="text">Stephen Carter, I&#39;m going to move on to our next question. Is this a trick or a treat for the federal liberals? The cost of the Arrive Can app, Carter, many saying, including the opposition, that this thing could have been built for less than a million bucks, not its projected $55 million cost. Now, in the grand scheme of pandemic spending, this was a drop in the bucket. But as we talk about quite often, not</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">not that we know what $54 million looks like. We know what an app looks like. We know what its functionality was. We can kind of ballpark that as layman, in, so to speak. Is this a trick for the liberals? Is this pretty tricky or is this going to be a slightly palatable, maybe not so tasty treat that they can stomach at the end of the day?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">trick and a treat. And I&#39;m going to tell you why. It&#39;s a trick because we all know we could build this app for a lot less. I think the three of us would be able to commit. Well, when I say the three of us, I mean, Corey, to build this app for a lot less money. Probably build it tonight.</span>

            <span class="text">We weren&#39;t dealing with the bureaucracy. We weren&#39;t dealing with the panic. We weren&#39;t dealing with all the various challenges that were coming forward. And frankly, I think this is where the treat comes in. People have a really hard time relating to $54 million. They have a way easier time relating to a $16 glass of orange juice or $1,000 a month for a committee meeting that never happened. Those types of things that people can immediately relate to are far more damaging than it costs $54 million to produce an app that most people don&#39;t know how to build an app. They have no, they have no comparatives.</span>

            <span class="text">It&#39;s funny because I think the general public are going to say, I don&#39;t really know. You know, it&#39;s not quite the billion dollar long gun registry. doesn&#39;t quite have that impact. And I think that people are pretty used to massive cost overruns on tech programs. And I think that a very in the know audience will also look at it and say, well, you know what, it seems too high, but there&#39;s a lot of things that justify that expense, which I&#39;m going to kind of try to quickly outline in a second here. It&#39;s the group in the middle that it&#39;s very tricky with, right? And that includes people like reporters who will say, okay, explain to me how, Because I think I understand the complexity of this app. It is basically just what we call a crud app, right? Or at least it appears on the surface, you know, create, read, update, destroy. It&#39;s just changing records around. You&#39;re just adding information to records. But it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s not so simple, right? Like the difficulty in an app for the federal government is not in the coding. Like, I mean, I was joking about doing it in one night, but it&#39;s not a huge lift to build an app like this. The complexity comes from the integrations that need to occur, the changing scope that&#39;s going to happen along the way as you bring in all of these various departments. Obviously, the security requirements, we&#39;re not keeping what&#39;s your favorite flavor of bubble gum in this app. We&#39;re keeping information</span>

            <span class="text">in aggregate. And the challenge was it couldn&#39;t because it was all using magnetic reel-to-reel from the 70s and 80s. And it didn&#39;t have like a database that was naturally able to be kind of SQL queried in that particular fashion. It just wasn&#39;t possible because we&#39;re not using the latest and greatest in government. Governments are early adapters. They&#39;re big institutional adapters. Change costs are enormous. And it may have been a situation where somebody said, okay, we can build an app that should cost us 10 million for 55 million, or</span>

            <span class="text">what do you think the fail rate is acceptable in government? Because it&#39;s basically 0%. These things have to be always on, always working. And that adds a lot to cost because you&#39;ve got to build in a ton of redundancy as a result. So this is not something that your neighbor could build. I just want to underline that.
