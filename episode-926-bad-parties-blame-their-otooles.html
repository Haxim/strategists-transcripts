        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Conservative Party of Canada policy convention. What does Erin O'Toole's keynote tell us about the upcoming election? Did the Conservatives sign their political death warrant by voting against climate change being real? And will the young up-and-comer Corey Hogan invite Stephen Carter to his 40th birthday party this year? Zain Velji, as he does every year, picks the headlines and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">well we had different ones carter and i uh carter thought it would be a speech to the base i thought it would be a speech to middle I think that I was largely right, but what I was struck by was how much Aaron O&#39;Toole tried to talk to both audiences at the same time. It was definitely a speech more for Canadians writ large than it was for the party, in my opinion. Certainly when you saw what happened the next day and how the party rejected some of the things that were in his speech, it&#39;s hard to come to any other conclusion. But he talked about the need for the Conservative Party to change. And that is really also, as much as that may seem like a message directed towards the base, that&#39;s really a message directed towards Canadians saying that the Conservative Party will change. Yeah,</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">I mean, it was an opportunity to kind of take the limelight that he was given and make a big show of it, make a show of change being the mantra. In fact, he was very non-specific about the nature of change that he would have relative to what the Conservative Party had offered in the past. But that change mantra was strong. I mean, the most concrete component in his speech about what he would change was the approach to climate change, right? That climate change is real, and the Conservative Party will act on climate change with a serious and substantive policy to be released at a later date. He did also say it wouldn&#39;t include like a carbon tax, but nonetheless, he talked about a serious and substantive policy coming down the line. So imagine his surprise. Well, I guess that&#39;s your next segment, so I won&#39;t even go there. No, but he was directing towards Canada, and I think that if his party had played ball, it wouldn&#39;t have been such a bad way to tee up a reintroduction to the country.</div>

I&#39;m not sure, though, that it&#39;s a play that will actually work because there&#39;s so much coming, so much largesse coming from the liberal government that it&#39;s very difficult, I think, for the NDP supporters that may be shaken a little bit by Singh&#39;s weakness to just jump over the liberal party that seems to be so focused on delivering a more progressive view.</div>

But it&#39;s interesting, because Carter and I have given sort of two different versions of this speech. One is you anchor it and you make it more conventional speech. And mine was like, if you&#39;re going to do that, go all in. But I think that the failure to commit to either one of those approaches was not his friend.

This was kind of subtle in some ways in what he was saying, but certainly not subtle in what was behind him, which was this larger mantra of recovery, you know, securing Canada&#39;s recovery. And I&#39;m paraphrasing that because I don&#39;t remember the exact phrasing that was behind him when he was speaking. But this whole concept of recovery and securing the future as part of Canada&#39;s recovery plan, it almost seemed to me that he was saying Justin Trudeau was Canada&#39;s pandemic prime minister, but I&#39;m your recovery prime minister in some ways. I&#39;m kind of curious if you saw that or if I&#39;m just injecting and perhaps making that connective tissue. And if so, do you feel like that could be an effective overall framing for him as much as Corey&#39;s version of how to frame Trudeau in terms of his great rebuild as well?

These are words, these are concepts that came through the speech. He used the phrase, I want to, I think it was like, I want to create a path of security and certainty, something about security and certainty. That was his chosen framing there.

He talked about Trudeau wanting to reimagine the economy a couple of times with scare quotes, you know, like reimagining this economy, this idea of Ottawa knows best, this unethical government that is going to make the connected few really, really advantageous during this reimagined economic time, but was ultimately an unreliable leader who tried risky things that hurt the Canadian economy. So you can really see the contrast, right? Like, risk and unethical versus secure, certainty, steady, honest. Like, it&#39;s quite clear what they&#39;re trying to build out of this. The speech has words that are chosen, obviously, with care, because they&#39;re repeated regularly and at intervals, both throughout this speech and then in all of the corresponding materials around it. So, I mean,</div>

Yes, indeed, guys, conservative delegates, as Corey has mentioned a few times, the very next morning after this well-planned, well-staged and, you know, largely well-delivered speech by Aaron O&#39;Toole rejected adding green-friendly statements to the policy book, including a line that it would have stated the party believes in, quote, climate change is real, unquote, and is willing to act on it.</div>

          <div class="said">Delegates on the issue rebuked a climate change policy by a margin of 54 to 46. The breakdown, which I find interesting, I&#39;m just going to kind of go into the breakdown just to kind of add some further context by province. The Atlantic provinces and delegates from New Brunswick were 70% on side. The BC no side had just a two-point edge, while the vote was much more lopsided in Saskatchewan, 73 points against. The territories, 69 points against. Alberta, 62 points against. And Ontario, 58 points against. I wanted to throw some of those geographic elements onto there for obvious reasons as we&#39;ll get into it. And a double majority of delegates, a majority of delegates must agree to the official policy change. So we&#39;ve talked about how these policy conventions at the end of the day, as it relates to the policy that is presented by the party at the end, really don&#39;t matter. But</div>

I mean, that is a headline-grabbing moment to say that there&#39;s a guy here that&#39;s trying to quite literally drag his party to a path that he feels like is most viable to forming government. I have a question for you, hypothetical. Suppose that this had gone 51-49 in a victory for O&#39;Toole, that they said, yeah, let&#39;s acknowledge it. Would we be having this similar conversation and kind of what would have changed these four percentage points? I know there&#39;s no real value, you but i&#39;m curious what it would have meant from your your perspective if if it went the other way by a point or two well</div>

Maybe the fact that it got lost and you can set up this fight and you can – I don&#39;t even know what it is, but I don&#39;t know. Go to war with somebody somewhere in your own party and say this is just the way it is. If you don&#39;t like it, get the fuck out. Maybe that&#39;s what O&#39;Toole needs to do here. But there is a problem with the party. This is a problem with the party, not the leader right now. Now, the polling on this is crystal clear. Canadians believe in climate change. Canadians want action on climate change. We&#39;re talking like four to one. Like this is not something that&#39;s deeply ambiguous here. And I guess this is fundamentally also</div>

And I don&#39;t have a problem with it as long as the grassroots are going to take that responsibility seriously and think in a general sense about things. But let me put it this way. Parties need to do more to invest in their grassroots and not just siphon them for cash because this is the inevitable conclusion of that. The same people who are animated to respond to these breathless fundraising emails are the ones who are electing delegates and going to convention these days.

And to your point, Corey, you know, this was a party, the conservatives, that got in front of micro-targeting first, that used that technology first. If you recall, I mean, I&#39;m sure you guys do is what, six, seven, eight years ago, we were talking about Sims, the conservative database and its sophistication, and how it was so much better than the liberals. And then, you know, this is getting into nerd talk of political data and how the liberals had to go to the Democrats in the US and borrow their political tool and create liberalists to try to compete in that 15 cycle. I mean, this is the stuff that is underneath the iceberg on a digital marketing, organizing, political strategy level that gets, at the end of the day, people riled up and engaged in these systems.

          <div class="said">You guys have talked about this thing as though it is a, you know, the micro-targeting, the message pushing is one of, you know, it&#39;s the only problem. There&#39;s another problem, too, and that is that a small interest group, a small group of people will come and take over a party. And what we&#39;re seeing, like, so two, there were two big initiatives that were voted down by the conservative memberships this weekend. The first, of course, everybody&#39;s talking about the climate change thing. The other was medically assisted suicide. suicide both climate change and medically assisted suicide in the right terminology in the right language have 80th percentile support of canadians the 20th percentile you know the two the two and ten that don&#39;t support it are all conservative members now right they have taken over that party in order to have that political opinion and that&#39;s the other thing that i think is is kind of interesting about this grassroots initiative that cory was speaking to right like the the shift that it happens by putting all of your effort into a grassroots party and allowing the grassroots to speak means that you attract some pretty unique grassroots. And the grassroots that is now attracted to the conservatives tend to be more religious than the average population. They tend to have different social conservatives and socially conservative views.

And you can see some of that when we were talking in the last episode about Sam Osterhoff. He comes from a particular part of the party for the Doug Ford conservatives that they&#39;ve tried to push away, but it keeps coming back in because this is the place that they find their voice and they feel like they have power because they do have power.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the right strategy if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to say, to paraphrase what Stephen said. But it was not right that they didn&#39;t know what to say. They should have been able to envision a world in which this occurred, and they should have had some sort of lines ready to deal with it. Maybe he goes up and he says the party was wrong, and every leader gets a chip they can use once, and I&#39;m throwing it down now. I don&#39;t care how they voted on this. Climate change is real, and you can expect a robust plan from the Conservative Party on this. Maybe, if that&#39;s what you want to do. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of going up and saying, well, the party has said they want climate change plus a bunch of things in there. Well, I didn&#39;t hear that they rejected climate change. I heard it was too narrow and that our environmental plan needs to be bigger. So that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re going to see. I think he should have said something. I think he should have done some effort to frame this thing out and allow the conversation not to get away from him right now in the way that it is. I mean, right now, people are talking about it as though, and I don&#39;t know that people are wrong, that they have effectively written the next liberal campaign ad here.</div>

          <div class="said">suppose so. I would be curious to flesh that one out. I&#39;m still not sure it&#39;s a great idea, but it&#39;s something to at least explore whether there is a villain within your own party that you can go to war with. And it doesn&#39;t need to be a person. It can be an institution. It can be the way things are set up. We didn&#39;t even talk about how the party also discussed and adopted changes to how leaders are elected in kind of a tacit rebuke of O&#39;Toole as well, because if that system had been in place, perhaps he would not be leader. So this was not a very friendly policy convention crowd to him there. And we did talk a couple of weeks ago now about being able to sort of say this was a very unusual policy convention. It is not reflective of the membership. If you want to do that, then you better explain how you&#39;re going to find a way to get more reflective of the membership down the road. Maybe you call a council of all of the constituency presidents and you say, what are we going to do about this? I don&#39;t know. I am spitballing here and it would take an understanding of the Conservative Party that I just do not carry. But I don&#39;t actually know that you can just go quiet for three weeks and then come back. And I don&#39;t think, Stephen, you&#39;re saying act as though nothing&#39;s happened, but I don&#39;t think you can do that. I think it actually is going to require something more forceful right now saying, well, that was wrong. I didn&#39;t agree with that. Or, well, the party told me all of the things I said, that&#39;s got to be broader. So we&#39;re going to do that now. But make no mistake, this is going to be a strong policy. I&#39;m not going to be cowed on this one. We&#39;re going to move forward. and</div>

And this is what I&#39;m going to task each of you to do, is to put together a 30-second pitch for a bit, maybe a pitch for what a 30-second spot could look like. Let me be more articulate. And Carter and Corey, I&#39;m going to give you each separate Carter, you are on the pack that is anti-Aaron O&#39;Toole. So you&#39;ve witnessed a bunch of stuff this weekend to use as fodder. This ad needs to go out tomorrow morning and we are here on Sunday night. You&#39;re pitching this group of funders as to what this spot needs to look like. So I&#39;m going to give you that task. You&#39;re doing the anti-O&#39;Toole 30-second spot. What does it include? Is it a VO? Is it not? not, Corey, you&#39;re doing the opposite. You&#39;re taking what you saw this weekend, and you&#39;re saying, oh, shit, this was a bit of a shitstorm. And your PAC has told you, Corey, we need a 30 second spot. We&#39;re giving you $2 million for distribution to air it across the country. We just need you to tell us what it says. What is it going to say about Aaron O&#39;Toole and his leadership? What is it going to say? What is it going to highlight? So while I give you a couple of seconds to think, I&#39;m going to try to do some delay tactics of my own. Of course, I planned on none of this. So Carter, I&#39;ll come to you in about 15 seconds. In the meantime, I do want to talk about tonight&#39;s episode sponsor, Air Canada. Now, Air Canada has been a long time sponsor of this podcast. Now, the thing is, we haven&#39;t mentioned Air Canada in a very long time. And it&#39;s because they told us not to. And I&#39;m so glad that they finally have come out of the closet and have told us that yes indeed we can mention them on air um in fact we&#39;re really looking forward to getting their uh their their sponsorship package uh which along which will include of course their um their letter of telling me to shut the fuck up which will go directly to cory so if you want to send that to him please send it to to cory uh directly thank you fine folks at air canada uh looking forward to your bailout uh stephen carter time</div>

          <div class="said">Underrated, especially if they&#39;re out of step with the leader. We I&#39;ve been in a party system where the leader was significantly out of step with the party president. And it&#39;s excruciating. It is a fight every single day because the party apparatus must work together with the leader&#39;s office and the caucus. And if any of those three are out of step, it is a nightmare to try and run a political organization.</div>

          <div class="said">Overrated. Overrated. I have seen a lot of party presidents for a lot of parties come and go. And to be honest, it&#39;s really hard to delineate when one&#39;s tenure begins and the other ends because they&#39;re just not that consequential to the day-to-day operations of the party. And the size of these councils these days is large enough that they&#39;re one vote. It&#39;s not a big deal.</div>
