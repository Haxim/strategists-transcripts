You could take that in many directions. Color of the hats. Are they similar or different? Head coverings overall. Why are we wearing hats?

          </div>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s talk about the speech let&#39;s talk about the speech expectations get those from you again based on some of the previous conversations we&#39;ve had to recalibrate what the expectations were for Aaron O&#39;Toole heading into Friday night then let&#39;s actually break down his speech from content style substance staging as we often do with political speeches and get your sense on what what you found in each of those. And then we&#39;ll use another entire segment, if not the bulk of this episode, to talk about what literally happens 12 hours after Harold O&#39;Toole gives that speech. Because I do think divorcing it might not be the right sort of frame, but I think I want to address it almost independently. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I feel like it&#39;s totally not the right frame. How do we talk about the speech without talking about the fact that his party rejected his speech effectively within</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay and steven carter is one of them because he&#39;s putting up his hand i&#39;m like i&#39;m stuck i&#39;m</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">i&#39;m gonna i&#39;m actually gonna do a pretty quick drive by which is which is why i wanted to do it this way because i don&#39;t want these thoughts to be muddied overall um cory let&#39;s start here what were the expectations for for otul heading into this speech well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">well we had different ones carter and i uh carter thought it would be a speech to the base i thought it would be a speech to middle I think that I was largely right, but what I was struck by was how much Aaron O&#39;Toole tried to talk to both audiences at the same time. It was definitely a speech more for Canadians writ large than it was for the party, in my opinion. Certainly when you saw what happened the next day and how the party rejected some of the things that were in his speech, it&#39;s hard to come to any other conclusion. But he talked about the need for the Conservative Party to change. And that is really also, as much as that may seem like a message directed towards the base, that&#39;s really a message directed towards Canadians saying that the Conservative Party will change. Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, it was an opportunity to kind of take the limelight that he was given and make a big show of it, make a show of change being the mantra. In fact, he was very non-specific about the nature of change that he would have relative to what the Conservative Party had offered in the past. But that change mantra was strong. I mean, the most concrete component in his speech about what he would change was the approach to climate change, right? That climate change is real, and the Conservative Party will act on climate change with a serious and substantive policy to be released at a later date. He did also say it wouldn&#39;t include like a carbon tax, but nonetheless, he talked about a serious and substantive policy coming down the line. So imagine his surprise. Well, I guess that&#39;s your next segment, so I won&#39;t even go there. No, but he was directing towards Canada, and I think that if his party had played ball, it wouldn&#39;t have been such a bad way to tee up a reintroduction to the country.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s get the table stakes set from you. What was he trying to do from what you saw? Why do you think it was divergent from what you expected to happen going into Friday?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s be clear. that Aaron O&#39;Toole listens to the podcast and he thought, you know what I&#39;m going to do? I&#39;m going to listen to Corey Hogan because that Corey Hogan, he&#39;s a young whippersnapper. He&#39;s just an up-and-comer. He&#39;s going to have the right ideas, right? And he ignored Stephen Carter. And Stephen Carter was just sitting on the side like, what the hell just happened? Except he listened to Corey when he should have listened to me</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

And that&#39;s scary. And that should concern us all. And I said back in September, and I still think now that&#39;s a pretty good message, because I think ultimately after a year of total upheaval, as much as we might want to kind of intellectually build back better, quote unquote, whatever the Trudeau government manages</span>

You can&#39;t move from the far left to the far right. That&#39;s impossible. But that requires a logic that doesn&#39;t exist in terms of the average voter.

There&#39;s no saying, well, you have to stamp my passport at the liberal stop before I can move on to the conservative stop. So that was a really interesting play because it exists in real life. And I think that it&#39;s also something that could be existing right now. I&#39;m not sure, though, that it&#39;s a play that will actually work because there&#39;s so much coming, so much largesse coming from the liberal government that it&#39;s very difficult, I think, for the NDP supporters that may be shaken a little bit by Singh&#39;s weakness to just jump over the liberal party that seems to be so focused on delivering a more progressive view.</span>

They have a set of values that is all over the place.

There&#39;s future focus versus right now, which will have a lot to do with how you&#39;re feeling secure or not. And to Carter&#39;s point, there&#39;s principled versus unprincipled. And some people would rather take somebody principled they disagree with than somebody they perceive as unprincipled. It&#39;s the old Alexander Hamilton, you know, not endorsing Aaron Burr, if you&#39;re a fan of musical theater and or history. So the reality is the orange-blue shift, that&#39;s not such an uncommon thing. Like, they don&#39;t have to jump over, quote-unquote, jump over the liberals.

We&#39;re always center stage when we do these speeches. Why? Why aren&#39;t you standing, you know, stage left front, right? Like, why are we always standing center stage?

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">It could have added some interest because he was walking around a stage and it was a TED Talk minus the thing that makes a TED Talk a TED Talk, right? Which is you&#39;ve got your presentation behind you. And so I thought that was a bit of a miss on that front. But it&#39;s interesting, because Carter and I have given sort of two different versions of this speech. One is you anchor it and you make it more conventional speech. And mine was like, if you&#39;re going to do that, go all in. But I think that the failure to commit to either one of those approaches was not his friend. But again, I don&#39;t know if that matters that that much. It&#39;s just the two of us kind of digging deep on some of those details. I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">have one final question, which I should have asked you earlier, both of you, around framing. This was kind of subtle in some ways in what he was saying, but certainly not subtle in what was behind him, which was this larger mantra of recovery, you know, securing Canada&#39;s recovery. And I&#39;m paraphrasing that because I don&#39;t remember the exact phrasing that was behind him when he was speaking. But this whole concept of recovery and securing the future as part of Canada&#39;s recovery plan, it almost seemed to me that he was saying Justin Trudeau was Canada&#39;s pandemic prime minister, but I&#39;m your recovery prime minister in some ways. I&#39;m kind of curious if you saw that or if I&#39;m just injecting and perhaps making that connective tissue. And if so, do you feel like that could be an effective overall framing for him as much as Corey&#39;s version of how to frame Trudeau in terms of his great rebuild as well? Maybe Carter, I&#39;ll start with you on that particular point.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think that that&#39;s exactly right, Zane. I think that he is talking about, you know, his graphic from this morning of we need to restore, we need to restore, we need to restore. I mean, it&#39;s not even subtle. You know, they want to take us back to some sort of imagined prosperity that they think that Canadians are desiring.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">desiring. And that, I think, could work really well. I mean, we&#39;ve talked on the podcast that at some point, the optimism getting this of us getting out of the pandemic is going to quickly change to the reality of our economic situation. And what O&#39;Toole is trying to foreshadow is that change. And if the election happens, and I think this is the challenge that the liberals are facing. The liberals have said, basically, we&#39;re going to have an election in 2021 because they are afraid that,</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">This is O&#39;Toole foreshadowing that and trying to make that the central question of the election. Who do you trust with your economic recovery?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And if that&#39;s the question of the election, I&#39;m fascinated to see how Canadians will respond. Will they respond with, as they have in the past, many, many times, the Conservatives? Or will they respond with, I&#39;m going to stay with the people who brung us. We&#39;re going to dance with the people who brung us. We&#39;re going to stay with the Liberals. Right now, that&#39;s the situation. But</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But the Liberals seem to be desperate to get this election to happen before that economic light switch turns on. And I think you&#39;re seeing O&#39;Toole jump on that by focusing on recovery, focusing on restoration, you know, get us back, bring Canada back, versus, you know, some of the other messaging that Trudeau might steal from Biden.</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, O&#39;Toole really leaned into recovery. You talked about, you know, it was Canada&#39;s recovery plan. And then every single one of the bullets underneath started with secure. You know, recovery inherently means going back secure, safe, steady. These are words, these are concepts that came through the speech. He used the phrase, I want to, I think it was like, I want to create a path of security and certainty, something about security and certainty. That was his chosen framing there. Meanwhile, he talked about Trudeau as risky, talking about untested changes. He talked about Trudeau wanting to reimagine the economy a couple of times with scare quotes, you know, like reimagining this economy, this idea of Ottawa knows best, this unethical government that is going to make the connected few really, really advantageous during this reimagined economic time, but was ultimately an unreliable leader who tried risky things that hurt the Canadian economy. So you can really see the contrast, right? Like, risk and unethical versus secure, certainty, steady, honest. Like, it&#39;s quite clear what they&#39;re trying to build out of this. The speech has words that are chosen, obviously, with care, because they&#39;re repeated regularly and at intervals, both throughout this speech and then in all of the corresponding materials around it. So, I mean,</span>

            <span class="text">Let&#39;s move it on to our next segment. Our next segment, this TED Talk has an open bar for day drinking. Yes, indeed, guys, conservative delegates, as Corey has mentioned a few times, the very next morning after this well-planned, well-staged and, you know, largely well-delivered speech by Aaron O&#39;Toole rejected adding green-friendly statements to the policy book, including a line that it would have stated the party believes in, quote, climate change is real, unquote, and is willing to act on it.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Delegates on the issue rebuked a climate change policy by a margin of 54 to 46. The breakdown, which I find interesting, I&#39;m just going to kind of go into the breakdown just to kind of add some further context by province. The Atlantic provinces and delegates from New Brunswick were 70% on side. The BC no side had just a two-point edge, while the vote was much more lopsided in Saskatchewan, 73 points against. The territories, 69 points against. Alberta, 62 points against. And Ontario, 58 points against. I wanted to throw some of those geographic elements onto there for obvious reasons as we&#39;ll get into it. And a double majority of delegates, a majority of delegates must agree to the official policy change. So we&#39;ve talked about how these policy conventions at the end of the day, as it relates to the policy that is presented by the party at the end, really don&#39;t matter. But</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">primarily just because of timing. All of the headlines, all the positive headlines that could have occurred or would have occurred out of O&#39;Toole&#39;s speech were all undermined by 9 o&#39;clock the next morning.

And when you miss, not only just the negative headlines, but the potential positive headlines being undermined by your own actions, that&#39;s death in politics.</span>

            <span class="text">undercut like that by his party, regardless of when the timing was, it shows just a total disconnect between the leadership and the grassroots. And he needs to be able to explain this. Already, you&#39;re starting to see comments like, well, some of the votes were in before, you know, before Aaron O&#39;Toole made the statement that</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that we believe in climate change. that&#39;s actually not very comforting uh let me just say um but then there is also going to be comments like well the problem was that it talked about co2 at the exclusion of other things within the environment and we didn&#39;t want to elevate one we wanted to talk about all of them also not great because most canadians see this as an existential crisis and something that that warrants special attention shall we say um but i also don&#39;t think that</span>

There is a bit of like, you know, nothing in life is as good or as bad as you think it is. Maybe there&#39;s even an opportunity here because now Canadians are very much aware of the difference between Aaron O&#39;Toole and his party, perhaps in a fashion they were not the week before. And there could be some power in that because right now Aaron O&#39;Toole is dragging a lot of his party&#39;s attributes around with him.

I want to talk about that in detail. Carter, let&#39;s address an element that Corey also brought up in terms of how impactful this could be, right? So how bad was it in the moment in terms of the weekend, right, that was for Aaron O&#39;Toole? Because this was a lot of effort, time, resources into getting to this weekend. end. So it doesn&#39;t help that this is, you know, perhaps the major headline. O&#39;Toole gives a TED Talk speech to mix reviews, and then that gets usurped with, and his party tells him to go fuck himself, right? But let&#39;s address the second part of Corey&#39;s sort of analysis there. How impactful do you think this will be in the long term? And do you feel like there is perhaps silver lining to perhaps even alluding to what Corey mentioned as how O&#39;Toole could jujitsu</span>

I mean, that is a headline-grabbing moment to say that there&#39;s a guy here that&#39;s trying to quite literally drag his party to a path that he feels like is most viable to forming government. I have a question for you, hypothetical. Suppose that this had gone 51-49 in a victory for O&#39;Toole, that they said, yeah, let&#39;s acknowledge it. Would we be having this similar conversation and kind of what would have changed these four percentage points? I know there&#39;s no real value, you but i&#39;m curious what it would have meant from your your perspective if if it went the other way by a point or two well</span>

Maybe the fact that it got lost and you can set up this fight and you can – I don&#39;t even know what it is, but I don&#39;t know. Go to war with somebody somewhere in your own party and say this is just the way it is. If you don&#39;t like it, get the fuck out. Maybe that&#39;s what O&#39;Toole needs to do here. But there is a problem with the party. This is a problem with the party, not the leader right now. Now, the polling on this is crystal clear. Canadians believe in climate change. Canadians want action on climate change. We&#39;re talking like four to one. Like this is not something that&#39;s deeply ambiguous here. And I guess this is fundamentally also</span>

            <span class="text">also a problem with how grassroots now run political parties. And I don&#39;t have a problem with it as long as the grassroots are going to take that responsibility seriously and think in a general sense about things. But let me put it this way. Parties need to do more to invest in their grassroots and not just siphon them for cash because this is the inevitable conclusion of that. The same people who are animated to respond to these breathless fundraising emails are the ones who are electing delegates and going to convention these days. And so they get riled up to open up their checkbooks. They get told these extreme fairy tales about what things</span>

            <span class="text">good point. But, you know, this is an unintended consequence of these things. There was a lot, a lot to dislike about being able to take huge checks from Bay Street. I wouldn&#39;t recommend going back to those days. But it had a moderated influence. And if you had extreme positions, you were not going to get money from them here. And now we have sort of the opposite. So I think we need to look at our system and say, how</span>

I&#39;m very worried that all of a sudden, the impetus is to be wild and extreme. And and that is causing these kinds of consequences down the road, because what party in their right mind does this to their leader? Right,</span>

            <span class="text">Right, right. And unless they reject the fact that he&#39;s representing what they care about. And to your point, Corey, you know, this was a party, the conservatives, that got in front of micro-targeting first, that used that technology first. If you recall, I mean, I&#39;m sure you guys do is what, six, seven, eight years ago, we were talking about Sims, the conservative database and its sophistication, and how it was so much better than the liberals. And then, you know, this is getting into nerd talk of political data and how the liberals had to go to the Democrats in the US and borrow their political tool and create liberalists to try to compete in that 15 cycle. I mean, this is the stuff that is underneath the iceberg on a digital marketing, organizing, political strategy level that gets, at the end of the day, people riled up and engaged in these systems. I&#39;m glad you made that point.</span>

            <span class="text">able to, Carter, I&#39;m coming to you in a second, also being able to not just do that, but I think the added layer of sophistication in the last half decade has been to find more people like you, to say, how do I, you know, I&#39;ve got one of these, how do I find 10 more and bring them into the fold and have an added suite of tools to be able to do that? Carter, sorry, we&#39;ve been talking a lot. I&#39;m giving you the floor on both questions, either if you want to hit on the political tech side, which now I want to cover at some point, But also the 5149 question, which kind of led me to start this, was would we be having a similar conversation had O&#39;Toole won this by one, two, even five points on the other side of the equation?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You guys have talked about this thing as though it is a, you know, the micro-targeting, the message pushing is one of, you know, it&#39;s the only problem. There&#39;s another problem, too, and that is that a small interest group, a small group of people will come and take over a party. And what we&#39;re seeing, like, so two, there were two big initiatives that were voted down by the conservative memberships this weekend. The first, of course, everybody&#39;s talking about the climate change thing. The other was medically assisted suicide. suicide both climate change and medically assisted suicide in the right terminology in the right language have 80th percentile support of canadians the 20th percentile you know the two the two and ten that don&#39;t support it are all conservative members now right they have taken over that party in order to have that political opinion and that&#39;s the other thing that i think is is kind of interesting about this grassroots initiative that cory was speaking to right like the the shift that it happens by putting all of your effort into a grassroots party and allowing the grassroots to speak means that you attract some pretty unique grassroots. And the grassroots that is now attracted to the conservatives tend to be more religious than the average population. They tend to have different social conservatives and socially conservative views. And they make</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">make it so So that the actual party, because they believe these things so strongly, is hampered. And you can see some of that when we were talking in the last episode about Sam Osterhoff. He comes from a particular part of the party for the Doug Ford conservatives that they&#39;ve tried to push away, but it keeps coming back in because this is the place that they find their voice and they feel like they have power because they do have power. They don&#39;t have two in 10 wins you nothing in a federal election.</span>

We&#39;re only going to put out our speech on Friday. We&#39;re going to make them cover it for three full days. We&#39;ll put out our little infographics. We&#39;ll do our little thing.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the right strategy if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re going to say, to paraphrase what Stephen said. But it was not right that they didn&#39;t know what to say. They should have been able to envision a world in which this occurred, and they should have had some sort of lines ready to deal with it. Maybe he goes up and he says the party was wrong, and every leader gets a chip they can use once, and I&#39;m throwing it down now. I don&#39;t care how they voted on this. Climate change is real, and you can expect a robust plan from the Conservative Party on this. Maybe, if that&#39;s what you want to do. Maybe it&#39;s a matter of going up and saying, well, the party has said they want climate change plus a bunch of things in there. Well, I didn&#39;t hear that they rejected climate change. I heard it was too narrow and that our environmental plan needs to be bigger. So that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;re going to see. I think he should have said something. I think he should have done some effort to frame this thing out and allow the conversation not to get away from him right now in the way that it is. I mean, right now, people are talking about it as though, and I don&#39;t know that people are wrong, that they have effectively written the next liberal campaign ad here.</span>

            <span class="text">suppose so. I would be curious to flesh that one out. I&#39;m still not sure it&#39;s a great idea, but it&#39;s something to at least explore whether there is a villain within your own party that you can go to war with. And it doesn&#39;t need to be a person. It can be an institution. It can be the way things are set up. We didn&#39;t even talk about how the party also discussed and adopted changes to how leaders are elected in kind of a tacit rebuke of O&#39;Toole as well, because if that system had been in place, perhaps he would not be leader. So this was not a very friendly policy convention crowd to him there. And we did talk a couple of weeks ago now about being able to sort of say this was a very unusual policy convention. It is not reflective of the membership. If you want to do that, then you better explain how you&#39;re going to find a way to get more reflective of the membership down the road. Maybe you call a council of all of the constituency presidents and you say, what are we going to do about this? I don&#39;t know. I am spitballing here and it would take an understanding of the Conservative Party that I just do not carry. But I don&#39;t actually know that you can just go quiet for three weeks and then come back. And I don&#39;t think, Stephen, you&#39;re saying act as though nothing&#39;s happened, but I don&#39;t think you can do that. I think it actually is going to require something more forceful right now saying, well, that was wrong. I didn&#39;t agree with that. Or, well, the party told me all of the things I said, that&#39;s got to be broader. So we&#39;re going to do that now. But make no mistake, this is going to be a strong policy. I&#39;m not going to be cowed on this one. We&#39;re going to move forward. and</span>

And this is what I&#39;m going to task each of you to do, is to put together a 30-second pitch for a bit, maybe a pitch for what a 30-second spot could look like. Let me be more articulate. And Carter and Corey, I&#39;m going to give you each separate Carter, you are on the pack that is anti-Aaron O&#39;Toole. So you&#39;ve witnessed a bunch of stuff this weekend to use as fodder. This ad needs to go out tomorrow morning and we are here on Sunday night. You&#39;re pitching this group of funders as to what this spot needs to look like. So I&#39;m going to give you that task. You&#39;re doing the anti-O&#39;Toole 30-second spot. What does it include? Is it a VO? Is it not? not, Corey, you&#39;re doing the opposite. You&#39;re taking what you saw this weekend, and you&#39;re saying, oh, shit, this was a bit of a shitstorm. And your PAC has told you, Corey, we need a 30 second spot. We&#39;re giving you $2 million for distribution to air it across the country. We just need you to tell us what it says. What is it going to say about Aaron O&#39;Toole and his leadership? What is it going to say? What is it going to highlight? So while I give you a couple of seconds to think, I&#39;m going to try to do some delay tactics of my own. Of course, I planned on none of this. So Carter, I&#39;ll come to you in about 15 seconds. In the meantime, I do want to talk about tonight&#39;s episode sponsor, Air Canada. Now, Air Canada has been a long time sponsor of this podcast. Now, the thing is, we haven&#39;t mentioned Air Canada in a very long time. And it&#39;s because they told us not to. And I&#39;m so glad that they finally have come out of the closet and have told us that yes indeed we can mention them on air um in fact we&#39;re really looking forward to getting their uh their their sponsorship package uh which along which will include of course their um their letter of telling me to shut the fuck up which will go directly to cory so if you want to send that to him please send it to to cory uh directly thank you fine folks at air canada uh looking forward to your bailout uh stephen carter time</span>

And so his judgment will be called into question as well.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you on this one. We talked about this very quickly, but the Conservatives introduced a new sub-brand for their policy, Secure the Future, Canada&#39;s recovery plan. What did you make of both the brand name as well as kind of the brand design of Secure the Future on a scale of, let&#39;s say, A to F?</span>

If they just added the word together, it would have really, really popped. But I&#39;ve already run that campaign, and it succeeded because, you know, I ran it. That&#39;s the way it goes.</span>

One of the last things that kind of wrapped up the convention traditionally and regardless of which party, this is one of the items and actions that happens at your at your conventions.

            <span class="text">Underrated, especially if they&#39;re out of step with the leader. We I&#39;ve been in a party system where the leader was significantly out of step with the party president. And it&#39;s excruciating. It is a fight every single day because the party apparatus must work together with the leader&#39;s office and the caucus. And if any of those three are out of step, it is a nightmare to try and run a political organization.</span>

            <span class="text">Overrated. Overrated. I have seen a lot of party presidents for a lot of parties come and go. And to be honest, it&#39;s really hard to delineate when one&#39;s tenure begins and the other ends because they&#39;re just not that consequential to the day-to-day operations of the party. And the size of these councils these days is large enough that they&#39;re one vote. It&#39;s not a big deal.</span>
