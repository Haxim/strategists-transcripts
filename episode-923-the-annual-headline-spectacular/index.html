        <p>It's the annual headline show! Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter give one hour of hot takes on what's in the news. Will Jody Wilson-Raybould's upcoming book change the federal political landscape? How did Alberta's "Energy War Room" get back into the news? And how long until Rocket Mortgage buys the naming rights to The Strategists? Zain Velji, as he does every year, picks the headlines and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

Because, you know, the thing is, it&#39;s like when you, do you ever like paint a room and then you want to paint the next room something that&#39;s not quite that color, but you&#39;ve got to make it different enough it doesn&#39;t look like you just failed at matching it? at</div>

I mean, is she going to tell us new salacious details that she held back in the first telling of the story when she used that story to get elected as an independent MP, which is a difficult thing to do and a very impressive thing to have done. She got elected as an independent MP at a time when we don&#39;t elect many independent MPs.

I feel like maybe this is one that they should reverse course on. The doubling down and keeping the Bob and Bob diversity structure in place is probably not the smartest move for Disney.

But there&#39;s not a ton of sophistication in this communication. When you&#39;re communicating on a controversial issue, when you&#39;re in a landscape where it&#39;s very charged, that&#39;s very political, when there are all sorts of considerations of that ilk, you&#39;ve got to treat your communications different. One of the ways that came up sort of in the Twitter replies when I was bringing this up online was, yeah, charts don&#39;t generally work when everybody&#39;s really charged and drawn lines lines and gotten to their corners. But let&#39;s step past that one. There&#39;s one that I think people don&#39;t think about enough, which is the kitchen sink approach to communications. When you rebut a charge that people did not necessarily have in their head before, you also risk in these charged environments reinforcing that original charge. So perhaps you&#39;ve heard that the oil and gas sector doesn&#39;t spend much on environmental protection. You&#39;ve heard wrong. In a politically charged environment, what happens is partisans on the other side of the issue will then go and find all of the facts they need to validate that, in fact, they have heard correct.

In Alberta, it&#39;s 48%. But here&#39;s perhaps the most interesting thing. That&#39;s still six points ahead of Jason Kenney. What does this mean for, let&#39;s just start with Kenney first. Is this worry time for Jason Kenney right now? Like he&#39;s polling 42% on this particular poll by Ipsos. We also had Angus Reid, I believe, this week. Not the lowest amongst all the premiers, but he was at 39% job approval. This is starting to get into perhaps unprecedented territory, close to it, I should say, for Jason Kenney. Thoughts on this, guys, on Kenney before we jump to Trudeau? Well,</div>

Like they are, this idea that the voter is rational and is some way predictable. It&#39;s just kind of, it&#39;s masked because in many ways, they don&#39;t care that much. much. The difference was we are caring a lot more because we&#39;re seeing the government in our lives a lot more. We&#39;re seeing that when the government is failing us on vaccines or they&#39;re failing us on the economy, we tend to move towards volatility. When they are succeeding, we tend to move towards stability because our lives are the ultimate barometer of the success of the government. Do I feel the change? Do I feel the upset?

And it&#39;s good – it&#39;s something that should give the liberals pause, that people are moving around and that the events of the day can move them so easily off of the liberal party. because if we want to go back and we have talked about this for a while and this has been a common theme for at least since the fall of us here people are very fixated on covid right now they are living covid they are dying covid quite literally in some cases unfortunately but we are going to be getting to a point where say there&#39;s a june election say most of us have had at least our first dose people are going to start turning their attention to other issues they&#39;re going to to start looking at politicians again for the first time in a long time. You&#39;ve got to keep in mind, Parliament isn&#39;t even really meeting, right? They&#39;re doing this remote thing. A lot of the theatre we&#39;re used to, the scrums, all of that, that&#39;s not occurring. We&#39;ve just had this transfer of power in the United States that is capital F fucked.

But I do want to cover this story in a more serious manner, perhaps on Sunday, but we&#39;ll tease it a little bit today, which is from the CBC as well. Alberta MLA was monitored by five different police officers, documents show. I&#39;ll add some context. I know you guys know this story, but perhaps our listeners across the country do not. Over the last four years, Lethbridge NDP MLA Shannon Phillips, who was a former environment minister here in our province with the NDP government, has had suspicions that some members of her Lethbridge police force have been monitoring her. In a new cache of newly released documents, she was right. She found out that multiple police officers were looking at her records, had taken pictures of her in a restaurant with some friends, had accessed her account without a justification or accessed her files without a justification. Corey, this story goes on and on, and I&#39;m only just reading the tip of this story. Like, there is so much depth here that I can&#39;t even contextualize. But your initial thoughts when you read this story here in our home province of Alberta, but certainly has reverberations across the country for public servants and elected officials.</div>

          <div class="said">Oh, I mean, my first thoughts were, holy fuck. And the chill that this would just put on anybody interested in public service or considering it, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind that Shannon Phillips, she did nothing wrong. The reason why these totally out-of-control police officers decided they were going to start monitoring her is because she was trying to remove ATV off-road activity in some provincial land. It&#39;s fucking nuts that somebody would start – like police officers began stalking a minister of the crown because of this thing. Like this is just the most out-of-control situation I could possibly consider, and it&#39;s scary as hell. And there are so many other details you didn&#39;t get into. I didn&#39;t, no. You know, we can get into them on Sunday. And the follow on it from this has been pretty crazy, too.

Maybe I&#39;ll comment on before I throw it to you, Carter, around the justice minister, Casey Maddow, coming out very strongly against Lethbridge police. I would note that this has been a justice minister who has been pretty strong on indicating specific issues, but has, you know, thus far not really been very bold on the systemic side of things. And I think that&#39;s going to be perhaps the tension here is, is he going to just isolate this as five bad apples? Or is he going to, you know, perhaps go further than he has before historically in our province to talk about systemic issues in policing? Because this is one proof point in a very specific, horrible story to a minister. But the systemic issues here also need to be perhaps addressed at some point. Carter, your thoughts from what you saw initially, and we&#39;ll get into it on Sunday even more.</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I&#39;m very interested that ACERT has been brought in to investigate the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team. Too late, in my mind. The fact that, I mean, we&#39;ve known this for quite a while that this had happened. What has changed is that there&#39;s been a story put forward by the CBC and it&#39;s brought more attention to it. It&#39;s not a new story. It&#39;s not a new story to us. Not a new story to the Minister of Justice. It&#39;s not a new story within the circles of politics.</div>

We need to know what the hell&#39;s going on in our political system, because this isn&#39;t good enough anymore. And we can&#39;t stand behind process any longer. This is something that is demanding action. And the Lethbridge police response from the chief of police was wholly inadequate. And it was laughable, except it&#39;s not a laughable subject. subject we&#39;ve all been subject to harassment just for being in politics it is fair to say that the abuse that shannon phillips faces is amongst the strongest abuse in in our province and we&#39;ve seen shit that is not right and and the fact that the police not only didn&#39;t stand to protect her but were the perpetrators this demands action it demands action at the highest highest possible levels. And for the police chief to basically stand up and say, it&#39;s not for us to judge. It&#39;s for God to judge. Let me play God. I am judging you, sir. Step the fuck down. Get out of the way. You&#39;re not a leader. It&#39;s time to move on.</div>
