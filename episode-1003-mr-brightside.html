Like, is this kind of like in that sense, like, is there a connection point to what he&#39;s there for the activity he&#39;s there for? Like, I suspect there&#39;s a bit of a backstory here, but talk to me. Is this scandal worthy? And I put scandal in quotes because I think many people are realizing that if it is indeed scandal worthy, it&#39;s not long term scandal worthy. It&#39;s not We Charity. It&#39;s not SNC Laughlin. It&#39;s probably another proof point of the prime minister&#39;s judgment, perhaps tied to foreign trips, as we&#39;ve seen before. But Carter, scandal worthy in your mind?

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">and as you say cory good strategy begins with good analysis and i&#39;m curious if the analysis you guys have given is in line with the one that the pmo and the liberal party has about their leader on his authenticity marker like i genuinely wonder if they&#39;re asking themselves and analyzing it being like if did they see what happened today and the extension of it the same as as we did because they could very well see it differently, Carter. Like, I could see a world where they read this thing very differently, being like, no, this is this guy. Like, he&#39;s in a T-shirt. He&#39;s singing a song. This is exactly who he is. This is more of what we need. We can win as authenticity being one of the, I&#39;m going to throw it, five pillars of the next campaign, so to speak. Right? Like, there could be a piece of analysis internally that says, fuck it, authenticity is a winning marker for us. Well,</span>

            <span class="text">Exactly. So both his hardcore supporters and his hardcore opponents, who gives a shit if they think he&#39;s authentic? But if a persuadable group in the middle believes he&#39;s authentic, then yeah, you can build a strategy around that. These</span>

So there&#39;s that going on. And then I want to talk about this Don Braid article that, that just came out that Corey circulated to us. Corey, I believe this is from, from either today or yesterday. It&#39;s from today, which talks about Daniel Smith reaching out and throwing out all of branches to the UCP MLAs, to the caucus, knowing that she doesn&#39;t have the vast majority of endorsements. This article ultimately talking about how some people are saying, listen, Danielle Smith, sure, but we&#39;ll take Danielle Smith over Rachel Notley any day. This is UCP MLA is kind of paraphrasing, kind of starting to warm up to the prospects that she will be their leader and she will be the premier. So, Carter, I want to talk about in broad terms, give me the broad terms of what you make of the Danielle Smith endgame. As you see perhaps the convergence of a winning campaign, is this looking to you like an undeniable force? Or are you seeing some holes in the potential strategy in the campaign here that could make you question as a political observer and a strategist that this is not a done deal? Tell me that top line and then let&#39;s get into some of these things I&#39;ve mentioned here.</span>

You know, like there&#39;s been a couple of polls that were apparently put out by the Daniel Smith team. Daniel Smith&#39;s team put out their own polls and the media jumped on them like rabid dogs on food. It was it&#39;s just embarrassing. Anyways, the media were walking through. I think by media, I&#39;m including Rick Bell in this. So it&#39;s very loose definition of media.</span>
