          <p></p><p><br /></p><p>The gang talk the PM's pipes, the question of political authenticity and Danielle Smith's pivot to mending the UCP caucus. Plus: Corey spends $450 on a badass shirt, but in his defence it was his exact style.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about differing views of authenticity through the lens of the Prime Minister breaking into some Queen karaoke before the Queen's funeral. Why are Canadians having such different reactions to the PM's rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody? Has Danielle Smith locked up the UCP leadership? And when did the podcast start resorting to niche visual gags? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Like, is this kind of like in that sense, like, is there a connection point to what he&#39;s there for the activity he&#39;s there for? Like, I suspect there&#39;s a bit of a backstory here, but talk to me. Is this scandal worthy? And I put scandal in quotes because I think many people are realizing that if it is indeed scandal worthy, it&#39;s not long term scandal worthy. It&#39;s not We Charity. It&#39;s not SNC Laughlin. It&#39;s probably another proof point of the prime minister&#39;s judgment, perhaps tied to foreign trips, as we&#39;ve seen before. But Carter, scandal worthy in your mind?

Like, I could see a world where they read this thing very differently, being like, no, this is this guy. Like, he&#39;s in a T-shirt. He&#39;s singing a song. This is exactly who he is. This is more of what we need. We can win as authenticity being one of the, I&#39;m going to throw it, five pillars of the next campaign, so to speak. Right?

So there&#39;s that going on. And then I want to talk about this Don Braid article that, that just came out that Corey circulated to us. Corey, I believe this is from, from either today or yesterday. It&#39;s from today, which talks about Daniel Smith reaching out and throwing out all of branches to the UCP MLAs, to the caucus, knowing that she doesn&#39;t have the vast majority of endorsements. This article ultimately talking about how some people are saying, listen, Danielle Smith, sure, but we&#39;ll take Danielle Smith over Rachel Notley any day. This is UCP MLA is kind of paraphrasing, kind of starting to warm up to the prospects that she will be their leader and she will be the premier. So, Carter, I want to talk about in broad terms, give me the broad terms of what you make of the Danielle Smith endgame. As you see perhaps the convergence of a winning campaign, is this looking to you like an undeniable force? Or are you seeing some holes in the potential strategy in the campaign here that could make you question as a political observer and a strategist that this is not a done deal? Tell me that top line and then let&#39;s get into some of these things I&#39;ve mentioned here.</div>

Daniel Smith&#39;s team put out their own polls and the media jumped on them like rabid dogs on food. It was it&#39;s just embarrassing. Anyways, the media were walking through. I think by media, I&#39;m including Rick Bell in this. So it&#39;s very loose definition of media.</div>
