Ready, set, go away, I&#39;m on vacation. That is the name of our first segment. And there is a lot to talk about. And at the top of it is the fact that a lot of people are on vacation while this rate has been dropped. So is that part of the reason why it surprised you, Carter and Corey, that this was done today?

            <div class="said">Yeah, that&#39;s a good point you bring up, Corey. Let&#39;s talk a little bit about that launch of a campaign. You can You can launch it, but if no one sees it, did it happen? And all three campaigns got together and launched today in, I&#39;d say, very different fashion. So I want to talk to you about that a little bit more. But before we get into the specifics, what do you guys think is involved in a good campaign launch? What do you think are the key ingredients to successfully launching a political campaign? And index that for me to a campaign that&#39;s 37 or 27 days versus one that&#39;s 11 weeks long. What do you look for in a good launch? Carter, I&#39;ll go with you first.</div>

            <div class="said">Well, what I want to look for is owning the news cycle that evening and ideally into the next morning. So the idea of launching your campaign is what visuals am I going to be able to present that are going to be the most important visuals on the day of the election? Now, the prime minister has a tremendous leg up in this because he gets to walk in to the governor general&#39;s home</div>

            <div class="said">So Mulcair and Trudeau are now coming at this from a much different place, and they have to try and figure out how to actually own the news cycle on a day when really it&#39;s the prime ministers.</div>

            <div class="said">Well, I&#39;ll be honest. I can&#39;t remember. I was sitting here trying to think what my my last campaign launch looked like uh these things do tend to be forgotten pretty quickly but you want to roll out your main theme you want to have your visuals um kind of align with the message that you&#39;re going to be giving the overarching campaign message of the the next well in this case 11 weeks and with 11 weeks that&#39;s really tough but you&#39;ll note mulcair was across the river in in quebec almost</div>

            <div class="said">You had Trudeau in Vancouver, where I think he had a pretty nice visual. It was almost an accidental visual. But here I am actually out in the country meeting with people. I&#39;m going to Pride. I&#39;m a guy who&#39;s doing politics different. Those other two are in Ottawa. I didn&#39;t think that really hurt him. And of course, the prime minister is stuck somewhat by convention. He&#39;s got to make his announcement in front of Rideau Hall after talking to the governor general. But in that context, they all had very interesting things going on. The three openings were wildly different. And I think in each of the three openings, we saw the seeds of a problem and pretty clear indication of the path they&#39;re going to take forward.</div>

            <div class="said">I want to get that in a second, but I do want to allow Carter to chime in a little bit more. One of the things that you guys mentioned just right now was ensuring that you&#39;re on the right visual cue. What does the setup of a good visual cue look like? In past episodes, we talked about how summer barbecue season was effectively you walking into other people&#39;s events and trying to not look like an idiot. This is the time where you stage your event and you present yourself to the people for the first time. In a situation where the campaign, for lack of a better term, has already been being run for the last four or five weeks, two weeks at least. How do you set yourself up for a strong visual to launch yourself? Carter, any thoughts on that?</div>

            <div class="said">Well, I mean, to be honest, I would really struggle with it in this particular setting. I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d want to pull out my ace to launch this early when people really aren&#39;t paying attention on a long weekend in August. But I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;d be pulling out my ace. And</div>

I mean, obviously, you guys had started before then, but this is not something foreign to you. So we&#39;ll definitely consider and talk about the nature of holidays and maybe do a little bit of a parallel based on where you were at with the Nenshi campaign. Well,</div>

But one of the things I&#39;m really kind of concerned about as much as I&#39;m interested about is what a 78-day writ period looks like for the government. Carter, I&#39;d love for you to jump in on this because you were there as chief of staff, but government doesn&#39;t really function that well during writ period in this country. Announcements don&#39;t happen. Things don&#39;t go on. It&#39;s not like the United States with the perpetual campaigns. It&#39;s not like municipal where everything&#39;s going to continue on a schedule that council has set going well back.</div>

All of the actual activities that a person is involved in will get done or the government is doing will get done. But it&#39;s those policy initiatives, those big discussions, they absolutely shut down.

They have to find a way to make that stick because, you know, Harper&#39;s opening was two-headed, right? He said, well, look, everybody&#39;s already campaigning anyways. And that to me is a pretty good point, because if it&#39;s game on, it&#39;s game on. But the other one was, oh, I&#39;m going to try. We&#39;re doing this to save money. And that was so weak. And it was so obviously like a defensive move because he knew the most obvious attack coming was this is going to cost so much more now that it&#39;s a 78 day campaign instead of a 35 day campaign. but if i&#39;m the liberals if i&#39;m the liberals or if i&#39;m the new democrats but less so if i&#39;m the new democrats i really hammer you on this you know the liberals right now have come to this calculation it&#39;s going to be 125 million extra the</div>

Now, I have to tell you, I went through Mulcair&#39;s speech twice just to make sure I was correct. But in English, he talked about a strong united Canada, and he didn&#39;t use anything close to that language in French. I think that he could open himself up to some real criticism and legitimate criticism if he continues to take that approach over the next couple of weeks, saying one thing to Quebec. In French, he&#39;s talking about the need to clean up the environment. He&#39;s talking about how they have to correct the problems the prime minister has made, which almost to me seems a wink the other way. We have to find a way to make Confederation work for Quebec.

Does this mean that a gaffe made on day three of the campaign in a couple of days by any one of these leaders is not going to be as important as it would be in a 37? Or how do you treat the missteps and the unforced errors? Do they just have longer legs or are they just as short and you have more room to make more mistakes? Well,</div>

And even when he was having an okay day, they found something that screwed up to hit them with. And they&#39;ve got to be very careful to get out of that deep, deep trench, particularly Mulcair and Trudeau, because one of those guys is going to be the person who has all of the votes coalesced to them on the progressive side.
