            <span class="text">This is The Strategist, episode 541. My name is Zain Velji, with me as always, Stephen Carter, Corey Hogan. Guys, how are you?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I&#39;m really good. I&#39;m good. I&#39;m in an undisclosed location with a one-year-old in the next room, so if you start to hear shouting, it&#39;s not Canadians revolting against this early election. It&#39;s actually my kin. Okay,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so you&#39;re in an undisclosed location. Now, I&#39;m going to ask you, is that undisclosed location Carter&#39;s bunker where he hangs out with his pet kittens? Is that where you are?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">not allowed in that bunker and neither are you. Don&#39;t stop talking about the bunker. okay you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">you know the only reason we are doing this is because you guys were wrong uh the only reason we&#39;re putting this episode together is because last time i asked you is this thing going to happen on august 2nd or 3rd you know during this long weekend and both of you were like no way this is not going to happen and now we have to record this podcast update everyone on on this early rip drop so this is all on you guys we had</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">had a lot of confidence we had a lot of confidence that it it was not going to happen today.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, okay. I was expecting more of a fight from you guys, but that&#39;s fine. No,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, no, we&#39;re prepared to admit when we&#39;re wrong. It happens so infrequently.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Okay, so let&#39;s get into it because we want to record a quick hit today so that we</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">we can provide people with a certain sense of context as to this launch that happened today and what the campaign looks like going forward in almost an unprecedented style with 11 weeks So let&#39;s go to our first segment. Ready, set, go away, I&#39;m on vacation. That is the name of our first segment. And there is a lot to talk about. And at the top of it is the fact that a lot of people are on vacation while this rate has been dropped. So is that part of the reason why it surprised you, Carter and Corey, that this was done today? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, Corey and I are calling in on Skype because we are, in fact, on vacation. This is the problem. I&#39;m not sure that most people, I mean, maybe not most people, but I know there&#39;s a large group of people who don&#39;t even know that this election has been called. They&#39;re going to come back next</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">week and they&#39;re going to go, what happened while we were gone? And this is what&#39;s going to have happened.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, they&#39;re going to see a lawn sign on their neighbor&#39;s lawn, a crazy person, probably me or one of you guys. and they&#39;re going to say, I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">guess the writ was dropped. And yeah, it&#39;s going to be tough to drag people&#39;s attention into it. I still think that just because you call an election doesn&#39;t mean people pay attention. And we&#39;re going to have to see how long</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">long it takes before people actually get into the sense that there isn&#39;t a campaign that&#39;s going on.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s a good point you bring up, Corey. Let&#39;s talk a little bit about that launch of a campaign. You can You can launch it, but if no one sees it, did it happen? And all three campaigns got together and launched today in, I&#39;d say, very different fashion. So I want to talk to you about that a little bit more. But before we get into the specifics, what do you guys think is involved in a good campaign launch? What do you think are the key ingredients to successfully launching a political campaign? And index that for me to a campaign that&#39;s 37 or 27 days versus one that&#39;s 11 weeks long. What do you look for in a good launch? Carter, I&#39;ll go with you first.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, what I want to look for is owning the news cycle that evening and ideally into the next morning. So the idea of launching your campaign is what visuals am I going to be able to present that are going to be the most important visuals on the day of the election? Now, the prime minister has a tremendous leg up in this because he gets to walk in to the governor general&#39;s home</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">and make the call. And no one else has that visual.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So Mulcair and Trudeau are now coming at this from a much different place, and they have to try and figure out how to actually own the news cycle on a day when really it&#39;s the prime ministers.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, what do you think? What ingredients do you think are necessary for a launch of a campaign that&#39;s going to last 11 weeks?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;ll be honest. I can&#39;t remember. I was sitting here trying to think what my my last campaign launch looked like uh these things do tend to be forgotten pretty quickly but you want to roll out your main theme you want to have your visuals um kind of align with the message that you&#39;re going to be giving the overarching campaign message of the the next well in this case 11 weeks and with 11 weeks that&#39;s really tough but you&#39;ll note mulcair was across the river in in quebec almost</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">almost looking at uh the parliament buildings in the distance like he&#39;s about to launch artillery attacks against them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You had Trudeau in Vancouver, where I think he had a pretty nice visual. It was almost an accidental visual. But here I am actually out in the country meeting with people. I&#39;m going to Pride. I&#39;m a guy who&#39;s doing politics different. Those other two are in Ottawa. I didn&#39;t think that really hurt him. And of course, the prime minister is stuck somewhat by convention. He&#39;s got to make his announcement in front of Rideau Hall after talking to the governor general. But in that context, they all had very interesting things going on. The three openings were wildly different. And I think in each of the three openings, we saw the seeds of a problem and pretty clear indication of the path they&#39;re going to take forward.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">I want to get that in a second, but I do want to allow Carter to chime in a little bit more. One of the things that you guys mentioned just right now was ensuring that you&#39;re on the right visual cue. What does the setup of a good visual cue look like? In past episodes, we talked about how summer barbecue season was effectively you walking into other people&#39;s events and trying to not look like an idiot. This is the time where you stage your event and you present yourself to the people for the first time. In a situation where the campaign, for lack of a better term, has already been being run for the last four or five weeks, two weeks at least. How do you set yourself up for a strong visual to launch yourself? Carter, any thoughts on that?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I mean, to be honest, I would really struggle with it in this particular setting. I&#39;m not sure that I&#39;d want to pull out my ace to launch this early when people really aren&#39;t paying attention on a long weekend in August. But I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;d be pulling out my ace. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">you say your ace, what does that mean for you? Is that content or is that thematic? What is that? Is that aesthetic? What is your ace for you? Well, it&#39;s all those those things i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i mean so when you have your ace you have something that people are going to remember and talk about for the duration of the campaign you have something that actually sets up the stage for you that everybody then has to try and match um we&#39;ve seen you know in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in the united states there they have a much stronger uh experience if you will running this type of long campaign and you&#39;ll see them pull their aces out kind of every couple of months where they&#39;ll do a major event that they They own, and that major event is something that defines the brand that they want to be defined as. Because that&#39;s ultimately what we&#39;re talking about here is brand definition.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Who are you and what do you want to be seen as? Corey</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">Corey Carter brings up a good point. What do you think of brand definition this early? Is it worth it or do you have a slow burn where you crescendo later on in the campaign? Well, I don&#39;t think those two thoughts are mutually</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">mutually exclusive. The process of picking the visual is really to get, and it is, it&#39;s very strategic, that first visual. And I think the U.S. model of the anchors and those big events is something we&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll be surprised if we don&#39;t have something right after Labor Day, maybe something again in October. One of the things I was thinking of is in the course of this campaign, we have three holidays. And all of those holidays offer a reset point, right? We&#39;ve got this August long weekend for most of the country. We have Labor Day and then we have Thanksgiving before</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">before it&#39;s all said and done.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, and can I jump in on that, Corey? Because when we were doing the Nenshi campaign, Thanksgiving was massive.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">holidays are a major time when people are getting together and as much as people pretend that they don&#39;t want to talk about religion and politics when they get together they often talk about religion and politics well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah the alternative is talking about your uncle&#39;s new wife right these are</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so you this this enables people to talk about something and you can actually see a significant shift in those weekends if i was to plan out the campaign. And I may be jumping ahead here to another episode. One of the things that I&#39;d be talking about is how do you define yourself before those major holidays? But this holiday and the Labor Day holiday, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d care about. Because I don&#39;t think anybody&#39;s going to be talking about politics. I mean, you&#39;re going to be sure there&#39;ll be something, but no one&#39;s talking about politics or campfires tonight. It&#39;s not to have campfires. This</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_00</span>
            <span class="text">This is an interesting timeline. You know, Carter, you&#39;re probably, this is not foreign When you ran Nenshi, the summer season, early August, climaxing to mid-October was effectively your campaign season. I mean, obviously, you guys had started before then, but this is not something foreign to you. So we&#39;ll definitely consider and talk about the nature of holidays and maybe do a little bit of a parallel based on where you were at with the Nenshi campaign. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we jump off that, can I just say there are precedents with the U.S., the perpetual campaign, our municipal ones with the lock campaign, sure. But one of the things I&#39;m really kind of concerned about as much as I&#39;m interested about is what a 78-day writ period looks like for the government. Carter, I&#39;d love for you to jump in on this because you were there as chief of staff, but government doesn&#39;t really function that well during writ period in this country. Announcements don&#39;t happen. Things don&#39;t go on. It&#39;s not like the United States with the perpetual campaigns. It&#39;s not like municipal where everything&#39;s going to continue on a schedule that council has set going well back.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, it is actually really difficult to work in the business of government because what the bureaucrats immediately start doing is they shut down and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">

So let&#39;s differentiate between the people, the frontline service workers who are providing the services to people. I mean, obviously, all the checks are still going to be delivered. All of the actual activities that a person is involved in will get done or the government is doing will get done. But it&#39;s those policy initiatives, those big discussions, they absolutely shut down. So no one in Health Canada is going to be talking about what new political initiative the government should undertake. Not like this government ever does undertake anything in health.

            <span class="text">Corey and Carter, I want to hit on this because thanks for bringing it up, Corey. Do you think this is too nuanced of an issue to be able to be considered a point of attack for the opposing parties on the government? Or does something big need to happen to highlight this situation that we&#39;re going to embark on or we&#39;ve started to embark on? Let</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Let me tell you, it&#39;s going to cost a lot. And I think you saw a lot of discussions about that today. They have to find a way to make that stick because, you know, Harper&#39;s opening was two-headed, right? He said, well, look, everybody&#39;s already campaigning anyways. And that to me is a pretty good point, because if it&#39;s game on, it&#39;s game on. But the other one was, oh, I&#39;m going to try. We&#39;re doing this to save money. And that was so weak. And it was so obviously like a defensive move because he knew the most obvious attack coming was this is going to cost so much more now that it&#39;s a 78 day campaign instead of a 35 day campaign. but if i&#39;m the liberals if i&#39;m the liberals or if i&#39;m the new democrats but less so if i&#39;m the new democrats i really hammer you on this you know the liberals right now have come to this calculation it&#39;s going to be 125 million extra the</span>

            <span class="text">the ctv actually had an even higher number but that breaks out to about three million dollars a day it&#39;s going to cost people because not everyone realizes but every dollar that&#39;s spent in a writ period the parties get half of it back so you get 50</span>

            <span class="text">cents back every dollar that a candidate spends locally if they get more than 10 percent of the vote they get 60 cents on that dollar back so with all of these increased limits it&#39;s estimated about three million a day so if i&#39;m the liberals no matter what i&#39;m talking about for the next month you know we&#39;re here to talk post-secondary education but before we do i&#39;d like to remind everybody that with what the extended election cost us today alone the government could have paid for the books of over a thousand university students or something like that i think you have have to tie it into your campaign narrative. You can&#39;t get too distracted by it, but it&#39;s pretty bad. And it&#39;s, it&#39;s a lot of money for not a lot of reason. And, uh, you</span>

And I do want to move it on for, for the sake of, of this episode and, and to really hit on the major themes of the the launch. So let&#39;s start at the natural point that Corey, you had touched upon Stephen Harper&#39;s launch of his campaign. Carter, what are your initial thoughts based on the ingredients we talked about, the aesthetics, the content, the visuals, the overall brand messaging, what were your thoughts on the launch of Stephen Harper today and how would you rank it?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">harper isn&#39;t the best campaigner when it comes to visuals and themes that&#39;s not his strength his strength is uh kind of just grinding it out and finding out where the votes are and getting those votes to go there so you&#39;re never going to see stephen harper in what i would consider to be the world&#39;s best photo opportunity um or the world&#39;s best thematic uh kind of presentation presentation. He&#39;s going to grind through these things, answer his five questions a day, which the media are going to complain about every single day.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But if the media could pull their heads out of their asses and actually ask different questions instead of the same question three times, I think we&#39;d have a chance to actually hearing some interesting answers. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, what&#39;s your take on this? Carter answered with as expected. Does Stephen Harper need more than as expected on a launch today? Oh,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Oh, I mean, Carter&#39;s totally right. This is not where Stephen Harper wins his campaign. And I don&#39;t know if I give him a failing grade on themes, if only because themes suffer for the benefit of his message discipline. And he knows message discipline wins the game. I thought, as a point of contrast, you had today, Harper took five questions, Malterre took zero questions, and Trudeau took as many questions as would be thrown at him. I</span>

            <span class="text">I understand that Trudeau wants to look like he&#39;s open, but I would caution and remind everybody, Michael Ignatieff did the exact same thing. He took every question. The risk with taking every question, on a day like this, it&#39;s fine, because it says, hey, Trudeau was open. He took every single question. And the story becomes about the questions, not the content. But you cannot control your message if you&#39;re letting them ask anything you want. In fact, you&#39;re giving ample opportunity for them, them being the media, to throw to the other guy&#39;s message. Prime Minister Harper</span>

Now, I have to tell you, I went through Mulcair&#39;s speech twice just to make sure I was correct. But in English, he talked about a strong united Canada, and he didn&#39;t use anything close to that language in French. I think that he could open himself up to some real criticism and legitimate criticism if he continues to take that approach over the next couple of weeks, saying one thing to Quebec. In French, he&#39;s talking about the need to clean up the environment. He&#39;s talking about how they have to correct the problems the prime minister has made, which almost to me seems a wink the other way. We have to find a way to make Confederation work for Quebec.

            <span class="text">situation has two questions that flow for me from it. The The first one is what does this mean about gaffes that leaders make? Does this mean that a gaffe made on day three of the campaign in a couple of days by any one of these leaders is not going to be as important as it would be in a 37? Or how do you treat the missteps and the unforced errors? Do they just have longer legs or are they just as short and you have more room to make more mistakes? Well,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">release that says that Paul Martin, you know, is in favor of child pornography or however that one was phrased, it&#39;s going to stick with you for a long time. But other mistakes were a candidate simply, I mean, maybe it&#39;s Stockwell Day&#39;s mistake of saying that the Niagara Falls, the river flowed the wrong way. You know, that was a little mistake, but that was a mistake that was still part of a definition of who he was. if it&#39;s a mistake that&#39;s out of character you should be fine if it&#39;s a mistake that is entirely what you is expected by the national media and the voters you&#39;re pretty much screwed cory</span>

            <span class="text">yeah i think so although i do think these things will fade with time uh the cycles just spin so quickly these days i i think though that if you find yourself getting wrong-footed early the media is going to smell blood and uh they&#39;re going to define you like that ongoing i I think about in Alberta, the way Prentice got defined as this bundling guy who could do no right. And even when he was having an okay day, they found something that screwed up to hit them with. And they&#39;ve got to be very careful to get out of that deep, deep trench, particularly Mulcair and Trudeau, because one of those guys is going to be the person who has all of the votes coalesced to them on the progressive side. And unless Harper does his job very well, I should say. But you don&#39;t want to be the guy who who gets in that ditch.</span>

You know, we saw the conservatives finally shift last week with the pay it back and now have an have an ad out against Tom Mulcair saying that he&#39;s a career politician who&#39;s an opportunist. So the guns are finally facing Tom Mulcair from the conservative side. But what I mean, in specific to this ad, sure.

John, that infamous Kretchen ad, that happened in the closing days. The guns on our street were not, was not an ad that happened on day one of the campaign, right? Especially because you&#39;re in a war room surrounded with people who get really wound up about the opposition and feel like everybody in the country feels about the conservatives the way they do, or the liberals the way they do, or the New Democrats the way they do, right? It becomes very easy as time goes on and you&#39;ve been in that bubble longer to believe that these tacks are not just not just justified but somehow tapping into a zeitgeist that&#39;s just not there frankly which goes back to this notion of you better have a couple of teams and you better have some some breathing room um yeah</span>
