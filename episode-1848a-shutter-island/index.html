        <p>A busy week in politics means the gang has a double-header. Today: Danielle Smith's loyalties are called into question as she refuses to sign on to the Team Canada approach. Tomorrow: maybe we hear more about how to construct a human wall behind a leadership candidate?</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the First Minister's Conference and the consensus that wasn't. Will Danielle Smith's position be a winner in Alberta? If you're Smith, Nenshi, Ford or Trudeau - what do you do now? And do we think with 10 more minutes we could have gotten Stephen Carter to realize the awful truth about his past? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

But at the end, the meeting ended with the prime minister in a press conference with a couple of his ministers, also the ambassador, all premiers, sans Daniel Smith, who did not show up. And I press conference i might be wrong about that but we&#39;ll i&#39;ll find that out while we uh while we discuss uh but all of them including eb uh except smith signing this statement the joint statement that that comes out of the meeting cory daniel smith is taking a lot of heat for for putting alberta first for not putting canada first she&#39;s taking that heat from justin trudeau sharply today less sharply yesterday but she also took that heat very diplomatically from scott moe from from Doug Ford, certainly. And she seems to be taking it from the commentary class, the political class across the country as well. Let&#39;s get into this, you know, without bearing the lead.

But short term thinking does seem to be ruling the day. It does feel like the other premiers got there faster and said, No, no, we can&#39;t screw around with this United, United we stand, divided we fall, as Doug Ford said. And I mean, like just a cliche for a reason, like it&#39;s just absolutely accurate. But Danielle Smith wasn&#39;t willing to get there.

So I got to protect the oil and gas industry. Interesting, interesting. You&#39;re going to continue to focus on selling our product at a huge discount into a market that holds us captive. Interesting. I mean, if you really wanted to protect the oil and gas industry, there&#39;s a number of different things you could do. But I don&#39;t think that just capitulating to Donald Trump is necessarily in our long-term best interest. Um, the oil and gas industry, uh, you know, if the tariff is applied, the oil and gas industry may do worse. It may not be doing as, as badly, but there&#39;s, as we talked about in the last episode, there&#39;s a huge, uh, amount of turnover and cost to turning over from the heavy oil that comes out of Alberta.

The charges that go beyond this is a strategic mistake or blunder and put her into a very narrow category that might be quite damning. Let&#39;s talk about that in a second. Before we get there, do you feel like her dusting off an old script, which this is, and putting it out to Albertans will work, in the sense that will she feel political pain from this here? I&#39;m curious about that from your perspective, because, you know, there&#39;s all this other noise about what this means to the national conversation, etc. And Doug Ford made a good point, like, this is like me giving up the auto sector and saying, yeah, I could do this carve out for the auto sector, but I&#39;m not, because Canada comes first, right?

          </div>
          <div class="said">for her to dust off a script that many of us are used to, the ear is very used to this sort of rhetoric. Do you think Albertans will care of context and will care of gravity of situation and ultimately factor that in or not and say, you know what? Yeah, she&#39;s actually standing up for us. This makes a ton of sense and get a bump here.</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Well, I think it&#39;s going to be a very mixed response. My sense is that if you are a supporter of the UCP, you&#39;ve certainly heard enough voices in the UCP. They are hanging together very well on this particular issue, that probably the majority of UCP supporters will think this is an okay idea. My gut says, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see polling eventually, it&#39;s going to be decidedly more mixed amongst Albertans broadly. My guess is more Albertans opposed than in favor of Alberta&#39;s actions, but could very easily be on the other side of that, but close. That&#39;s my feeling, just based on conversations I&#39;ve had today, based on some chatter I&#39;ve had about the various inputs that are available to people here. I think that we are still in those forming times and that a really strong argument one way or the other could really sway Albertans who are just looking at this and saying, holy fuck, what the hell is happening? God, I hate Trump. Well, I don&#39;t really like Trudeau either. I don&#39;t know whose side I&#39;m on. And so what matters the most in the next couple of days in terms of what the outcome with Albertans will be are the voices that come forward. So put a pin in that because I think it&#39;s really important that Albertans hear the contrary voice from albertans articulated by albertans as to why this would be bad for them here but you know i do want to say one of the reasons why albertans will feel different about this inherently than the auto industry okay like i don&#39;t want to i don&#39;t want to be simple about it obviously a deeply integrated auto industry where for a car to be built it might cross the border or the various parts multiple times deeply integrated that&#39;s</div>

When there&#39;s always someone who&#39;s an outlier, do they not always politically look better? Doesn&#39;t Scott Moe get a bit of a bump by having Danielle Smith as a foil versus all of them just coming together and looking standard issue, we&#39;re all together, Team Canada, rah, rah, rah? Like, talk to me about the politics of offering that off-ramp to her. Do you actually want her to be on the same boat as you?

They have Pierre Polyev and they now get to equate Pierre Polyev to Daniel Smith.
