The freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, the right of free assembly, and right there in the first sentence of the First Amendment, Congress</span>

            <span class="text">Staggering hypocrisy. But there was a second group who were cast out from the protection of the Constitution. A group comprising 51% of the American population. Women. Fighting for the rights as basic as the ability to vote, open a bank account, control their own healthcare. Today, women can vote. They can open bank accounts. Hell, they can even hold elected office. But they remain unable to control their own health. They call it abortion and they&#39;ve been fighting about it for decades, centuries even. But at the core of it, a desire for the religious to impose their beliefs on the uteruses of the nation.</span>

            <span class="text">well it&#39;s very interesting to me because Because, of course, the midterm elections, the Democrats did better than the polls. And one of the reasons that people often kind of attribute to that is the reaction, the backlash to the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to throw out Roe v. Wade and make abortion rights once again a state issue and make a real patchwork across the nation, including in a lot of swing states, some of which you mentioned in your opening there. Yeah,</span>

But generally speaking, I&#39;ve not been super engaged in this election. So obviously, this has passed my view. There has been a court case, an abortion law that was written, as you said, before Arizona was even a state, was deemed to still be on the books, and it&#39;s taken effect. I mean, I&#39;m curious your thoughts on that and if you can expand a bit on that. I will say, in</span>

I wouldn&#39;t trust him to be a valet and park my car. But this is something that Americans just generally seem to give Republicans higher marks on. Not that confusing.
