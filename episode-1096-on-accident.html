          <p>The gang tackle the political strategy of resignation, federal leader summer performance, the evolving English language and more.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use Steve Clark quitting as Ontario Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister to talk about the politics of resignations - when the help, when the hurt, and the rules that help you split the two cases apart - before turning their attention to the federal scene to give summer report cards to Trudeau, Poilievre and Singh. Can Premier Ford now put his greenbelt woes behind him? Did Singh show up this summer? And who brought the biggest wuncle energy to the show? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Do you want to talk about the Doug Ford Greenbelt controversy as it stands right now? The moves that need to be made, the follow-ups that need to happen, Doug Ford shuffled, I put shuffled in quotes, his cabinet today. We can talk about that. The second thing we can talk about is do resignations actually help? And I want to go into a deep dive on that a bit. Do they add more fuel to the fire or do they actually calm the waters? We&#39;ve talked in in the past about resignations. We&#39;ve, in this case, have a chief of staff that&#39;s resigned now, a minister that&#39;s resigned. It&#39;s happened in sequential order, not necessarily altogether. But do resignations like this help? What are the conditions of when a resignation will help? What are the conditions when a resignation actually hurts and opens a floodgates and admits a soft spot rather than a finality or a conclusion? So we have a choice. Carter, I want to get your vote. Corey, I&#39;ll get your vote. We can go either of the two directions. I&#39;m going to let you go.</div>

So immediately after something happens, all of a sudden you&#39;ve got the resignation of of the minister, or you&#39;ve got the resignation of the chief of staff, whatever staffer is going to go. And that is too early because you haven&#39;t allowed the mystery to unfold in such a way that you can actually name the killer and actually have it stick. So that&#39;s the first mistake. The first mistake is doing it too quick. And then of course, in parallel, the second mistake is doing it too late. And I would argue that the Steve Clark resignation is too late. I can&#39;t remember remember the name of the chief of staff which was just going to bother me but the chief of staff&#39;s resignation was also too late um you know it had established and um if</div>

            <div class="said">if it had gone earlier if the chief of staff had been pushed out much earlier i think that there might have been a case that this was uh malfeasance at that particular level but it just looked like they were looking for a scapegoat and they found one in him and then now it&#39;s cost the minister his job but it&#39;s it&#39;s way too late the story&#39;s unfolding and frankly the public have cast their villain their villain is is the uh is the premier himself uh not any of those around him it&#39;s it&#39;s this malfeasance that exists at the at the premier&#39;s office that is now the the focal point of the attention from those of us devouring this murder mystery</div>

            <div class="said">I half agree with what Stephen said. And it goes to what I want to say is probably the more important determinant here. If you&#39;re looking to throw somebody under the bus, right? If you&#39;re trying to make somebody the fall guy, what&#39;s really important is that it can end there, right? Like it helps when you asked if can resignations help help or hurt, right? Like, what&#39;s the thing here?</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">Well, sometimes it helps. Sometimes it helps. And sometimes it just puts blood in the water. And when it puts blood in the water, usually what&#39;s occurred here is you have then seen somebody resign or you have fired somebody or somebody has lost their job in some way, shape or form for something that you are clearly guilty of as well. And I think that&#39;s the situation where it hurts because then you&#39;ve essentially created stakes and you&#39;ve said, this is what&#39;s supposed to happen under this set of conditions. So my name is Steve Steve Clark, and I did something wrong, and I am now resigning now. Would have helped if you could say, well, Steve Clark was the only person who knew about this. Steve Clark&#39;s the only person who took these actions, and so Steve Clark will take the fall. It hurts when Steve is now resigning for the very things that the premier has done and the premier&#39;s office has been accused of, right? That would be being asleep at the switch, not necessarily watching oversight of these, you know, the departmental things, and intervening and having staff intervene as we are starting to see unfold in the story here. So I think that&#39;s really the determinant for me. Now, where timing is super important is it&#39;s not necessarily clear what kind of story you&#39;re working with right away. And so if you imagine on day one, these resignations occurred, let&#39;s say Steve Clark and Ryan Amato, who&#39;s the chief of staff,</div>

Based on what we&#39;re just talking about, aren&#39;t they a helpful – and we talked about this on a previous episode. I think, I don&#39;t know whether you were on that one or Carter and I were, but I&#39;m curious to get your take, Corey. Isn&#39;t it then helpful, just based on the property that you&#39;ve described, to have chiefs of staff and political staffers that are notable so they can be a trading chip, they can be someone who falls on their sword, that they all be in the the model of a Stephen Carter so that if a minister isn&#39;t enough, a minister plus a Jerry Butts or a minister plus a noteworthy chief of staff actually give you some good book value to the public?

But there are a lot of premiers with chiefs of staff that are a lot more anonymous, frankly, and they&#39;re not likely to be big targets to the opposition, simply because it just doesn&#39;t have that kind of value to the public.</div>

Our next segment very quickly here, guys. Summer school report cards. That is right. It is Labor Day. It is the beginning of the school year soon. I know, Corey, you&#39;ve got three to nine kids, so they may have already started school at various times. But Carter, the summertime, as we know it, is over. The summer barbecue season, which we celebrated with various episodes regarding the Calgary Stampede and how politicians should get out there, how they should learn to associate with people, do the retail politics, do all that sort of stuff. Well, we now need to do some report carding. And let&#39;s do that report carding on the federal stage, Carter. I want to measure three things for our leaders, attendance, effort, and results. And I want you to give them a letter grade for each of our three major political parties for Jagmeet Singh, for Justin Trudeau, and for Pierre Polyev. So Carter, let&#39;s start with attendance. Give me your scores for Jagmeet, Justin, and Pierre Polyev on attendance for summer school, which of course we might know as outdoor school or the summer barbecue circuit. How did they do? Did they show up? Were they excited? How do you feel? How did they do?</div>

            <div class="said">do? Well, I think that Justin Trudeau has to get a nine out of 10. He seemed to be everywhere wear this summer uh he was visible he uh you know he he put his head into the lion&#39;s mouth whether it was in calgary or any you know a number of other locations uh he he&#39;s been possibly i think the most visible leader um of</div>

I mean, did we even see him out this summer? I mean, I don&#39;t recall seeing him at all. I think he was on vacation for the entire time. So I&#39;m giving him an F. he was nowhere and pierre polyev&#39;s gonna find a better body double because you know the person i saw out didn&#39;t look at all like him so um i give the body double on on seven out of ten i give pierre polyev a fail oh</div>

Corey, Jameet gets an F, Justin gets a 9 out of 10, Pierre gets an F, and the body double gets a 7 out of 10. Carter, it may surprise you, it might be the same person.

And my media market is primarily Alberta, Alberta, and then Western Canada. And of course, well, he&#39;s a MP from BC doesn&#39;t really mean that that&#39;s necessary. Like, we&#39;re not traveling in the same circles.

He signed up for a class he didn&#39;t show up for so his attendance is up like he he gets a dnc you can&#39;t say this is an important area for you and not show up right there is a big disconnect between actions and rhetoric actions and strategy if that&#39;s what&#39;s going on there now</div>

He gives Trudeau high marks for effort, but he agrees with you that he&#39;s failed, right? He shows up a lot. He works really hard, but he&#39;s terrible at what he&#39;s doing.
