Do you want to talk about the Doug Ford Greenbelt controversy as it stands right now? The moves that need to be made, the follow-ups that need to happen, Doug Ford shuffled, I put shuffled in quotes, his cabinet today. We can talk about that. The second thing we can talk about is do resignations actually help? And I want to go into a deep dive on that a bit. Do they add more fuel to the fire or do they actually calm the waters? We&#39;ve talked in in the past about resignations. We&#39;ve, in this case, have a chief of staff that&#39;s resigned now, a minister that&#39;s resigned. It&#39;s happened in sequential order, not necessarily altogether. But do resignations like this help? What are the conditions of when a resignation will help? What are the conditions when a resignation actually hurts and opens a floodgates and admits a soft spot rather than a finality or a conclusion? So we have a choice. Carter, I want to get your vote. Corey, I&#39;ll get your vote. We can go either of the two directions. I&#39;m going to let you go.</span>

Hey, okay, Carter, then talk to me about this. Let&#39;s talk about resignations. And to get on this topic, we have to talk about the Steve Clark one, right? You have your sort of natural components of it. When I say natural components, they&#39;ve almost become natural order in the political world, I&#39;ve become a distraction, all those sort of things. But let&#39;s start with the ground rules, Carter. In your mind, when does a resignation work</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">work to end a story, to begin the final chapter, the denouement as they taught us in grade school here in the Alberta curriculum? When does it start becoming the beginning of the end versus another chapter or allowing the floodgates to open? Start Start giving me a few conditions, and Corey, I want you to build on that. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think it&#39;s really interesting that you put it in as kind of the denouement. It&#39;s not the denouement. It should be the conclusion. What you&#39;re trying to actually do is reveal the murderer, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? And there&#39;s two classic mistakes that I think are made by politicians when they&#39;re taking this story arc, right? The first mistake that people make is they do it too early, right? So immediately after something happens, all of a sudden you&#39;ve got the resignation of of the minister, or you&#39;ve got the resignation of the chief of staff, whatever staffer is going to go. And that is too early because you haven&#39;t allowed the mystery to unfold in such a way that you can actually name the killer and actually have it stick. So that&#39;s the first mistake. The first mistake is doing it too quick. And then of course, in parallel, the second mistake is doing it too late. And I would argue that the Steve Clark resignation is too late. I can&#39;t remember remember the name of the chief of staff which was just going to bother me but the chief of staff&#39;s resignation was also too late um you know it had established and um if</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">if it had gone earlier if the chief of staff had been pushed out much earlier i think that there might have been a case that this was uh malfeasance at that particular level but it just looked like they were looking for a scapegoat and they found one in him and then now it&#39;s cost the minister his job but it&#39;s it&#39;s way too late the story&#39;s unfolding and frankly the public have cast their villain their villain is is the uh is the premier himself uh not any of those around him it&#39;s it&#39;s this malfeasance that exists at the at the premier&#39;s office that is now the the focal point of the attention from those of us devouring this murder mystery</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">okay i&#39;m going to come back to this but carter you&#39;ve put timing on the table either too early too late. Corey, what do you want to give us? What are the conditions that help make this successful or help make a resignation successful?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I half agree with what Stephen said. And it goes to what I want to say is probably the more important determinant here. If you&#39;re looking to throw somebody under the bus, right? If you&#39;re trying to make somebody the fall guy, what&#39;s really important is that it can end there, right? Like it helps when you asked if can resignations help help or hurt, right? Like, what&#39;s the thing here?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, sometimes it helps. Sometimes it helps. And sometimes it just puts blood in the water. And when it puts blood in the water, usually what&#39;s occurred here is you have then seen somebody resign or you have fired somebody or somebody has lost their job in some way, shape or form for something that you are clearly guilty of as well. And I think that&#39;s the situation where it hurts because then you&#39;ve essentially created stakes and you&#39;ve said, this is what&#39;s supposed to happen under this set of conditions. So my name is Steve Steve Clark, and I did something wrong, and I am now resigning now. Would have helped if you could say, well, Steve Clark was the only person who knew about this. Steve Clark&#39;s the only person who took these actions, and so Steve Clark will take the fall. It hurts when Steve is now resigning for the very things that the premier has done and the premier&#39;s office has been accused of, right? That would be being asleep at the switch, not necessarily watching oversight of these, you know, the departmental things, and intervening and having staff intervene as we are starting to see unfold in the story here. So I think that&#39;s really the determinant for me. Now, where timing is super important is it&#39;s not necessarily clear what kind of story you&#39;re working with right away. And so if you imagine on day one, these resignations occurred, let&#39;s say Steve Clark and Ryan Amato, who&#39;s the chief of staff,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s say that they had both resigned on day one.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, that might have looked okay until the other shoe dropped. And then all of a sudden, the premier&#39;s office is in the mix, too. And there is, you know, back and forth. And it looks like, you know, the, you know, the ethics commissioner&#39;s report comes out that says the premier&#39;s office intervened or made comment on these things, whatever the language was there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So you don&#39;t want to have those resignations until you have kind of a lay of the land. And then you can determine what the best course of action is going forward. I think it&#39;s pretty clear that at least</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we can&#39;t have him resign because of the things I said, because the premier&#39;s office could be accused of the same things. But the heat just got too hot. Challenge is, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it doesn&#39;t necessarily go away simply because you&#39;ve thrown somebody to the wolves here. And in fact, now you&#39;ve said, this is the punishment, this is the consequence of these actions.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, you put timing on the table. Corey, you&#39;ve put fall guy versus isolated incident. I&#39;m going to kind of classify it as that, right? Are you a scapegoat for something that was more systemic, more broadly known?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s use that as the second one. Carter, let&#39;s stick to timing. And then I want to get, I&#39;ll come in and out of this list. How do you nail timing? Corey&#39;s given us a bit of a scenario where if they did day one, what would happen when the other shoe were to drop? In your strategist experience, how do you nail the timing on something like this?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this? Well, I think it also depends on another factor, and that is, are you actually getting rid of the right guilty party? Timing is less important than, you know, so getting rid of the right person is kind of also a part of this model. Um,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, so if you&#39;re going to release somebody, if you&#39;re going to, to force someone to walk the plank because you, you know, because of malfeasance, then you have to actually be fingering the right person. You have to be pointing their finger at the right person. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And I think that that&#39;s why one of the reasons that this</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">this has not become a general practice any longer, people are moving away from this because so much is controlled from the premier&#39;s offices that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that it becomes really difficult to point any fingers at anybody else. um because ultimately what is the what is the phrase you know you point your finger at someone and there&#39;s three pointing back at you or something like that i don&#39;t know how many fingers you got there cory three or like i keep the thumb in the air so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s three pointing back at me um</span>

            <span class="text">you know this and let&#39;s be honest this practice has really gone out of favor right like there are far fewer ministerial resignations than there used to be There used to be this thing called ministerial responsibility where the minister would resign if something bad happened on their watch. Well, it&#39;s a hell of a lot harder to get a minister to resign when something bad happens on their watch when the watch is actually being directed by the premier&#39;s office. I mean, how happy are you going to be? And this is another factor of it, Zane. And how happy are you going to be to walk the plank, to be asked to leave the ship if</span>

And if you&#39;re in the premier&#39;s office, you&#39;ve got to find a plausible victim. And I think that that&#39;s where Ford has really failed right now.

            <span class="text">Yeah, I want to add a fourth, and it&#39;s a really important one for the context of this particular issue. And it&#39;s part of why I think Doug Ford has a very serious challenge in front of him. If it&#39;s not existential, it&#39;s going to be very close. And that is the question of, in the public&#39;s eye, does the punishment fit the crime?</span>

So if you have have a situation where for example uh somebody buys 30 orange juice and people think that&#39;s really poor judgment then you know the punishment of the crime would be that person leaving the job or taking a reprimand depending i mean obviously resigning over orange juice would be insane but i guess my point would be small small</span>

Now, if you had a more anonymous chief of staff or a more anonymous principal secretary, that might not have the same cachet with the public as a minister who&#39;s perhaps a prominent minister. The reality is there are ministers who are notorious and notable, and there are staff that are notorious and notable. And years ago, it</span>

            <span class="text">it was far more likely it was going to be a minister who was notable. That&#39;s changed a little bit as the media has gone deep into process stories, as people like Stephen Carter, frankly, have become personalities in their own right when they&#39;ve held these roles and been part of the public conversation. But it hasn&#39;t 100% flipped. So it is very, very context dependent. It depends on the staff. It depends on the ministers. It depends on, you know, the leader. And, you</span>

            <span class="text">The old school way of thinking was these people should be silent. They should be in the background. ground. They shouldn&#39;t make noise. Based on what we&#39;re just talking about, aren&#39;t they a helpful – and we talked about this on a previous episode. I think, I don&#39;t know whether you were on that one or Carter and I were, but I&#39;m curious to get your take, Corey. Isn&#39;t it then helpful, just based on the property that you&#39;ve described, to have chiefs of staff and political staffers that are notable so they can be a trading chip, they can be someone who falls on their sword, that they all be in the the model of a Stephen Carter so that if a minister isn&#39;t enough, a minister plus a Jerry Butts or a minister plus a noteworthy chief of staff actually give you some good book value to the public? You think this is like a trade show? I&#39;m not sure. Kind of. What&#39;s what I called it last time?</span>

            <span class="text">No, I mean, honestly, it&#39;s a double-edged sword. And I&#39;m sure Stephen would say it&#39;s a double-edged sword too. I suspect that you could do different calculations in different contexts and decide it&#39;s worth it or not. But sometimes it&#39;s valuable. Sometimes it&#39;s a liability. Sometimes it&#39;s a risk. Sometimes you&#39;re creating additional targets for yourself. And one of the things you have to keep in mind is when you&#39;ve got a staff member who is a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a public personality and a persona, you&#39;ve created another target adjacent to the leader. And that can have some downside too, because we&#39;ve talked about this in a lot of other contexts, but when you go after the chief of staff,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s a great proxy way to go after the principal whether that be a prime minister a premier a mayor you name it you take down their chief of staff first and that&#39;s a way that you weaken them without you know weakening them and that&#39;s a lot harder to do if that person&#39;s not a public person but it&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">to get you is not the words i&#39;m looking for but you know it&#39;s not going to have that kind of cachet the chief of staff to a leader will always be a target internally to caucus dissidents right and it&#39;s because it&#39;s the safe way to give your grievances about the the leader themselves right sure say oh you know i i&#39;m not getting what i want and to say that about the leader is seen as disloyal to say that and then blame the chief of staff is not and that&#39;s a proxy way that you have the same conversation about the leader and of course the reason why it hurts so much when you lose a chief of staff in those contexts and you know and i think this goes to steven&#39;s point about hey they&#39;re not going to go for danielle smith first you&#39;re going to see them go for smith and uh rob anderson right is because once those dominoes have fallen or maybe domino&#39;s not the right those are the pieces in front of the king and once those fall you know there&#39;s nothing protecting it&#39;s a it&#39;s a much clearer shot from that point because you can no longer blame that person as well if you&#39;re the leader so you know i i just i think yes the chief of staff will always be an internal target my point would be if you&#39;ve got a media personality you become an external target as well and look the prime minister&#39;s chief of staff in 2023 is always going to have a public persona that&#39;s just the way it is these days. But there are a lot of premiers with chiefs of staff that are a lot more anonymous, frankly, and they&#39;re not likely to be big targets to the opposition, simply because it just doesn&#39;t have that kind of value to the public.</span>

Like in a 2023 world of positionless politics, which is a term that I&#39;ve invented and coined, and a t-shirt will be available soon on strategist.ca. Corey, what does your chief of staff look like? Are they more in the Carter mold, which Carter&#39;s like one of the few in this country who&#39;s kind of like taking on that more assertive, I&#39;m going to be president, not giving up my Twitter account, but didn&#39;t do that, right?

If it&#39;s a good strategy, if it&#39;s a good tactic to pull at any given time. Now we&#39;ve got a guide for folks to follow. We&#39;re going to move it on to our next segment. Our next segment very quickly here, guys. Summer school report cards. That is right. It is Labor Day. It is the beginning of the school year soon. I know, Corey, you&#39;ve got three to nine kids, so they may have already started school at various times. But Carter, the summertime, as we know it, is over. The summer barbecue season, which we celebrated with various episodes regarding the Calgary Stampede and how politicians should get out there, how they should learn to associate with people, do the retail politics, do all that sort of stuff. Well, we now need to do some report carding. And let&#39;s do that report carding on the federal stage, Carter. I want to measure three things for our leaders, attendance, effort, and results. And I want you to give them a letter grade for each of our three major political parties for Jagmeet Singh, for Justin Trudeau, and for Pierre Polyev. So Carter, let&#39;s start with attendance. Give me your scores for Jagmeet, Justin, and Pierre Polyev on attendance for summer school, which of course we might know as outdoor school or the summer barbecue circuit. How did they do? Did they show up? Were they excited? How do you feel? How did they do?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">do? Well, I think that Justin Trudeau has to get a nine out of 10. He seemed to be everywhere wear this summer uh he was visible he uh you know he he put his head into the lion&#39;s mouth whether it was in calgary or any you know a number of other locations uh he he&#39;s been possibly i think the most visible leader um of</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">of the three so i&#39;m giving him nine out of ten i&#39;m not i mean i&#39;d give him a 10 out of 10 i just i kind of you know reject the idea of a perfect score um normally i just reject the idea of giving a grade at all but uh you know i&#39;m just being nice to you today um And here we are. But,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">But, you know, I think that that was pretty good, pretty good for the for the prime minister. This the second grade for Jagmeet Singh, I think, has to be an F. I mean, did we even see him out this summer? I mean, I don&#39;t recall seeing him at all. I think he was on vacation for the entire time. So I&#39;m giving him an F. he was nowhere and pierre polyev&#39;s gonna find a better body double because you know the person i saw out didn&#39;t look at all like him so um i give the body double on on seven out of ten i give pierre polyev a fail oh</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">interesting carter going with the body double analogy okay nicely done done. Corey, Jameet gets an F, Justin gets a 9 out of 10, Pierre gets an F, and the body double gets a 7 out of 10. Carter, it may surprise you, it might be the same person. Corey, give me your take on attendance for our three major federal party leaders.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let&#39;s talk about Singh first. I didn&#39;t see a ton of Singh, and normally that would be fine. I live in Calgary, Alberta, right? And my media market is primarily Alberta, Alberta, and then Western Canada. And of course, well, he&#39;s a MP from BC doesn&#39;t really mean that that&#39;s necessary. Like, we&#39;re not traveling in the same circles. I&#39;m not reading the newspapers in the places he would be hanging out if he&#39;s looking for electoral success is what I would normally say.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But recently, he did say that he was thinking Alberta would be a breakout market growth area. Yeah. And he didn&#39;t fucking show up here all summer, right? He signed up for a class he didn&#39;t show up for so his attendance is up like he he gets a dnc you can&#39;t say this is an important area for you and not show up right there is a big disconnect between actions and rhetoric actions and strategy if that&#39;s what&#39;s going on there now</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">on the trudeau front yeah he was around everywhere getting separated from his wife really bumped him into the headlines to master strategy i suppose so yeah i mean we were talking about trudeau a lot we&#39;re reacting to trudeau to to Trudeau, but I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think that he&#39;s going to have some weakness in some of these later score areas, because despite being around a lot, doing a cabinet shuffle, having his personal issues out there, coming to the stampede, doing those things, doing all of the stuff you expect a prime minister to do, he&#39;s less and less popular every week. So I think that&#39;s one where we could say, boy, attendance is about all we can say for you right</span>

You know, Carter&#39;s made an interesting, if you follow Carter&#39;s logical consistency, which is hard sometimes, but I think I&#39;m going to. He gives Trudeau a 9 out of 10 for attendance. He gives Trudeau high marks for effort, but he agrees with you that he&#39;s failed, right? He shows up a lot. He works really hard, but he&#39;s terrible at what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s not hitting the mark. How fucked is Justin Trudeau if you were to give him a letter grade on that? And then let&#39;s go through the other leaders for me.

And the reality is when you meet the real Stephen Carter, it&#39;s going to, you know, the one that I marketed on advertising is not going to hold.

Do you agree with Corey&#39;s assessment that it&#39;s... And the reason I bring this up is because on our episode where he was...

Of course, Carter, Corey said last episode, which you weren&#39;t on, that we do this for me. That is indeed only a half-truth because we do do it for you, Carter.</span>

            <span class="text">I take Corey&#39;s point. A reversal is super difficult to walk through. um but it&#39;s happened before and uh previous ontario governments have paid out a small fortune to private corporations uh for things like gas plant deals so one imagines that this very well could fall through whether or not it should um i&#39;ll</span>

Overrated? Are we giving him too much credit for this sort of like persona that he has, that Klein-like, oh, fucked up, sort of like straight talk persona? Or underrated in your mind? What do you think? If this reversal is on the table, right, even as a potential option, Doug Ford&#39;s brand, overrated or underrated as it relates to</span>
