And so if they fast forward seven days, it&#39;s like it&#39;s rit drop day. um and we&#39;re going to spend time in the coming weeks using this alberta election as kind of a case study um for an election cycle and so let&#39;s start that now let&#39;s start chatting about what these seven days before rit drop looks like um for each campaign so probably a lot here it&#39;s going to be a super busy um seven days but cory because you predicted this as our first segment And Carter is not prepared.

            <div class="said">the problem with this is that you just really don&#39;t know where it&#39;s going to go. I mean, Corey&#39;s right. This is the week of discovering problems. So several weeks ago, we would have put together the ground game, you know, pieces, who&#39;s going to be running which campaigns, who&#39;s, you know, pulling together all the campaign managers, making sure we&#39;ve got all of that operating do you know who&#39;s got digital media people pulling them all together you know all of that would have been done in the previous few weeks so now what we&#39;d want to be seeing is a functioning ground game we&#39;d want to be seeing people out uh door knocking we&#39;d want to make sure that the volunteers were being contacted all of these things that you know you don&#39;t want to wait for the main for the main event before you&#39;re making sure that the ground is working uh the next thing is tour you&#39;re going to make sure that your entire tour structure is scripted. We talked a little bit about this last week. It&#39;s all scripted in advance. That&#39;s not because it&#39;s all going to happen like that. But you need to know what you&#39;re switching away from. You need to know what your options are. You know, we had planned to have a talk, you know, to talk about the economy on the third last day. Oh, well, this great opportunity is coming up on the eighth last day. Do we want to do that? You know, yes or no. We&#39;ll move this third last day event to the eighth last day. Advertising, most of the advertising booked. I mean, if you drive around, I&#39;m sure anywhere in Alberta, you&#39;ll see ads for the UCP ads for the NDP. And then there&#39;s this little niggly detail of policy, which I think that we put too much effort in. But I know most political parties actually think that it matters. I think they&#39;re wrong, but they do spend an inordinate amount of time on it. And it&#39;s a great bugaboo of mine, because I want them focusing on on things that actually win elections, and they want to focus on, you know, the</div>

No one thinks, well, I&#39;ve just seen this policy unfold in front of me and I really like it. No, what they want to see is the story that&#39;s related to that, right? So you have to be making sure at each of these areas or each of these announcements, you&#39;re actually making a story and you&#39;re thinking of things like what is the narrative from this you know from this announcement what is the uh how are people going to interact with it how are people going to see themselves in this story well who are the characters right so we would often talk about you know seniors or we would talk about um you</div>

I mean, to a degree, I think the UCP is struggling to find anything vaguely resembling a narrative because they&#39;ve been off track for so long. But the NDP still has a difficult time relating things back to you and me and my parents and my friends. They have a difficult time relating things to story. And that&#39;s going to be their challenge over the course of the next five weeks. Can they, in fact, create a story that people see themselves in as characters? Yeah.</div>

And I was more talking about those nuts and bolts in terms of you&#39;ve got a calendar and you&#39;re saying like, I&#39;m going to be here on these days. And in these weeks, I&#39;m going to be talking about these things. But it is all about story. And those little pieces, those little tour events, those little op-eds that you managed to get out there, the rallies that you have on days where you don&#39;t really have anything to do besides a rally, those are all means to an end, not an end in their own right. Right. And Stephen&#39;s right. A lot of parties think that the policy is the end, but the policy is a means to an end. It is a small character in a story. And so the whole purpose of these policy announcements is bluntly, in a campaign sense, not about policy. It&#39;s to create a media hook to allow you to put the next chapter of your story out there, to say yet another thing about the thing you were talking about yesterday and that you&#39;re talking about all week. That is the chapter in the book you are trying to write for the election. Do</div>

This had nothing to do with world oil prices. This had nothing to do with your companies. This had everything to do with Rachel Notley and the NDP.

What happened was Redford then, by moving more towards the center, more towards the left relatively, surrendered a fair bit to the Wild Rose and the contest became about the Wild Rose versus the PCs and the PCs shut out everyone else. The election ended, I think, with the Liberals getting like 10 or 11% of the vote and the NDP getting 1% behind that. But it was really a contest between the Wild Rose and the PCs. And so as like, as somebody who was running the campaign for, we knew we were going to be the third party well in advance, like the Wild Rose were pulling ahead of the Liberals for quite some time.</div>

And I think that that&#39;s one of the challenges of election campaigns is that sometimes your candidate doesn&#39;t want to fit the role that is best for the election. And again, I worry about both Danielle Smith and Rachel Notley in this. Both of them are very strong women who have their own ideas about how they wish to be perceived. And that&#39;s great.

So in campaigns, you&#39;re in the bubble or you&#39;re out of the bubble. And most people are in the bubble, right? Because we care more about the campaign than the general population does. so everybody who&#39;s working on the campaign is in a bubble of a sort but then there&#39;s really in the bubble and there is nothing more in the bubble than being on the leaders tour bus being on the leaders tour bus you only hear the negative you do not understand what&#39;s going on with the bigger picture you&#39;re not even seeing necessarily the media hits or anything like that you might get clippings you might be shown you know what uh people you know think is important at that particular moment but you&#39;re not you&#39;re just not getting the fullness of of how things are going or how things are feeling and</div>

But in province-wide campaigns, there is no other way to do it. You have to listen to your team. And if you don&#39;t trust your team, get a different team.

The leader&#39;s got leader stuff to do. And if everybody&#39;s doing their role, things move a little bit smoother here. The answer is fundamentally about need. And every campaign is going to have different needs. So is money a little light? Well, then the leaders probably work in the phones with donors, especially, you know, in an environment where you can get, you know, those big donors, like the three, $4,000 that you need to just fuel the campaign. are you a little worried about candidates that&#39;s not going to be the case for either of these two parties this time but you then you try to go out and drum up the last of the candidates you need and figure all of that out there</div>

And you try to hook on to those as best you can. And quite often, if you&#39;re sitting there, and you&#39;ve got your calendar to almost the start of where this was, and you&#39;re looking at those 28 days, and you&#39;ve got 35 days worth of stuff to do, well, then you&#39;re going to spend this week doing those those other seven days of things right you&#39;re going to pull it out and even though it&#39;s not in the campaign it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s pre-launch it&#39;s not the high value stuff you want to structure it along those ways but you start telling that story and start building towards the things that you want to say and and really truly there&#39;s just not enough hours in the day i&#39;m the leader like the campaign manager like any of the campaign staff will just be saying uh shit i don&#39;t i don&#39;t have enough to get done everything that i want to get done the other thing i&#39;ll say is there&#39;s a a very practical thing that occurs the week before a campaign when you&#39;re an elected official that&#39;s cleaning up a lot of shit you know</div>

You&#39;ll recall Stephen Harper called it, and it was just months before this particular campaign. And one of the things we talked about at the time was</div>

And it was just too long to have one team running, you know, redline that long, and they needed to kind of swap them out. But the reality is you should probably be able to manage 28, 35 days. I hope they&#39;re going into this somewhat somewhat well rested. Um, and I hope that they&#39;ve somewhat time managed themselves because there is just this phenomenon that any campaigner will know, which is like, you don&#39;t even want to sleep. You realize you feel so acutely every hour that goes by, uh, that you are not doing something productive. And, uh, you know, you&#39;re working 16 hour days plus trying to get things done. Um,</div>

I mean, I don&#39;t know, Stephen, maybe you&#39;ve got different thoughts, but in my experience, you don&#39;t, right?
