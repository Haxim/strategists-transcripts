            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">here I was asking what the topics were going to be and Corey had already figured it out, you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">he predicted it. Yeah. So we&#39;re one week out, essentially, from a May 1 rit drop. We&#39;re talking tonight, Sunday evening, most people will probably be listening Monday morning. And so if they fast forward seven days, it&#39;s like it&#39;s rit drop day. um and we&#39;re going to spend time in the coming weeks using this alberta election as kind of a case study um for an election cycle and so let&#39;s start that now let&#39;s start chatting about what these seven days before rit drop looks like um for each campaign so probably a lot here it&#39;s going to be a super busy um seven days but cory because you predicted this as our first segment And Carter is not prepared. Let&#39;s start with you.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">What are the kinds of things like what are the what are the top priorities? And we can kind of get into the nitty gritty of different topics. But like, what are the top priorities right now for a campaign seven days before Red Drop? up</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">these are my least favorite seven days in a campaign like the the anticipation before the the firing is just just the worst um i will say in my experience that maybe stevens has been different um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">um that um the seven days before you think you&#39;re going to be more prepared and more ready than you are like there&#39;s just like all sorts of random things that come across your your radar that you&#39;re like, oh shit, is that done? Oh my God, that candidate still doesn&#39;t have signs. Holy crap. Like how come that literature is still not here? I ordered that like eight weeks ago, you know? And, and so, um, it&#39;s a lot of, uh, anxiety. Have I forgotten anything? Have</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Have I gotten it all? And, uh, it&#39;s going back and circling through and, and checklist after checklist after checklist and preparation. And, and in my experience, you&#39;re never actually as prepared as you want to be.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Annalise</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, how about you? Are they your least favorite week before?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">There&#39;s a lot of least favorite weeks, but yeah, I mean, we&#39;re now into the top five least favorite weeks of a campaign. So the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the problem with this is that you just really don&#39;t know where it&#39;s going to go. I mean, Corey&#39;s right. This is the week of discovering problems. So several weeks ago, we would have put together the ground game, you know, pieces, who&#39;s going to be running which campaigns, who&#39;s, you know, pulling together all the campaign managers, making sure we&#39;ve got all of that operating do you know who&#39;s got digital media people pulling them all together you know all of that would have been done in the previous few weeks so now what we&#39;d want to be seeing is a functioning ground game we&#39;d want to be seeing people out uh door knocking we&#39;d want to make sure that the volunteers were being contacted all of these things that you know you don&#39;t want to wait for the main for the main event before you&#39;re making sure that the ground is working uh the next thing is tour you&#39;re going to make sure that your entire tour structure is scripted. We talked a little bit about this last week. It&#39;s all scripted in advance. That&#39;s not because it&#39;s all going to happen like that. But you need to know what you&#39;re switching away from. You need to know what your options are. You know, we had planned to have a talk, you know, to talk about the economy on the third last day. Oh, well, this great opportunity is coming up on the eighth last day. Do we want to do that? You know, yes or no. We&#39;ll move this third last day event to the eighth last day. Advertising, most of the advertising booked. I mean, if you drive around, I&#39;m sure anywhere in Alberta, you&#39;ll see ads for the UCP ads for the NDP. And then there&#39;s this little niggly detail of policy, which I think that we put too much effort in. But I know most political parties actually think that it matters. I think they&#39;re wrong, but they do spend an inordinate amount of time on it. And it&#39;s a great bugaboo of mine, because I want them focusing on on things that actually win elections, and they want to focus on, you know, the</span>

So imagine it was a different era. And imagine that healthcare was only one of the three weeks that you wanted to talk about.

Every day you&#39;re in a different place with a different backdrop and a different skyscraper behind you, whatever it is, that&#39;s Tora&#39;s job.

Too many people do what Corey just kind of did and then fixed at the end. He listed off all of the tour activities, all of the policy announcements, the tour elements. No one thinks that way. No one thinks, well, I&#39;ve just seen this policy unfold in front of me and I really like it. No, what they want to see is the story that&#39;s related to that, right? So you have to be making sure at each of these areas or each of these announcements, you&#39;re actually making a story and you&#39;re thinking of things like what is the narrative from this you know from this announcement what is the uh how are people going to interact with it how are people going to see themselves in this story well who are the characters right so we would often talk about you know seniors or we would talk about um you</span>

            <span class="text">yeah whiner um anyways i i just think that the the stories are the most important elements and i think that that&#39;s still where both of these uh campaigns struggle each of them has the announcement stuff down. I mean, to a degree, I think the UCP is struggling to find anything vaguely resembling a narrative because they&#39;ve been off track for so long. But the NDP still has a difficult time relating things back to you and me and my parents and my friends. They have a difficult time relating things to story. And that&#39;s going to be their challenge over the course of the next five weeks. Can they, in fact, create a story that people see themselves in as characters? Yeah.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And I was more talking about those nuts and bolts in terms of you&#39;ve got a calendar and you&#39;re saying like, I&#39;m going to be here on these days. And in these weeks, I&#39;m going to be talking about these things. But it is all about story. And those little pieces, those little tour events, those little op-eds that you managed to get out there, the rallies that you have on days where you don&#39;t really have anything to do besides a rally, those are all means to an end, not an end in their own right. Right. And Stephen&#39;s right. A lot of parties think that the policy is the end, but the policy is a means to an end. It is a small character in a story. And so the whole purpose of these policy announcements is bluntly, in a campaign sense, not about policy. It&#39;s to create a media hook to allow you to put the next chapter of your story out there, to say yet another thing about the thing you were talking about yesterday and that you&#39;re talking about all week. That is the chapter in the book you are trying to write for the election. Do</span>

This had nothing to do with world oil prices. This had nothing to do with your companies. This had everything to do with Rachel Notley and the NDP. And because both of those stories were set so well, and people could see themselves in those characters, both of those campaigns. Oh, no. Hold on. While those wound up shitting the bed. I was misremembering that. Oh, that&#39;s right. Because we then said a new story, which was, you can&#39;t trust them. They&#39;re crazy. And that story replaced the previous story.

And And it&#39;s one, you know, a lot of people try and then slay the truth, you know, the fact that the truths don&#39;t actually support the story all the time.

            <span class="text">hard stat is the Liberals dropped in the polls from about 22%, 23% to 11%, 12% overnight as that support went to Alison Redford. Now, that 11% never came back. What happened was Redford then, by moving more towards the center, more towards the left relatively, surrendered a fair bit to the Wild Rose and the contest became about the Wild Rose versus the PCs and the PCs shut out everyone else. The election ended, I think, with the Liberals getting like 10 or 11% of the vote and the NDP getting 1% behind that. But it was really a contest between the Wild Rose and the PCs. And so as like, as somebody who was running the campaign for, we knew we were going to be the third party well in advance, like the Wild Rose were pulling ahead of the Liberals for quite some time.</span>

No. But that was our attempt to wrestle the ballot question away, just as Stephen at the same time was trying to make one about the competency of the Wildrose, just as the Wildrose was trying to make one overall about you&#39;re tired of these guys, it&#39;s time for change.

            <span class="text">Had we kept our original brand position, I think we would have had a much easier time of it. But by the time we got to April of 2012, the brand position that we had in 2011 of, you know, mother of a young daughter, daughter of aging parents, we&#39;d abandoned because Alison just didn&#39;t want to be that brand. And I think that that&#39;s one of the challenges of election campaigns is that sometimes your candidate doesn&#39;t want to fit the role that is best for the election. And again, I worry about both Danielle Smith and Rachel Notley in this. Both of them are very strong women who have their own ideas about how they wish to be perceived. And that&#39;s great. Got to be authentic. We&#39;ve talked about being authentic a lot, but you&#39;ve got to be authentic in a role that people actually want to vote for. Being authentic in a position that people don&#39;t want to vote, that person&#39;s called a loser. And And, you</span>

            <span class="text">Well, what I want them doing is whatever they&#39;re told. What I don&#39;t want them doing is trying to call the play from the bus. So in campaigns, you&#39;re in the bubble or you&#39;re out of the bubble. And most people are in the bubble, right? Because we care more about the campaign than the general population does. so everybody who&#39;s working on the campaign is in a bubble of a sort but then there&#39;s really in the bubble and there is nothing more in the bubble than being on the leaders tour bus being on the leaders tour bus you only hear the negative you do not understand what&#39;s going on with the bigger picture you&#39;re not even seeing necessarily the media hits or anything like that you might get clippings you might be shown you know what uh people you know think is important at that particular moment but you&#39;re not you&#39;re just not getting the fullness of of how things are going or how things are feeling and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">yet nonetheless most candidates um call the ball they want us they want to be in charge of how the campaign is unfolding they think that you know their instincts are what got them to this place and they&#39;re not going to uh suddenly become just somebody who who sits on the sidelines and waits to be told what to do. But in province-wide campaigns, there is no other way to do it. You have to listen to your team. And if you don&#39;t trust your team, get a different team. Because there&#39;s no means of success without putting your trust in the people who are not blinded by the bubble.</span>

            <span class="text">what I have done in the weeks before a campaign, you know, like what, and I honestly can&#39;t remember. And part of that is actually because of the division of labor Stephen was talking about. You know, the campaign manager&#39;s got campaign manager stuff to do. The leader&#39;s got leader stuff to do. And if everybody&#39;s doing their role, things move a little bit smoother here. The answer is fundamentally about need. And every campaign is going to have different needs. So is money a little light? Well, then the leaders probably work in the phones with donors, especially, you know, in an environment where you can get, you know, those big donors, like the three, $4,000 that you need to just fuel the campaign. are you a little worried about candidates that&#39;s not going to be the case for either of these two parties this time but you then you try to go out and drum up the last of the candidates you need and figure all of that out there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there are a couple of nuts and bolts things the leader has no business being involved in and any time free and any time you get the opportunity you also want to be setting the stage for the campaign it is true that people will pay more attention during the campaign but outside of the campaign period the week they&#39;re going to be paying the most attention intention, week</span>

            <span class="text">week before the campaign period. So you do treat it as a bit of campaign light, you&#39;re building up to it, you&#39;re trying to create this sense of momentum, lots of process stories about what the parties are doing in the lead up to an election gets very meta in that sense. And you try to hook on to those as best you can. And quite often, if you&#39;re sitting there, and you&#39;ve got your calendar to almost the start of where this was, and you&#39;re looking at those 28 days, and you&#39;ve got 35 days worth of stuff to do, well, then you&#39;re going to spend this week doing those those other seven days of things right you&#39;re going to pull it out and even though it&#39;s not in the campaign it&#39;s not you know it&#39;s pre-launch it&#39;s not the high value stuff you want to structure it along those ways but you start telling that story and start building towards the things that you want to say and and really truly there&#39;s just not enough hours in the day i&#39;m the leader like the campaign manager like any of the campaign staff will just be saying uh shit i don&#39;t i don&#39;t have enough to get done everything that i want to get done the other thing i&#39;ll say is there&#39;s a a very practical thing that occurs the week before a campaign when you&#39;re an elected official that&#39;s cleaning up a lot of shit you know</span>

            <span class="text">you don&#39;t oh god i mean ultimately the thing about campaigns in general which i think makes them very interesting relative to a lot of things that occur in the corporate world uh even even happen in politics and in longer lead like party senses and whatnot is they&#39;re not built for distance right they are built to survive 28 days 35 days you you have fairly ramshackle processes and procedures including ways to deal with like your own personal health and sanity now one of the things that was super interesting about the 2015 campaign federally not provincially was how how long it was. You&#39;ll recall Stephen Harper called it, and it was just months before this particular campaign. And one of the things we talked about at the time was</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">was you could see people starting to lose their mind about halfway through. And it was just too long to have one team running, you know, redline that long, and they needed to kind of swap them out. But the reality is you should probably be able to manage 28, 35 days. I hope they&#39;re going into this somewhat somewhat well rested. Um, and I hope that they&#39;ve somewhat time managed themselves because there is just this phenomenon that any campaigner will know, which is like, you don&#39;t even want to sleep. You realize you feel so acutely every hour that goes by, uh, that you are not doing something productive. And, uh, you know, you&#39;re working 16 hour days plus trying to get things done. Um,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s why campaigns in Canada, I think aren&#39;t longer. And so, uh, in terms of how are you trying How you&#39;re trying to pace yourself, how you&#39;re trying to manage your health, your sleep schedule, all of that. I mean, I don&#39;t know, Stephen, maybe you&#39;ve got different thoughts, but in my experience, you don&#39;t, right? You live this unhealthy to the wall lifestyle and you hope that somebody around you is sane enough at any time to be that break on your judgment.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

You&#39;re going to work 16 hour days for those 35 days and you&#39;re going to be exhausted. exhausted uh you&#39;re going to get sick and you will power through it and then after the campaign you are going to get so sick you think you&#39;re going to die because your body your body just beats the shit out of you yeah</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">there are there are a few lessons that have been learned number one feed the campaign team um the campaigns that don&#39;t feed their team wind up you know with with even sicker group of people uh so food is usually brought in um by you know smart campaigns uh at least twice a day um sometimes</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">sometimes there&#39;s breakfasts but more more often than not there&#39;s not breakfast but you need the food to come in because people will not go out to eat they will stay where they are because they have shit to get done and then they will find out you know hours later that they&#39;ve made a horrible mistake because they are now exhausted and they&#39;re going to collapse right here on the floor and when was was the last time you ate what is eating i don&#39;t even know what that is anymore so</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so bringing in food is is one of the key ways and bringing in the right food like jesus you know you can&#39;t just eat subway for for the better part of uh um you know a month and a you know month plus you have to have decent food you have to have it in reasonable quantities um i like you know if you you have the money and it&#39;s a provincial campaign does a little catering contract to a small company can go a long ways i&#39;ll tell you the best food surrey i could go back to surrey tomorrow the food was unbelievable it</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it depends on how much money you have. If you&#39;ve got enough for the entire campaign, then you are trying to shovel as much money out the door as this week as you possibly can to soften the ground, to do the advertising you want to do, to just take advantage of the fact that you are not currently covered by the campaign finance limits, right? The campaign spending limits, I mean.</span>

It&#39;s getting shittier bit by bit. And it does feel like we&#39;re probably just one big moment away from the suddenly, right? Where there&#39;s just a total flight.

And it kind of felt like the whole platform was at war with itself all weekend, lots of weird stuff happening, kind of culminating with Elon Musk as punishment for his critics, giving them blue check marks, and then giving accounts that have a million blue check checkmarks again, like it&#39;s total chaos.
