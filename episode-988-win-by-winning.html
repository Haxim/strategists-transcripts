          <p>The gang gets together to talk about the issues of the week, including dipping their toes into the Ontario election which Zain promises "we'll do an episode about, probably." Look forward to that and look present to what we just released.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are subjected to Zain's "strategy scale" - grading an Ontario PC ad, Jason Kenney's punditry on the Conservative leadership race, bulk membership purchase accusations, Trudeau in Ukraine and more. Was Trudeau's visit to Ukraine a political win? Will accusations of bulk membership purchases change the UCP leadership review? And how good are good photos? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

There is no shortage. There&#39;s no shortage of topics to talk about. And I haven&#39;t even talked about pure polyamory and cryptocurrency. And David Dodge on CTV&#39;s question period saying pure polyamory has no idea what he&#39;s talking about, and it&#39;s a bunch of bullshit. So much to talk about. But guys, let&#39;s start here with our strategy scan. For those who are not familiar with this segment, I run down topics. I ask Stephen and Corey to give it a ranking on terms a strategy between one and 10. How good is the strategy? How good is the move? And then we discussed amongst each other. You could also discuss at home. We just won&#39;t be able to hear you. It&#39;s just that sort of medium. We don&#39;t stop the participation. We also don&#39;t give credit for participation. So feel free to participate at home, but we will participate here and we&#39;ll discuss how we kind of upgrade that strategy, how we make it better, what would make it better, what would have been an alternative take, what would you have done, et cetera. And Carter, what do I always say? There is no better way to get started than to get started. And there&#39;s no better person to get started with than Corey Hogan.

            <div class="said">So maybe it&#39;s a poorly targeted ad, and maybe it will help the Liberals move forward, or maybe it&#39;s running nowhere, and maybe they were trying to make it look like they see the NDP as the real threat to push people to the NDP from the Liberals and try to create some chattering amongst the chattering classes. That&#39;s also a real possibility. So it&#39;s hard to say without digging a little bit deeper into how it&#39;s being run and who it&#39;s being run towards. I do think one of the things about modern campaigns and how digital they are is you do have an immense ability to target, right? So you can run certain ads with certain people and not worry too, too much about the bleed outside of those communities, or at least not nearly as much as you had to worry about when there were only four television channels back in the 1980s, right? So there are options here that may allow this to be an effective tactic.</div>

And so they just hit the exact same resolution and have the exact same 23 go forward and say, we&#39;re now asking you to do one properly. This was a farce. Here are the 18 reasons it was a farce. You said it was only safe in person. You then changed it from in person. You changed those rules after the fact. You allowed bulk purchase of memberships by one party, but not by all parties. You delayed the introduction of laws that would protect us from a situation like that until after the membership cut off. I mean, you can almost imagine it being nailed to a church door like these are our problems.</div>
