There is no shortage. There&#39;s no shortage of topics to talk about. And I haven&#39;t even talked about pure polyamory and cryptocurrency. And David Dodge on CTV&#39;s question period saying pure polyamory has no idea what he&#39;s talking about, and it&#39;s a bunch of bullshit. So much to talk about. But guys, let&#39;s start here with our strategy scan. For those who are not familiar with this segment, I run down topics. I ask Stephen and Corey to give it a ranking on terms a strategy between one and 10. How good is the strategy? How good is the move? And then we discussed amongst each other. You could also discuss at home. We just won&#39;t be able to hear you. It&#39;s just that sort of medium. We don&#39;t stop the participation. We also don&#39;t give credit for participation. So feel free to participate at home, but we will participate here and we&#39;ll discuss how we kind of upgrade that strategy, how we make it better, what would make it better, what would have been an alternative take, what would you have done, et cetera. And Carter, what do I always say? There is no better way to get started than to get started. And there&#39;s no better person to get started with than Corey Hogan. So, Corey, we&#39;re going to start with you. Our first one is</span>

So, Corey, we&#39;ve now got this wild, anotherworldly ability to play clips. This is crazy. People are actually taking a shit on me for my preparation.</span>

            <span class="text">Andrea Horvath&#39;s NDP are out of touch. They fight against building new roads and highways to end gridlock. They oppose building more homes that families can afford. They attack plans to open Ontario and want to keep it locked down forever. Her NDPers protest, criticize, and delay getting things done at every turn. Because that&#39;s what Andrea Horvath demands they do. The NDP would be an expensive disaster for Ontario. Ontario just like they always have been authorized by the CFO for the Ontario PC party</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, I need your take on this. Scale of one to 10, the Ford strategy here targeting the Horwath NDP rather than perhaps going after who might be second in the polls.

            <span class="text">So maybe it&#39;s a poorly targeted ad, and maybe it will help the Liberals move forward, or maybe it&#39;s running nowhere, and maybe they were trying to make it look like they see the NDP as the real threat to push people to the NDP from the Liberals and try to create some chattering amongst the chattering classes. That&#39;s also a real possibility. So it&#39;s hard to say without digging a little bit deeper into how it&#39;s being run and who it&#39;s being run towards. I do think one of the things about modern campaigns and how digital they are is you do have an immense ability to target, right? So you can run certain ads with certain people and not worry too, too much about the bleed outside of those communities, or at least not nearly as much as you had to worry about when there were only four television channels back in the 1980s, right? So there are options here that may allow this to be an effective tactic.</span>

And showcasing this, I got this, right? Both in media interviews and flying across the country, being like, by the way, right? I&#39;m still one of the conservative brain trusts leaders in this country. I&#39;m here. You have access to my brain. You have access to me. I still lead this movement in many ways.

You said it was only safe in person. You then changed it from in person. You changed those rules after the fact. You allowed bulk purchase of memberships by one party, but not by all parties. You delayed the introduction of laws that would protect us from a situation like that until after the membership cut off.
