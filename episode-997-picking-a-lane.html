            <span class="text">do want to talk about the Raj and Sonny launch event, Corey Hogan, because she launched today in a 13 minute speech outdoors with banners beside her. And then she later went to a what seemed like a several hundred person events where she launched her campaign on a stage with multiple banners of herself. Corey, I know you&#39;ve been trying to make this go viral and meme worthy on the Internet. at. But the question I want to ask Stephen Carter is I don&#39;t want to poke fun at this. I want to actually ask Carter, is the launch event dead? Because we had Raj and Sonny do a launch event that many might characterize as a little bit underwhelming today from how it perhaps looked to us, right? We&#39;re not the membership acknowledge that. You had Lila here who launched on Ryan Jesperson&#39;s podcast and then with a couple of tweets, as far as I can tell, and I&#39;m just going to head on to her Twitter account in a second. I don&#39;t see any sort of website. I don&#39;t see any sort of brand change i don&#39;t see any sort of like overnight let&#39;s flip the switch uh sort of thing so carter the question i have is we&#39;ve discussed the elements of launch events we&#39;ve actually never discussed the binary of are these events dead are they even necessary talk to me about that give me give me your hot take first and we&#39;ll jump into some of the reasons why yes or no i</span>

            <span class="text">like the smartest thing in the whole world was to give the check to Heather. That was unreal, Corey. Good call on your part. I was thinking, you know what? I could use that money for so many things. But when I gave that check to Heather, I&#39;ll tell you something. Everything was amazing. So I&#39;m pretty happy with that. Let me continue on. I have done launch events and I have done non-launch events. In In fact, I just did a launch event last week in CERT. We had a group of people, some 600 people came to an event. There was a 10 or 11 minute speech.</span>

            <span class="text">The audience did all the things that the audience was supposed to do. I don&#39;t think it changed. It certainly won&#39;t change the outcome of the election. It was a fine</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">fine event. It was absolutely fine. It was as good as you&#39;re going to get in these things. And I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to have any real impact. and i think that raj and sani&#39;s event wasn&#39;t as good as you&#39;re going to get in those thing in these things and that&#39;s where you might actually have impact because it&#39;s not about if your event is good it&#39;s about what happens if your event doesn&#39;t work and sani&#39;s event i don&#39;t know how cory how long you made it into the video cory i i think i made it um three and a half minutes uh but i skipped ahead for much of the three and a half minutes so i&#39;m not even sure how far I made it. So Mike, I think that you can do a good launch event. I&#39;m just thinking that if you don&#39;t do a good launch event, it&#39;s going to haunt you. And I don&#39;t think Raj and Sonny did a particularly good launch event.</span>

            <span class="text">do it, like obviously like do it well, but how do you make the decision on whether to do it or not? That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to understand. Cause you said you&#39;ve done both. So what was your, what was your metric to decide? Was it the candidate? Was it the the moment? Was it where you stood in the race? Like what was the strategic calculation based on we&#39;re going to go in with a launch event versus we&#39;re going to do perhaps the Lila here style? And Corey, I&#39;ll come to you in a second.</span>

We were never going to be able to do that. So we didn&#39;t do an event. Lila here couldn&#39;t draw as many people, you know, a thousand people to an event. So she chose not to do one. I think that that&#39;s the right call. And I think that Raj and Sonny maybe should have thought a little bit more about what, what she could or couldn&#39;t do in terms of the overall impact of her, of her event cory</span>

            <span class="text">no i mean steven started giving the answer i wanted to give here which is it goes back to your campaign your story your brand it depends on what you&#39;re trying to do and for many people the proper move is just not to try to play in that space i you know and when you say launch event steven was talking about a thousand people there that&#39;s not even what the sony event was the sony launch although there were follow-on events throughout the day subsequent this</span>

            <span class="text">have banners there have your candidate there don&#39;t have your candidate there there with in front of banners of your candidate has been a couple of times i&#39;ll confess in my own career where we&#39;ve ended up there because that tends to be collateral you have around like the face on a banner that should never be the backdrop to the leader and one of the minor things that really blows my mind about the sunny event is that uh especially the later events of the day she&#39;d be on a stage with four of these banners of her wearing the exact same suit that she was wearing standing at the lectern giving the speech she was giving there and that&#39;s that&#39;s distracting directing, if nothing else. So don&#39;t, don&#39;t do anything like that. But, um, when</span>

            <span class="text">when you decide whether you&#39;re going to do an event like this, or maybe just go on the radio, or maybe you are going to try to fill a room of a thousand people that really depends on what you&#39;re trying to say as a campaign, or it should, right? Like you shouldn&#39;t do these things just because in any kind of context, I mean, this is literally the purpose of this show, right? Strategy. Think about the context, the strategic context of these things here. And there&#39;s been successful non on launches one of my favorite was bernie sanders i think launching in maybe it was 2012 2016 uh his campaign where he literally just like walked across a field uh from the congress building he&#39;s like oh i&#39;m running for president and that was his launch right uh</span>

We had all these families and we were focusing on the family or whatever the messaging structures were. But that focus on the individuals, the focus on the bigger picture becomes the message.

And I think that Raj and Sonny today, she launched as though she had a big time campaign. The four events was a big thing, right? Like being able to do four events in a single day. I mean, I was impressed by just the logistics piece. I just didn&#39;t need the launch in front. I think the problem with it was the launch in front of the legislature. I think if you take away that 13-minute speech and instead just go with, you know, Raj and insani is going to be across the province working hard for all of you i think it would have been a much stronger set of events where each each city or each place would have had their own media event instead of this kind of one singular media event at the start i</span>

But here&#39;s the thing, you know, Carter, you&#39;ve run a lot of come from behind campaigns or what we&#39;d call like narrow path victory campaigns, right? Where you&#39;re the underdog. And I almost sense, you know, with with some campaigns, and I&#39;m not accusing the Sony campaign of doing this, but if you know you&#39;re an underdog, that you have to almost overcompensate with your seriousness on day one, that you don&#39;t have any time to waste, that there&#39;s there can&#39;t be a slow burn to catch up to show viability because you&#39;ve got to do it right away. Talk to me about that a bit, because it can backfire in certain cases. And I&#39;m trying to extract this beyond the Sony launch today to maybe looking desperate in certain situations, maybe looking like you&#39;re in overreach, maybe looking like you&#39;re redlining on capacity, as Corey said. So Carter, talk to me about the strategy of a campaign that knows it&#39;s an underdog, that&#39;s trying to showcase viability, but feels like they don&#39;t have time to actually do a slow burn or make the case that they need to show seriousness on day one. Is there a misnomer here in strategies or a mistake you see often? Just your reflections on that. this</span>

This, of course, after a significant dip earlier in the month. The reason we bring this up as it relates to the race, of course, Corey Hogan, because one Pierre Pallieva said earlier at a shawarma shop where he purchased his shawarma in crypto, if I&#39;m not mistaken, or Bitcoin more specifically, that Bitcoin and by extension crypto was the way to opt out of inflation.</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. So background that I think most Canadians will know at least a little bit about. When Pierre Polyev bought that shawarma, made those comments, Bitcoin was going for $59,000 Canadian. It today hit below $27,000 for a bit. It&#39;s now above $28,000 as of seconds ago, 9.32pm mountain time. I just took a bit of a scan on it. That&#39;s a pretty big drop. That&#39;s a more than 50% drop. And the suggestion that this is a way to opt out inflation was always a little nutty. I mean, if you invested in Bitcoin in 2013, you&#39;re still looking at annualized returns of like 100% still looks like a brilliant investment.</span>

And if you purchased it, if you got on that roller coaster in the last two years, basically, you&#39;re not you&#39;re behind, you&#39;ve lost money at And so that&#39;s also a bit of a challenge here.

I want to remind that, and I want to almost get you to either revise that or re-up that or give me a take on that, on what you think his competitors should do to take advantage of this. Because right now, we&#39;re in the middle of another bloodbath. Most people don&#39;t understand crypto, which is perhaps the cloud cover that Pierre has. They don&#39;t understand what it is. So what&#39;s the simple story here? Take this complicated currency, boil it down into a nugget for me, and give me something on a silver platter that you can hand over to Jean Charest or Patrick Brown tomorrow. Bake it a bit more from previous times we&#39;ve discussed this, Carter. Well,</span>

And it costs $8.75, or if we&#39;re in Calgary, $12.75. And that is the same price that you would have paid a month ago. If you were paying with Bitcoin, you now have to pay twice as much. It is twice as expensive because your Bitcoin dropped so substantially because all of this up and down and back and forth is difficult for people to track. But if you say to them, I am taking good old Canadian currency issued by the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Canada, you know, look, it&#39;s the signature of the president or the head of the Bank of Canada is right on this thing.

            <span class="text">Carter, let&#39;s talk about the Conservative Party membership. So last time we discussed this, we took the numbers as they were. I asked you guys whether there was any incentive in lying about it. Corey said, no, these numbers are going to come out in a couple of days. Carter said, fuck yeah, I would lie about it. Well, turns out accusations about lying are are literally what have fueled the conservative leadership race for the last, what, seven days, 10 days? Each campaign pointing their fingers at the other. Jenny Byrne saying Patrick Brown is a liar seven times on television in a five-minute interview. Also releasing a video, a senior advisor to Pierre Pallièbe for clarity. Jenny Byrne is releasing a video about Patrick Brown will say anything. How did he buy this multimillion dollar house? Some suggesting that&#39;s Pierre being Pierre. Their campaign scorched earth. Others suggesting, oh, is this campaign actually behind? It is now a little bit panicked about the situation. So we&#39;re seeing a very, very interesting dynamic play up, Carter, regarding the memberships. Also, strategists from each of the campaigns saying we&#39;re going to challenge other parties&#39; memberships on eligibility. What do you make of the current state of affairs, Carter? And what do you make of this? Let&#39;s start start with the membership challenges, that eligibility is going to be challenged on thousands and thousands of rival party members. Is this a common process within the leaderships of campaigns that you&#39;ve run? And do you feel like it will be on overdrive here as we have all this haze about what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not so real in this leadership race?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, there&#39;s a lot at stake. And when there&#39;s a lot at stake, people break the rules and other people will kind of, you know try and find a different way to achieve their ends and so yeah i mean the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">the the objective or the the exercise of challenging people&#39;s memberships is entirely predictable because if you have a way of taking a significant number of memberships out of play then</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">then it&#39;s the same as getting votes for yourself right you&#39;re now in a much stronger position than you would have been if you just allowed it to all unfold naturally so you you and there&#39;s very little cost to doing it It&#39;s happening literally behind a closed door. So you go out and you say, well, this member is not a real member. Well, who the hell even knows? No one even knows. There&#39;s no cost to you as a campaign. So you&#39;re better off to challenge those as much as possible. as possible. Now, the party has a role in this as well, because the party doesn&#39;t want to disallow every candidate or every membership. So they&#39;re going to fight for the members that they see are real. A lot of campaigns or a lot of parties will make sure that the unreal or the not real candidates or memberships that are sold are pulled from circulation. But it&#39;s still tricky tricky to make sure that everything gets out that needs to be out. So my, my experience with this is that a</span>

We just hate you and we don&#39;t give a flying fuck. We&#39;re We&#39;re going to go negative at every turn, as they did on day one of their campaign to to to to Patrick Brown. What do you think it is and what is your interpretation? Because there is conventional wisdom about when to go negative. And so does this kind of break a rule? Does this form with convention with you? What are you thinking?</span>

They are they are in charge. Even when there&#39;s a Democratic president, they are still calling the shots. That&#39;s the height of conservatism.

Why did Fox News have to go without commercials? Because for the first time, they knew that they were actually under threat by the communications from the other side. Because for so long, the liberal and the Democrats had decided that they were going to cede the ground. They weren&#39;t going to engage in the propaganda. They weren&#39;t going to use the sensational language. You know what? Good job.

If at least the Democrats have the ability to start to put a mirror in front of people and show them how they&#39;ve been tricked and how they&#39;ve been fooled, maybe, maybe we can avoid that civil war. But as we continue right now, the probability that the election is going to be seen to be stolen by 50% of the population in the United States is extremely high.
