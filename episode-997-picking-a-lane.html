        <p>Inexplicably, the show leads with the launch of the Rajan Sawhney campaign for UCP leader before turning attention questionable decisions, short memories and the world collapsing around us. America and the Conservative Party of Canada guest star.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss leadership campaign launches, Poilievre's Bitcoin liability and his civil war with the Brown campaign. Do leadership launch events still matter? If you're the Liberals, when's the right time to define Pierre Poilievre? And where will the Dow Jones Industrial Average be in 30 years (adjusted for inflation)? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

And then she later went to a what seemed like a several hundred person events where she launched her campaign on a stage with multiple banners of herself. Corey, I know you&#39;ve been trying to make this go viral and meme worthy on the Internet. at. But the question I want to ask Stephen Carter is I don&#39;t want to poke fun at this. I want to actually ask Carter, is the launch event dead? Because we had Raj and Sonny do a launch event that many might characterize as a little bit underwhelming today from how it perhaps looked to us, right? We&#39;re not the membership acknowledge that. You had Lila here who launched on Ryan Jesperson&#39;s podcast and then with a couple of tweets, as far as I can tell, and I&#39;m just going to head on to her Twitter account in a second. I don&#39;t see any sort of website. I don&#39;t see any sort of brand change i don&#39;t see any sort of like overnight let&#39;s flip the switch uh sort of thing so carter the question i have is we&#39;ve discussed the elements of launch events we&#39;ve actually never discussed the binary of are these events dead are they even necessary talk to me about that give me give me your hot take first and we&#39;ll jump into some of the reasons why yes or no i</div>

I could use that money for so many things. But when I gave that check to Heather, I&#39;ll tell you something. Everything was amazing. So I&#39;m pretty happy with that. Let me continue on. I have done launch events and I have done non-launch events. In In fact, I just did a launch event last week in CERT. We had a group of people, some 600 people came to an event. There was a 10 or 11 minute speech.</div>

And I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to have any real impact. and i think that raj and sani&#39;s event wasn&#39;t as good as you&#39;re going to get in those thing in these things and that&#39;s where you might actually have impact because it&#39;s not about if your event is good it&#39;s about what happens if your event doesn&#39;t work and sani&#39;s event i don&#39;t know how cory how long you made it into the video cory i i think i made it um three and a half minutes uh but i skipped ahead for much of the three and a half minutes so i&#39;m not even sure how far I made it. So Mike, I think that you can do a good launch event. I&#39;m just thinking that if you don&#39;t do a good launch event, it&#39;s going to haunt you.

Like you shouldn&#39;t do these things just because in any kind of context, I mean, this is literally the purpose of this show, right? Strategy. Think about the context, the strategic context of these things here. And there&#39;s been successful non on launches one of my favorite was bernie sanders i think launching in maybe it was 2012 2016 uh his campaign where he literally just like walked across a field uh from the congress building he&#39;s like oh i&#39;m running for president and that was his launch right uh</div>

I mean, I was impressed by just the logistics piece. I just didn&#39;t need the launch in front. I think the problem with it was the launch in front of the legislature. I think if you take away that 13-minute speech and instead just go with, you know, Raj and insani is going to be across the province working hard for all of you i think it would have been a much stronger set of events where each each city or each place would have had their own media event instead of this kind of one singular media event at the start i</div>

But here&#39;s the thing, you know, Carter, you&#39;ve run a lot of come from behind campaigns or what we&#39;d call like narrow path victory campaigns, right? Where you&#39;re the underdog. And I almost sense, you know, with with some campaigns, and I&#39;m not accusing the Sony campaign of doing this, but if you know you&#39;re an underdog, that you have to almost overcompensate with your seriousness on day one, that you don&#39;t have any time to waste, that there&#39;s there can&#39;t be a slow burn to catch up to show viability because you&#39;ve got to do it right away. Talk to me about that a bit, because it can backfire in certain cases. And I&#39;m trying to extract this beyond the Sony launch today to maybe looking desperate in certain situations, maybe looking like you&#39;re in overreach, maybe looking like you&#39;re redlining on capacity, as Corey said. So Carter, talk to me about the strategy of a campaign that knows it&#39;s an underdog, that&#39;s trying to showcase viability, but feels like they don&#39;t have time to actually do a slow burn or make the case that they need to show seriousness on day one. Is there a misnomer here in strategies or a mistake you see often? Just your reflections on that. this</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah. So background that I think most Canadians will know at least a little bit about. When Pierre Polyev bought that shawarma, made those comments, Bitcoin was going for $59,000 Canadian. It today hit below $27,000 for a bit. It&#39;s now above $28,000 as of seconds ago, 9.32pm mountain time. I just took a bit of a scan on it. That&#39;s a pretty big drop. That&#39;s a more than 50% drop. And the suggestion that this is a way to opt out inflation was always a little nutty. I mean, if you invested in Bitcoin in 2013, you&#39;re still looking at annualized returns of like 100% still looks like a brilliant investment.</div>

I want to remind that, and I want to almost get you to either revise that or re-up that or give me a take on that, on what you think his competitors should do to take advantage of this. Because right now, we&#39;re in the middle of another bloodbath. Most people don&#39;t understand crypto, which is perhaps the cloud cover that Pierre has. They don&#39;t understand what it is. So what&#39;s the simple story here? Take this complicated currency, boil it down into a nugget for me, and give me something on a silver platter that you can hand over to Jean Charest or Patrick Brown tomorrow.

And it costs $8.75, or if we&#39;re in Calgary, $12.75. And that is the same price that you would have paid a month ago. If you were paying with Bitcoin, you now have to pay twice as much. It is twice as expensive because your Bitcoin dropped so substantially because all of this up and down and back and forth is difficult for people to track.

I asked you guys whether there was any incentive in lying about it. Corey said, no, these numbers are going to come out in a couple of days. Carter said, fuck yeah, I would lie about it. Well, turns out accusations about lying are are literally what have fueled the conservative leadership race for the last, what, seven days, 10 days? Each campaign pointing their fingers at the other. Jenny Byrne saying Patrick Brown is a liar seven times on television in a five-minute interview. Also releasing a video, a senior advisor to Pierre Pallièbe for clarity. Jenny Byrne is releasing a video about Patrick Brown will say anything. How did he buy this multimillion dollar house? Some suggesting that&#39;s Pierre being Pierre. Their campaign scorched earth. Others suggesting, oh, is this campaign actually behind? It is now a little bit panicked about the situation. So we&#39;re seeing a very, very interesting dynamic play up, Carter, regarding the memberships. Also, strategists from each of the campaigns saying we&#39;re going to challenge other parties&#39; memberships on eligibility. What do you make of the current state of affairs, Carter? And what do you make of this? Let&#39;s start start with the membership challenges, that eligibility is going to be challenged on thousands and thousands of rival party members. Is this a common process within the leaderships of campaigns that you&#39;ve run? And do you feel like it will be on overdrive here as we have all this haze about what&#39;s real and what&#39;s not so real in this leadership race?</div>

Now, the party has a role in this as well, because the party doesn&#39;t want to disallow every candidate or every membership. So they&#39;re going to fight for the members that they see are real. A lot of campaigns or a lot of parties will make sure that the unreal or the not real candidates or memberships that are sold are pulled from circulation.

          <div class="said">right? And I can see that argument kind of holding true when you&#39;re starting to look at what&#39;s happening in the United States, Right. Look at how conservative everything is in the United States. And conservatives have never, you know, well, I shouldn&#39;t say never been as popular, but they certainly are nearing the height of their own popularity. They, you know, and they&#39;ve and they&#39;ve got control of things. Look at how good the conservative movement is in the United States right now. They&#39;ve got control. They are they are in charge. Even when there&#39;s a Democratic president, they are still calling the shots. That&#39;s the height of conservatism. So if we could just show how conservative we are, and maybe Pierre Polyev fits into that category, but that&#39;s</div>

Corey&#39;s made very good points about math at the end of the day it is winning the number of seats that gives you a majority or minority government. The conservative movement has gotten the most votes in the last two elections and they have lost. They do not have their votes in the right places to actually make this work. If they want to get the votes in the right places then they&#39;re going to need to shift the way that they&#39;re thinking and Pierre Polyev is is shifting the way that he&#39;s thinking in exactly the wrong direction.</div>
