So Elon Musk has really ably shown his ability to move markets more recently down than up, but certainly in both directions. He creates spectacle. He creates his own storylines. We would never be struggling for a podcast episode topic again if Elon Musk was the host of this show because every three days he does something crazy. Today, he was posting about how Kevin McCarthy should be Speaker of the House. And then he posted a poll saying, hey, should I be involved in politics still? And the answers were, get out of politics or keep shooting yourself in the foot. And he had a lot of fun with that. He can&#39;t stand to be out of the limelight. He can&#39;t stand the fact that Grimes, who wasn&#39;t even actually his wife, left him. And he&#39;s having a breakdown in real time, which I think would sort of help mask the breakdowns in real time that Stephen and I are having over the general state of the world. So, yeah,</div>

You don&#39;t have to do anything. You roll out of bed. You show up five minutes before you go to nationalnewswatch.com and you see what&#39;s in the news. And and then you just talk until a question comes to you after about three, four hundred words. I think Roger Goodell could do that.
