His record of 11 nominations for speaker without being successful is pretty impressive. In the last 100 years, no one else has done that. So we&#39;re also very proud of him for that.

The American system and the Canadian system seem so similar at times, and both of them suffer from what I would call an overabundance of pageantry. And when you look at the Americans, you have this system that it was almost cast in bronze when they created their country in the the 18th century. And no matter how asinine, how foolish it seems as they run through this pageantry, they find themselves unable to break away from it. What I find totally crazy about what&#39;s going on in the United States right now is</span>

And it&#39;s through a combination of precedent and House rules. And, you know, Madam Chair, I was reading through some of those House rules today and I was reading through some of the precedent and I</span>

I mean the fact is in the United States, in the 20th century, in 1923, there were nine ballots per speaker. That was the last time there was more than one. And now we&#39;re going back to precedence from the 1850s where it went on for days and days and days and days, weeks in fact. Well, plurality</span>

It seems like the kind of thing we do here in Canada. But they can&#39;t. They can&#39;t. They can&#39;t because of a combination of the pageantry that they are stuck with from 250 years and the practical reality that having only two parties that both vilify the other gives no room for negotiation with the other. The way that they have vilified each other means the only dealmaking can be within their party. And</span>

So Elon Musk has really ably shown his ability to move markets more recently down than up, but certainly in both directions. He creates spectacle. He creates his own storylines. We would never be struggling for a podcast episode topic again if Elon Musk was the host of this show because every three days he does something crazy. Today, he was posting about how Kevin McCarthy should be Speaker of the House. And then he posted a poll saying, hey, should I be involved in politics still? And the answers were, get out of politics or keep shooting yourself in the foot. And he had a lot of fun with that. He can&#39;t stand to be out of the limelight. He can&#39;t stand the fact that Grimes, who wasn&#39;t even actually his wife, left him. And he&#39;s having a breakdown in real time, which I think would sort of help mask the breakdowns in real time that Stephen and I are having over the general state of the world. So, yeah,</span>

            <span class="text">so why would a man like this be an excellent host for the strategist podcast i mean the reality is simple the nfl is loved by tens of millions hundreds of millions the strategists relatively few tens of thousands hundreds of thousands so uh i think it would be the most honorable way uh to end the podcast is to bring roger goodell onto it uh removing him from his role as nfl commissioner in many ways in most ways i would say host of the strategist is better i mean it&#39;s It&#39;s just a better gig. You don&#39;t have to do anything. You roll out of bed. You show up five minutes before you go to nationalnewswatch.com and you see what&#39;s in the news. And and then you just talk until a question comes to you after about three, four hundred words. I think Roger Goodell could do that. And I think by and large, the world would be better if we got him out of NFL commissioner.</span>

And I think that following the rules is not something that we&#39;re good at at The Strategist. So I am suggesting that we should get someone who is not a rule follower to join us on the podcast and become the host of The Strategist. So I am recommending and I am nominating for host of The Strategist Representative Lauren Bobart to join the strategists as hosts because of her commitment to lawlessness.
