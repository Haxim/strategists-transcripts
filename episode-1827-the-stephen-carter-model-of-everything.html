Before I jump into the show, Corey, how are we doing on celebrating September 30th? Now, this is a holiday, a pseudo holiday holiday that</span>

            <span class="text">that we have established, this National Truth and Reconciliation Day across this country. How are we doing? This is landing in a way that I don&#39;t necessarily know how many people are practicing this, if it&#39;s still working, quote unquote, as it relates to this day that this government, this prime minister, has put on the calendar as a national holiday. How are we doing, Corey, both from its observance, but also its logistics and practice and incorporating it as a long weekend, because it is a strange non-long weekend for many. So</span>

Not sure it was ever supposed to. Not sure that&#39;s what we&#39;re supposed to be doing on September 30th. It&#39;s saying, I&#39;m just saying. No.</span>

And I&#39;m saying that this is maybe one that&#39;s supposed to be more in the model of that, of reflection and contemplation and perhaps even education and taking the opportunity to learn about these things.

            <span class="text">Carter, how are we doing on observing this day? I shouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a political invention, but it is certainly a response to our politics created by a government, this one. How are we doing? And I guess the broader question I have for the two of you on the back end of your responses is, are we on the risk of losing this day? Like, is that a possibility? And I&#39;m curious about that in a second, but Carter, give me your take first. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think everything&#39;s a risk if Pierre-Paul Lievre wins. I think that, you know, land acknowledgements and Truth and Reconciliation Day feel like two of the big things that we put in the window of our, you know, from our Truth and Reconciliation Report, what was it, 59, 109? It was a big number of recommendations, and I feel like we&#39;ve really missed on most of them. But we do have Truth and Reconciliation Day, and we have, you know, land acknowledgements. And those are good things, but they&#39;re not doing the work. They&#39;re not doing the heavy lifting that needs to be done for First Nations issues in Canada. We</span>

            <span class="text">probably another 15 years before we have enough of the population educated to really start to make a difference. And I just think it&#39;s too little too late and it shouldn&#39;t be a day off. That&#39;s not really the point. The point isn&#39;t to have time off and go camping. The point of the exercise is to inject truth and reconciliation into our everyday lives. And that&#39;s fucking hard to do. So having a day off is, I think, the opposite of how this should be treated. Corey,</span>

And partially because people don&#39;t necessarily know how to observe it and they don&#39;t know if it&#39;s categorized as holiday or observance day and it&#39;s on a Monday, so it feels like a long weekend, but we had one at the beginning of the month and there&#39;s one in two weeks. There&#39;s all these logistical items at play for sure, but there&#39;s also the heart of the matter of its observance. Are we at risk of potentially losing this day with the Polyev government.

            <span class="text">So Paul Wells had an interesting piece in the Walrus recently. And I want to pull you a quote from it. I was looking it up as you were talking here. And basically, the question was like, hey, why are you sometimes such a jerk to Pierre Polyev, right? And I think his kind of theory, his worldview really comes through here. Short answer is, yeah, probably, but maybe not definitely. Definitely. So he says here, I think that compassion is measured in results, not in words or gestures, Polyev said. So it&#39;s not about, you know, standing up, putting your hand on your heart and bursting into tears to plead with people to make them believe that you care more than the other guy. It&#39;s about what do you actually deliver?</span>

So this was the stated purpose of it. And then parliament was prorogued, and so the vote could never happen. And then it all kind of fell apart for Stéphane Dion. on and then um then ultimately harper did manage to seize the narrative talked about the coalition of the losers got</span>

            <span class="text">it actually did prove that Parliament, if it was given just a couple of months, could come back and work, right? It didn&#39;t ultimately lead to the fall. It didn&#39;t delay the inevitable. It changed the outcome, right? All of a sudden, people could sit and say, is this actually what we want? Does this make sense? Do we want the bloc propping up the government, for example? And it changed the outcome, right? Two, it was so close to after an election. This was like a couple of months after the 2008 election. So, I think they don&#39;t release like, this is why we decided to prorogue or not document if you&#39;re the governor general. But certainly, Michel Jeanne, in conversations and interviews after said, well, you know, it was a young parliament, we wanted to give it a chance. We wanted to see if they could make it work. This wasn&#39;t forever. This was a get your ducks in a row, come back with a different budget. So, it&#39;s a chance for the government to negotiate, right? right? This is the dying days of this liberal government. This is the dying days. So many of those conditions that Michelle Jeanne has hinted to and talked about in interviews do not exist here. It is not a new government that we&#39;re trying to get a chance to. This is not a situation where they get their ducks in a row and come up with a budget necessarily, right? I mean, that could happen, but it could also happen. They just prorogue for four months and then go straight to the fucking polls and the governor general knows it. Okay.</span>

And if there is one fundamental job of the governor general, it&#39;s to maintain responsible government. And, you know, it&#39;s a concept that we learn about in social studies when we&#39;re you know in our teens and we kind of forget about what the whole fucking notion of our type of government is that the executive branch of the government has the support of the legislative branch of the government and so when we talk back in 2008 and the whole circuit circuit breaker thing the idea was brand new parliament we&#39;re going to give it a shot go get your ducks in a row come back and see if you can to it that&#39;s the argument for why prorogation was allowed then but</span>

And to do a cabinet shuffle in the middle of the session is a bit of a pain in the ass, especially for the new ministers. And second, I think he needs to resign. I think he needs to resign. And proroguing parliament gives him that opportunity to resign and enable a very quick leadership race. Or</span>

It&#39;s a whole new liberal party, right? Just you fucking wait and see. Like, I do think that there is something to the almost cinematic nature of doing that. And just because let&#39;s be clear, the fact that he could pro Rogan, there could be a new, a new throne speech next week, right?

And it&#39;s not going to fucking work. I guess that&#39;s the final point I&#39;ll make on it. It&#39;s not going to work just as the cabinet shuffle didn&#39;t work, just as the budget didn&#39;t work. There&#39;s like one thing that&#39;s going to work and we all know what it is, right? People in Canada have gotten past the point where they can hear Justin Trudeau when he talks, or certainly, you know, can&#39;t hear it in anything except for a tone that makes them want to punch a wall.

We want to reflect the different situation with the end of the confidence and supply agreement. And frankly, we want to reflect some of the different and new demands that have come out from all of these various parties within parliament as conditions for their support. God, we&#39;re not going to decide whether we want to do something as dramatic as change OAS in three weeks. That&#39;s government by madness. So we&#39;re going to take a beat. We&#39;re going to assess a bunch of these things. Maybe we can do with some of them, maybe not, but we&#39;ll come back with a throne speech and a new agenda for the final session of this parliament that&#39;ll take us through to the next election.

Talk to me about the conversation. How do the liberals, once they do this, drive the conversation, right? So we were talking about how they could be net beneficiaries here. I now want to go a little bit further. I want both of your help to help me with how. The decision was made by the leader, and you guys are supporting the leader as chief strategists running the liberal party, right? The decision was made that we&#39;re doing this. And we were doing Let&#39;s just go down the lane to replace the leader because that&#39;s the one we&#39;ve been talking about the most. How do you drive conversation? Do you talk about prorogation at all? Do you talk about the future? How do you take this and then move it to what you want to, which is either your reset or your new leadership or those things? How do you stay away from the obvious lines of attack that are going to come for you in that way? Help me flesh this strategy out a bit more.

Just take the blows and actually make the blows the point. Right. The NDP says there this is just because Casa got eliminated. Yeah, you&#39;re damn right. It&#39;s because Casa&#39;s gone. That&#39;s a big part of the story. we&#39;ve now got to think about parliament a little bit differently and we&#39;ve got to put a different legislative agenda together there that just makes sense like i think that there is a that just makes sense mini tag that you can do based on some of the things that are going on right there look</span>
