      <h1>Episode 1827: The Stephen Carter Model of Everything</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">September 30, 2024</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Zain runs Stephen and Corey through a "what-if" scenario based on an Ottawa rumour that won't die: what if the Liberals decided to prorogue parliament? Would they? Could they? Should they?</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss proroguing Parliament - whether it's something Justin Trudeau could do, whether it would serve any purpose and what it would mean for all of the parties. Is prorogation a "circuit breaker" that would allow the government to a chance to reset? How could the Liberals sell it? And do we think Stephen would lower or raise his rate to run the Liberal campaign? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

And partially because people don&#39;t necessarily know how to observe it and they don&#39;t know if it&#39;s categorized as holiday or observance day and it&#39;s on a Monday, so it feels like a long weekend, but we had one at the beginning of the month and there&#39;s one in two weeks. There&#39;s all these logistical items at play for sure, but there&#39;s also the heart of the matter of its observance. Are we at risk of potentially losing this day with the Polyev government.

And basically, the question was like, hey, why are you sometimes such a jerk to Pierre Polyev, right? And I think his kind of theory, his worldview really comes through here. Short answer is, yeah, probably, but maybe not definitely. Definitely. So he says here, I think that compassion is measured in results, not in words or gestures, Polyev said. So it&#39;s not about, you know, standing up, putting your hand on your heart and bursting into tears to plead with people to make them believe that you care more than the other guy. It&#39;s about what do you actually deliver?</div>

He kind of staves off this vote. boat he survives he builds you know uh the legacy of of uh and continues a legacy i guess in this case of the harper decade in that regard um he used it a couple other times since 2008 but cory&#39;s right carter this you know this would be a circuit breaker come back uh you know get rid of the current dynamic shake up the board a bit buy yourself some time buy yourself some energy Would that be for resetting</div>

          <div class="said">yeah. That&#39;s exactly right. Yeah. The 2008 one was very contentious because that was where there was a deal that was struck by the liberals, the NDP, and the bloc to bring down the conservative government. So this was the stated purpose of it. And then parliament was prorogued, and so the vote could never happen. And then it all kind of fell apart for Stéphane Dion. on and then um then ultimately harper did manage to seize the narrative talked about the coalition of the losers got</div>

          <div class="said">it actually did prove that Parliament, if it was given just a couple of months, could come back and work, right? It didn&#39;t ultimately lead to the fall. It didn&#39;t delay the inevitable. It changed the outcome, right? All of a sudden, people could sit and say, is this actually what we want? Does this make sense? Do we want the bloc propping up the government, for example? And it changed the outcome, right? Two, it was so close to after an election. This was like a couple of months after the 2008 election. So, I think they don&#39;t release like, this is why we decided to prorogue or not document if you&#39;re the governor general. But certainly, Michel Jeanne, in conversations and interviews after said, well, you know, it was a young parliament, we wanted to give it a chance. We wanted to see if they could make it work. This wasn&#39;t forever. This was a get your ducks in a row, come back with a different budget. So, it&#39;s a chance for the government to negotiate, right? right? This is the dying days of this liberal government. This is the dying days. So many of those conditions that Michelle Jeanne has hinted to and talked about in interviews do not exist here. It is not a new government that we&#39;re trying to get a chance to. This is not a situation where they get their ducks in a row and come up with a budget necessarily, right? I mean, that could happen, but it could also happen. They just prorogue for four months and then go straight to the fucking polls and the governor general knows it. Okay.</div>

And if there is one fundamental job of the governor general, it&#39;s to maintain responsible government. And, you know, it&#39;s a concept that we learn about in social studies when we&#39;re you know in our teens and we kind of forget about what the whole fucking notion of our type of government is that the executive branch of the government has the support of the legislative branch of the government and so when we talk back in 2008 and the whole circuit circuit breaker thing the idea was brand new parliament we&#39;re going to give it a shot go get your ducks in a row come back and see if you can to it that&#39;s the argument for why prorogation was allowed then but</div>

And to do a cabinet shuffle in the middle of the session is a bit of a pain in the ass, especially for the new ministers. And second, I think he needs to resign. I think he needs to resign. And proroguing parliament gives him that opportunity to resign and enable a very quick leadership race. Or</div>

It&#39;s not going to work just as the cabinet shuffle didn&#39;t work, just as the budget didn&#39;t work. There&#39;s like one thing that&#39;s going to work and we all know what it is, right? People in Canada have gotten past the point where they can hear Justin Trudeau when he talks, or certainly, you know, can&#39;t hear it in anything except for a tone that makes them want to punch a wall.

We&#39;re going to assess a bunch of these things. Maybe we can do with some of them, maybe not, but we&#39;ll come back with a throne speech and a new agenda for the final session of this parliament that&#39;ll take us through to the next election.

And we were doing Let&#39;s just go down the lane to replace the leader because that&#39;s the one we&#39;ve been talking about the most. How do you drive conversation? Do you talk about prorogation at all? Do you talk about the future? How do you take this and then move it to what you want to, which is either your reset or your new leadership or those things? How do you stay away from the obvious lines of attack that are going to come for you in that way? Help me flesh this strategy out a bit more.
