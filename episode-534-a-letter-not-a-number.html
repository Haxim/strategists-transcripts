They&#39;re allowed to follow the story. They have a voice. They&#39;re able to articulate a point in the fashion they want to articulate it. And when you go into government, you are an order taker. You are following the line day in, day out. And it&#39;s so different than what they&#39;re used to. And I don&#39;t know how many of them realize just how different it&#39;s going to be. That&#39;s a problem for them but that&#39;s also a problem for the new democrats because you want to know who goes off script worse than anybody who&#39;s a government employee in the communications department it&#39;s the guys who used to be commentators and reporters and and they&#39;ve created themselves a bit of a time bomb with six i think maybe even seven people right now who have come from a universe of being able to say what they want when they want and and that are frankly very cozy with the rest of the the media.
