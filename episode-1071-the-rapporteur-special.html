        <p>Zain's back and provincial politics is back on the menu. We turn back to neglected news about David Johnston's special rapporteuring (including the hiring of crisis communications firm Navigator) before debating whether Danielle Smith's leadership is in trouble and what she needs to do to be secure through the summer and beyond.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Special Rapporteur David Johnston’s recommendations and communications support, as well as what Alberta Premier Danielle Smith needs to do this summer to secure her leadership. Can Smith be the first premier since Klein to finish a full term? Does the gang still think a public inquiry is an inevitability? And what’s your favourite Dave prequel? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

David Johnston has actually hired Navigator. His office is confirmed on Friday. In an email to CTV News, his spokesperson said the special rapporteur has hired Navigator. When we kind of get further into the understanding of what we call in the consulting biz, the scope, Stephen Carter, we call it the scope. We&#39;re realizing that they&#39;re helping him with support as related to speeches, speeches media appearances uh you know uh helping him with social media analysis and drafting communications materials like press releases let&#39;s start here before we actually get to his conclusion because i think this is really interesting like the over the top line on his conclusion is that there was not a public inquiry we&#39;re not going to do one i&#39;m the special rapporteur everyone said that there was a a crisis of credibility that he was facing he had to call public inquiry he said a public inquiry would be wholly unsatisfying canadian public so i&#39;m not going to do one instead i&#39;m going to do this panel and this traveling circus show to kind of examine what happens um but he doesn&#39;t call one and then carter he&#39;s now calling navigator to to help him and assist him talk to me about the hiring of navigator first and i actually want to go to the issues interestingly</div>

Like, I mean, this is fundamentally my problem. He has hired a crisis communications firm, well known and has built a brand and curates a brand and fosters a brand for trying to win. And that&#39;s just the wrong energy you need to bring to something like this, where you&#39;re the special rapporteur. Like what is winning here? What is winning for you, David Johnston? That&#39;s the question that I think Canadians are seized with when they hear that you are trying to hire Navigator because yes, well, I think that there is communications needs for any kind of job like this.

You know, since we&#39;re so intimately familiar with Navigator, that part really didn&#39;t even stick out to me that in the general public&#39;s eye, if they know anything beyond Gian Gomeschi and Peter Slowly and Hockey Canada, is that they kind of have this binary win loss positioning, which is which is fine and perhaps confident in like the political world or those binary situations where win and lose. to your point, Corey, is very clear that there&#39;s a charge against you, that there&#39;s a crisis where you got to kind of come out from under it and restore your reputation.

And there&#39;s a bit on the legacy in terms of like, how do you repair that in some ways? Because Johnson is a guy who&#39;s got a story, right? And he&#39;s got a legacy prior to this.

Talk to me about this because there&#39;s the mechanics here that also there&#39;s the hiring, which I&#39;m in agreement with your guys&#39; perspectives on that, by the way. But there&#39;s also the mechanics of this we&#39;re intimately familiar with.

But the reality is, if they&#39;ve structured it in a way that specifically speaks to crisis communications, well, let&#39;s put it this way. what&#39;s worse than hiring navigator looking like you&#39;re trying to hide the fact that you hired navigator and there might have been a desire to say well this is coming out anyways we&#39;re going to manage this coming out and we&#39;re going to put it out in a way that we think is a little bit more confident maybe not even controlled but confident as though we&#39;re saying this is a communications firm we have communications needs and now we hired navigator they&#39;re one of the best who&#39;s going to dispute that well</div>

They didn&#39;t take it seriously. I know we discussed a bit of that, but walk me through it now seeing the results. Do you pinpoint it to something else? Well,</div>

That was a gotcha moment they were attempting to set up. Like, fuck you, you&#39;re going to have to accept Johnson. So let&#39;s not pretend the conservatives are the only ones with blood on their hands as we&#39;re talking about the death of this particular integrity around the David Johnson inquiry here.

He comes out, they have a press conference, and he ultimately concludes that we&#39;re not doing a public inquiry. To me, there&#39;s a bit of like, you know, you know hiring navigator is on one end of like a win-loss binary but in some ways there was like no winning strategy that he like he must have known or he must have not cared about the political sort of ramifications of him coming out many weeks later as this tension has been getting uh you know as it&#39;s been getting even more tense i should say and the temperature has been getting higher and higher and then saying yeah we&#39;re not doing it um do you feel like from</div>

I want to know who the fuck is doing that, and I want them to go to jail if they&#39;ve been doing it illegally and for political reasons. Simple as that for me, right?</div>

          <div class="said">Listen, we have to talk about it. We&#39;re going back to provincial politics. At least I am. You guys have always been there, but I&#39;m going back to it. I want to talk about Danielle Smith. I want to talk about the fact that she&#39;s now Premier Corrie, and it is clear by the election result that she was a liability to the party. and that there was many conversations at the doors, many conversations in the chattering class and conservative circles that said something like, well, you know, once we get elected, once we get the mandate, we&#39;ll ensure that we swap out the leaders, you know, say that silently. We&#39;ve heard that once or twice. And we know that there&#39;s that sentiment. You look at the results, you see that, you know, the NDP were able to make gains significantly. Many people think that&#39;s on the back of Danielle Smith. You might disagree. agree yeah but i think the knives might be out and i want to help us craft a strategy for daniel smith it should be the gift that we give her carter the daniel smith how do i keep my job for as long as possible strategy that is what we are doing and it&#39;s going to start with the scope of the summer and she&#39;s got a lot of stuff happening this summer she&#39;s of course going to get her cabinet sworn in she&#39;s probably going to choose staff she&#39;s probably going to have to deal with some big questions around uh folks that um how to deal with edmonton how to deal with calgary I want us to kind of collectively work together in the sandbox to help Danielle Smith keep her job as long as possible. Corey might think the knives, one of you might think the knives are actually not going to come out this summer, that they might wait for a bit. But there is a sense that these knives come out. We know this because it&#39;s Alberta and it&#39;s a conservative party in government. And we know that this is going to happen. So I want us to work on this project together. So Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. Give us one thing, put it in the sandbox that That allows us to start molding it together around how Danielle Smith avoids having the knives coming out for as long as she can. How does she keep her job for as long as she can this summer? And what is the first thing she needs to start doing this summer? Stephen Carter, over to you. She</div>

They all literally stood with you for the last six weeks trying to run this election. Get on their side. Get them all into your office. Make sure that they understand that they&#39;re the real power in this party and that you will be listening to them moving forward. Essentially, you are taking half of your power and you are saying, I&#39;m giving it to these candidates and these MLAs. And that&#39;s it. it. I&#39;m giving as much power as possible, because if you don&#39;t, if you try and make a strong premier&#39;s office, if you try and do a deal with TBA, you&#39;re going to find yourself on the outside looking in at the leadership review, which will happen, I think, in the next, it won&#39;t necessarily be this summer, but it will happen sooner than later.</div>

In fact, I think a smaller caucus is a bit of her friend, because a lot of the people who would be the natural standard bearers that people would rally around in terms of being a moderate conservative. They don&#39;t exist anymore. And by the way, when we talk about people going down, Ralph Klein was just a little long in the tooth, a little bit different there. But all of the other ones that have been ousted have been ousted from the right. Even Jason Kenney inexplicably was ousted from the right. But we have Danielle Smith, who has decided pretty clearly that she&#39;s going to hang out on the right. And what&#39;s the threat? That she&#39;s going to be ousted from the left?</div>

However, Corey said something very interesting that I just want to examine with you, which is, Carter, does an election absolve you of any past sins, winning an election? Is that the rule? Corey kind of said that&#39;s the rule, definitively 100%. I want to just get your take on that before we move on to the Danielle Smith summer planning.</div>

Brian Jean being put in injustice tells us a different story. Brian Jean being put in health tells us a third story still. And we&#39;ll get a sense of what Daniel Smith&#39;s governing priorities priorities are and what she&#39;s looking to do in the next bit in part based on this cabinet. So I can&#39;t wait to see it, but I don&#39;t have a clue who she&#39;s going to put where.

Would you oversample on Calgary, Carter, or would you oversample on rural when you look at her own survivability? This is my more specific question that I want to ask.

And so that&#39;s got to be the kind of the bulk of her cabinet, in my opinion. It would be a bit hazardous to do otherwise. But of course, you&#39;re still fighting for Calgary and you&#39;re still fighting for Edmonton. So you&#39;re going to pick, obviously, Nate Gloobish right on the edge of Edmonton. We&#39;ll get to be an Edmonton cabinet minister. You know, maybe Searle will get a nice promotion. oh i</div>

Demetrius Nicolaitis maybe getting a promotion, maybe not. You know, Advanced Ed&#39;s a pretty good portfolio too. to. But I would imagine there&#39;s going to be a few you can point to that are ministers you hear from all of the time that will be from Calgary, because Calgary will sort of demand it. A dozen MLAs is not an insignificant number of MLAs. And there&#39;s kind of a lesson here. Joey Smallwood was the premier of Newfoundland when it joined the Confederation, right? And obviously, Newfoundland was going to need to have when they elected a couple of liberal MPs, somebody in cabinet. And Joey Smallwood, being very practical, said, well, just give them like one of the junior Secretary of State positions, because most people are familiar with the American system. Secretary of State seems really senior, but it&#39;s actually pretty junior. Like there are levers you can pull like that, where it&#39;s like sounds like a big job, not actually doing a ton in that role. And I expect Calgary will get an outsized number of those ministries.</div>

That means all of a sudden your apparatus, your power as premier has been diminished because your power is executed through your staff. Your staff are the ones that make you look like a genius in a speech and make sure you&#39;re there on time and are doing all of the meetings to coordinate people and make sure that everybody feels like the premier is giving them a love. The less that you have your people in staff, the less authority you have as premier. You see it get diminished and eroded over time as people start saying, you got to bring in this person you got to bring in that person you got to bring in this other person do i if i&#39;m premier well if i do that probably means my power as premier is not as big as it was the day before yeah</div>

But when we start talking about building a staff, especially if you are coming in and you didn&#39;t necessarily have control of the party in the same way, yeah, inevitably, you&#39;re going to need to go look further afield. You&#39;re going to need to find experts from different provinces, maybe even from different countries. And that&#39;s fine. I think that they bring probably deep functional expertise that enrich most premier&#39;s offices. And also, they will not have the same blind spots as the people who&#39;ve been there as true believers all the way along the way.

Carter, we usually don&#39;t see the campaign manager find themselves in the premier&#39;s office i think you were a rarity if i&#39;m not mistaken that you were like one of the few guys and and maybe because like we haven&#39;t seen it since that like tandem relationship like the campaign manager of uh was rod love and ralph klein like they you know attached to the hip of course he was going to be his principal advisor i&#39;m kind of curious your thoughts on that like the campaign manager very different set of skills or campaign director whatever they&#39;re called in each of these parties finding themselves in the premier&#39;s office any Any reflections on that and the core competencies? The reason I ask is to make a finer point on it. Over lunch, you and I were kind of discussing the campaign strategist role inside the premier&#39;s office. We&#39;ve seen that happen in the United States and other jurisdictions. We don&#39;t necessarily see it labeled as that within the premier&#39;s office. I&#39;m just kind of curious if you have any reflections on that in the modern reality and what you&#39;d be kind of looking for to occupy that positioning. And I will move on. I</div>

And let&#39;s be really clear, there are some skill overlaps between needing to be a senior strategist, a campaign director and running a premier&#39;s office. You&#39;ve got a lot of things moving, you got to keep them coordinated, you got to keep people motivated, you got to go. No. But yeah, there are different intersections. There are different interfaces. And government&#39;s different. Government&#39;s very different. And it&#39;s hard to run at speed for four years. I always think about campaigns as something that&#39;s built to last for 28 days. And it&#39;s built to be as big of a spectacle as possible. So for 28 days, it&#39;s just got to work. And you are trying to get all eyeballs on you. Government&#39;s a little different. Government is built to be durable. It&#39;s supposed supposed to last for decades centuries you know generations we talk about when we talk about building government systems you think that&#39;s a joke we&#39;re still using magnetic reel-to-reels for our health care records from like the 70s or at least we were when i was lasting government a couple of years ago but i&#39;m pretty confident they&#39;re still there because government&#39;s fucking slow sometimes right but it&#39;s slow because those things are supposed to last and work and always work and move forward and</div>
