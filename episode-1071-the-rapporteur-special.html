            <span class="text">can we talk about this dude i don&#39;t even think we&#39;ve talked about david johnson&#39;s coming out and saying i have done the shit and the shit says we&#39;re not doing a public inquiry have we talked about no we haven&#39;t because we&#39;re shocked okay we have not talked about that we have not talked about the response uh from the conservatives we&#39;ve not not talked about the lack of response to the liberals, but I want to start here. David Johnston has actually hired Navigator. His office is confirmed on Friday. In an email to CTV News, his spokesperson said the special rapporteur has hired Navigator. When we kind of get further into the understanding of what we call in the consulting biz, the scope, Stephen Carter, we call it the scope. We&#39;re realizing that they&#39;re helping him with support as related to speeches, speeches media appearances uh you know uh helping him with social media analysis and drafting communications materials like press releases let&#39;s start here before we actually get to his conclusion because i think this is really interesting like the over the top line on his conclusion is that there was not a public inquiry we&#39;re not going to do one i&#39;m the special rapporteur everyone said that there was a a crisis of credibility that he was facing he had to call public inquiry he said a public inquiry would be wholly unsatisfying canadian public so i&#39;m not going to do one instead i&#39;m going to do this panel and this traveling circus show to kind of examine what happens um but he doesn&#39;t call one and then carter he&#39;s now calling navigator to to help him and assist him talk to me about the hiring of navigator first and i actually want to go to the issues interestingly</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">interestingly i just rebranded my company from decide campaigns to decide uh crisis campaigns campaigns um when your crisis communication strategy needs a crisis communication strategy so we&#39;re going to pick up all the people who hire navigator and do their you know do the crisis communications for the crisis communications firm it&#39;s going to be fantastic it&#39;s really smart</span>

            <span class="text">Look, it&#39;s obviously not a great idea to hire a crisis communications company whose slogan is when you can&#39;t afford to lose when you are trying to look like a nonpartisan representative who is trying to balance things equally. Like, I mean, this is fundamentally my problem. He has hired a crisis communications firm, well known and has built a brand and curates a brand and fosters a brand for trying to win. And that&#39;s just the wrong energy you need to bring to something like this, where you&#39;re the special rapporteur. Like what is winning here? What is winning for you, David Johnston? That&#39;s the question that I think Canadians are seized with when they hear that you are trying to hire Navigator because yes, well, I think that there is communications needs for any kind of job like this. Hiring Navigator and hiring Navigator with the brand that Navigator carries. I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I mean, hopefully Navigator&#39;s first piece of advice was you probably shouldn&#39;t have hired Navigator, but here we are with the contract and now let&#39;s try to do better going forward because it carries a bit of a charge that you are now going to have to deal with for however long this clown car continues to drive down the road.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s actually a really Really excellent point. You know, since we&#39;re so intimately familiar with Navigator, that part really didn&#39;t even stick out to me that in the general public&#39;s eye, if they know anything beyond Gian Gomeschi and Peter Slowly and Hockey Canada, is that they kind of have this binary win loss positioning, which is which is fine and perhaps confident in like the political world or those binary situations where win and lose. to your point, Corey, is very clear that there&#39;s a charge against you, that there&#39;s a crisis where you got to kind of come out from under it and restore your reputation. In this particular case, I think you make such an excellent point that what is win for someone who says that they&#39;re trying to be above it all? Carter? Well,</span>

A lot of of the advice was trying to remove it from that political win-loss arena, where, you know, if you keep this entire project, entire process in win-loss, you&#39;re only hurting the country, right? Like, this is external interference in our elections, external interference in our, you know, electoral processes. And frankly, it shouldn&#39;t be dictated by wins and losses. It should be dictated by everybody stopping this from happening and stopping China from interfering in our our elections, but instead it has turned into a partisan political piñata.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that raises that challenge in my mind a little bit more clearly than perhaps if he was just going to say, I&#39;m going to let the chips fall where they may. Yes, I need communications assistance for this. Yes, I&#39;m going to make sure I don&#39;t say something stupid That might actually cause challenges for everybody. But when you hire a firm who has the reputation Navigator has, you know, I&#39;m not even talking win-loss here. I&#39;m talking about the reputation to be pugilistic, to fight, to go out there and to say, we&#39;re going to get you to the finish line no matter what.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And your job is decidedly to make choices as to whether you should even get to the finish line. Your job is to decide what&#39;s in the best interest of the country, even if you can&#39;t tell the country everything, right? Isn&#39;t that exactly why we&#39;re not doing this inquiry to begin with? Because there are some things you just can&#39;t bring forward.

Carter brought up this point around like, you know, how liberals and David Johnson were caught flat footed. There&#39;s the overall sort of decision point, why Johnson kind of led into this decision. And there&#39;s a bit on the legacy in terms of like, how do you repair that in some ways? Because Johnson is a guy who&#39;s got a story, right? And he&#39;s got a legacy prior to this. And how do you ensure that this is not a legacy defining moment? moment but before that carter can i get nerdy about yes political</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">political like the politics of hiring an agency maybe that&#39;s the best way to put it like why do we know that he hired navigator like the three of us worked at a consulting firm where there was multiple layers of security to ensure that certain clients did not have public exposure oh yeah and i&#39;m just trying to figure that out from my perspective like did he feel like this was a good strategy or like even to confirm that that this is what the case was. Talk to me about this because there&#39;s the mechanics here that also there&#39;s the hiring, which I&#39;m in agreement with your guys&#39; perspectives on that, by the way. But there&#39;s also the mechanics of this we&#39;re intimately familiar with. There&#39;s multiple layers of institutional security at these firms to ensure that something like this can remain deeply confidential should that be the client&#39;s wish. Let&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Let&#39;s be clear. I mean, to be honest, hiring a communications firm is probably probably wise in terms of what the special rapporteur is doing and what the next phase of this is going to be. Going out and holding these hearings, you&#39;re going to hire a communications firm, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">could fit that bill under the engagement services that are traditionally provided. Because keep in mind, Navigator doesn&#39;t just do crisis communications. They do the full suite of communications that everybody does, because they they do what all of us did which is take all the money right yo you do that type of we do too well that is we do too yeah</span>

            <span class="text">right are we are we going to be fussed by that maybe not maybe maybe it gets spun but there wasn&#39;t even a there wasn&#39;t even an attempt to say, well, we didn&#39;t hire Navigator for crisis communications. So someone has let it slip that they&#39;ve hired Navigator to do not just communications, but crisis communications. I mean, that&#39;s ridiculous. That&#39;s kind of unheard</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, simply, the government can&#39;t generally hire a confidential contractor, and a government RFP is going to define the scope in a way that&#39;s pretty hard to avoid. So guess what? If you hire them for crisis, that&#39;s probably going to show up in some way. And yes, I understand you can just say general communication services. But the reality is, if they&#39;ve structured it in a way that specifically speaks to crisis communications, well, let&#39;s put it this way. what&#39;s worse than hiring navigator looking like you&#39;re trying to hide the fact that you hired navigator and there might have been a desire to say well this is coming out anyways we&#39;re going to manage this coming out and we&#39;re going to put it out in a way that we think is a little bit more confident maybe not even controlled but confident as though we&#39;re saying this is a communications firm we have communications needs and now we hired navigator they&#39;re one of the best who&#39;s going to dispute that well</span>

But is what can you do right now while you&#39;re in it? As you think of David Johnson, the you know, just the the the the former governor general, the law dean, the guy who&#39;s written volumes on on what it means to be Canadian as a treatise. Like, how does he prevent this from being what defines him at the end of it? I</span>

I don&#39;t think that this is going to be satisfactory if we hold this inquiry in the public eye. I think that there&#39;d be so many times that they&#39;d have to say, I&#39;m sorry, we have to go in camera. We&#39;re going to have to ask everybody to leave. Then you come back in and you&#39;re back in for about four and a half minutes.

They didn&#39;t take it seriously. I know we discussed a bit of that, but walk me through it now seeing the results. Do you pinpoint it to something else? Well,</span>

That was a gotcha moment they were attempting to set up. Like, fuck you, you&#39;re going to have to accept Johnson. So let&#39;s not pretend the conservatives are the only ones with blood on their hands as we&#39;re talking about the death of this particular integrity around the David Johnson inquiry here.

The entire purpose of this is to build confidence, and it&#39;s clear to me that we will not have the ingredients to build confidence as long as the House is not willing to entertain conversation.</span>

I&#39;ll just do that at the end here. But let&#39;s talk about Johnson&#39;s decision, right? He comes out, they have a press conference, and he ultimately concludes that we&#39;re not doing a public inquiry. To me, there&#39;s a bit of like, you know, you know hiring navigator is on one end of like a win-loss binary but in some ways there was like no winning strategy that he like he must have known or he must have not cared about the political sort of ramifications of him coming out many weeks later as this tension has been getting uh you know as it&#39;s been getting even more tense i should say and the temperature has been getting higher and higher and then saying yeah we&#39;re not doing it um do you feel like from</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">from your perspective perspective like how would you counsel a person who&#39;s going to make that decision know that there&#39;s a political consequence to it and while they can&#39;t be partisan they do have to not they have to at very least be you know politically not tone deaf like what was the line how would you&#39;ve coached and counseled johnson as you would have was about to kind of make that that announcement a few a few weeks ago now yeah</span>

You need to think about this country in broader sense, because we are in a democracy.

Sorry, fucking we kind of told you that. Or the Johnson track right now where they&#39;re taking even more kicks to the shins, but it might actually have some upside for them because it may have been the right call to not go down the public inquiry route from a pure political, political strategy perspective.

Well, I would suggest to him that if he wants to be seen as impartial, he&#39;s going to to need to make a little bit of a show of impartiality. So next time he&#39;s at disagreement with the government, next time they withhold something that he wants to see, he should let us all know about it, right?

I want to talk about Danielle Smith. I want to talk about the fact that she&#39;s now Premier Corrie, and it is clear by the election result that she was a liability to the party. and that there was many conversations at the doors, many conversations in the chattering class and conservative circles that said something like, well, you know, once we get elected, once we get the mandate, we&#39;ll ensure that we swap out the leaders, you know, say that silently. We&#39;ve heard that once or twice. And we know that there&#39;s that sentiment. You look at the results, you see that, you know, the NDP were able to make gains significantly. Many people think that&#39;s on the back of Danielle Smith. You might disagree. agree yeah but i think the knives might be out and i want to help us craft a strategy for daniel smith it should be the gift that we give her carter the daniel smith how do i keep my job for as long as possible strategy that is what we are doing and it&#39;s going to start with the scope of the summer and she&#39;s got a lot of stuff happening this summer she&#39;s of course going to get her cabinet sworn in she&#39;s probably going to choose staff she&#39;s probably going to have to deal with some big questions around uh folks that um how to deal with edmonton how to deal with calgary I want us to kind of collectively work together in the sandbox to help Danielle Smith keep her job as long as possible. Corey might think the knives, one of you might think the knives are actually not going to come out this summer, that they might wait for a bit. But there is a sense that these knives come out. We know this because it&#39;s Alberta and it&#39;s a conservative party in government. And we know that this is going to happen. So I want us to work on this project together. So Carter, I&#39;m going to start with you. Give us one thing, put it in the sandbox that That allows us to start molding it together around how Danielle Smith avoids having the knives coming out for as long as she can.

They all literally stood with you for the last six weeks trying to run this election. Get on their side. Get them all into your office. Make sure that they understand that they&#39;re the real power in this party and that you will be listening to them moving forward. Essentially, you are taking half of your power and you are saying, I&#39;m giving it to these candidates and these MLAs. And that&#39;s it. it. I&#39;m giving as much power as possible, because if you don&#39;t, if you try and make a strong premier&#39;s office, if you try and do a deal with TBA, you&#39;re going to find yourself on the outside looking in at the leadership review, which will happen, I think, in the next, it won&#39;t necessarily be this summer, but it will happen sooner than later.</span>

Take Back Alberta supports Danielle Smith. Take Back Alberta controls the board. She has control on things actually that even Jason Kenney had challenges controlling right now. So, you know, it&#39;s funny because everything steven said is good advice and that you want to talk to the candidates they&#39;re the ones who are going to drive it that&#39;s a nice supplement to take back alberta that can be part of a longer term strategy to build your own power base which you desperately need to do because live by taking back alberta die by take back alberta otherwise right um but you know it&#39;s uh it&#39;s almost overkill it&#39;s almost unnecessary at this point because she won she</span>

In fact, I think a smaller caucus is a bit of her friend, because a lot of the people who would be the natural standard bearers that people would rally around in terms of being a moderate conservative. They don&#39;t exist anymore. And by the way, when we talk about people going down, Ralph Klein was just a little long in the tooth, a little bit different there. But all of the other ones that have been ousted have been ousted from the right. Even Jason Kenney inexplicably was ousted from the right. But we have Danielle Smith, who has decided pretty clearly that she&#39;s going to hang out on the right. And what&#39;s the threat? That she&#39;s going to be ousted from the left?</span>

So I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re that far off in terms of what I wanted to do and what we are doing. However, Corey said something very interesting that I just want to examine with you, which is, Carter, does an election absolve you of any past sins, winning an election? Is that the rule? Corey kind of said that&#39;s the rule, definitively 100%. I want to just get your take on that before we move on to the Danielle Smith summer planning.</span>

So I think one of the fun things when a cabinet is decided upon is we then get to read the tea leaves and say, what does this mean? Brian Jean being put in energy tells us one story. Brian Jean being put in injustice tells us a different story. Brian Jean being put in health tells us a third story still. And we&#39;ll get a sense of what Daniel Smith&#39;s governing priorities priorities are and what she&#39;s looking to do in the next bit in part based on this cabinet. So I can&#39;t wait to see it, but I don&#39;t have a clue who she&#39;s going to put where. I mean, it&#39;s just so hard to do unless you happen to know exactly what she&#39;s thinking and how the wheels are turning.</span>

A dozen or so Calgary candidates? It might be 12. Exactly. It&#39;s fair to say they&#39;re not the TBA crowd, for the most part, at these Calgary folks. Would you oversample on Calgary, Carter, or would you oversample on rural when you look at her own survivability? This is my more specific question that I want to ask. If you have have your kind of more moderate conservative folks that in today&#39;s light might even look a little red tory to you considering where the party might be going and they&#39;re not to be clear uh most of them would you oversample on them would you oversample on rural how would you kind of look at that if once again your survivability is is what you look at this through carter</span>

The a degree of strength that the urban organizers aren&#39;t going to have. And when that strength gets executed, it&#39;s going to be really hard. Like Danielle needs people to protect her from that or needs to co-opt that. So I would think it would be under sampling.</span>

And so that&#39;s got to be the kind of the bulk of her cabinet, in my opinion. It would be a bit hazardous to do otherwise. But of course, you&#39;re still fighting for Calgary and you&#39;re still fighting for Edmonton. So you&#39;re going to pick, obviously, Nate Gloobish right on the edge of Edmonton.

But I would imagine there&#39;s going to be a few you can point to that are ministers you hear from all of the time that will be from Calgary, because Calgary will sort of demand it. A dozen MLAs is not an insignificant number of MLAs. And there&#39;s kind of a lesson here. Joey Smallwood was the premier of Newfoundland when it joined the Confederation, right? And obviously, Newfoundland was going to need to have when they elected a couple of liberal MPs, somebody in cabinet. And Joey Smallwood, being very practical, said, well, just give them like one of the junior Secretary of State positions, because most people are familiar with the American system. Secretary of State seems really senior, but it&#39;s actually pretty junior. Like there are levers you can pull like that, where it&#39;s like sounds like a big job, not actually doing a ton in that role. And I expect Calgary will get an outsized number of those ministries.</span>

That means all of a sudden your apparatus, your power as premier has been diminished because your power is executed through your staff. Your staff are the ones that make you look like a genius in a speech and make sure you&#39;re there on time and are doing all of the meetings to coordinate people and make sure that everybody feels like the premier is giving them a love. The less that you have your people in staff, the less authority you have as premier. You see it get diminished and eroded over time as people start saying, you got to bring in this person you got to bring in that person you got to bring in this other person do i if i&#39;m premier well if i do that probably means my power as premier is not as big as it was the day before yeah</span>

But when we start talking about building a staff, especially if you are coming in and you didn&#39;t necessarily have control of the party in the same way, yeah, inevitably, you&#39;re going to need to go look further afield. You&#39;re going to need to find experts from different provinces, maybe even from different countries. And that&#39;s fine. I think that they bring probably deep functional expertise that enrich most premier&#39;s offices. And also, they will not have the same blind spots as the people who&#39;ve been there as true believers all the way along the way. It&#39;s useful to have a couple of cynics who say, wait, what the fuck are you talking about? What</span>

Like you just need to have some of that history when you&#39;re in a premier&#39;s office too. So generally, I recommend a mix, insider, outsider.

Carter, we usually don&#39;t see the campaign manager find themselves in the premier&#39;s office i think you were a rarity if i&#39;m not mistaken that you were like one of the few guys and and maybe because like we haven&#39;t seen it since that like tandem relationship like the campaign manager of uh was rod love and ralph klein like they you know attached to the hip of course he was going to be his principal advisor i&#39;m kind of curious your thoughts on that like the campaign manager very different set of skills or campaign director whatever they&#39;re called in each of these parties finding themselves in the premier&#39;s office any Any reflections on that and the core competencies? The reason I ask is to make a finer point on it. Over lunch, you and I were kind of discussing the campaign strategist role inside the premier&#39;s office. We&#39;ve seen that happen in the United States and other jurisdictions. We don&#39;t necessarily see it labeled as that within the premier&#39;s office. I&#39;m just kind of curious if you have any reflections on that in the modern reality and what you&#39;d be kind of looking for to occupy that positioning. And I will move on. I</span>

You&#39;ve got a lot of things moving, you got to keep them coordinated, you got to keep people motivated, you got to go. No. But yeah, there are different intersections. There are different interfaces. And government&#39;s different. Government&#39;s very different. And it&#39;s hard to run at speed for four years. I always think about campaigns as something that&#39;s built to last for 28 days. And it&#39;s built to be as big of a spectacle as possible. So for 28 days, it&#39;s just got to work. And you are trying to get all eyeballs on you. Government&#39;s a little different. Government is built to be durable. It&#39;s supposed supposed to last for decades centuries you know generations we talk about when we talk about building government systems you think that&#39;s a joke we&#39;re still using magnetic reel-to-reels for our health care records from like the 70s or at least we were when i was lasting government a couple of years ago but i&#39;m pretty confident they&#39;re still there because government&#39;s fucking slow sometimes right but it&#39;s slow because those things are supposed to last and work and always work and move forward and</span>
