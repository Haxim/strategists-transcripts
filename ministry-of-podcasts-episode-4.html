            <div class="said">Well, Mr. Speaker, we support a pipeline. We support the whole MOU, which is a careful balancing of the economy, the environment, and it gets us away from the United States as a primary trading partner, and that&#39;s great news. It also is an MOU that balances the interests of Indigenous peoples and other jurisdictions. We do not support, and we are happy to vote against, games played by the opposition that make a pipeline less likely. That the leader of the opposition would do this is ridiculous. It lets Alberta down, but I shouldn&#39;t be surprised. Being elected in Battle River does not an Albertan make.</div>
