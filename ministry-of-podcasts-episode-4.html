Well, and I actually want to enter a broader conversation of how much of your job you feel like is punditry, because we&#39;re seeing a lot more MPs do what seems like punditry, right? But you are kind of explaining to people the hazards of each direction, if that&#39;s fair to say, that the Conservatives wanted you to go. And I&#39;m like, oh, that&#39;s an old-timer. That&#39;s like hearkening back to an archive Corey Hogan, in a sense. Am I wrong in saying</span>

The idea is it actually makes it easier to defend yourself against those kinds of things. So I&#39;ve always believed that was one of the real benefits of the strategists. I think that was a pretty</span>

But then let&#39;s also explain why I think you&#39;re, you&#39;re kind of kidding yourselves, conservatives on this particular matter.

We do not support, and we are happy to vote against, games played by the opposition that make a pipeline less likely. That the leader of the opposition would do this is ridiculous.

            <span class="text">of, you know, you were talking about, like, the workhorse versus showhorse thing, Zane. I don&#39;t really believe that, but I do think that there are a lot of people who are doing very, very thankless work for their political parties. Very thankless, essential work. And</span>

That&#39;s not even a federal thing. That&#39;s every election, every legislature, every political organization I&#39;ve ever worked with. but</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">but but there is also this additional dynamic tell me if you disagree that comms is sexier than most other things because it&#39;s so upfront and and it gets rewarded more yeah and and there is and and you you can probably be on the other side of this where often very good communicators um are kind of looked down not looked down upon but like they&#39;re an annoyance to those around them to be like fuck they got that one thing that is disproportionately rewarded whereas i&#39;m here doing Doing that other stuff, that other work that is so technical, so deep, so sophisticated, whatever that, you know, insert your word of choice there. But communications has this reward structure that seems to be fundamentally different, if not disproportionate. Am I wrong?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, I don&#39;t know. I mean, again, I&#39;m still living it. I think in politics, communications is rewarded more. But I think in a lot of corporate jobs I&#39;ve had, I feel almost like the comms thing is almost like the junior version of it. You might be a vice president, but you&#39;re the vice president of comms. And I&#39;m not actually talking about my last job. I had a lot of responsibilities there. But you see this in a lot of organizations. Like, oh, that&#39;s the vice president of marketing.</span>

            <span class="text">good for them. I guess the distinction I&#39;m trying to make, not to use a corporate model too much, is not that you would be a VP of comms and getting rewarded disproportionately. But it&#39;s that you&#39;re a leader who can communicate, which are two very different things.</span>
