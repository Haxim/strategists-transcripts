And a lot of people have complained about it for a long time. You know, it&#39;s like a lie versus the truth. You shouldn&#39;t give equal measure to both. And this is a change from where the media traditionally saw itself, right? I mean, the golden age was probably in the 60s and 70s. All the president&#39;s men, Washington Post, you know, we&#39;re going to tell it like it is. We&#39;re going to break the story. We&#39;re going to give you the facts. They haven&#39;t done that for a long time.

Number one, it&#39;s legal. Number two, there&#39;s no proof he didn&#39;t pay taxes. Number three, this justifies our refusal to release his returns. Number four, he paid other taxes. Number five, everybody does it. Number six, Trump is a genius for not paying taxes. taxes number seven losses are a sign of business acumen number eight i love this one by the way guys failure is a step towards success okay take that one in number eight only an abuser can fix the system a common thread uh number 10 trump did it for others number 11 to pay the taxes would have been selfish guys there is a laundry list i&#39;ve only read you 10 or 11 of these but before Before we get into what Donald Trump&#39;s surrogates are doing, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve spent any time on the show really talking about surrogate strategy.
