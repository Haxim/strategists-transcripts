            <span class="text">think the media for a long time has not known how to deal with Donald Trump. Trump, they&#39;ve been conditioned and trained and beaten into this mold since the 80s, which is we give equal billing to both sides of the argument. And a lot of people have complained about it for a long time. You know, it&#39;s like a lie versus the truth. You shouldn&#39;t give equal measure to both. And this is a change from where the media traditionally saw itself, right? I mean, the golden age was probably in the 60s and 70s. All the president&#39;s men, Washington Post, you know, we&#39;re going to tell it like it is. We&#39;re going to break the story. We&#39;re going to give you the facts. They haven&#39;t done that for a long time. And in fact, when you start looking at how much access plays into it and the need for so much content, you know, you need to keep both sides happy so both sides show up on your cable news program so you have people watching your cable news program, right?</span>

Traditionally, the polls are pretty good in the U.S., right? So polls reflect because of a whole bunch of reasons. Less volatility, more connection to the parties, more tradition within those parties. Correct. Less choice. Yes.</span>

And it will be interesting to see when these two winds collide, you know, what that hurricane looks like. Is it going to be low turnout? Is it going to be epically high turnout? out. I wouldn&#39;t rule either out, particularly if it starts to look like it&#39;s close at the end and people get really panicked about the idea of either candidate winning. Although I think if we continue down the path we&#39;re on, if Donald Trump is truly in free fall, if we have truly witnessed a meltdown, then</span>

She outright won, but she didn&#39;t use any of those instruments. If you&#39;re her advisor going into that next debate, are you going down the likability road?

And before we do, I want to read you some of the top-line defenses that the surrogates for Donald Trump are using as it relates to the recent tax return. Here we go. Here they are. Number one, it&#39;s legal. Number two, there&#39;s no proof he didn&#39;t pay taxes. Number three, this justifies our refusal to release his returns. Number four, he paid other taxes. Number five, everybody does it. Number six, Trump is a genius for not paying taxes. taxes number seven losses are a sign of business acumen number eight i love this one by the way guys failure is a step towards success okay take that one in number eight only an abuser can fix the system a common thread uh number 10 trump did it for others number 11 to pay the taxes would have been selfish guys there is a laundry list i&#39;ve only read you 10 or 11 of these but before Before we get into what Donald Trump&#39;s surrogates are doing, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve spent any time on the show really talking about surrogate strategy. So I&#39;d like to do that as a top-line level first and then get into the defense points that Donald Trump&#39;s surrogates are using. But, Corey, to you,</span>

And it sounds more legitimate and valid because it&#39;s coming from a third party who&#39;s less vested in it. And that&#39;s the idea with surrogates. You have somebody out there who has their own expertise and background and knowledge, and they lend that to the candidate by supporting them with those messages. And,</span>

I mean, today&#39;s world, even in Canada, where we don&#39;t have a tremendous media world of opportunities. In the U.S., they have way more opportunities than they have principles. So you&#39;ve got to use surrogates. Even in Canada, you want to use surrogates. To Corey&#39;s point, you want people to say. To some of those reasons, yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">Two things, reputation and trustworthiness. So people know who you are and they believe what you&#39;re saying. And that is going to be different issue to issue, what their reputation is and what their trustworthiness is, which is why you would like to have a stable of surrogates who can talk to different issues. uh this is exactly why when they talk about security clinton&#39;s going to talk about all of the republican security experts who back them right now if it&#39;s on the economy you&#39;re going to go to a different surrogate and it&#39;s not a one-size-fits-all thing and you want to have a stable but the idea is you want diversity of voices you don&#39;t want to be in a situation where all of your circuits are fat old white men which is sort of the situation donald trump is very close to being in now um</span>

The exception to that is when you&#39;re putting out something that&#39;s going to be controversial and you distance using a third-party surrogate that&#39;s kind of a little bit different. But that&#39;s almost like a trial balloon, so it&#39;s a little bit different context. So you want the person to be as close to you as possible.</span>

Gingrich, to name one. um chris christie to name another uh rudy giuliani most recently where cory is it going wrong for donald trump that these guys are going off the rails with some of these messages like or is this advised are they going rogue like and we&#39;ll talk about how they&#39;re being put into these situations that might be irreversible for their political reputation going forward i hope so i</span>

And ultimately and fundamentally, the problem these guys have is it&#39;s an utterly bullshit thing that is happening here, right? There is no real excuse for not releasing his tax returns. And to do all of this soft shoe and spin around it is just going to, of course, it&#39;s going to look stupid. When you try to defend something that&#39;s stupid, it looks stupid.
