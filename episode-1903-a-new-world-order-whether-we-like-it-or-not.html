        <p>Stephen Carter and Shannon Phillips dive into Canada’s new world order as Mark Carney cuts a landmark trade deal with China and openly acknowledges that Washington is no longer a reliable partner. Stephen and Shannon break down what all of this means for Alberta separatism, NATO, and the future of Canadian sovereignty. Can Canada expand trade without selling out workers and Ontario auto jobs? Are Chinese EVs actually "spy cars," or is America now the bigger security risk? And if Carter is convinced he’ll need his bug-out plan, is that the strongest argument that we won’t? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p style="text-align: left;">You can also watch our episodes on YouTube.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/@strategistspod</a></p>

After the Mark Carney government set expectations, what I would describe as relatively low, I guess, based on their past history and trade negotiations, we&#39;ve come up with a trade deal. We&#39;ve got 50,000 Chinese EVs that now have a 6% tariff applied to them rather than the 100. In return, China is expected to slash combined tariffs on Canada canola from 84% to 15% by March 1st and suspend anti-discriminatory tariffs on lobster, crab, peas, etc. This has opened up a whole new pathway for people to talk about security and our relationship with China. This has opened up a whole new pathway for people to talk about morality and our dual track now strategy with China, which is, yeah, we don&#39;t agree on everything, but real politic, man, we got to get going. Where do you find yourself? Before I ask Shannon Phillips, the former cabinet minister, the policy advisor, the strategist, where do you kind of find yourself grappling with this element of what Mark Carney has described, our new world order, Shannon, with our new deal with China, especially given our relatively recent history as a country with</div>

But I also buy a lot of what Carter just sold me right now, which is that Carney&#39;s New World Order comments responds also to a domestic level of risk appetite or future forwardness that we haven&#39;t necessarily – people are going to have to get uncomfortable before we get comfortable. And so if you&#39;re a big labor right now, do you play into that narrative? Do you buy anything he&#39;s selling? Do you push back? How are you thinking, even if the premier backs down, which today you could call a bit of a scale back from Ford, how are you thinking about this if you&#39;re auto parts manufacturers or any of the labor groups, or frankly, big labor overall, looking at what Carney has done</div>

We need to even probably bargain some stuff away. What you are increasingly seeing is an environment where Mr. Carney has not bargained anything. He has simply given things away and not gotten anything back. And so for labor, I think what they need to figure out is where they can work with the government on finding leverage. This concept of leverage has not been used yet.</div>

Is it, do you want to talk about Greenland? Do you want to talk about Canada? Because there&#39;s recent reporting that NBC and others have made over this past weekend alone that talks about Trump&#39;s eye towards canada not being well not real and then there&#39;s a new element that has been added i shouldn&#39;t say officially but we&#39;ve got further evidence now an affidavit by national security experts sounding the alarm that separatist petition is not only extremely vulnerable to u.s foreign interference that conversations have already begun around some of the financing from down south to fund elements of the separatist uh referendum in which i&#39;ll remind our listeners They are currently collecting their signatures for, are in their four-month window to do so. So, Carter, where do you want to start? Do you want to start in Greenland? Do you want to start us as a country and maybe perhaps Alberta as the first part of picking off an invasion into Canada? Or do you want to talk about foreign interference? All of these are connected, I guess. They</div>

And I&#39;m perfectly right. So there&#39;s that and I do think that we are all going to have to put our oar in the water in terms of a campaign later this year because if it&#39;s not a referendum on separation, it&#39;s a referendum on separation&#39;s policy platform and</div>

And I&#39;m going to signal boost them because people can&#39;t go to the laundromat or pay their rent or anything else. Because like, we&#39;re in a like quite literal, like Anne Frank situation in the city of Minneapolis, St. Paul. And so that is what I did. I mean, and I think we should all be thinking about that.

          <div class="said">because 50 bucks goes a long way uh and uh so there&#39;s that um but uh i think for canadians in politics we need to think about um i really do think we need to think about what patriotism means uh and uh what like you know and and on the left certainly patriotism nationalism these have been words that that were sort of rendered kind of dirty words in the last 30 years But we were always, especially on the progressive left, about, you know, our strong border and a national industrial policy and, you know, that sense of Canadian identity and Canadian exceptionalism as distinct from the United States. You know, and then we had 30, 40 years of neoliberalism and globalization kind of batter those identities down. But it is time to have that conversation over and above some of the, you know, dangerous distractions and divisions that have come at us from the far right. That is what we need to be doing. And we need to get over ourselves. We need to have adult conversations across parties on this and have that, I think, revive that sense of Canadian identity. You know, go back to our Mel Hurtig books and pull them off the shelf. See what they got in there for us. So I tend to agree with everything you said there.</div>

That&#39;s number one. Number two, what are the issues that are, like, is it just we are Canadians, we need to be strong Canadians? I actually don&#39;t mind that because we have seen some instances since the end of April where our elbows are down and we&#39;re just penguin walking, you know, fucking Charlie Chaplin walking into this, into our conversations with the Americans. So we do need to get those elbows back up a little bit. We do need both a defensive and an offensive posture.</div>

Mark Carney, I think we have just seen, is not, by dint of character, really disposed to an aggressive sort of posture vis-a-vis other CEOs south of the border. He&#39;s not interested in such a thing. uh but so but he was pushed to that from public opinion uh and as these uh events sort of ramp up south of the border there&#39;s clearly an appetite from uh canadians to go back to that so giving canadians some very specific things we can do number one our alcoholics already tanked the americans uh alcohol business so find another one that we can fuck with uh and remind canadians as as that booze comes back on the shelf, that we shouldn&#39;t be buying it. And, you know, give Canadians another two or three things that they can, not everything, so we&#39;re not standing in the grocery store endlessly looking at labels, but two or three products that we can go after just as much. Do make it easier for people to go to one place to, you know, like they went and got the hats for a little while, but make it easier for Canadians to go and get their other, you know, know, performative flags or other, you know, demonstrations of their patriotism. Sure, that&#39;s part of a campaign, quote unquote. That is part of something that civil society can do. I do think that in Ontario, it is time for a Defend Ontario Jobs specific campaign</div>

But they also have very, very good salaries. And it is a career that we aspire to, that has civilian purpose, when needed. Again, we&#39;re a northern country, we&#39;re a remote country, there are many, many instances where an emergency response, we do require the military, and we should have more of them. And we should invest in that emergency response capability. But also, for these national security reasons. Now, we have bases up there, there that are NORAD outposts that are co-managed with the United States. The Americans are there with us. And the only other people around, the people that are doing the rangers activity are Inuit. And the communities that they come from do not have the appropriate water, housing, social infrastructure, roads, ports, all of the things that crisis response, all of the things that we need to make sure that we have safety safety, and security for people who live up there. That is a national project. There is nothing, I think, regressive about it. I think it is fundamentally progressive. It is pro-people politics. And it is a massive state investment that is about much more than understanding the military as toys for boys. And that has to be how we think about this, in my view, if we&#39;re going to take a progressive approach to it. I have not heard any of this come from anyone in a position of decision-making. And there&#39;s a beautiful opportunity to do so. And it can start with send well-equipped, well-trained, well-paid troops to Greenland and show that a career in military service has a civilian applicability, that has civilian respect, and that it&#39;s about national security for the country and for the North and for the people who live in the North, which is the UN.</div>

So you think that that invasion of Greenland, let alone Canada, like furthers this narrative that Trump is still serious and crazy and hard to deal with and hard to negotiate with. But is there any penalty or risk for Carney to not delivering this thing sooner rather than later, or has he just, from a pure political perspective, bought himself more time?</div>

          <div class="said">I&#39;m going to quibble with the premise. I don&#39;t think he was elected to narrowly get us through Kuzma. Again, I think most people who switched from NDP to Liberal or from Conservative to Liberal in some key seats, the reason why they did that is because they saw him as an adult who is able to meet the moment, whatever the moment means, and it can mean something different at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning from a true social post than it means at 6 o&#39;clock in the morning.

          <div class="said">Carney keys to Rideau Cottage. So I think, yeah, it buys him an explanation as to why we don&#39;t have a fucking deal, because you&#39;re dealing with a crazy person. um and uh and i think increasingly canadians are are of the view and it seems like the government of canada is of this view that what why would we want to negotiate with this person let&#39;s ride the puck for as long as we can uh because at least this sort of quiet cosmo situation that we&#39;re in you know that gets abrogated uh on on certain files i periodically is a preferable situation overall for a trading relationship than than uh having a new deal that you know is not great, like, for example, is prevailing in the UK.</div>
