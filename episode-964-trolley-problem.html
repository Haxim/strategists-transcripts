Manitoba cabinet minister mocked for tweet of wife shoveling snow after 12-hour hospital shift. You&#39;ve probably seen it. I&#39;m sure you have. A Manitoba cabinet minister is making international headlines over a tweet that features his wife shoveling snow and extremely cold temperatures after a 12-hour overnight shift. He said, even after a 12-hour night shift at the hospital last night, my wife still has the energy to shovel the driveway. God bless her and all frontline workers. Time to make her some breakfast, unquote Stephen Carter. Carter.</span>

Let&#39;s move on to our next headline. line this one comes to us from the drive new french law requires car commercials to tell people to walk or bike instead that&#39;s right new federal law is now very similar to quote unquote please enjoy responsibly because the disclaimer on these advertisements in france now must mandatorily include either the following for short trips choose to walk or cycle think about carpooling or take public transit daily. Stephen Carter, are cars the new cigarettes?</span>

We&#39;ve had advertising that has to run disclaimers in the past. And, you know, I think that we&#39;ve accepted it. I mean, it&#39;s always fun to watch an old Formula One race and see all the tobacco advertising on all the cars and think about how we&#39;ve moved from that to not having anything i mean now we&#39;re not going to have the cars i mean it&#39;s a fascinating switch but i&#39;m i i think that you know what national government someone had to be the first mover you know between that and new zealand like starting to outlaw smoking completely um i think that we have a new view towards things that we feel are damaging to our society unfortunately the things that are damaging to our society are often the things that we want to buy the most cory</span>

You want to advertise your thing and the government insists you advertise substitute goods at the same time. And that&#39;s, that&#39;s strange for me as a marketer, right? Like I, you know, it&#39;s funny because the comp will be smoking for a lot of people and, but really there it&#39;s like smoking kills, don&#39;t do it, right? Here it&#39;s, do you really need a car?

District Sycamuse Council approved the permit as well as any accompanying development variance permit. Wow, very generous, but why not? It&#39;s a Dairy Queen as it&#39;s December 8th meeting. Corey Hogan, this is big news for the people of Sycamuse Council, for the people of Salmon Arm, for the people of British Columbia and Canada. A new Dairy Queen will be taken over the land.</span>

The People&#39;s Party of Canada has been blocked from registering its own name for the provincial party in Ontario by Toronto man who&#39;s used the People&#39;s Political Party for the last decade plus. It&#39;s a big blow to Maxine Burney who&#39;s wanting to gain seats in Ontario, take away vote share from Doug Ford. I want to talk about this and another headline coming up for a second here.

I think the PPC actually has the fundraising capacity and a business plan that makes sense because of who they&#39;re targeting.

They&#39;re associated with the color purple. They&#39;re associated with Maxime Bernier. They&#39;re associated with crazy policies on the bat shit, right? They&#39;ve got a brand beyond just being able to call themselves the People&#39;s Party. And in fact, they&#39;re known as the PPC pretty broadly here. So look, we&#39;re going to talk about it for a day. They&#39;re going to argue they should be allowed the name, maybe.

Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper is once again going to bat for Peter McKay in a bid to help him pay off his 2020 conservative leadership debt. 16 months after the contest, McKay still owns roughly half a million dollars in a letter to party members and supporters this week. Harper said people need to pay, help him pay that down. I want to talk about this in the specificity of Peter McKay and what this means. And then I want to once again zoom out about this, because we talk about campaign debt as like a fleeting conversation. I don&#39;t think we really appreciate the toll that it takes to run for office, to lose. If you win and you have got debt, much cleaner, smoother pathway. way.

When you work with a vendor in it, so I&#39;ll get back to you there. So as a result, this is often how this debt takes form in this day and age, right? And I think that if we continue to see this, if we continue to see Kevin O&#39;Leary $500,000, Peter McKay $500,000, somebody is going to quite sensibly say, maybe there ought to be rules on pay as</span>

Talk to me about the reality here from your perspective of what you see when a campaign has debts, like the strategists, the managers, the volunteers, like you reference some campaigns, let&#39;s not get into specifics, but you reference some campaigns with some lived experience recently. Like what happens to campaigns and candidates once they have and are saddled with this debt?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s reality in there and there&#39;s also the legality of it now. Now, so most of the legislation surrounding campaigns has been updated that forces campaigns, if you&#39;re going to take a loan, to take the loan only from a chartered bank. So you can only take a loan from an existing chartered bank. Well, it turns out to get that loan, it&#39;s a little bit of a tushy pain in the butt, right? Like it&#39;s hard to get that loan. So most campaigns are actually run off the cash flow of candidates, cash flows of spouses, cash flows of senior volunteers or cash flows of the senior staff. And you&#39;ll wind up taking, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, so the first thing that you do is you say, OK, well, I know we&#39;re a little short of cash this month, so I&#39;m not going to take my fee</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">fee that I&#39;m due. So I&#39;m going to push off my fee for a month. You&#39;ll pay me next month because we&#39;re going to do this thing. This thing&#39;s going to happen. This thing&#39;s going to happen. And then cash will start to flow because we&#39;re really on the uptick. So I&#39;m going to push off my money for a month. And then the next month happens and something has happened and it didn&#39;t work the way you wanted it. So you push your second month&#39;s fee and now you&#39;re going to carry a little bit of expenses because if someone doesn&#39;t carry these expenses, then you&#39;re not actually going to get to the thing. So now let&#39;s say you&#39;re at $30,000 all in after only two months. Well, now you&#39;ve got this sunk cost problem, right? You&#39;re $30,000 in and the only way you&#39;re going to ever get out is if you continue to put money in because you don&#39;t win a campaign by stopping in the middle, right? So I&#39;m $30,000 in. I&#39;m just one person. There&#39;s six other people who are each $30,000 in, one guy who&#39;s stupid enough to go $40,000 in. And all of a sudden, you know, there&#39;s there&#39;s two hundred plus thousand dollars outstanding. And you think, you know what?</span>

Did you just have bad internal controls? Did people spend money and start sending you receipts after that you couldn&#39;t do anything about? You know, the other thing that I think is worth noting, especially in the context of Peter McKay, although my sense is Peter McKay done, like he&#39;s not going to run for the conservative leadership after. But if you&#39;re not done, and if you&#39;ve run one of these campaigns, let&#39;s just imagine you ran for leader, but you lost, but you&#39;re still an MP or an MLA or</span>

Nobody was that impressed that he ran a half million dollar debt. But at the end of the day, they&#39;re still all conservatives. They want to do right by each other.

Quote, we&#39;re looking for a health contribution for adults who refuse to be vaccinated for non-medical reasons, unquote, Legault said at a news conference in which he also announced an interim public health director to replace his public health doctor. Since then, more than 7,000 people have registered for their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. That was just that first day, which was one of the highest in several days. We&#39;ve also seen Quebec now put a curfew on their curfew, which is coming to an end as well. I want to talk about the policy of this. I want to talk about the politics of this. Many folks, premiers, Jason Kenney, Doug Ford, federal leaders, Aaron O&#39;Toole, saying they will not be replicating what Legault said. But let&#39;s get into the policy here. And Corey, I want to start with you. You know, know, when you saw Legault do this, there&#39;s the politics here, and we&#39;ll talk about that.

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re chief of staff to a premier in a different part of the country. You saw what Legault did on Tuesday. Are you saying, fuck yeah, let&#39;s jump on board with this? Or are you saying, I&#39;m not sure I love this from the policy perspective? It doesn&#39;t have to be either of those camps. I suspect there&#39;s a blurred line between, but which way would you be leading if you were chief of staff to a premier in this country, not Francois Legault?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, this is all very interesting to me because, you know, Corey&#39;s comment about surface logic kind of, you know, was, I think, made to diminish some of that surface logic. And I quite like the surface logic because it strikes – Well, he cherry-picked some data points, and I&#39;m going to cherry-pick my own data points to make my point. But we do place an inordinate tax on tobacco products. We do place an inordinate tax on drinking. We take the proceeds of gambling in Canada because we feel that these sins should come with a cost. We&#39;re also at a place where many jobs have mandatory vaccination requirements. One of the great things that annoys me the most about the RCMP or the police services across the country saying that they don&#39;t want to stand up for mandatory vaccinations is it is mandatory to be vaccinated for most things in the police service because you&#39;re exposed to things like hepatitis through the course of your workplace and they do not want to be putting their employees at risk when there&#39;s an easily usable, safe vaccination, which it turns out is the case with COVID. Easily available, safe vaccine. So the surface logic of this makes sense to me. We should be placing a cost on that which we feel is a sin that we have additional costs for.</span>

Now, this may not be entirely the same because it&#39;s a little bit more market-driven, but British Columbia has a government-led insurance program, and if you choose to drive your car like a maniac, as Corey does, he pays a higher rate. If someone chooses to drive like a grandma, like Zane does, he pays a higher rate because that&#39;s neither safe nor fun to watch either, but perfect drivers like myself...</span>

Anyways, I digress. My point is that surface logic works for me. I am struggling with these new levels of logic that say we can&#39;t force people to take vaccination when we can, and we have, and we do and we can&#39;t have an additional cost for sins when we can and we have and we do the difference of this is that the cost is going to be applied in a different fashion because we&#39;re not selling anti-vaxxers their medicine right so they&#39;ve just come they&#39;re coming up with a different means to deliver the syntax and i like it cory</span>

            <span class="text">right? So if people get an unlimited number of free rapid tests and they are expected to rapid test twice a week to ensure that they can maintain their work status, then those rapid tests are incentivizing them to stay unvaccinated. Whereas if you charge them for those tests, then you are now putting them in a position where they&#39;ve got an economic incentive. And the same goes for this tax. This tax should not be paid for anybody. This government should not want to collect the tax. The government should be putting the tax in place as a simple economic or behavioral economics suggestion that a more rational human being, which of course we know doesn&#39;t exist, but a more rational human being should be pushing themselves towards getting getting vaccinated, because they don&#39;t want to pay the cost, which is why we put the tax on cigarettes, why we put the tax on alcohol, and</span>

If Legault, you&#39;re the last person to talk to Legault on his team, and he&#39;s like, fuck this shit. I&#39;m going to, as you say, bigfoot this meeting, you know, give them their money&#39;s worth, the press corps, try to make a big swing. If you were giving him some advice about the phrasing and what he had to do, was there anything you would have changed with how he presented this? Any things you would have covered off or perhaps perhaps left less exposed than he did on Tuesday? Yeah,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, for sure. You know, he mused about how he could do this and whether it would be legal to do it unless he did it certain ways. And when, you know, if this gets challenged and it goes to court, I think his musings about what his actual intent is could very much undermine him, depending on what this program actually ends up looking like, because he was quite open about his actions and his desires. And they may not be constitutional when all comes and goes. And if he had just maybe gone in with a little bit more of a thoughtful, we&#39;re looking at managing it in this way. We&#39;re based on these precedents. And so this is what it is. Because, you know, generally speaking, the courts will say if like it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it&#39;s a duck.</span>

Well, look, on a principled basis, if nothing else, I absolutely loathe it when governments signal intent to do things they know are likely illegal. I think it is so poisonous to kind of body politic and, you know, like kind of forward signaling of government, which is important. I mean, the Alberta governments, both NDP and UCP did this with the turn off the taps legislation, like, oh, we&#39;ll just turn off oil to BC. Absolutely clear by the the Constitution, you can&#39;t do that. You can&#39;t turn off the taps of refined products. The Constitution literally says you cannot do that. So many things in the Constitution are open to interpretation. They&#39;re not in black and white like this particular clause. And it rightly pisses me off when people start acting so casual with the rule of law. And I think it should piss other people off as well. So I want to say this.</span>

Jason Kenney says, for example, that the implication of such attacks would result in those who are lower income and unvaccinated being denied care. He called this inhumane. He said, yes, it&#39;s true that the unvaccinated impose a greater burden. But ultimately, we as a society through universal public health care agreed to accept the consequences of people&#39;s choices. I mean, his argument seems pretty persuasive, too. If you were advising Jason Kenney, though, would you say, boss, this is the line you have to take, the one that I&#39;m quoting you, this is the only lane you have to swim, or would you have tried to persuade him to say, well, go maybe on to something here, man?

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, he said Ottawa is reviewing Quebec&#39;s plan to penalize those without a medical exemption with a financial levy with interest and with interest as in the levy doesn&#39;t have interest. Ottawa is reviewing it with specific interest. He said, quote, as we&#39;ve set incentives and strong measures, whether it&#39;s vaccine passports, requirements for travelers, requirement for public servants to be fully vaccinated. We&#39;ve taken very strong measures in the past in terms of keeping Canadians safe. We will continue to look to provinces and look at measures put forward.</span>

            <span class="text">most Canadians who are vaccinated sort of begrudge the unvaccinated. And so he&#39;s, he&#39;s put most of his chips over there, but he hasn&#39;t gone totally all in. And I think that&#39;s that&#39;s probably prudent.</span>

This entire operation is because of you. Stephen Carter, are you in or are you out on Justin Trudeau escalating the rhetoric against the unvaccinated, saying that we&#39;re angry and frustrated at the unvaccinated. There&#39;s been some, you know, previous videos from his campaign comments circulating, but his rhetoric, even in live time, is getting louder. It&#39;s getting more aggressive against the unvaccinated. Are you in or out on that strategy from the prime minister? I&#39;m</span>

They keep portraying this as some sort of a their words holocaust against them and and get god man like the the people who are who are unvaccinated who are um who have exemptions you know what i get it you know some people can&#39;t have certain procedures i get that but the people who are choosing not to be vaccinated because of some sort of you know something they heard on joe rogan&#39;s podcast you know i don&#39;t have time for it and uh the prime minister calling them out um you</span>

It is far closer to, you know, eight or 10% of the population than it is to 50. And if you allow the People Party of Canada to have control, and that&#39;s who these people tend to be, then, you know, you&#39;ve made a really bad strategic political choice.</span>

There&#39;s nothing like that. It&#39;s just, if you&#39;re going to do anything, you&#39;ve just got to do it.

            <span class="text">Carter, I&#39;m going to ask you once again, overrated or underrated the strategic line that the Conservatives are now hitting on, which is wanting an inquiry on health officials using cell phone locations at Canadians as part part of this broader vaccine rollout, the broader public health measures in the country. They want to understand what this data was doing. They&#39;ve been attacking it hard, overrated or underrated, this strategy by the conservatives to focus on consumer cell phone data or citizen cell phone data.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, data is data. I mean, I&#39;m imagining that it&#39;s not tremendously individualized. Anonymized.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, if it was tracking Corey and Corey was going, you know, between the as he does the porn shop and the smoke shop, then, you know, that would be that would be one problem. But it&#39;s anonymous data. It&#39;s anonymous data and data tells stories and stories should be used by officials to make better decisions. We can, you know, Google uses data every day to update your traffic, your drive into the downtown core. That&#39;s Google&#39;s way of making sure that they have the right travel times for you. You think that&#39;s just plucked out of the air? It&#39;s all data that they&#39;re aggregating anonymously. So it makes the conservatives look like they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, which I think all too often is, in fact, the case.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">You know, I&#39;m of two minds, because I do think it&#39;s a serious problem that governments continue to just hoover up data on private citizens and use it so casually. The New York Times did some great reporting on this a couple of years back. Anonymized or not, this cell phone data can tell stories. You can see where people sleep at night, you go forward. Like, what are the controls in place? How are we making sure it was used appropriately? These are legitimate oversight questions that I think our politicians should be asking.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But I don&#39;t think their intentions are particularly pure. And I worry that this is just going to fire up the tinfoil hat brigade. And we&#39;re just in such a weird moment. Everybody&#39;s got to sort of put it through their own kind of discretionary filter. Because again, like as much as we forget, because it&#39;s been going on for two years, we&#39;re in a public health emergency. And the normal rules need to be relaxed sometimes, right? Now, that&#39;s not a blank check to governments to always act in this fashion. And I, in a sense, almost credit the conservatives for reminding people of that more regularly than I think people want to be reminded of that. But it&#39;s something that it&#39;s just got to be kept in mind.</span>
