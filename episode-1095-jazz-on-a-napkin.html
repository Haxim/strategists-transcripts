          <p>Stephen Carter rode a mountain bike and at his age is regretting it. Zain Velji and Annalise Klingbeil showed up to have the tables turned on them. The gang discusses the role of media - journalists and commentators - when it comes to platforming views and the changing nature of journalism.</p><blockquote><p><em>Zain Velji and Annalise Klingbeil unpack the strategy of hosting, tackling issues like building rundowns and executing transitions before a deep dive into the changing nature of journalism and a host's obligations when interviewing controversial guests. Where is the line between responsible journalism and irresponsible platforming? Is journalism evolving or dying? And why wasn't Vivek invited to do the podcast? Corey Hogan turns the microphone on the two hosts and Stephen Carter isn't here.</em></p></blockquote>

You want to try to get into a sense of emotional connection. And the best way to do that is to get into their head. And the best way to get into their head, of course, is through their ears, Corey. So what I like to do is I like to use the auditory nature of my vocal cords, also known as my voice, uh to get people to really understand uh through words verbiage uh generally uh the next segment that i&#39;m that i&#39;m about to to to lean</div>

So disregard whatever I said earlier about the heart and the head. Here&#39;s the thing. Usually, it ends on one of two notes. You&#39;ll notice a pattern. Either I say something hilarious and then I move it on because I want people to know I&#39;m the funniest of the three of us, regardless of who the three are. And or it&#39;s on something weird that Carter says that could probably get him sued, canceled or disqualified. So if you go back, that pattern also remains consistent that I either make a killer joke, which has the audience asking, why does he do this? He&#39;s so much better. And or has Carter make a comment which has a very similar outcome, which says, you know, why does he do this? He&#39;s not good enough for this podcast. It&#39;s</div>

The Ethics Commissioner vacancy was recently filled. Of course, we have the government giving their interim. We&#39;ll get to our homework later on the Emergencies Act. So, Annalise, as host, how would you approach these issues? How would you tee them up to a podcast panel?</div>

            <div class="said">news to me. Oh, this is so interesting. I hosted a radio show for like four months. This is exactly what I would do, is that we&#39;d have like rough outlines, six minutes, nine minutes at a time. Ten and nine minutes, ten minutes, ten minutes, nine minutes would be kind of the back and forth because of commercial breaks. And you&#39;d have like a rough idea of what was up, but the production sort of almost like slogan was like, you have to let it breathe. And whatever that means, that means. So if I&#39;m doing a ten-minute rant, you&#39;re not writing any of it. If you&#39;re doing a call and text thing, you&#39;re throwing out the question, but you always have to have something to go and say, but everything you say has to be a reaction to what someone else has said. So you&#39;re keeping a conversation alive. So for me, I don&#39;t have questions as much as I have, like, I&#39;m very curious about what something is and what the, uh, and, and why something&#39;s happening. And I know that like between the 20, 25 minutes, an hour that we spend on it, we&#39;ll get to something that interests me. That&#39;s the only metric that I use.</div>

So when we start an episode, and it was much more noticeable when we were kind of in person, and we used to record this podcast in person back in the day, usually we would get there. and zane would then take five to ten minutes to write out his notes and so i had assumed at that point after you arrived my process after he arrived yeah he he didn&#39;t want to put in a lot of advancement he didn&#39;t take the annalise let&#39;s do some research approach to this right but</div>

We&#39;re not comedians, right? But we&#39;re also not journalists. We&#39;re like occupy this really weird, interesting space where we are talking about like many cases lived experience, learned experience. experience. And Carter has opinions, but I think a lot of them stem from things that he feels like he has learned or honestly feels that are part of an extension of his craft. In many ways, a lot of his opinions come from not just like an inflammatory perspective, some of them I would say would do, but some of them are like a byproduct of him like living this craft. And I think one thing about Carter, if you want to talk about this is like, fucking think the guy&#39;s like, so resilient in in terms of how many campaigns he has done over and over, right? How many campaigns he&#39;s successfully won across multiple decades, if you think about it, quite literally. I try not to, but yeah. Most people in Carter&#39;s position would do a couple of wins, take the legacy win, ride on that forever. Frankly, most other quote-unquote strategists, and I&#39;m not throwing shade at anyone that&#39;s how they that&#39;s their meal ticket they&#39;ve won one thing once and like that&#39;s it then they just become a talking head i think what&#39;s interesting about carter is like you&#39;re platforming if you want to use that term cory like someone who does this shit more often than any of us maybe you know uh yeah there&#39;s a</div>

            <div class="said">I totally agree. Good get by Jespo. Glad that he interviewed David Parker. This is a person who clearly has whatever degree you want to apply some sort of hold on this party, ideologically, policy-wise. He&#39;s clearly relevant. Yeah, sorry, in the UCP, clearly relevant. This is a newsmaker. And the fact is, Ryan got him to make some news, right? When you you interview these people, whether it&#39;s you do an accountability interview, which Annalise is more so in your lane, what journalists kind of do around keeping folks accountable, or in casual conversation, you can unearth their perspectives. In fact, I would argue that in the lead up to this last election, and even after this last election here in Alberta, it was largely podcasts and other third party sort of like non-journalistic interview sources where we got some perspective about what daniel smith even believes cory you were saying on this pod like her moratorium on on on on electricity on renewable energy projects was derived from like some commentary that rob anderson her when you come put that together you stitch it together you kind of get where they were coming from if you were looking for those breadcrumbs well thanks to those people even if they were ideologically aligned with her i&#39;m glad they did those pods i&#39;m glad they did those interviews i&#39;m glad they platformed that uh her because there was even commentary about jespo platforming danielle smith after she was after she won the leadership race right i think so like before we need this because even if you are against this person ideologically politically on an advocacy level on a human moral level you want to know how they think what they think uh and where they&#39;re you know uh placing their priorities their money their talents good for jess but i have no issues with this whatsoever i&#39;m happy to debate that well</div>

            <div class="said">well i want to push a little bit on both of you on this one here and ask where you see the line, if you see there&#39;s a line here. The counter argument is it&#39;s moving the Overton window. You&#39;re making it part of mainstream discourse. And again, when you&#39;re a columnist, when you&#39;re a commentary provider, maybe you don&#39;t necessarily need to do that. That&#39;s the counter argument. I&#39;m not saying I agree with it, but I&#39;m saying that&#39;s the counter argument out there.</div>

            <div class="said">But the fact of the matter is in an evolving and changing media landscape, which we&#39;ve seen like on hyperdrive in the past five, 10 years, if, you know, if David Parker wasn&#39;t on Jesper&#39;s and David Parker would be on someone else. Right. And so as Zane says, it&#39;s, it&#39;s a get and it&#39;s a newsy get. And I think as we see, you know, our post medias and other kind of mainstream media just shrink and shrink and shrink and have like literally no reporters, You see all of these other kind of outlets with their own agendas and their own opinions and stuff. And I think, I mean, it&#39;s a good question. I think that this will keep evolving and we&#39;ll keep having these discussions. But how is it different than, you know, 20 years ago when the Herald had 40 or 50 reporters? borders.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="said">That&#39;s a really good point. And can I also add something to this, Corey? I&#39;m going to challenge your premise. And I know it&#39;s not your premise. It&#39;s a premise put out there right around the Overton window. But I would tell us to be cautious because whether or not interviewing people that you might think are unsavory moves the Overton window is actually complex and has no easy answer, right? So your argument is one of them, which is like you are platforming marginal thoughts. You&#39;re giving them mainstream credibility. This can be challenging if the interviewer, for example, doesn&#39;t challenge those points. They let them ride by. They can legitimize these perspectives. The other way of thinking about it is that interviewing these unsavory people can actually show a vast audience how unsavory those perspectives are. If done the the right way with journalistic integrity,</div>

              </span>
            </div>
            <div class="said">the interviewer, you know, challenging points, interviewing these unsavory people can help educate the public in terms of the views that they hold, which should not be accepted. And so the real question to me is like, at the end of the day, what is the job of journalists, right? And then this is a question I shouldn&#39;t just put at your feet, Annalise, because I know it&#39;s complex. But there are models, like there are models of what talking to people that you disagree with, that you think are on the margins, that you you think are unsavory and challenging their perspectives. Two people that I have unbelievable admiration for, Jonathan Swain, who used to be, I believe, was it Vice? He&#39;s now at the New York Times. Mehdi Hassan, formerly Al Jazeera, now at MSNBC. Both, interestingly, both journalists who talk about the US are all about the American political system. Neither of them come from the American journalistic tradition of political interviews. Mehdi comes from the British one, Jonathan Swain comes from the Australian one. I think there&#39;s something to be said about that around the political traditions that other countries hold around holding accountability. But I feel like there are ways to do these things. So I just wanted to mainly kind of talk about the premise of your question there and challenge it because I think it really does depend on the quality of interview and debate and courage that journalists bring to the table as well.</div>

            <div class="said">So I think too that, and Zane kind of brought it up, that what is the job of journalist? I don&#39;t think you would get journalists to agree on that and I think I think of a local example um my first uh boss in journalism Darren Krause who was at Metro built up Metro Calgary when um Toronto Star took Metro in a different direction he he was adamant that like journalism is not activism I want no part in that that&#39;s not and I think it&#39;s probably still in his Twitter bio and that he left Metro four if not five years ago or Toronto Star whatever it was at the time But I think, and now he runs Livewire in Calgary, but I think journalists themselves would, you couldn&#39;t come to one conclusion of what is the job of a journalist.</div>

            <div class="said">boxed in in the types of questions they can ask, the duration of the interview, the outright sort of editorial on like what stays in, what doesn&#39;t if you&#39;re producing. So for me, like to do 10 minutes on that, it would have to be the best 10 minutes of a longer conversation, right? And honestly, like I think there&#39;s like a lot of guardrails that are required, right? Like you just even think about like safe, secure environment, environment, right? Someone who&#39;s willing to challenge, um, the, the interviewer&#39;s views and perspective. Um, you know, you may almost need a rule around like what talking points can look like, you know, the time horizon or the timeline of that interview, how long the duration, I should say, should probably have range so that the person can&#39;t just talk and have and be there for their own content purposes, right? One of the things we&#39;ve seen in our, and let me just, you know, leave that bracket open for a second and open another bracket if you don&#39;t mind. One of the things we have seen with folks who are perhaps unsavory characters, and let me use one that&#39;s maybe not unsavory because he&#39;s mainstreaming himself a lot, is my friend from Kumon, Vivek Ramaswamy. This guy running for president shows up on anyone&#39;s fucking podcast. This pharma bro, tech bro, clearly someone who speaks with immense confidence and clarity. He railroads everyone he speaks on even if it doesn&#39;t look like. And the reason is, is because he&#39;s there to create his own content, right? Like he&#39;s there to get the 45, 50, 60 second sound bit after someone asks a question. And it could be a really solid, accountable interview. But someone asks a question. And if he&#39;s like, this is the one, volley spike, that&#39;s the thing that he&#39;s extracting and creating his own content from. And it looks like that interview was a slam dunk and neutralizes the interview if it actually finds legs beyond those 40, 50 seconds that he&#39;s pumping out there. So you&#39;d also want to have, as an interviewer, an understanding of what content is being produced on the back end, other cameras, etc. You know, I think really, at the end of the day, it&#39;s just like, what are you able to do to challenge these perspectives and challenge these perspectives in a meaningful way? And often, Corey, to get back to the heart of your question, that takes a lot of time. That takes a lot of back and forth. That takes a lot of asking the same question over and over. That says, okay, I get what you&#39;re saying there. Like, you know, you got your runoff talking points in. Level with me on this now. Same question, different way. Okay, okay, I got it. But like, how about this, right? Different scenarios where you&#39;re finally getting them to answer the question in multiple ways or multiple attempts. 10-minute interview? Definitely not.</div>

            <div class="said">And she&#39;s been for a long time championing something called solutions-based journalism, Which is ultimately saying the media&#39;s job is not to be simply focused on diagnosis, not simply focused on understanding what&#39;s going on constantly, and leaving it there with no real pathways or prospects of solutions, but complement the strengths of problems, right? provide valuable insights to help, whether it&#39;s communities tackling problems like climate change. In her case, it was incarceration that she was deeply, deeply focused on, on what should be done. She herself would 1,000% consider herself a journalist. She herself would 1,000% consider herself to be nonpartisan. She herself would 1,000% consider herself adhering to the written and unwritten code for a journalist, but is starting to, and I&#39;m not saying she&#39;s the one pushing this on her own, but is starting to present as a class of journalists who are saying enough of just talking about the problem. We need to be part of the solution because smartly diagnosing the problem is currently what&#39;s being taught and all that&#39;s being taught and all that&#39;s being valued. We need people like myself who consider themselves journalists, journalists, nonpartisan, above the fold, high integrity to be part of the solution. And I think that&#39;s the start of the answer in some ways, is to examine what solutions-based journalism looks like. I&#39;m very curious if Annalise has any thoughts on that. But to me, when she presented in my conversations with her over the years, I found that to be an incredibly compelling way that journalists get involved with, I shouldn&#39;t say advocacy because it isn&#39;t, But get involved with the dotted line that is from problem to end result as also being citizens living in a community, in a place, in time.</div>

You know, I, we, we never, we never credit him, but, um, David Hurley had a really interesting podcast a couple of months ago, um, where he interviewed some legacy media folks and the, the conversation was, uh, on the heels of what Annalise is talking about here, which is like, we all iterate on what&#39;s put out by the media, right? Like we, you talked about this like 35 minutes ago, Corey, like I look at national news, watch, see what these people wrote. I know if I can&#39;t find the ad free version of it, I probably am not talking about it at the end of the show. Sorry, folks. So we&#39;re getting no fucking Hill Time stories because I&#39;m not paying $7 a week. Are you fucking kidding me? Which I probably should, right, to the point of this conversation. But if these people who put out the facts, put out the stories start disappearing, the people like us that iterate, right, the people like us that comment, that speculate, that extend the news cycle, that talk about the strategy of certain things, that talk about the The analysis will have really very little to do. So what kind of replaces that? And I don&#39;t want to get into the CBC conversation because they certainly did. And I recommend people do listen to that episode. If the CBC goes away in a couple of years, at least in its current form, with perhaps a new prime minister.</div>

We&#39;re talking about going up the ladder and where the line is. But it&#39;s tough. These are tricky challenges.
