And so, he&#39;s really quite attached to this policy. I don&#39;t mean like he&#39;s emotionally attached. I mean, to the public, this policy is synonymous with his premiership, his prime ministership. So, I don&#39;t know. I mean, I think that if you asked me the question about should the liberals run away from this tax, I&#39;d say, yeah, it kind of feels like that&#39;s where it&#39;s going.

So just wait for that, because just give it a couple of weeks until that happens, because we know that means something. Hey, Carter, here&#39;s the assignment for both of you, because I was hoping both of you would say, this is actually, he&#39;s doing the right thing.

You won&#39;t even notice them because I&#39;m giving you the money for those four easy payments. And I think that there is a fundamental disconnect here. Like in some ways, we talk about, oh, this is a political policy, and the problem is there&#39;s pain. Well, there&#39;s pain, and we&#39;re pretending there&#39;s not pain, is actually probably a better way to put the problem.</span>

The planet is on fucking fire. You know, this is what we now have to do. this is a very serious thing this is serious as cancer and so let&#39;s get moving on this thing and and in some ways we have kind of fuzzed the stakes out of the picture like there&#39;s just too much blur and now people don&#39;t even sort of the conversation about the carbon tax is not even really about climate change anymore as a result of all of these puts and takes and the money coming and going and people saying i don&#39;t get it how does this do anything if you&#39;re giving me the money back that i&#39;m taking and i do kind of wonder if the carbon tax might be a little bit more comprehensible</span>

I wonder. I mean, we don&#39;t have that parallel universe, but I kind of wonder if what&#39;s missing is that moral clarity.

And I will like I will emotionally take that in and I&#39;ll give you a performance that that that that builds builds that in. And I think, Corey, you used the word of the stakes. Like, I think this is missing an emotional draw. Right now, we&#39;re talking about it in the face of, like, pure affordability, right? It&#39;s like, I fucking can&#39;t pay this because I can&#39;t pay other shit. And, like, we&#39;ve bought that frame, Carter. We&#39;ve purchased the frame that this is now a burden alongside groceries, you know, housing, you know, lack of future opportunity, whatever that might be on a financial dollars and cents front.

And it is an interesting political wedge, Carter, because it is one that one might think was meant for the liberals who are now trying to pass it over, hot potato it over to the conservatives. But what&#39;s ended up happening very recently, as we record right now, the House of Commons passed a softened, amended, whatever you want to call it, NDP motion on Monday night that no longer calls for the federal government to officially recognize Palestinian statehood after last-minute amendments were brought in. There&#39;s 14 amendments that said we&#39;re now going to work towards the establishment of the state of Palestine as part of a negotiated two-state solution. The motion was passed. Many thought it would not happen, but it was indeed passed. I&#39;m just pulling in the number here, 204 to 117. So it, of course, had NDP support. It had some liberal support. report. Every conservative voted against it, from what I&#39;m reading here, Carter. But let&#39;s, you know, we could talk about the issue at hand. We could talk about Gaza at hand.

Was this meant for the conservatives, every single one of them not voting for? Who was this for? And I hate to sound so crass about it, but this is the strategist.

That&#39;s been Canadian policy, I think, since the Oslo Accords. It&#39;s certainly the formal policy of the government of Canada that Palestinians have the right to self-determination and the right to statehood. So, quite impressive that they&#39;ve managed to just re-bundle. Interesting, too, that you&#39;ve re-bundled kind of the current status quo and managed to get the conservatives mad about it.

Can we defer this vote on it tomorrow? That did not happen. And then, of course, here they are on the other side of this vote, right?</span>

They could not reconcile, you know, where their policy positions lay within, if we can call it, and we might regret these words, but let&#39;s do it now for argument&#39;s sake as we talk about the politics of it, an enhanced version of the status quo, Carter, like, does that cost you? Do these procedural, like, what I find interesting about this is why I want to focus on the politics, less so on Gaza right now. Do these procedural sort of lack of being able to pivot, you know, being on the wrong side of a vote that ages poorly in 12 hours, let alone a week from now, do these cost political political parties? Or is it all about what happens, you know, on your message box on your time? And I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to understand, because I came into it with a similar, this was a wedge for the liberals to try to pass it on to the conservatives, and they may have actually succeeded in that regard with some of these changes.</span>

But there is a lot of interesting political wedges happening to that community right now, And it all kind of stems from the premise that that vote is up for grabs. It no longer squarely and surely belongs to the liberals. The NDP feel like there&#39;s access through it to that voting bloc based on Gaza, right? And the conservatives, Carter, feel like there&#39;s tremendous access to it to allow Muslims to voice their opinion, or certain Muslims, to be very clear, to voice their opinion that they may have been harboring for years around trans issues, for example. And it&#39;s a really interesting sort of wedge that is dividing the community right now. When you say it&#39;s worked up, let me speak clearly about it. Like those two issues right now on a week to week, day to day basis is kind of the heart of what I brought to you guys a couple episodes ago when I made a point about Gaza, but it got, you know, tangled and used as political ammunition for a point about trans issues. I mean, this continues. And the calls get louder and louder. And part of me wonders, Carter, will the conservatives who have been the engineers, political engineers of the trans rights issue across the country have been peeling off Muslim communities or at least certain Muslim individuals or prominent members of that community to their political side? Will they even pay an issue when you&#39;re helping a community on one side and you might necessarily be inactive on another side sort of thing? And I kind of always think about it in those terms, despite, you know, fully admitting that it&#39;s not a monolithic community. community.</span>

Are you in or are you out on Pierre Pauliev&#39;s most recent rhetoric against big business? Speaking to a Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, he said, listen, my message to corporate candidates is that when I&#39;m prime minister, if you want any of your policy agenda pushed forward, you&#39;re going to have to convince not just me, but the people of Canada. It&#39;s good for them. He called corporate lobbyists in Ottawa utterly useless. He said that he wouldn&#39;t listen to them. He wouldn&#39;t engage them. You know, then the rhetoric continues about like, oh, my daily obsession is going to be what&#39;s good for Canadians. But you think of conservatives and you think of big business and you think of, you know, chum chum. This is interesting in some ways. This is kind of going after the professional lobbying class, which is an easy class to kick on. But Carter, are you in or are you out on this Pierre Polyev big business</span>

They&#39;re actually reasonable, they can talk your language, they can be, and I think that is just as important.

It&#39;s this three-minute retort on Pierre Polyev on housing. You don&#39;t have to see it, because... Yeah, I have seen it. You don&#39;t have to see it. It&#39;s him voicing over it, reveals himself at the end. Classic construction in a video sense. But what I want to harp on is the line that they&#39;re floating out there. And this is a takedown of Pierre on housing. It tries to kind of talk about, you know, how he doesn&#39;t ultimately care. But the conclusion, Corey, is the thing Pierre cares about the most is Pierre. And they have this rapid fire series of clips where Pierre says, when I&#39;m prime minister, when I&#39;m prime minister, when I&#39;m prime minister, me, me, me, prime minister. Okay, they&#39;re trying to make that point.</span>
