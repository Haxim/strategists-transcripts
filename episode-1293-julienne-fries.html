And if you&#39;re a politician in a democracy, why are you creating policies that are so deeply unpopular, especially when they are just a means to an end?

But what&#39;s ended up happening very recently, as we record right now, the House of Commons passed a softened, amended, whatever you want to call it, NDP motion on Monday night that no longer calls for the federal government to officially recognize Palestinian statehood after last-minute amendments were brought in. There&#39;s 14 amendments that said we&#39;re now going to work towards the establishment of the state of Palestine as part of a negotiated two-state solution. The motion was passed. Many thought it would not happen, but it was indeed passed. I&#39;m just pulling in the number here, 204 to 117. So it, of course, had NDP support. It had some liberal support. report. Every conservative voted against it, from what I&#39;m reading here, Carter. But let&#39;s, you know, we could talk about the issue at hand. We could talk about Gaza at hand.

            <div class="said">Corey, Carter&#39;s right. This is non-binding. It&#39;s an NDP motion. Yes, it had liberal support. Yes, it passed. But at the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t really necessarily equate to anything. None of the amendments here, you know, and none of the principles here really make it anywhere, so to speak. But it is a symbol and it is a political instrument. And it is a wedge. And Corey, who was that wedge for in your mind?</div>

            <div class="said">what is it a symbol of? I don&#39;t – what&#39;s so interesting to me is at least the notion of a two-state solution. That&#39;s been Canadian policy, I think, since the Oslo Accords. It&#39;s certainly the formal policy of the government of Canada that Palestinians have the right to self-determination and the right to statehood. So, quite impressive that they&#39;ve managed to just re-bundle. Interesting, too, that you&#39;ve re-bundled kind of the current status quo and managed to get the conservatives mad about it.

They could not reconcile, you know, where their policy positions lay within, if we can call it, and we might regret these words, but let&#39;s do it now for argument&#39;s sake as we talk about the politics of it, an enhanced version of the status quo, Carter, like, does that cost you? Do these procedural, like, what I find interesting about this is why I want to focus on the politics, less so on Gaza right now. Do these procedural sort of lack of being able to pivot, you know, being on the wrong side of a vote that ages poorly in 12 hours, let alone a week from now, do these cost political political parties? Or is it all about what happens, you know, on your message box on your time? And I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to understand, because I came into it with a similar, this was a wedge for the liberals to try to pass it on to the conservatives, and they may have actually succeeded in that regard with some of these changes.</div>

But there is a lot of interesting political wedges happening to that community right now, And it all kind of stems from the premise that that vote is up for grabs. It no longer squarely and surely belongs to the liberals. The NDP feel like there&#39;s access through it to that voting bloc based on Gaza, right? And the conservatives, Carter, feel like there&#39;s tremendous access to it to allow Muslims to voice their opinion, or certain Muslims, to be very clear, to voice their opinion that they may have been harboring for years around trans issues, for example. And it&#39;s a really interesting sort of wedge that is dividing the community right now. When you say it&#39;s worked up, let me speak clearly about it. Like those two issues right now on a week to week, day to day basis is kind of the heart of what I brought to you guys a couple episodes ago when I made a point about Gaza, but it got, you know, tangled and used as political ammunition for a point about trans issues. I mean, this continues. And the calls get louder and louder. And part of me wonders, Carter, will the conservatives who have been the engineers, political engineers of the trans rights issue across the country have been peeling off Muslim communities or at least certain Muslim individuals or prominent members of that community to their political side? Will they even pay an issue when you&#39;re helping a community on one side and you might necessarily be inactive on another side sort of thing? And I kind of always think about it in those terms, despite, you know, fully admitting that it&#39;s not a monolithic community. community.</div>

Are you in or are you out on Pierre Pauliev&#39;s most recent rhetoric against big business? Speaking to a Vancouver Chamber of Commerce, he said, listen, my message to corporate candidates is that when I&#39;m prime minister, if you want any of your policy agenda pushed forward, you&#39;re going to have to convince not just me, but the people of Canada. It&#39;s good for them. He called corporate lobbyists in Ottawa utterly useless. He said that he wouldn&#39;t listen to them. He wouldn&#39;t engage them. You know, then the rhetoric continues about like, oh, my daily obsession is going to be what&#39;s good for Canadians. But you think of conservatives and you think of big business and you think of, you know, chum chum. This is interesting in some ways. This is kind of going after the professional lobbying class, which is an easy class to kick on. But Carter, are you in or are you out on this Pierre Polyev big business</div>

It&#39;s him voicing over it, reveals himself at the end. Classic construction in a video sense. But what I want to harp on is the line that they&#39;re floating out there.
