Why do the UK Conservatives look more surprised by the election call than Labour? Would Trudeau benefit from stealing Joe Biden&#39;s early debate strategy?

Is frequent &#34;flooding the zone&#34; a consequence of more ideological politics? How do you avoid debates when people already know you&#39;re bad at them?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss Biden, bidets, politicians doing punditry, pundits becoming politicians and more. Are Canadians oratory-deficient? Does the election of Jamil Jivani in Durham change the game? And I missed that - why can&#39;t Zain be appointed to Justin Trudeau&#39;s Cabinet? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Are there any good reasons for candidates to talk publicly about almost joining other parties? Did Danielle Smith get away with framing austerity as investment? Or is this budget all about &#34;two unrelated facts&#34;? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Is pharmacare a win for Jagmeet Singh? Has Pierre Poilievre fallen into a polling trap? And how does one book voyage on the &#34;Noah&#39;s Ark of Drugs&#34;?

How well known are the candidates with the general public? What does their membership sales universe look like? And can Zain&#39;s DGAF attitude catch fire in the race?

Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter, in a post-Valentine&#39;s Day tradition, talk about the positions they love and the positions that bug them - from Zuckerberg&#39;s takedown of the Apple Vision Pro to the new name for the Canada Carbon Rebate and everything (some things) in between. How can the Alberta Government justify withholding the results of the Alberta Pension Plan survey? Will the new carbon tax refund increase support for the climate incentive plan of action?
