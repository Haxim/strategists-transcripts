I mean, he could have been fired, right? But instead, they kept him for 100 years. um they kept lloyd robertson bald and gray and uh lisa laflamme&#39;s gray hair was fantastic it was absolutely spectacular so i i i do think that you know bell media made a mistake firing lisa laflamme i&#39;m not sure how i feel about um wendy&#39;s jumping in on it dove made total questioning dove</div>

You think about Dove&#39;s advertising, real bodies, 99.99% pure, this honest forthright, we should be happy in our skin approach. approach so consistent with their messaging ladders up to the story they are telling about themselves. No brainer. And the fact that they took it serious, I think also reflects the tone of their advertising.

In fact, the comedian who really pushed that, made that a national story was comedian Roy Wood Jr. from The Daily Show, who I was in Vancouver to see. see, I saw a show of his where he&#39;s performing at the Orpheum Theatre, and sitting right in front of me, Stephen Carter, was another national news host, Ian Anamansing. So, I just want to just let you pick up those names I&#39;ve dropped on the floor, just to let you know that I&#39;m also part of the mixture of Canadian culture, that I get it, that I&#39;m around, and that I take occasional trips to Vancouver, Carter.

And I would suggest to you that those groups are very, they have long memories and they remember them. This is not a group that you play with.

This is a pro-independence group. Up until, I believe it was Friday, Rebecca Schultz and Travis Taves were also on the roster. They both dropped out. I want to talk about them in a second. But the strategy scale, let&#39;s use Daniel Smith as a frame, Corey, for Daniel Smith to attend this. And of course, we now have some commentary on her, as Carter was mentioning. I&#39;ll read out the quote here. I personally have not given up on Canada yet. I understand why so many have. And then she goes on to say, this is the highlighted part. So I have a, I think there&#39;s a track that I&#39;ll be walking in parallel with the Alberta Prosperity Project. Once again, this is a pro-independence group, but I&#39;m still trying to give Canada one more chance. That&#39;s a quote from Danielle Smith. Talk to me about the strategy scale here, Corey. I mean, I don&#39;t want to get super cynical, but if you need to and say this this is a great strategy. Do it, because that&#39;s what we&#39;re here doing. But give me your strategy scale score for Danielle Smith as she engages in this forum tonight.</div>

Well, it&#39;s, you know, of course, Jared Kushner would read that and think that it was a great win for them. That was part of our strategy. We knew that they had these pressures that were out there. We were more than happy to let them run out. We were more than happy to give them the kind of the nominal electoral wins if it meant that we got the real wins underneath the substance of kuzma right and um that would have been more my response i think that would have been the more mature response that would have been the one that would be less likely to set you up for trouble down the road i</div>

Well, because I know this person, Najeeb Judd from Edmonton. He&#39;s helped enemy Paul&#39;s election campaign last time. He&#39;s suggesting that he&#39;s got all the criteria that he needs to run, but he&#39;s refusing to take a French language test required by the party and refusing to take it on effectively EDI grounds, saying he&#39;s not, quote, not participating in any language test testing by a party that professes to stand for the principles of respect for diversity and social justice. He goes on to mention that a political party has generally allowed a leader to grow in this particular domain, not have the proficiency right away, but learn the language, get comfortable with it, be provided the supports. And he goes on to then say, it&#39;s the most egregious rule of the contest and an artificial barrier created to unintentionally or not move the goalposts on equity-deserving leadership hopefuls. And finally adds, no former leader or interim leader of the Green Party has been required to take such a test. the</div>

Is there anything strategically he can do here, like in what&#39;s seeming to be a very small universe of voters to appeal to them? Or is it all one of those things back to, and this is not a fair comparison in the least, but it&#39;s like a Patrick Brown situation. Good luck, dude.

A political follow-up for Pierre Polyevera, whose campaign has ignored calls to disavow the far right extremist identified as a national security threat. He&#39;s caught in this picture where he&#39;s shaking hands with this individual. His campaign went on the offensive, said, I don&#39;t track everyone&#39;s hand I shake. There&#39;s thousands of people we don&#39;t register that&#39;d be like, I&#39;ve shaken Justin Trudeau&#39;s hand and that guy&#39;s worn blackface. So I&#39;m not going to disavow it ultimately. The political fallout here for peer policy, overrated or underrated?
