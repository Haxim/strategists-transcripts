And I think we&#39;ve seen a few examples recently within institutional parties here in Canada and the United States. Most recently with with Bernie Sanders&#39; uptick in Iowa, we are seeing that and a lot of the narrative around that is because he, unlike Hillary Clinton, is going for the big issues, large reforms, standing to the left, making big changes that are noticeable, whereas Clinton may be a little bit more predictable or a little bit more mainstay in how she&#39;s moving. We&#39;ve seen it with Donald Trump. And frankly, I wanted to get your guys&#39; opinion if we&#39;ve seen it with Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau. But let&#39;s start with the guy I mentioned off top, because I think this is a very interesting story and it&#39;s finally entering the zeitgeist february is the iowa caucus cory february 1st</div>

Carter, in your mind, is this new, what we&#39;re seeing right now, where we&#39;re seeing rather than having a pool of candidates going for iterative differences and clawing out amongst that, having people take huge or what I&#39;m going to call more significant stances on the issues?</div>

I mean, Barack Obama, I think, wanted to cut out something that was a bit bigger.
