            <span class="text">Yeah, that&#39;s true. We auditioned a couple of guys. Well, we should have after the response from last episode. People either loved it or wanted to rip our heads off. So it was really a tale of two camps. Now,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Now, in fairness, only the proportional vote people wanted to rip our heads off. And we don&#39;t care about them. But</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">they were insistent. They kept on going. You know, when I say reach out to us on Twitter, I mean send us a note. We respond back. this was like a thread of like 450 messages and i blame you cory for engaging yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know what and after last episode i kind of claimed maybe i would maybe i wouldn&#39;t engage i just went in with both feet that&#39;s okay so yeah i think we&#39;ll be talking more about that we can get into the more arcane pr stuff in the future but god not today come on like okay</span>

I want to try to hit a theme, and we may be successful in it. We may not. We are compensating today, certainly. I&#39;m not going to tell you for what, because I don&#39;t know. Clearly, these two are.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">But I want to talk about political parties and candidates now starting to go for moonshots more than they are for the small ball changes. And I think we&#39;ve seen a few examples recently within institutional parties here in Canada and the United States. Most recently with with Bernie Sanders&#39; uptick in Iowa, we are seeing that and a lot of the narrative around that is because he, unlike Hillary Clinton, is going for the big issues, large reforms, standing to the left, making big changes that are noticeable, whereas Clinton may be a little bit more predictable or a little bit more mainstay in how she&#39;s moving. We&#39;ve seen it with Donald Trump. And frankly, I wanted to get your guys&#39; opinion if we&#39;ve seen it with Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau. But let&#39;s start with the guy I mentioned off top, because I think this is a very interesting story and it&#39;s finally entering the zeitgeist february is the iowa caucus cory february 1st</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">sanders let&#39;s talk about bernie sanders because i want to go there first lay it on me what what is what is your take in terms of first him as a candidate and then let&#39;s talk about if his ideas are actually what&#39;s moving him forward yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">yeah well right off the top it&#39;s not just that he&#39;s looking like he&#39;s in the race in iowa it&#39;s that national polls there was this new york times cbs poll that came out that showed the race tightening significantly nationally between Between him and Hillary Clinton. Now, it&#39;s one poll, but what was really fascinated about it is that of primary and caucus goers under 45, under 45, we&#39;re not talking under 30, we&#39;re not talking, you know, the hacky sack crowd. Under 45, we&#39;ve</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Two to one. Five years ago, I defined youth voters as anybody under 40 for Nenshi. And it&#39;s been five years since I did that. And now here we are, people under 45 are still youth voters.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Arrested development, I guess. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, they have a different model of making their voting decisions, and it&#39;s not necessarily a good voting model. Did</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in Nenshi? Some did. The plus 35s did. Not so much the 25 to 35.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">So I guess, you know, it&#39;s interesting, and I don&#39;t want to just stop the Sanders conversation there, but I want to actually go back to the larger point for a second. is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">this new is this new where you have candidates who when compared to their counterparts in races and despite their popularity talk about huge total you know shifts okay that they&#39;re gaining this momentum let&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s context this right you know it&#39;s only huge shifts relative to the 90s where we decided we&#39;d solved all our problems and we&#39;re just refining things but the reality is the political spectrum as we talk about it today has become is probably as narrow as it&#39;s ever been You know, the left is talking about, like, they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they talk about raising taxes to lower than the taxes Klein was under here in Alberta, or that Clinton had in the 90s, right? I mean, the fact is, we&#39;ve kind of just gotten</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">gotten to this point where we think it&#39;s big and dramatic to do things that are still within that liberal, democratic, you know, capitalist sphere. we don&#39;t really like</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">like what are we really talking about what is bernie sanders really saying that is so outrageous uh really when you put it in the context of the 20th century where we had movements like fascism and communism and all of these other isms we&#39;re still just refining the system and if these refinements seem big it&#39;s only big relative to where those refinements that&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s a fair point carter do you have anything to say well i think that there&#39;s two things first of all i think that cory doesn&#39;t see the big shift in bernie sanders because cory&#39;s looking from a canadian lens and with a canadian lens really bernie sanders is not that big a deal in</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">in the american lens bernie sanders is a big deal and the other side of it is trump cruz uh carson right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">who are also a big deal non-institutional</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know so what what cory is representing is hey maybe you know you know sanders isn&#39;t that big a deal because he&#39;s actually moving towards what we would consider uh as a canadian common sense and i&#39;m not saying that i mean our Our right-wing parties in Canada don&#39;t measure up to the right-wing nature of the Democrats, let alone the Republicans in the United States.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, but does Bernie Sanders even want taxes as high as they were under Reagan? No,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, but he is very left in the popular mythology of the United States right now when you look at the right. Right.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Right. When you look at Cruz and Trump and Carson, you have got, you know, what Zayn is going for, very far right positions. But I don&#39;t</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">don&#39;t think that Trump holds a candle to Barry Goldwater. Like, my point is, if you take this and put it into some perspective, these are not radicals by any way, shape or form. Goldwater</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that these people are being branded as radicals. And to me, that is what&#39;s fascinating, because it&#39;s not actually diminishing their appeal whatsoever. It</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>
            <span class="text">It isn&#39;t. And we&#39;ve seen that on both sides. But Corey, hit on me, hit on that a little bit more for me in the sense that them being branded as radicals, what do you think that&#39;s a response to today? Like,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_01</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, everything is relative to the baseline that is today, right? And if you&#39;ve been sitting there arguing, you know, I mean, I remember last election here in Alberta, there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">there was, and I actually think Rachel Notley doesn&#39;t belong in that group of radicals, because I thought, so-called radicals, because I thought the NDP in Alberta ran a pretty centrist platform last election. but you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you had everybody was sort of saying oh no no small business taxes have to be three percent or lower that was the consensus among all of the parties in alberta right some of them wanted to lower it further nobody</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">nobody wanted to raise the corporate income tax further than to 12 percent from 10 percent it was 15 percent in the 90s right i mean these are not big radical changes is is the point but how it&#39;s playing is is um it</span>

It&#39;s actually not as accelerated or as hyped as it was back in the day, looking at the larger context. Carter, in your mind, is this new, what we&#39;re seeing right now, where we&#39;re seeing rather than having a pool of candidates going for iterative differences and clawing out amongst that, having people take huge or what I&#39;m going to call more significant stances on the issues?</span>

            <span class="text">I think that Corey&#39;s correct in his historically no position, but I do think that relative to the most recent political success stories, they are new. I mean, Barack Obama, I think, wanted to cut out something that was a bit bigger. Clinton absolutely wanted to cut out something bigger but didn&#39;t because it was easier just to stay on very simple themes and stay in the center. um bush</span>
