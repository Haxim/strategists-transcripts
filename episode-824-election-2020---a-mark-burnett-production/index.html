        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Donald Trump's COVID-19 diagnosis and the Vice Presidential debate. Can getting COVID-19 work to Trump's advantage? Does this change our thinking about the Supreme Court fight? And has Stephen Carter invented a new type of negative ad? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">Well, let&#39;s be honest. I mean, elections for quite some time have been many reality television shows where, you know, the media play their role. The candidates each play their role and the voter watches it with some sort of entertainment,</div>

          <div class="said">entertainment, benign entertainment value. I think, you know, it&#39;s not very exciting, but they watch it anyways because, you know, people could hurt each other. this is totally different this is real reality tv it is entertaining it has uh life and death stakes in a way that we&#39;ve never seen you know like you know the survivor episode that ends with someone stepping on a jellyfish will he or she make it i mean that&#39;s where we are right now donald trump stepped on the jellyfish and now we&#39;re wondering will he or will he not make it and what happens then i mean who&#39;s not following this who&#39;s not interested in this who doesn&#39;t think this is the best reality television that Mark Burnett has ever produced, because that&#39;s what it feels like. It doesn&#39;t have anything vaguely resembling normal ebbs and flows of electoral politics. The debate was a great example. And now this COVID diagnosis, also a great example. This is not real.

Wake me up when the season&#39;s over, so to speak. Because none of the plot points matter because none of them actually travel from day to day. And I think that&#39;s where I feel right now.

And let&#39;s start with what Corey mentioned, which is the medical team. And what do you guys make of this medical team coming out, almost playing to the audience of one? We&#39;ve talked about the audience of one so many times. Dr. Conley playing to the audience of one. And then having Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, going off the record saying, of course, then being outed by The New York Times for doing it so poorly, but then saying that, you know, he&#39;s actually quite concerned about the health. Carter, give us your strategic comments of like what they&#39;ve done. And do you think it&#39;s a strategic choice they have made as to how they&#39;re playing this?

Let&#39;s talk about that, the lack of clarity. These are, at the end of the day, medical professionals.

This is my suspicion. This is my hypothesis, is that Trump&#39;s doctors are playing for Trump and people around Donald Trump are saying, okay, well, we can&#39;t just let everybody sleepwalk through this gobsmacked if this guy dies in five days.

So it was that photo session. You saw the photo session with Trump at Walter Reed Medical Center saying that he&#39;s good, signing his autograph on a blank sheet of paper. You then saw that four-minute video where he communicated directly to his supporters saying he&#39;s fine. And then today you saw him in the Beast doing a little bit of a victory lap in this hermetically sealed car where he&#39;s got COVID and there&#39;s a Secret Service agent inside. So let me just add that context. Well, he waves and thanks his supporters. Let&#39;s package those three things together. And maybe, Stephen, I&#39;ll start with you. What did you make of Trump&#39;s what I&#39;d call PR 101 exercise to show that he&#39;s still the strong man that his supporters think he is? Would you give it high marks? What would you kind of dissect from that strategy? And where&#39;s your head at on what you saw?</div>

Even if it&#39;s just a walk through the grounds of Walter Reed Hospital. He needs to get – he needed to be showing that he had – you know, he could act. It could be a closed, secured environment.

Let me talk about, before I get into Biden and the Dems strategy here, I want to talk about one more thing on the Republican side, which is Mike Pence. So Pence was at that same Amy Coney Barrett Rose Garden celebration. He has been tested negative three days in a row. Medical professionals across the United States are pounding their desks saying that he needs to isolate. He needs to be in isolation and quarantine himself. He&#39;s refused. He said he&#39;s going to debate on Wednesday against Kamala Harris, which we&#39;ll talk about in our upcoming segment. But he&#39;s also said that he&#39;s going to hold rallies going forward. If you&#39;re the Republicans, Corey, let me stick with you here. Is Mike Pence doing you any favors with his strategic choice here or no?</div>

I mean, like, this is the notion of putting down bets that seem suspect at one point, but are at this point, you&#39;re almost just chasing your losses. And now, just imagine from a reputational point of view that Pence does get COVID. Maybe not even from this event.

An interesting sidewind of this thing has been that a couple of the GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee have also been diagnosed with COVID. This has then led Pelosi and Schumer to say that we should not be having a hearing for Amy Coney Barrett, that a vote on a lifetime appointment needs to happen in person. Corey, what do you kind of make of this? I shouldn&#39;t call it Hail Mary, but it is resembling one, trying to take advantage of an opportunity of what Schumer and Pelosi are trying to do right now, because we still have a promise by Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump that they want to get Amy Coney Barrett to become a justice prior to the election.

We&#39;ve always and you guys have especially always said Biden&#39;s strategy here needs to be to not go down Trump&#39;s rabbit holes to not, you know, necessarily pick scabs, so to speak, to appear presidential to peer above the fray. Today, an NBC poll comes out saying Biden has a 14 point edge over Trump, volatile polling for sure. But I want to use it to talk about this item we just mentioned, which is the Supreme Court nominee. Should Biden be spending political capital right now to making an emphasis on this particular issue? Should he be donating some of his political capital behind Chuck Schumer and others, perhaps even burning it to be able to try to make this not happen, knowing that he&#39;s got, whether it&#39;s a 14 or eight or six, whatever you want to say, point lead heading into November?

And if you are Joe Biden, your campaign is largely a campaign against Donald Trump. And to pull that arrow out of your quiver, that&#39;s a big move. The other thing is, when do you put it back? When do you put it back? When is the trigger that allows you then to say, okay, I&#39;m going to run negative ads again? Is it when he returns to the White House? Is it when he himself resumes his campaign? You&#39;re going to take the hit that you would have taken about the negative ads. You&#39;ve drawn attention to it. You&#39;ve implied there&#39;s something wrong about negative ads all at the same time. like it gets so complicated i guess is my</div>

Let&#39;s assume Trump survives this thing. Let&#39;s assume he beats it. Is there any upside to that? Let&#39;s say it takes the standard 10 to 12 days. Let&#39;s do political math here.

          <div class="said">Look, it seems really unlikely. It&#39;s not impossible. I thought it was more probable before. So before he went to the hospital, I thought if Trump is just got the sniffles for three days, and then he&#39;s back, and he&#39;s the same guy he was, and he&#39;s out on the campaign trail in 10 days, that&#39;s very reinforcing of his overall narratives, which are very counter to Joe Biden&#39;s narratives. Joe Biden is saying, this is really serious. You got to take this serious. You&#39;ve got to do more. And if Donald Trump sort of walks through and kind of dusts his shoulder and says, yeah, no big, then I think if you&#39;re Joe Biden, you&#39;ve got a problem. If you&#39;re Donald Trump, you&#39;ve got an opportunity. But now that he has actually had to go to the hospital, he&#39;s been put on experimental drugs, he has been given oxygen, he&#39;s been given a steroid treatment that is only supposed to be used in severe situations. conversations, I think it is a bit of a stretch to suggest he&#39;s going to be able to walk out and say, yeah, no, like COVID is not a big deal. Like every time he talks about COVID for the rest of the election, which will be the rest of the election because the fucker got COVID, it&#39;s going to be just a reminder of the weaknesses of Donald Trump. So I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s a significant risk, at least with the bulk of the electorate. Obviously, Donald Trump&#39;s diehards, They will see him as that messiah that Carter talked about.</div>

And he&#39;s clearly been, you know, in close connection at that Rose Garden ceremony, as we talked about. And Carter, maybe I&#39;ll start with you. What is Kamala Harris&#39;s strategy heading into this debate? Should she outright refuse to debate knowing, you know, that Mike Pence is not taking into perspective the medical guidance here. Maybe that isn&#39;t the strategy, but maybe let&#39;s start with Kamala.

You&#39;ve been exposed to people with covid. You&#39;ve been talking in close quarters with people with covid. You are not isolating and quarantining yourself. I am not going to debate you. you i am not going to be in inside with you uh you know spitting at each other uh from from two and a half meters apart um that feels to me like that should be the normal response um but i don&#39;t think that she&#39;s got that opportunity first of all we&#39;re all looking forward to this debate remember from the day that she was chosen uh to be joe biden&#39;s running mate it has been expected that she would be the star of the debates she would stand in there against mike pence and wipe the floor with that poor motherfucker and and that is what we want from her so i&#39;m really like i think that on the medical side she should say no on the political side she should say yes and walk into that room and do as we&#39;ve been hoping for uh from the day she was named and just take take um him him down.</div>

This is, you literally have a president who&#39;s in the hospital, and you have another one who is is also very old. So it&#39;s important that this go forward. I will say that if I&#39;m the Democrats, however, that doesn&#39;t preclude me from doing things like demanding the commission put plexiglass between myself and Mike Pence, which will just visually reinforce the whole Donald Trump is a walking vector of disease thing throughout the debate. So there are ways you can play with it. And there&#39;s no way that Pence can reasonably say no to such a demand. And so a bit of a game of chicken can happen there.

Should he try to add some distance between him and Trump? Should he try to be his own thing? How is he positioning himself? Because Corey brings up a really important point, a president in the hospital, and if Biden wins the oldest president to ever take office, this could be a preview of maybe not even four years from now, but much sooner in either direction. So how is Pence perhaps positioning this debate and perhaps himself in the context of being Trump&#39;s VP pick?</div>

It&#39;s not an organization that immediately is just turnkey. you take it over and by the way uh here&#39;s your seat you get to run an election now that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to be happening you are going to be distracted on the campaign trail for uh you know for the next month and uh and to what end like to what benefit i just um i don&#39;t know maybe i mean to me it&#39;s one of these things where it&#39;s high risk high reward but i just don&#39;t think the calculations there somebody always wins the lottery doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a smart money move to buy a lottery ticket.</div>

          <div class="said">Nicely said, Corey. I&#39;m sticking with you. Same frame in or out, same frame on in or out. Horgan, week two of the BC general election. We talked about week one, him taking a bit of a beating for calling the election, a bit of a gamble, rolling the dice as numbers for COVID do go up. Well, they are going up, but now it&#39;s starting to seem like his leader and Dr. Wilkinson are being defined a bit more. From what you&#39;ve seen in week two, are you in or out? in the week that he&#39;s having, not on the overall campaign, but in the week that NDP leader and Premier John Horgan is having this week?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I&#39;m in because every week that gets us a little closer to the election without a significant change in the landscape is a good week when you go into an election so far up. You know, he has benefited from, I think, a few missteps by Wilkinson. And also, let&#39;s be really real, the entire world being distracted by the same things things we&#39;ve been distracted on in this podcast. It could very well be British Columbia is going to get to election day and say, oh, shit, it&#39;s election day. I&#39;ve been watching this American thing the entire time.

          <div class="said">I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s not just even knowing the general trajectory of this disease. It seems really unlikely that this is in the rear view mirror. Carter&#39;s notion of super spreader events that he may or may not get involved with the minute that he&#39;s cleared from his COVID diagnosis, which I&#39;m not at all convinced or think is even close to likely that we&#39;ll be in that position next week. But when he gets out there, we know Donald Trump&#39;s very selfish. He&#39;ll say, I&#39;m safe now. I can&#39;t get COVID again, or at least it&#39;s very unlikely based on all of the evidence that we have. So he&#39;s just going to go out there and put together all sorts of very questionable events, it would be my suspicion, if he recovers well enough to get back onto the campaign trail. So yeah, we&#39;ll be talking about this one way or the other. This is going to drag for a while. It&#39;s hard to imagine this campaign not closing closing out on COVID after Donald Trump&#39;s diagnosis.</div>

That&#39;s how you ask a listener question. No, there is no other way, people on Twitter. Here we go. Five stars, the subject heading, poor Zane, of course. The podcast is a brilliant example of an extremely put-upon host doing the best with what he&#39;s given. Don&#39;t disagree. agree. Zayn Velji deserves a Gemini Award for dealing with those other two. Agreed. Here&#39;s the question. Since the throne speech featured little in the way of massive expensed items, do you think the fissure between Trudeau and Morneau was purely about the latter falling on his sword over the We Charity scandal? So we&#39;ll go back to some Canadian politics with this question by Mihalik. Corey, I&#39;m going to start with you. So the question is, Was the Trudeau-Morneau rift purely about the fissures of we that led to Morneau being ousted?</div>

          <div class="said">Not entirely. I think that after the throne speech, it&#39;s hard not to think it was more about that than we were led to believe in the lead up to the throne speech. But let&#39;s just put a couple of things out there. No new expense items does not mean that there is peace in the valley when it comes to our finances. And it&#39;s quite possible, if not even probable, Morneau was arguing for, how are we going to get back? What is the path? And obviously, the extension of CERB is a very expensive line item. And I could see Morneau not being that enamored with that, right? The other thing is it is also possible, if not probable, that just based on the reporting that was out there, that the Liberals got, if not cold feet, they lost their enthusiasm for spending at the nth degree because a combination of the polls, some anxiety that was out there, and maybe even just a stern talking to from the public service who said, Sir,</div>
