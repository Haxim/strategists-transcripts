        <p>Annalise is at Folk Fest. Zain Velji is decidedly not. Stephen and Corey answer questions around the Calgary Stampede, George Chahal, Liberals that have won Ontario elections and Liberals unhappy with their federal lot. Plus: the gang create a whole bunch of new merchandise.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk the Calgary Stampede's acceptance of liability and negligence for decades of sexual assault, Calgary Skyview MP George Chahal's fiery response to the same, the Ontario by-elections, post cabinet public sniping by Liberal MPs and much more in this July edition of "Fine, Fabulous or F--ked". Did George Chahal channel public rage or set a trap for himself and his party? Are the Liberals reverting back to their history of internal, internecine warfare? And when will the debate between winning and losing be resolved? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

We&#39;re going to go through a list of political things, items that have happened in the news, political strategies that have been implemented, political stories that we are now seeing in the headlines. Carter, you guys are going to tell me whether it is fine, fabulous, or fucked for the party in question. And, Corey, let&#39;s start here. Let&#39;s start locally with a story that is making some headlines here. Calgary Skyview MP George Chahal has written a letter, a scathing letter, on the developments concerning the Calgary Stampede. This, of course, after the Stampede admitted knowing about a culture where sexual assault went unchecked for decades, members of the Young Canadians and the Calgary Stampede. Carter, will you explain? I&#39;ll let you explain the story. It&#39;s a very intricate story</div>

          <div class="said">about... They were made aware of sexual harassment and assault that went back to the 1980s with one of their young Canadians instructors. And it took them, as you say, decades to act on it. And finally, the lawsuit has been, right now they&#39;ve agreed to the wrongdoing. They&#39;ve not yet settled on the amount that they will be paying. And the Calgary Stampede, I think, here has been quite tarnished by it. But I&#39;ll let you get to the fine, fabulous, or fucked part. but that&#39;s the basis of the story is that they&#39;ve known they they knew about it for decades and they took exactly zero action to protect children uh i think is the is the crux of it uh unless cory you know you want to add anything but i think that that&#39;s got uh the core elements of the story</div>

          <div class="said">it&#39;s obviously a bad scene there&#39;s no disputing that i think that we do need to acknowledge there&#39;s a difference between acknowledging kind of corporate culpability and the culpability of the people that are there right now and there is an argument to be made that the people there right now are trying to do right and trying to move forward and trying to do good and this organization of course is more than just one individual or one set of actors and so i think this is where we get into the challenge of this particular matter when you assess the actions of George Chahal, which I think you&#39;re teeing up here, you know.

          <div class="said">up. So thank you to both of you for kind of adding color to that story, adding some context to this story. Before I get to Chahal, can I talk about this Calgary Stampede? And my question starts with you, Stephen Carter. Fine, fabulous, or fucked? Let&#39;s talk about the actors of today, right? This is an incident that happened years ago, spanning over a decade. will easily get into the territory of speculation. I love that usually. I don&#39;t want to get onto it in this particular story. So let&#39;s talk about the actors of today, Carter. Fine, fabulous, or fucked in your mind that the Calgary Stampede releases this statement, this admission of culpability right after the Stampede, not doing it before, right after. Is that fine, fabulous, or fucked in your mind? Put your strategy hat on. I</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">I mean, as a strategist, I think you have to acknowledge acknowledge that it is far better to do it after the stampede than it is to do it before the stampede. You know, they have enough controversy that swirls around the stampede every year without adding this to it. So from a strategic point of view, I think that it&#39;s fine. And I might even go so far as to say fabulous when thinking of the point of view that Corey&#39;s bringing forward, which is that this is a group of people who may or may not be individually responsible because you know they they weren&#39;t sitting at the control panel when this happened over the over the past decades but um so as the individuals to to accept culpability uh to do the right thing is is probably fabulous um but there&#39;s going to be a pretty big bite that hangs in the air over this because of um the culture that had to exist uh for this to to occur for the period in which it did.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, same question to you about the stampede, their communication strategy here, releasing this note, this apology, this admission right on the heels of a near record-breaking stampede. Fied, fabulous, or fucked in your mind?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, again, if you&#39;re talking from a strategy point of view, I tend to think it&#39;s fine, or maybe even a quote-unquote fabulous strategy here.

          </div>
          <div class="said">you would be thinking in in the sense of you have optionality as to when this occurs you want to do it in a way that damages the the corporate institution that is the stampede the least that is the furthest away from the stampede so you have time to recover and people to contextualize it and think about things differently and and maybe even see some of your follow-on actions in terms of the things you are going to do as an organization to both atone for what was occurring, how you&#39;re going to make sure something like this never happens again, right? To have the most time possible to do that, you do that as far away from the stampede as possible, which is right after the stampede. So it makes a ton of sense from a strategy point of view. I have to confess, I don&#39;t know enough. I would feel maybe a little bit differently about it if by delaying it, there were some significant ramifications besides that delaying of justice by a week or two weeks or whatnot, or maybe they&#39;ve been holding on to this for four months. I just don&#39;t know enough about that, Zane. I don&#39;t know enough about the chronology behind there. But let&#39;s just assume they had a choice between a week before and a week after, and the facts are what the facts are.</div>

          <div class="said">to this point, being like, of course they released this after the stampede, right? Of course they released this after the 10-day festival where they raked in the money, the sponsorship, you know, the sponsors felt good. They give themselves 51 weeks to rebuild trust to next year&#39;s event. When the strategy is so crystal clear, does it come at a cost when it&#39;s like it&#39;s both artful but also just so nakedly obvious? You know what I&#39;m trying to say? Like I&#39;m trying to say that if people can see it as like, oh, that kind of makes you feel something, you know? Yeah.</div>

The Stampede, for those not in Calgary, is a bit of an all-encompassing event. And there are significant outlays by, you know, the agriculture industry, by corporate Calgary, by partners more generally, as they invest in this community building time. And if you&#39;ve got this cloud over it, and those investments all of a sudden become these big liabilities, that&#39;s a problem for a lot of people. And I can hear people say, and I&#39;m not sure I entirely entirely disagree. Yeah, but you know, you got to pay the piper. And there were there were significant wrongdoings that were done here.

So the question really is on the heels of this, where the Stampede finally acknowledges, right on the heels of this year&#39;s Stampede, that this decades-long history of abuse by this individual who was imprisoned in 2018, we apologize and we take responsibility for the stampede admits that carter uh on the heels of this year&#39;s stampede last week so this past thursday then calgary skyview mp george shahal writes this one pager a letter that says not a single taxpayer dollar should support an organization that has shown shown such blatant disregard for the well-being of our youth federal funding should only be reconsidered when the victims themselves feel the genuine accountability and reconciliation conciliation have incurred. The Calgary Stampede must recognize that they have lost trust of many Calgarians. And then he goes on to say that I&#39;ll be encouraging my federal colleagues within the government to not fund the Calgary Stampede. And for context, it&#39;s about two million bucks a year that the feds kind of cough up to the Calgary Stampede. Carter, the question top line is very simple.

So I honestly don&#39;t know how I feel about this. I think that that came out so quickly after the fact base. I wonder if George Chahal had all of his facts or if he&#39;d really thought about it. It felt very shoot from the hip. And, you know, it was based on a righteous indignation that was legitimate, right? Absolutely legitimate what was occurring here.

I&#39;m paraphrasing for George, but it&#39;s in this vein. I&#39;m going to use my advocacy power to lobby my colleagues to not put a single dollar into the Calgary Stampede until this bar has been hit. When we talk about political strategy, we have to do risk calculations all the time. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time in this conversation on risk. What is the risk to George that he&#39;s unsuccessful in the feds and stopping his federal colleagues, right? He&#39;s not a cabinet minister, recent cabinet shuffle, right? He&#39;s a voice here in Calgary, a powerful one. But like when we talk about risk exposure, when he puts out that letter, He might win on vibe check, which we all largely agree. He may or may not win on fact base, TBD. But what risk has he now exposed on himself around his political both might and, frankly, fallibility if he can&#39;t persuade his federal colleagues?

It was a big thing when Jyoti Gandek took on the Stampede, because there was an open question as to whether or not that would be a successful strategy, because the Stampede is so fucking powerful. powerful um so you know i i&#39;m kind of i don&#39;t think i only i think the only risk that george has is in terms of all politics are local and maybe he has a harder time raising money because the stampede mafia close ranks and and try and protect um the organization but that&#39;s to me I think that that&#39;s a marginal issue, because I don&#39;t think that the Shahal cabal of power have ever relied upon the stampede as a center of power for them.</div>

It&#39;s not really how Calgary runs anymore. Calgary runs on different engines. And George Chahal represents one of those engines. Kind of this progressive politics, modern and outtake, diverse communities. communities. That&#39;s a version of Calgary that also exists and has an engine now. Just as there&#39;s an engine of populist right-wing politics, and just as there are other engines all over the city with all sorts of interests, it&#39;s way less unidimensional. And, you know, this idea of the so-called Stampede Mafia, so-called by Stephen, I will mention. I</div>

And the fact that they did get away with this for multiple decades shows that there is a culture of secrecy around the Stampede that&#39;s not healthy for any organization.

This is a party that struggled to get into third place, but they win a pair of by-elections. From your perspective, Corey, they&#39;ve of course got an ongoing leadership race, I should mention for context, that&#39;s happening currently in the moment. Fine? Fabulous?

They had somebody, they had a very powerful candidate, you know, a former MP who runs. It was, you know, in the other case, a seat that they&#39;d held. So like no big in that sense. But, you know, certainly that&#39;s great. It&#39;s better to win by elections than lose them. And well, when I last checked, and I should have looked this up again, the NDP were doing pretty strong in southwestern Ontario, doing stronger than they have historically done. No one&#39;s talking about that. Everyone&#39;s talking about the fact that the Liberals got both seats. And it&#39;s better to win than to lose. And it will certainly help in their ongoing attempt to become like the opposition in waiting, the government in waiting. It&#39;s funny, because they&#39;re in third place.
