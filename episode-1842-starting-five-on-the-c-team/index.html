          <div class="said">yeah a couple of lessons come immediately to mind for me one maybe i should make it the second one but i&#39;m going to start here he&#39;s taught us there is no liberal party right it only justin trudeau He&#39;s recreated it to such an extent that there is no infrastructure to keep him in check because in a more functional political party, and this is true, by the way, of Donald Trump and the Republicans as well, but in a more functional political party, there are checks on the leader&#39;s authority. The leader&#39;s office is not so all-powerful. Ministers have authority that they&#39;re able to exert. They have a voice they&#39;re able to use. The party apparatus has an ability to step in and the executive can lay pressure on. Donors used to be able to lay pressure on. This is another one of those changes that is, I think, subtle and unappreciated. But when we went to grassroots donations like this, we&#39;ve changed that particular check too, where large interests used to be able to come in and say, you know what, bud, no more. And not all good. I&#39;ll be the first to say that. But we&#39;ve lost a check on the leader&#39;s power as well, when you no longer have donors who can move in and move their heft around. So there&#39;s no Liberal Party anymore. There is Justin Trudeau, and there&#39;s the apparatus that Justin Trudeau has created. So I think that&#39;s lesson one.</div>

And maybe there has been, maybe they&#39;re just keeping it very quiet. Maybe everybody&#39;s being very professional about it, but it would be, hey, are you planning to run if leadership opens up, if the answer is yes, I can&#39;t put you in cabinet, I hope you understand, right?</div>

And so it did seem to me that the UCP were better positioned to pull resources in than the NDP were at that particular moment. So that all weighed on the like, geez, I don&#39;t know, man, that seems like I wouldn&#39;t be shocked if the NDP lost it. Now, they didn&#39;t. They won it and they won it by just as much. And that matters because that tells us at the very least, the one data a point we have suggests that Nahid Nenshi can hold the Notley Coalition, which for me was not a given in any way, shape or form. And especially when we throw in all of those other things I&#39;ve talked about, I think that that&#39;s pretty good.
