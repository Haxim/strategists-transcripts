        <p>The gang talk the effect of Trump's tariffs on politics and political actors across Canada.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the Team Canada response to the Trump Tariffs - Trudeau's renaissance, Smith's evolution and Poilievre's bad couple of months. What if Trudeau hadn't announced his resignation? Should Smith's change be embraced or treated with skepticism? And what is the appropriate number of beverages to have in front of you when recording a podcast? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

So the prime minister leaving is a catalyst to us changing our minds about him, because now we can start to remember him the way that we remember Jason Kenney or the way that we remember Stephen Harper. We changed the way that we, or even the way that we now remember George W. Bush, right? We changed the way that we remember them, because in the moment we can&#39;t. There&#39;s been no catalyst for changing the way that we think. I think this is a catalytic moment and the prime minister is taking advantage of it, which I think is good for his long term legacy. But I don&#39;t think that this opportunity would have presented itself in the same fashion if he hadn&#39;t had the moment of I&#39;m leaving first. It&#39;s a lot easier to love someone on the way out the door. Corey</div>

And so in Canada, there&#39;s a comp in 1984 when Trudeau, the senior left he left a pile of like appointments for you know Turner effectively to give and everybody remembers the of a certain age remembers that you had no option moment in the 1984 debate that was about those kinds of appointments those kinds of appointments hit differently when you&#39;re trying to do the switch of the leader because it looks like too much continuity so between the appointments and if you were to use the trappings of the office I think you would just have you</div>
