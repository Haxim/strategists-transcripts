There&#39;s a bit of a poll tax there, so that would be in some ways the equivalent. And then about 100,000 voted and 1 over 80%, I believe.</div>

So that&#39;s true. But if you kind of of run back the clock further and you look at the trajectory, you can see that parties are getting more and more efficient at dragging people into the doors here, at least for these instant leadership contests. And so I don&#39;t think that you say, oh, clearly they&#39;re twice as popular as the Trudeau liberals were in 2013.</div>
