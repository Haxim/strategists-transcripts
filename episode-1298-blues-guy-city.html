          <p>The gang assemble to talk about the Liberals' budget, important updates to the City of Calgary's brand and much, much more.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the 2024 federal budget and the expectation game the Liberals willingly set for themselves. Does the budget tell the story the Liberals want to tell? What happens if the Liberals don't get their heavily-telegraphed 5-point polling bump? And isn't The Strategists an example of a three-man monologue? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

Any building you look at that you&#39;re like, that&#39;s a beautiful old building. There were 30 or 40 years where somebody said, what an eyesore. Why did they build buildings like that? We&#39;re going to tear it down. And that&#39;s true of brands too. And you kind of have to power through the bad brands to get to the truly classic brands. The risk though, is that sometimes they don&#39;t come out the other side and that building still still looks like shit yeah 60 years later right so cities do tend to change them up every 10 years or so and not actually get to that classic space because there&#39;s the fear that they&#39;re just going to carry this dead or damaged brand for way too long and</div>

So I kind of felt like a little bit let down by the budget and the emotion of, you know, this is a super important budget that we&#39;re all going to pay a lot of attention to.

            <div class="said">You know, $52.9 billion more than planned over the next five years in spending. We&#39;re looking at a $40 billion deficit this fiscal year, $8.5 billion on spending in new housing. I want to come back to that number because you in a previous episode talked about what an ambitious housing plan would be, and it wasn&#39;t $8.5 billion. It was hundreds of billions when we talked about our Gen Z and millennial episode. We, of course, have the smaller stuff, but the niche stuff, right? The school food program, a billion bucks, $500 million from youth mental health. and then, of course, the cost to service a growing national debt, about $2 billion more than it was projected just a few months ago, so to speak. And then, of course, we&#39;ve got this capital gains tax, which we&#39;ll talk about in a second. Corey, those were the numbers, but I&#39;m still going back to the same question for you. How did this make you feel as a political strategist knowing what their plan was? They telegraphed it very aggressively through back channels, through leaks in terms of what they were trying to do on the cycle. Did they stick the landing that was the budget.</div>

And so like some of those people who have drifted from the liberals are going to react a little bit harshly to some of this stuff because it reinforces some of the concerns people have about the liberals in terms of, you know, they&#39;re not focusing on the core things. Everything&#39;s about climate, all of that. And you can make the argument. I&#39;m willing to entertain arguments that it&#39;s not bad governance to go and do things incrementally. But that&#39;s not really what this was, was it? This was starting things, starting whole new things rather than incremental improvements to the things that we already have.

And do you feel like the liberals may have done enough, despite the fact that we&#39;re adding quite a bit of analysis to our answers, do you feel like they may have done enough to affect the emotional mood or the sense of action being directionally correct or enough to start chipping away at a very uphill battle that they need to start making gains on?</div>

I think that their communications and their pointy foreheads and their political strategists were kind of geared towards how do we make it feel like we&#39;re doing a bunch of things, probably things Pierre Polyev wouldn&#39;t do, probably things that in isolation tested pretty well. And I feel that they probably spent too much time there in trying to make it sound and feel like action and not enough time trying to answer the question, what is the story all this action tells? And you can&#39;t mistake action for direction. And I do ultimately believe this is a somewhat directionless budget that was designed to feel like a lot of stuff going on. And that&#39;s a bit of a miss when you&#39;re one year out from an election and when you&#39;re down in the polls like this. There&#39;s a certain amount of focus the fuck up that&#39;s required here. If you&#39;re not really going to solve any of these budget problems, why are you tinkering with some of this stuff that you are, right? If you&#39;re not really going to bring in some of these programs, why are you raising them just so that they&#39;ll disappoint people who fall kind of short on them? I don&#39;t know the number is 10 billion, but I do agree with Stephen. If you wanted to take a bit of a critical lens to it, and</div>

Carter, will anything be able to get done? Or Corey, maybe I&#39;ll start with you on this one. Will anything be able to get done in the liberal side of things? Will people actually wanting to be pushing forward to get these five points, helping the PM get the five? Or is everyone&#39;s individual or secondary agenda going to kick into high gear when they know that this is something so explicit, so quantitative put out there, so to speak?

I think a lot of the most serious leadership contenders at this moment, again, my answer would have been different a year ago. They&#39;re just like, you know what, Justin can run it into the next election for us here, right? And so I do think some of the dynamics change the closer you get to an election like this. And when a certain fatalism sets in, you got to keep in mind, they&#39;ve been down in the polls for long enough that they are kind of acknowledging it too, I&#39;m sure, you know, in their dream diaries and in the places where they talk in hushed tones.

You don&#39;t want to be in a position where you get to articulate all the various solutions. You want to be elected leader by November 30th of 2024 and presenting your first budget in March</div>

But again, I&#39;ll go back to what does it even mean to have a 60-day media cycle? It means nothing if it&#39;s not in service of a story that people can walk away with and say, oh, I get it. I get the liberals and I like that. And I just don&#39;t get – I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to get that from this particular thing. There are things in the budget I quite like. There are.
