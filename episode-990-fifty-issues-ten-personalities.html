And one of which that I&#39;d love to discuss with you guys is this campaign, this three-way race, one might call it, between Doug Ford, Andrew Horvath, Stephen Del Duca, PC leader, NDP leader, liberal leader, in that order. It&#39;s been interesting to watch because Doug Ford and the way he behaves. And Carter, I want to start here, which is everyone knew what they were getting with Doug Ford in this election. His, you know, Ford Nation, you know, almost hokey, cliched, cheesy, kind of like, you know, dumbfounded at every turn sort of person. And</span>

Oh, shucks. Oh, hum. Sort of like persona and personality. And we saw it in the debate tonight. But before we go into the specifics of tonight, comments on what you&#39;re seeing and how in the most Doug Ford ways that we&#39;ve seen, he is so impenetrable, Carter. Talk to me about that. And let&#39;s talk about the strategy of how you combat that a bit, because I think it&#39;s really interesting. thing well</span>

Well, Doug Ford is our premier daddy and he&#39;s reading us the same bedtime story. No, you don&#39;t like premier daddy.</span>

He doesn&#39;t have, you know, there&#39;s no passion behind the man. It&#39;s not like Doug Ford, by the way, has this great level of passion. But,</span>

And Ford has a story, the other two don&#39;t. And Horvath, oh, my God. I mean, she doesn&#39;t have any of the elements of story, you know, of story or storytelling. We&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">We&#39;ll get to the debate in a second. What we saw on that stage, Corey, you know, what&#39;s interesting about this race is that the polling has been pretty consistent. If anything, Ford&#39;s lead has grown by a point or two. And the progressive primary that many have been calling between the liberals and the NDP hasn&#39;t really had a clear winner. It&#39;s not like the vote coalescing is happening, at least as related to the polls. But I want to of go back to the same fundamental question I asked Carter, which is how do you defeat a guy that kind of just gets away with it, that just everything rolls off his back and he&#39;s able to do it in this, I wouldn&#39;t even say charismatic, but this ho-hum-oh-shuck sort of way. What do you kind of see happening here? And I want to get into the strategy of how we contend against something like that.</span>

            <span class="text">you&#39;ve got your partisan blinders on. And let me give you analysis from a few provinces over here. He seems fine. He seems like the boss of the company you worked at. That was pretty good, but never going to be a Fortune 500. You didn&#39;t really worry the next paycheck was going to clear or not, but you didn&#39;t fucking think you deserve the Nobel Prize. This is the vibe that Doug Ford carries out here. And I think some of the attacks that they throw at him is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is their passion on these issues and their wonkishness. It hits him and it falls because he&#39;s just not that guy to have that conversation. And to use that boss metaphor again, it&#39;s like if somebody came into his business and said, you could be changing all of these things. You could move your advertising online. You know, you could buy another truck through this lease and it&#39;s cheaper and all of that. And he&#39;s just like, yeah, I know. But like, it&#39;s working. And I don&#39;t really want to mess with</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And this is the energy he brings to all of this.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And boy, I got a lot to say about that debate. But I feel like if I say any more and give any more examples. No,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">No, I&#39;ll let you get in there, Corey. But I really value what you said here with not impressive, not offensive. And I think, Carter, to round this out before we jump into the debate itself, there&#39;s something to be said about our models of leadership that this does question against, right? Because you see the other two parties trying to compete with, well, you&#39;d see that they would argue in a partisan way, that they would say that they&#39;re competing with impressive. I don&#39;t think anyone dispassionately is saying that Del Duc or Horvath aren&#39;t necessarily impressive. But they&#39;re certainly trying to pick up with intellectual, perhaps even earnest, perhaps even more aligned with people&#39;s interests and views. And none of those things, the cocktail of things I just mentioned, Carter, are able to beat this person who&#39;s not offensive, nor very impressive in that sense. And I find that a fascinating case study in what we call, quote unquote, leadership in that sense.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And one of the reasons, I mean, talk about not impressive. I mean, Ralph Klein is a not impressive, was not impressive person. He was. I mean, he was a mess of</span>

          <div class="turn">

And we can can get into that later at some other point, but he, he was a mess and, but he has a couple of really great things going for him. And the great things that he had going for him is that when he made a mistake, he said he was sorry.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And he had his finger on the pulse of who he called Martha and Henry and Martha and Henry were, you know, just the average person getting through life. And I think that Doug Ford really has his fingers on the pulse of those people. I don&#39;t think that, you know, Stephen Del Duca or Andrea Horvath have this sense of, you know, being connected to people, right? I mean, and again, I don&#39;t want to get too far into the debate, but through every piece of it, you just see them as different than you. And there&#39;s a ton of science into us wanting to vote for someone to represent us who is like us. And that like us piece can be a million different different ways. It used to mean, you know, like us, you know, white male, but it also means like us, something we can see in ourselves, because he&#39;s getting elected by more than just white males.

Did you think it was a microcosm of how the NDP and the liberals have been running their race, to Corey&#39;s point here, that they&#39;re taking big swings at anything, which allows Ford to kind of moderate and just keep the bar low? And as long as it isn&#39;t as crazy as they say, he just hops right over it. And in addition to that, it doesn&#39;t center a focal point of your attack, either on an issue or an item, to Corey&#39;s point.

Would you have told him, pick your spots, only swing at those? He&#39;s already started to give some advice in regards to allowing Andrew Horvath to speak and the impression that that would give.

Is there a format of conversation, idea generation, oxygenating the ideas that you&#39;ve liked, that you feel like can both do that, what I&#39;m saying, while simultaneously do what you said earlier, which is meet the voter where they are. Have you found a more healthier or useful form of bringing these ideas forward in your time that you&#39;d like to experiment with?</span>

            <span class="text">What I&#39;d love to do, and I haven&#39;t seen any of this, but what I think we should do with debate eight formats is we should do um so let&#39;s say there&#39;s three liters or four liters up there everybody gets 15 seconds or 20 seconds so we&#39;re going to talk about education now you&#39;ve got 15 seconds do your soundbite okay</span>

So COVID was brought up quite often. And when you look at Doug Ford&#39;s historic lows, or at least the lows of the last year or two years, they happened during the peak of Ford shutting down playgrounds, looking like he had no idea what he was doing with COVID, zigging and zagging. But now with the grace of time, with the grace of forgiveness and people moving on, COVID itself, people are kind of powering through. It&#39;s not the top rated issue. It&#39;s moved significantly lower in the rankings.</span>

And if you were giving advice to the Alberta NDP here, for example, who are going to have to do a similar version of that against Jason Kenney, bottle up that emotional truth that people felt and deploy it at a time where its salience or perhaps its priority in the public&#39;s mind might be less than it was. What advice would you have for them, especially in line with Carter&#39;s framework work that you&#39;re hearing too. Yeah.</span>

I&#39;m still not entirely convinced that&#39;s the big point that that&#39;s going to save the day for them. Uh, a lot of people have noted that affordability was really the, the secret theme of this. It was so funny watching this debate because the way they shoehorned affordability of housing into all of these various answers, like if there was a drinking game, I would not be able to record tonight. Horvath managed to turn knee surgery into a conversation about housing. Schreiner turned COVID-19 into housing. Ford turned education into learning how to look at a mortgage into housing. I mean, just really fucking wild shit here because they can all read the polls and they can all see affordability is super high. They can all see the idea of affordability of housing in particular has become a major pain point in Ontario. And maybe there&#39;s a way to take some of those micro issues and even the matter around the playground and tell that story. And I haven&#39;t, it&#39;s, let&#39;s call it half-baked at this point. But what if you said, like, let&#39;s take that binder thing too. Let&#39;s take all this fucking shit off the shelf here. the</span>

I&#39;m just noting that they seem to think it&#39;s the issue based on the way they keep trying to pull people back to it. And if that&#39;s the case, then there are ways to tell that story using the other pieces that are out there without feeling so scattered and without feeling like you don&#39;t actually have a way to tell a cohesive story here. And storytelling is like the challenge in politics. Carter says this, I say this. Every presentation is a story. Every campaign is a story.</span>
