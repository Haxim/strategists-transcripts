          <p>The gang decides it's time to dig into the Ontario election and Stephen Carter decides its time to pick fights with Ontario political podcasts. Topics include: message discipline (or lack thereof), controlling your brand (or failing to do so), debate moderation (and the ignoring of the same) as well as storytelling in politics and why sometimes - usually, in fact - the biggest tactical mistake you can make is hating your opponent. PLUS: how to make everything about housing.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter watch the TVO Ontario leader's debate so you don't have to. What's our take on the state of the Ontario provincial election? Are the Liberals and NDP strategically misfiring? And what does it reveal about Stephen that he was so quick to assume David Herle was talking about him? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

What we saw on that stage, Corey, you know, what&#39;s interesting about this race is that the polling has been pretty consistent. If anything, Ford&#39;s lead has grown by a point or two. And the progressive primary that many have been calling between the liberals and the NDP hasn&#39;t really had a clear winner. It&#39;s not like the vote coalescing is happening, at least as related to the polls. But I want to of go back to the same fundamental question I asked Carter, which is how do you defeat a guy that kind of just gets away with it, that just everything rolls off his back and he&#39;s able to do it in this, I wouldn&#39;t even say charismatic, but this ho-hum-oh-shuck sort of way. What do you kind of see happening here? And I want to get into the strategy of how we contend against something like that.</div>

And I think, Carter, to round this out before we jump into the debate itself, there&#39;s something to be said about our models of leadership that this does question against, right? Because you see the other two parties trying to compete with, well, you&#39;d see that they would argue in a partisan way, that they would say that they&#39;re competing with impressive. I don&#39;t think anyone dispassionately is saying that Del Duc or Horvath aren&#39;t necessarily impressive. But they&#39;re certainly trying to pick up with intellectual, perhaps even earnest, perhaps even more aligned with people&#39;s interests and views. And none of those things, the cocktail of things I just mentioned, Carter, are able to beat this person who&#39;s not offensive, nor very impressive in that sense. And I find that a fascinating case study in what we call, quote unquote, leadership in that sense.</div>

Or are you just like accepting it and you&#39;re like, this is what it is, you know, that Ford can win while contradicting himself in a statement with the less intellectualized or perhaps well thought out answer over people who obsessed over this education system, for example, let&#39;s choose education. And he could still, he could still come out ahead. Like, does that frustrate you? Or do you, are you just one of those folks? It&#39;s like, learn the game folks. That&#39;s what it is.</div>

Uh, a lot of people have noted that affordability was really the, the secret theme of this. It was so funny watching this debate because the way they shoehorned affordability of housing into all of these various answers, like if there was a drinking game, I would not be able to record tonight. Horvath managed to turn knee surgery into a conversation about housing. Schreiner turned COVID-19 into housing. Ford turned education into learning how to look at a mortgage into housing. I mean, just really fucking wild shit here because they can all read the polls and they can all see affordability is super high. They can all see the idea of affordability of housing in particular has become a major pain point in Ontario. And maybe there&#39;s a way to take some of those micro issues and even the matter around the playground and tell that story. And I haven&#39;t, it&#39;s, let&#39;s call it half-baked at this point.
