<meta name="description" content="For this Easter Monday edition of the podcast we dive deep into political process stories - why they can work, how they can be a distraction - and specifically their utility in the Conservative Party of Canada leadership race for one Mayor Patrick Brown. Plus, Zain drags the gang back to their &#34;political rules for Covid-19&#34; that Stephen and Corey set in January. Do they still hold? Or do they need a light dusting or deep clean? All this, plus the return of the fourth strategist, the sound board.Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use the Patrick Brown campaign as a launching off point to talk about political process stories, as well as revisit their &#34;political rules for Covid-19&#34; in the light of the sixth wave. Do process stories add from campaigns or detract from them? Is &#34;don&#39;t turn off your brain&#34; still good Covid-19 management advice? And if nobody shows up at the May 19th live show in Edmonton, will Corey and Zain blame Carter&#39;s ad read? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.If you&#39;re reading this before April 21, you can also watch the live feed of the recording. It&#39;s exactly what it sounds like: Corey is overdressed, Zain is underdressed, Carter has a camera angle that betrays his advanced age. But does it work? Oh, you bet.">

            <span class="text">Patrick Brown is in the media with a process piece about his campaign. It&#39;s about how he is reaching out to multiple communities, many of them South Asian. The article written by the Canadian press talks about a glimpse into his strategy can be found, I&#39;m quoting here, in the video shared on his Facebook page that those who attend such events, including a meeting that Brown had with the Muslim community, the Tamil community, the Sikh community, the Nepalese community. It really digs deep into his, what I&#39;d say, South Asian and religious community outreach, cultural community outreach. Carter, I want to talk about that, which is a sensitive concept in politics. We even have it being called sensitive for what it&#39;s called. Is it multicultural? Is it cultural? Is it South Asian? Is it religious groups? But this outreach that Patrick Brown, I shouldn&#39;t say specializes But let&#39;s just say in the past has shown a tremendous ability to move certain communities and at least reach certain communities. I want to talk about that. But I also want to talk, Carter, about the concept of a process piece in the media, what that is, how it gets into the media. So before we talk about Patrick Brown in particular, do you mind defining, because I saw you smile there, Carter, what a process piece is? And do you feel like something like this qualifies as one in your estimation?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. This is a process piece. This is the very definition of a process piece. Imagine that the media has a diet of only two things, vegetables and candy, right? So policy is vegetables. The media don&#39;t want to cover policy at all. They don&#39;t like eating vegetables. They find vegetables are a little, you know, they don&#39;t taste as good. If you had the choice between eating vegetables or eating candy, you would always choose candy. Well, candy in this case is process stories. Process stories have very little to do with anything except the behind the scenes glances. And so, you know, in the Nenshi campaign in 2010, we ran a process story, a number of process stories around how we use social media, how we were using an app, how we were the first campaign to really dig in and how important Facebook was. All of these things are process stories, and they generated dozens</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and that has to do with a couple of things and human interest is one of them and people love a bit of behind the scenes in the sense that they&#39;re getting some inside information that they wouldn&#39;t get if they were just reading the policy briefings and yeah the media loves process stories and you tend to get process stories in the valleys when there&#39;s not a lot There&#39;s not a lot of actual policy news. There&#39;s not a lot of actual substantive news. I would define process story a little bit more narrowly than Stephen. Like I wouldn&#39;t call a brick through the window of the Nenshi campaign a process story. I</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I would say a process story would be more, you know, the reaction, like what happened behind the scenes when all of a sudden, you know, Stephen Carter gets the call at 1am and, you know, he&#39;s in a dark alley disposing of brick remnants and his gloves.</span>

            <span class="text">this is the story about how the campaign reacts, how it goes into crisis mode, how it builds itself, how it spins itself out. Similarly, after the Nenshi campaign, there were a lot of stories about how Nahed Nenshi went from nowhere to victory. And those are process stories. And so what Patrick Brown has managed to spin out into the media here is a story about how he&#39;s active in a lot of, you know, cultural communities. And I would say generally any strong community is an opportunity for politicking, right? Churches are an opportunity to sell memberships, you know, tight cultural communities, an opportunity to sell memberships, anything like that. So I think it&#39;s funny that politicians tie themselves in knots on this. And, and I think it&#39;s kind of gross how they always default to ethnic community as the default, because really, they&#39;re just talking about a group based outreach thing. But what</span>

You watch these videos, the headline on certain publications, because it is, of course, syndicated, says, if you show up, I win, which is a quote that he&#39;s ultimately been making to these groups. What do you think he&#39;s trying to do here? And perhaps even broader, do you feel like this is untapped potential that if you are are a pure polyamory. Do you care about what he&#39;s trying to do here? Are you just sticking to your lane?

            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think it necessarily generates fear. I mean, I think that the problem with this type of campaign is it can exist underground. It&#39;s hard to see these types of campaigns. We broadened it out. I mean, you can call it a community campaign. No one calls it like an ethnic campaign anymore. You know, like it&#39;s it&#39;s a community campaign or the language that I like to use is social networks. So you&#39;re trying to find people with strong social networks. That&#39;s what Corey was alluding to. And you can go and find them with hockey teams, children&#39;s soccer teams, you know, like there&#39;s any, any place that you have a group of friends, a book club, that&#39;s a social network, but there happens to be social networks that exist, um, in,</span>

And, you know, you&#39;re nuts not to take advantage of finding those places because they do like having input. Like, I think there&#39;s a lot of audiences that have walked away from the political process. There&#39;s</span>

            <span class="text">There&#39;s a lot of people that have walked away from being involved in a leadership campaign. And it does avail the opportunity for recent immigrants or women have been extremely powerful in leadership campaigns. And if I were Pierre Pellievre, I would look at Pierre&#39;s audience and I&#39;d say that really he&#39;s opened up two very distinct audiences that can come after him. Three if you count Quebec, which</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">which I probably should have. But the first one is, is this broader ethnic community, which is huge, uh, where Patrick Brown, um, you know, lives and where he kind of comes from. Um, and it&#39;s huge in, in the lower mainland of British Columbia. It&#39;s huge in Calgary. It&#39;s huge in Edmonton, huge across the country, big, big opportunity. And the second is there&#39;s no women. Um,</span>

And then there&#39;s a, there&#39;s a tremendous number of young, uh, white people as well, but we&#39;ve all made comments about the relative, uh, similarity and skin tone at the, uh, Pierre Polyev events.

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Carter, what I assume you mean by that is this work can be done silently, that the ground war and the ground game doesn&#39;t need a spotlight on it, that it can just happen, that the competition can be surprised on a week by week or month by month basis as to the new members that are joining and said, holy shit, that&#39;s not us. unless someone&#39;s doing that. And that&#39;s probably Patrick Brown.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, why do you think they came to extend Grant Carter&#39;s analogy above ground? Why do you think they implemented and strategically decided to insert a process story or kind of went along with it? Give me your take on that. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think the main, there&#39;s two reasons. One&#39;s offensive and one&#39;s defensive, right? Offensively, they wanted to stop this narrative that, you know, Pierre Poliev&#39;s already won. it&#39;s done it&#39;s over you know move on to the next thing because that would be just demoralizing and attack the overall enthusiasm for the conservative contest overall right by making it seem not like a contest which hurts all of the candidates who are not here the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the second is defensive though it&#39;s because patrick brown has not necessarily proven himself to be a credible candidate now he&#39;s working the angles he&#39;s talking to a lot of people there&#39;s a lot of podcasts going on right now Now, there&#39;s a lot of guests on those podcasts, on those talking head shows on CBC and CTV saying, watch this guy. He&#39;s a sleeper candidate. He&#39;s out there hustling. He&#39;s selling memberships. Don&#39;t forget how we won the Ontario PC leadership in the first place. This is all now in the zeitgeist, and he&#39;s strengthening that. So he wants people to think of himself as a credible candidate as well. So those are the two big reasons to do it. But Carter really said the magic word in the middle of his, or at the end of his thing there when he talked about viability</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right he wants to seem like a viable candidate and both that offensive and defensive approach speak to viability the viability of both candidacy against pierre polliev generally and that of patrick brown specifically and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and it&#39;s an important point because people do generally just discount non-viable alternatives whenever i do a poll in an election you guys will know this because you worked with me avi right accessibility Accessibility, viability, intent, intent, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Accessibility, who would you consider voting for viability? Who do you think has a chance? Because that tells you where they&#39;re going to vote when push comes to shove, right? Because they they ultimately don&#39;t want to waste their vote. They don&#39;t want to waste their efforts, if they&#39;re a volunteer, and then intent, who are you planning to vote for? And intent is last, because in some ways, it&#39;s the least important. If you have accessibility and viability, you&#39;ve got a campaign, right?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I build on that? Jump in here. Jump in here. Yeah, yeah. Do it. Do it. Because what I&#39;d love to see with Pierre Polyev&#39;s numbers, right? I would love to see those who are aware of his name, but have no intention of voting for him. The ones that are kind of unavailable to him. Because I suspect there are large pockets of people who are available to him, and we are seeing them come out. But we have not seen any numbers that say who&#39;s not available to And I suspect that he&#39;s got near 100 percent name recognition within the party itself. And, you know, some big chunk of that will never vote for him. And that&#39;s the group that you&#39;re really interested in seeing. Can they can they vote? Because it&#39;s that plus new that equals victory. Right. And so it&#39;s I often say to people, all campaigns are about math and no one wants to do the math on these things. But what Corey is describing can actually be written. Why do you say no one</span>

So if you&#39;ve got 87 ridings in a province, that dictates a type of structural math. math. If you do a popular vote mayoral, that dictates a strategic math. If you do a popular vote councillor with four strong candidates, that dictates a type of math. This math is all different.

But I would say this, it&#39;s not so much that people are afraid of the math and the way people don&#39;t like to do their taxes or open up Excel ever, right?

You get the riding profiles. You build it up from FSAs, maybe. That&#39;s the postal areas.

And the reason I put it out there, there are some, I&#39;d say, stereotypical assumptions, especially related to cultural communities around, if you just hit that one person, trust me, they&#39;ll bring everyone else on board. How many times have you heard that shit? So when I say limits of the network effect, talk to me about limits of the network effect effect from an organizing perspective, but also from your experience as a, as a campaigner and what you need to do to ensure that if that is indeed your strategy, decentralized, have people fan out and organize that you&#39;re not caught up in, uh, in, in some mirage of, uh, of, of support that you, that you may not ultimately have.</span>

The first one was for politicians to follow. If you haven&#39;t listened to that episode, I believe mid-January, we put out a guide for here&#39;s what politicians need to look at as key principles as related to how to manage COVID going forward. Number one, don&#39;t go too far off the center path. Always acknowledge where that center is. It&#39;s always going to be shifting. It&#39;s clear right now that that center path of where people&#39;s appetite and comfort is has clearly shifted. Number two, don&#39;t turn off your brain.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s not the metric you need to focus on. I think as a society and culturally, we&#39;ve maybe moved on beyond that, although there is a few groups and a few organizations, political and otherwise, that are still using that as a key metric.</span>

When we record in January, it was a slow bird to try to get to some other topics. But those are all part of what people are considering. And number five, this almost seems a little... Number six, I should say, don&#39;t indulge the unvaccinated. Understand that we live together now, that they are our neighbors, our friends, our family, but don&#39;t indulge them so aggressively as to let them dictate where you go.</span>

Other cities in our country, and if not the world, now a conversation of reintroducing masking. And shutdowns and lockdowns are happening in other parts of the world right now. So I want to kind of reintroduce this one pager and see, hey, what are you keeping? What are you tweaking? Corey, let me start with you. Let me end with that simple frame. What are you keeping?

Yeah, like don&#39;t turn off your brain remains good advice. But at the time it was meant to be don&#39;t autopilot on what was working before. Correct. That remains true, but now almost in the opposite direction. So yeah, we had a lighter go with Omicron than some feared. It wasn&#39;t as bad as the Delta wave.</span>

            <span class="text">You know, their cost of living under the UCP government has skyrocketed in part because of inflation, in part because of the end of COVID, but in part because they let it skyrocket Because things that we didn&#39;t notice, like our electricity rates, like our natural gas rates, like our insurance rates, those things that we didn&#39;t notice, that we didn&#39;t blame the government for, all went up and we gave the government a free pass. So the billion dollars is overrated. No one understands what that means. Underrated, the amount of extra money that we&#39;re paying as individuals, as families, that adds up and that is noticeable.</span>

Thanks very much for listening to the podcast. See you at the live show, Edmonton, May the 19th.</span>
