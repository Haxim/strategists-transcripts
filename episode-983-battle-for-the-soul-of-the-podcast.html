      <h1>Episode 983: Battle for the soul of the podcast</h1>

      <div class="desc">
        <p>For this Easter Monday edition of the podcast we dive deep into political process stories - why they can work, how they can be a distraction - and specifically their utility in the Conservative Party of Canada leadership race for one Mayor Patrick Brown. Plus, Zain drags the gang back to their "political rules for Covid-19" that Stephen and Corey set in January. Do they still hold? Or do they need a light dusting or deep clean? All this, plus the return of the fourth strategist, the sound board.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter use the Patrick Brown campaign as a launching off point to talk about political process stories, as well as revisit their "political rules for Covid-19" in the light of the sixth wave. Do process stories add from campaigns or detract from them? Is "don't turn off your brain" still good Covid-19 management advice? And if nobody shows up at the </em><em><a href="http://www.thestrategistslive.com" target="_blank">May 19th live show in Edmonton</a></em><em>, will Corey and Zain blame Carter's ad read? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote><p>If you're reading this before April 21, you can also <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/65303607">watch the live feed of the recording</a>. It's exactly what it sounds like: Corey is overdressed, Zain is underdressed, Carter has a camera angle that betrays his advanced age. But does it work? Oh, you bet.</p>

          <div class="said">Patrick Brown is in the media with a process piece about his campaign. It&#39;s about how he is reaching out to multiple communities, many of them South Asian. The article written by the Canadian press talks about a glimpse into his strategy can be found, I&#39;m quoting here, in the video shared on his Facebook page that those who attend such events, including a meeting that Brown had with the Muslim community, the Tamil community, the Sikh community, the Nepalese community. It really digs deep into his, what I&#39;d say, South Asian and religious community outreach, cultural community outreach. Carter, I want to talk about that, which is a sensitive concept in politics. We even have it being called sensitive for what it&#39;s called. Is it multicultural? Is it cultural? Is it South Asian? Is it religious groups? But this outreach that Patrick Brown, I shouldn&#39;t say specializes But let&#39;s just say in the past has shown a tremendous ability to move certain communities and at least reach certain communities. I want to talk about that. But I also want to talk, Carter, about the concept of a process piece in the media, what that is, how it gets into the media. So before we talk about Patrick Brown in particular, do you mind defining, because I saw you smile there, Carter, what a process piece is? And do you feel like something like this qualifies as one in your estimation?</div>

          <div class="said">Absolutely. This is a process piece. This is the very definition of a process piece. Imagine that the media has a diet of only two things, vegetables and candy, right? So policy is vegetables. The media don&#39;t want to cover policy at all. They don&#39;t like eating vegetables. They find vegetables are a little, you know, they don&#39;t taste as good. If you had the choice between eating vegetables or eating candy, you would always choose candy. Well, candy in this case is process stories. Process stories have very little to do with anything except the behind the scenes glances. And so, you know, in the Nenshi campaign in 2010, we ran a process story, a number of process stories around how we use social media, how we were using an app, how we were the first campaign to really dig in and how important Facebook was. All of these things are process stories, and they generated dozens</div>

There&#39;s not a lot of actual substantive news. I would define process story a little bit more narrowly than Stephen.

          <div class="said">this is the story about how the campaign reacts, how it goes into crisis mode, how it builds itself, how it spins itself out. Similarly, after the Nenshi campaign, there were a lot of stories about how Nahed Nenshi went from nowhere to victory. And those are process stories. And so what Patrick Brown has managed to spin out into the media here is a story about how he&#39;s active in a lot of, you know, cultural communities. And I would say generally any strong community is an opportunity for politicking, right? Churches are an opportunity to sell memberships, you know, tight cultural communities, an opportunity to sell memberships, anything like that. So I think it&#39;s funny that politicians tie themselves in knots on this. And, and I think it&#39;s kind of gross how they always default to ethnic community as the default, because really, they&#39;re just talking about a group based outreach thing. But what</div>

You know, like it&#39;s it&#39;s a community campaign or the language that I like to use is social networks. So you&#39;re trying to find people with strong social networks.

Offensively, they wanted to stop this narrative that, you know, Pierre Poliev&#39;s already won. it&#39;s done it&#39;s over you know move on to the next thing because that would be just demoralizing and attack the overall enthusiasm for the conservative contest overall right by making it seem not like a contest which hurts all of the candidates who are not here the</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">the second is defensive though it&#39;s because patrick brown has not necessarily proven himself to be a credible candidate now he&#39;s working the angles he&#39;s talking to a lot of people there&#39;s a lot of podcasts going on right now Now, there&#39;s a lot of guests on those podcasts, on those talking head shows on CBC and CTV saying, watch this guy. He&#39;s a sleeper candidate. He&#39;s out there hustling. He&#39;s selling memberships. Don&#39;t forget how we won the Ontario PC leadership in the first place. This is all now in the zeitgeist, and he&#39;s strengthening that. So he wants people to think of himself as a credible candidate as well. So those are the two big reasons to do it. But Carter really said the magic word in the middle of his, or at the end of his thing there when he talked about viability</div>

I would love to see those who are aware of his name, but have no intention of voting for him. The ones that are kind of unavailable to him. Because I suspect there are large pockets of people who are available to him, and we are seeing them come out. But we have not seen any numbers that say who&#39;s not available to And I suspect that he&#39;s got near 100 percent name recognition within the party itself. And, you know, some big chunk of that will never vote for him. And that&#39;s the group that you&#39;re really interested in seeing. Can they can they vote? Because it&#39;s that plus new that equals victory. Right. And so it&#39;s I often say to people, all campaigns are about math and no one wants to do the math on these things.

If you do a popular vote councillor with four strong candidates, that dictates a type of math. This math is all different.

How many times have you heard that shit? So when I say limits of the network effect, talk to me about limits of the network effect effect from an organizing perspective, but also from your experience as a, as a campaigner and what you need to do to ensure that if that is indeed your strategy, decentralized, have people fan out and organize that you&#39;re not caught up in, uh, in, in some mirage of, uh, of, of support that you, that you may not ultimately have.</div>

The first one was for politicians to follow. If you haven&#39;t listened to that episode, I believe mid-January, we put out a guide for here&#39;s what politicians need to look at as key principles as related to how to manage COVID going forward. Number one, don&#39;t go too far off the center path. Always acknowledge where that center is. It&#39;s always going to be shifting. It&#39;s clear right now that that center path of where people&#39;s appetite and comfort is has clearly shifted. Number two, don&#39;t turn off your brain.</div>

When we record in January, it was a slow bird to try to get to some other topics. But those are all part of what people are considering. And number five, this almost seems a little... Number six, I should say, don&#39;t indulge the unvaccinated. Understand that we live together now, that they are our neighbors, our friends, our family, but don&#39;t indulge them so aggressively as to let them dictate where you go.</div>

Other cities in our country, and if not the world, now a conversation of reintroducing masking. And shutdowns and lockdowns are happening in other parts of the world right now.

Yeah, like don&#39;t turn off your brain remains good advice. But at the time it was meant to be don&#39;t autopilot on what was working before. Correct. That remains true, but now almost in the opposite direction. So yeah, we had a lighter go with Omicron than some feared. It wasn&#39;t as bad as the Delta wave.</div>
