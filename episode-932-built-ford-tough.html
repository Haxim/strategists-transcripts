Let&#39;s move it on to our first segment. Fridays are for taking out the trash and Saturdays are for bringing the trash back into your house.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Oh man, I don&#39;t even know where to start here. As Ontario Premier Doug Ford sat down on Friday afternoon&#39;s news conference to extend the province&#39;s COVID-19 measures, social media feeds erupted with posts from around the province, from around the country, uniformly expressing outrage. I&#39;m reading a piece here Here is an intro from the Washington Post, which is arguing that because of this disastrous Friday press conference and Saturday walkback that Doug Ford should resign. But let me add some of the details. Ford opened by blaming the federal government for not providing the province with sufficient vaccine supply, despite the fact that Ontario currently has still a million doses to yet to be administered, abdicating his responsibility for a pandemic that was never going to be solved immediately by vaccines. scenes. He moved on to make the absurd claim that Ontario had the toughest measures in North America, which it did not. He then added a couple of other items. He indicated that outdoor recreation in terms of playgrounds would now be closed. He also announced that the government was empowering the police in Ontario to arbitrarily stop anyone who&#39;s outside their residence during the province&#39;s lockdown, giving law enforcement extraordinary powers to threaten civil rights. Of course, this was certainly walked back by the government, but certainly was fought by several police forces in Ottawa, Waterloo, Peterborough, ensued, followed by Toronto and Hamilton. And then he also refused to do a few things that many people expected him to, a curfew, delaying and telling the Trudeau government to please fuck off with their offer for the Red Cross support, and also Also, not installing as many advocates that asked for anything related to paid sick days. Have I missed anything? This was a lot that they kind of threw out on a Friday afternoon and then walked back a ton of. Corey, you&#39;ve got your hand up. You want to jump in with some context before we jump into analysis?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Closing the border with Manitoba, Quebec. Did you mention</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">mention that as well? I did not, no. So that was also part of the list of things that they announced.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, anything I missed?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">no i mean you&#39;ve done a very exhaustive list but what you&#39;ve already done with the exhaustive list is something that doug ford did to me with the exhaustive list i got confused there&#39;s so much to hear so much change so much going on that it became you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know we need these short forms of what it is that we&#39;re doing that&#39;s why the the lockdown terminology has become so powerful right the short form language is what we&#39;re all listening to that long litany of of things that are is happening and and not happening, and happening, and not happening, it&#39;s very, very confusing. And that&#39;s been my foundational takeaway,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">all of this needs to be wrapped up in better communications. Because, you know, there&#39;s no question Ontario&#39;s on fire. There&#39;s a massive problem. And now, so is Alberta, per capita. But I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get there. All of these actions that he&#39;s taken, um you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s a bit like the closing the barn door when the horse is left right like this is it we are already a massive problem and this is what i i see with both uh kenny and ford is both of them are looking at the problem uh hoping that it&#39;s going to go away through the vaccination and not realizing that the problem was three four weeks ago um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um that&#39;s where we really ran into the problem and and not addressing it then is what&#39;s put us in the in the bad spot today</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, why do you think social media erupted on Friday? Why do you think this was met with such, I can&#39;t call it universal, but the closest thing I&#39;ve seen in a long time to universal disdain. We&#39;ve seen a version of that here in Alberta. But why do you think this was met with such hostility from the residents of Ontario, certainly, but by Canadians writ large?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">think it was a combination of the elements that you described there. there. Effectively, what Doug Ford did in his announcement was create a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a coalition of everybody against the announcement that he made. So you&#39;ve got this underlying, why didn&#39;t you do anything sooner, Doug, cohort, and then you have people who would really not be very enthused with the police getting new arbitrary powers. And then you have outdoor recreation, which is one of the very few release valves you have if you live in a city like Toronto, where everything is is largely closed as it as it is and it just became too much and it didn&#39;t seem justifiable relative to um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">other provinces were doing the moment maybe it is maybe it isn&#39;t one of the interesting things for me is if this was the right thing to do what</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i you know it the fact that he did walk it back so rapidly really does It does suggest it was more of a failed communications exercise than a true public health exercise, because ultimately, when people decided they didn&#39;t like it, he decided he didn&#39;t like it. And that&#39;s not what you would expect to see if it was truly rooted in public health concerns. Saying the other thing I want to say before I throw it back to you is the</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">announcement from the public health officials and the announcement from Doug Ford, they didn&#39;t occur at the same time. They don&#39;t there, right? And they&#39;re</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they&#39;re just so different. They were so different. It was hard to sort of reconcile the two exercises and say, this is in response to what we just heard from the doctors. And so that also was a problem for Doug Ford.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you make some good points cory and carter i want to ask you a very simple question that perhaps is a complicated answer maybe it doesn&#39;t actually was was that was this a no-win announcement like as soon as doug ford sat in front of that podium on friday was there anything he could have said that would have been politically strategic politically sound uh or was this just a moment where he had too many factions against whatever action he would take that this was an l before before the game was even played on Friday afternoon.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">You know, it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;ve been thinking about this quite a bit. Much of the polling has been on this idea, are you happy with your province&#39;s restrictions or not happy with them, right? And it&#39;s almost 50-50. And I think that each group looks at the not happy group and says, well, really that not happy group is reflecting a group that&#39;s not happy because the restrictions go too far, or they&#39;re not happy because the restrictions don&#39;t go far enough. and really the not happy group is is both right and there&#39;s a percentage of inside</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">inside of both of them and much of the polling hasn&#39;t really gotten into that reasoning and rationale so</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">so i i think that you&#39;re you&#39;re we really aren&#39;t a damned if you do damned if we don&#39;t situation right now that the protests are ramping up the the people&#39;s anger about curfews the anger about uh about the the quote-unquote lockdowns that&#39;s legit the mask uh fear</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">fear uh you know the the amount of stuff that&#39;s going around is is significant at this point and plus the vaccine hesitancy all of this is layering on top of one another and we&#39;re seeing just a model where people uh people aren&#39;t happy and it doesn&#39;t matter what the province is going to do it&#39;s going to be received poorly uh which is why one of the reasons that i think you just need to do things in the best you know in the the best interest scientifically, to actually managing this pandemic.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">reason I ask that in the thrust of my question was because there was so much as Carter alluded to in the first part of his response, what pundits and social media and others picked up on were a couple of the outliers or the couple of the most egregious claims, right? Right. The the carding. Right. It became it became carding right away. Right. Like it wasn&#39;t, hey, expanded powers for the police to arbitrarily stop. He was like, nope, this is carding. And it became look at this guy. He wants to shut down our playgrounds. And so the reason I ask you if this was that same crime, it almost led to a similar conclusion where people just picked certain things out and said, look at that fucking insane shit this guy wants to do on a Friday afternoon.

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that is now showing up in the communications efforts of the Doug Ford government. If this didn&#39;t need to be done, if they didn&#39;t believe this would actually make a material difference, then they shouldn&#39;t have done it. But that is not actually a communications problem. It&#39;s not actually the communicator&#39;s job to step in and veto the policies that have come out of the legal experts and the public health experts. It&#39;s their jobs to package them in a way that people can understand what we mean when we talk about those things. And this arbitrary police stopping was a really interesting one for me because of the way the police bit back, which I generally didn&#39;t love.</span>

I just don&#39;t like the idea that police are going to decide what laws they&#39;re going to enforce and not enforce. So in my opinion, there were two appropriate ways for that to have been dealt with. One is the police literally said, this is an unlawful request. We cannot follow this request. Not the, we&#39;ve decided not to because we care about our community too much. That&#39;s bullshit. You don&#39;t actually get to make that decision. The other way it could have been done is if the councils, if the civil representatives who oversee them said, you&#39;re not going to do this.

            <span class="text">Carter, I have to ask you the same question now that we&#39;ve opened up the bracket on policing. Let&#39;s get to that in a second. But before that, I want to give you the same opportunity to add to or add to any sort of communication sins you&#39;ve seen Doug Ford make with what Friday was. What lessons should politicians learn from those communication sins? That same question version of that I posed to Corey. And then let&#39;s talk about the bracket that Corey opened on policing in their response thereafter?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">think that any time politicians take a big swing at something, and it&#39;s got a long list of things, people are going to grab onto the weakest link within that list. So the weak link, the policing, I&#39;ll just pick up on policing because it&#39;s so easy to pick up on. And I want to go a little bit further than what Corey was talking about, too, because he&#39;s entirely right. The way that the police did this is particularly bad. But those weak links become really problematic. So the weak link of, you know, not being able to go to a playground with your kids, that is a weak link in the communication structure. It is hard to justify. It was easier to justify the first time we did it when we thought that this was passed by touching things. It is much harder to justify now that we kind of know that COVID&#39;s more aerosol.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So how we push this communication out with all of these weak links in it is the problem. So if you if you&#39;re going to put forward a list, you got to really make sure that each one of those things is bulletproof, because it&#39;s the bulletproof nature of it that enables you to to carry the day. Each piece should be justifiable. And the problem with Ford&#39;s communication on Friday and why he was back in front of the cameras on Saturday is that there were so many weak links and they were so easy to pick up on things like like the carding, which, of course, especially</span>

Let me take that a little bit further. let&#39;s move away from this carding piece and let&#39;s talk a little bit about all the anti-mask protests right the the challenge that we are seeing uh you know when when i&#39;m still able to get my my ticket for not having a registration still a little bitter i&#39;ll be okay but the you know i still get that ticket but at the exact same time there&#39;s or the next day there is a uh a massive rally downtown breaking the law and i see no tickets being handed out i don&#39;t see any um enforcement of the rules it it makes me angry it begs the question what what&#39;s special about that group do the police agree with that group and they just don&#39;t agree with me did they did they ticket me because i drive a certain type of car you</span>

            <span class="text">when you think about the power that the police decided not to use here, that these police forces say, you know, Hamilton police, I think, and then the Toronto police after, you might have liked that the police decided not to use this power. But imagine if the police had thrown out a tweet that said, community is important, so we aren&#39;t going to shut down restaurants that stay open. Would you still be cheering them on? I mean, these decisions have to be made by civilian oversight, and the application of police authority should not be arbitrary, certainly not at the policy level. And so that&#39;s the difference, I think, between the mask protest and this particular thing is a statement was made by the police force that we are not going to, the police are always going to need to use discretion in their jobs to an extent. If I get involved here, I might make make the situation worse. I&#39;ve got to consider the bigger thing at the moment. But the idea that you would put out as a matter of policy in an online setting, we are just not going to do this. That is what I find particularly problematic.</span>

Let&#39;s say you were in that Ford Premier&#39;s office, and you got a call from the boss saying, holy shit, we did not expect this to, at least I didn&#39;t, Stephen, expect this to land like it has tonight. Do I have to walk this back? Would your answer have have been yes?

And that&#39;s where I think I would have stuck to my guns in terms of the of the cops. I would have said, well, that&#39;s not their decision to make. I know that individual officers will will know that they&#39;ve got a role in upholding the law. I&#39;m very disappointed that some social media manager at Hamilton police would take it upon themselves, or I would try to minimize what was put out there. And I would say like, what a crock of shit. And then I would say, because responsible law enforcement officers know that just having this power in our tool belt will make people think twice and will keep the people of Ontario safe. It&#39;s not our intention that everybody gets stopped on the street. But if we see 10 cars on one block that are all going to one, you know, party, then obviously, that&#39;s</span>

What do you think of politicians when they have to make these tough statements and these decisions to revert to Twitter always? It just seems like this very convenient, like, let&#39;s just put out this 140 characters. Like, people will see it. They&#39;ll get it. but when your whole mantra is like tough guy communicating of the people like salt of the earth sort of person it just seems like a weird escape hatch many times like i i cared less about what he said but the way that like dude you introduced this like as tough guy to your point cory with like absolute statements at the beginning of your press conference on friday and then a whimpering fucking tweet on saturday like i don&#39;t know if i love it so a question to you on both medium and message um for your thoughts yeah</span>

            <span class="text">yeah i mean obviously and there&#39;s not a graceful way to climb down in a situation like that where as we&#39;ve both said literally making absolute statements one day walking them back the next day that&#39;s that&#39;s never going to look graceful and the reason why this is an approach that&#39;s taken is that it&#39;s a statement but it&#39;s even shorter because if you send out a written statement and it&#39;s 280 characters or less it It looks like a very unsubstantive statement.</span>

I wish I hadn&#39;t been so absolute. I wish I had canvassed more. But you know, we are in a moment where we&#39;re dealing with live ammo. And I&#39;m trying to keep this on the rails. And Ontario, this is not on the rails. There are people who are going to die if we don&#39;t start moving more aggressively towards locking this thing down. Now, I will answer any question on this matter, and I would get used to saying, yeah, I was wrong.

He&#39;s been on a very cordial phone call with the prime minister, now accepting health care workers and rapid tests from the federal government.

It&#39;s all of the moments that led up to that. And people People just write you off. They just think, well, because Doug Ford did it, it sucks. And then where do you go from there? Don&#39;t forget, he wasn&#39;t very popular pre-COVID. COVID provided a bit of a renaissance for him because he&#39;s tough, because he&#39;s compassionate.

Guys, the stage is set, arguably, for the most important federal budget in recent memory. the Liberal government prepares to unveil its plan for Canada&#39;s post-pandemic recovery amidst this escalating third wave. We can talk expectations, and we will. We can talk what we might want to see in it, and we will. We can talk about communication strategy, and we will. But I have got two questions up front.

            <span class="text">i certainly expect when we talk about poison pills in a general sense it&#39;s something something that would be absolutely unappealing to one side. And that&#39;s the sense. Like, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that will be political poison for the liberals. They&#39;ll put something in that the other parties can&#39;t support, perhaps.</span>

It&#39;ll be something that the NDP will have a very difficult time supporting, but the conservatives could get on board with, coupled with something that the conservatives will find impossible to support, that the NDP might be able to get on board with, plus the Greens, plus the bloc. Let&#39;s not forget there&#39;s a bunch of other parties at play here and just really make them twist in the wind, make them very awkward. Now, that said, it</span>

            <span class="text">who knows? Who knows? Maybe it just becomes one of those things that&#39;s just too hard to agree to. Or maybe they orchestrate it in such a way that the NDP start to feel a bit salty, give an ultimatum, and the liberals get to bring down their own government by saying, well, we can&#39;t do that ultimatum, so I&#39;ve gone to the GG, and maybe it won&#39;t even be a vote at all.

I haven&#39;t even gotten to ask you the poison pill question, but you said this regardless of what you think, that there&#39;s probably, and I made you answer in absolute terms like Doug Ford, but you said no, that this budget probably doesn&#39;t get defeated.

Is it going to be too much money on CEWS or SEWS or whatever the heck we&#39;re calling it? Is it going to be too much pandemic support? Is it going to be not deep enough on child care? Is the lack of pharma care going to be a deal breaker for the NDP?

This thing is about spending and it&#39;s about achieving the goals that the government wants to achieve at a time when people are willing to have deficits. And I think that it&#39;s also the coloring of it couldn&#39;t be any better. I think that if you&#39;d seen a 400 billion, assuming it&#39;s a $400 billion deficit, if you&#39;d seen a $400 billion deficit and we&#39;d been coming out of the pandemic, I think that people might&#39;ve responded differently. But we are in the midst of the third wave that looks as big as the second, if not bigger, again. And I&#39;ll tell you something, I think that people are going to be just fine. They&#39;re going to be just fine with where they are, unless you&#39;re already wearing the blue T-shirt.

Carter mentioned debt and deficit, like not mentioning of those two, there&#39;s going to be a spend budget. Is that a mistake to not address any of those items in this budget, for example? Or is there another mistake that could be an own goal heading into tomorrow from your perspective that the Liberals should look out for?</span>

            <span class="text">Well, there&#39;s no way they&#39;re not going to address the debt and the deficit in this budget. They&#39;ll have a declining deficit in out years. They&#39;ll talk about a path back to balance without being specific about when that will occur. I guarantee you it will not occur in the timeframe of the fiscal documents.</span>

I think that this is a government that knows how to govern at this moment, and they&#39;re doing a pretty good job of it. Their foreshadowing or their leaks appear to be well-coordinated, well-managed, and painting a picture of a budget that looks like it&#39;s going to fit the parameters that both Corey and I are describing.</span>

            <span class="text">Not to try to be too cute and tie the two segments together in some ways. But, you know, Carter, you talked about this concept of often the weakest thing sticks out. And when you have a laundry list of things that you&#39;ve mentioned relating to Ford, and we talked about carding and playgrounds in that regard. Corey, we&#39;ve also talked about that all budgets are political documents, they&#39;re communications documents. And by their nature, they&#39;re going going to have a lot of things to communicate to people. So we don&#39;t necessarily know what exact policies we&#39;re going to see tomorrow. We&#39;ve seen some leaks and telegraphing as to what could be in there. But let&#39;s go down the track of communications advice you&#39;d give to 11th hour communication advice you&#39;d give to the liberals heading into tomorrow. I&#39;d say expectations are high. They haven&#39;t delivered a budget in over two years. They&#39;ve had a throne speech that kind of plays on that we can do everything mantra. What&#39;s some comms advice you&#39;d have for Freeland and the surrogates that are going to be framing this budget tomorrow.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it&#39;s an interesting one, isn&#39;t it? Because there was an awful lot of conversation that this budget at least had the potential to be the starting pistol for a federal campaign. A lot of conversation that people have lost their nerve about that as Ontario continues to be a COVID basket case. Quebec not looking a ton better. Alberta is Alberta.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so um you know i i say all of this zane because i have also said in the past budgets are something you just got to do normally</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">normally every year this government has somehow gotten away with not doing it for two years fine but you just have to have a budget at a certain point and budgets are full of different items some good some bad it&#39;s a lot of ledgers and if you are trying to constrain spending in any way shape or form you are going to piss somebody off and even if you&#39;re or not, somebody&#39;s gonna say, how come they got so much and I didn&#39;t get very much, right? So budgets have good and they have bad. They are not entirely political wins. And what you want to do is you want to make sure that you control the story around the budget and keep the conversation on the good, on the political wins. Now, this was a budget that was possibly</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">possibly crafted as an election lead-in. I guarantee you if that&#39;s the case, it&#39;s got a lot more sweeteners than it has as sour. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And that should afford them a lot of opportunity to create more win and talk about the things that they want to do in the Canada that they want to build. So this might not be the most difficult budget in the world to communicate. This might, however, be one of those things that they live to regret. Because even if it&#39;s the great budget with all of the good stuff, and this election doesn&#39;t happen for, let&#39;s say, six months, let&#39;s say 12 months. And all of a sudden, you&#39;ve got a fiscal update in there. What do you say next? If this is your your thing and you&#39;re saying it you don&#39;t get to say it again at least not in the same way with the same vigor and that could be a bit of a challenge for them so my advice is</span>
