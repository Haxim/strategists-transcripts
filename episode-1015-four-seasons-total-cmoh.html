            <span class="text">cory dr dina hinshaw is out as alberta&#39;s chief medical officer of health that&#39;s not a surprise to many, many folks expecting that, as Daniel Smith&#39;s rhetoric about Dina Hinshaw has been quite loud and quite sustained throughout her leadership campaign and even her first day as a premier. That&#39;s not the surprise. We have a new chief medical officer of health, replaced by Dr. Mark Joffe, an Alberta Health Services vice president. His interim role began today and, of course, will continue until rescinded by appointment of the health minister. Mr. And there he goes. As scheduled, Stephen Carter has left us again. This is, Corey, before I continue, because I don&#39;t want to spoil the nub of the point, the reason why you and I are so excited. Should we discuss Stephen Carter&#39;s technology? Should we discuss Stephen Carter&#39;s lack of accountability to the show?</span>

            <span class="text">ahs has hired a new well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new chief medical officer of health i just mentioned mark jaffe alberta health services vice president uh appointed by the premier an interesting appointment cory because this seems like a very mainstream doctor who&#39;s an infectious disease specialist has very mainstream views on on COVID, lockdowns, measures.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">But is there a chance, Corey, that the government of Alberta may have appointed the wrong Dr. Jaffe? Because according to some Twitter activity that has just begun, there is a Dr. Jaffe that Danielle Smith has talked about, a pediatrician who&#39;s been a contrarian on COVID, on lockdown measures, on masking. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s been a contrarian on the vaccination, but he&#39;s certainly been a contrarian. And Stephen Carter, you can come in for the end part of the punchline. He&#39;s certainly also named Dr. Jaffe.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">a chance? Is there a chance? As I set it up for you, Carter, I was going to do the punchline for you twice, but I&#39;m not going to since you caught it. Is there a chance that</span>

            <span class="text">Premier Daniel Smith and the Alberta government may have appointed the wrong Dr. Jaffe, not the one that they did eventually appoint, Dr. Mark Jaffe, but the other Dr. Jaffe, who&#39;s been the contrarian on COVID measures. Stephen Carter, let&#39;s start with you. Is a grand fuck up like this possible?</span>

It is possible in the same way that it&#39;s possible that we&#39;ll get snow in august or snow in july i mean i&#39;ve been along i&#39;ve been alive long enough we&#39;ve had snow in every month except july it is possible is it likely is it likely i don&#39;t think so but is it possible absolutely it&#39;s possible well</span>

They might hold it as leverage. coverage, talk to me about, because with this strategy, it&#39;s less about what you do today, more about how you plan for tomorrow. Talk to me about how you&#39;re planning to prevent a leak of this, because I might suggest that a leak of this six months, three months down the road could be way more damaging than Carter&#39;s strategy of going out tomorrow and saying, we fucked up.

Let&#39;s say his advice leans in that direction and the base that elected her now gets frustrated being like, what the fuck is happening here? How do you prevent for that in the strategy where you&#39;re swallowing your pride and saying this was the right guy that we appointed?</span>

You can&#39;t necessarily use it as a situation of bad judgment without impugning other people. that aren&#39;t political. You have to kind of go after Dr. Ari Jaffe. And he didn&#39;t</span>

I do think though, that if this has a potential to be problematic for Danielle Smith, it&#39;s not actually people like us saying, oh my God, wouldn&#39;t it be funny if this was the case? It&#39;s if her base gets upset that a relatively moderate, well, not relatively, a moderate physician with impeccable credentials, credentials, very high up in AIHS, is now the chief medical officer of health. That&#39;s probably not the view of some of her supporters as to who should be the chief medical officer of health. And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of harm, frankly, in her poking that bear a little bit and almost saying, like, I&#39;m really happy with this chief medical officer of health pick. Seems very pragmatic. I noted that they were a supporter of vaccines. I noted that they see see that ivermectin was was not uh you know this miracle cure that some people have claimed it would be and i i noted that they&#39;ve got deep health care expertise they&#39;ve got a lot of experience running the health care system i think this is a pretty good pick now rachel</span>

I might be overthinking it but i&#39;m kind of curious if we if we have a couple of seconds and of course we do because i run the show um is let&#39;s talk about how these decisions are made and in some cases i suspect they&#39;re as clean as cory&#39;s carter that they&#39;re just like hey this is a fun show and they&#39;re good people um but how do you kind of choose where to expose your your your your leader and especially in a pop culture and mainstream media sense and where that kind of turns into to overexposure.</span>
