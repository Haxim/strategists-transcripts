        <div class="desc"><p>The gang use Twitter chatter that Danielle Smith appointed the wrong Dr. Joffe as Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health to go deep into a hypothetical universe where Alberta's premier must decide on a strategy of acting as though it was always the plan or rescinding a major appointment.</p><blockquote><p><em>Look, it didn't happen. Okay - it probably didn't happen. But if it did happen, there would be some big-time strategic decisions to make. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the decisions the Alberta UCP government would have to make if they had accidentally appointed the wrong Dr. Joffe as Chief Medical Officer of Health. Would they reverse course? Would they find a way to lean into it? What would the risks be of either decision and how would the government try to mitigate against them? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

That&#39;s not the surprise. We have a new chief medical officer of health, replaced by Dr. Mark Joffe, an Alberta Health Services vice president. His interim role began today and, of course, will continue until rescinded by appointment of the health minister. Mr. And there he goes. As scheduled, Stephen Carter has left us again. This is, Corey, before I continue, because I don&#39;t want to spoil the nub of the point, the reason why you and I are so excited. Should we discuss Stephen Carter&#39;s technology? Should we discuss Stephen Carter&#39;s lack of accountability to the show?</div>

I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s been a contrarian on the vaccination, but he&#39;s certainly been a contrarian. And Stephen Carter, you can come in for the end part of the punchline.

I do think though, that if this has a potential to be problematic for Danielle Smith, it&#39;s not actually people like us saying, oh my God, wouldn&#39;t it be funny if this was the case? It&#39;s if her base gets upset that a relatively moderate, well, not relatively, a moderate physician with impeccable credentials, credentials, very high up in AIHS, is now the chief medical officer of health. That&#39;s probably not the view of some of her supporters as to who should be the chief medical officer of health. And I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot of harm, frankly, in her poking that bear a little bit and almost saying, like, I&#39;m really happy with this chief medical officer of health pick. Seems very pragmatic. I noted that they were a supporter of vaccines. I noted that they see see that ivermectin was was not uh you know this miracle cure that some people have claimed it would be and i i noted that they&#39;ve got deep health care expertise they&#39;ve got a lot of experience running the health care system i think this is a pretty good pick now rachel</div>
