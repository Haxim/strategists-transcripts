Let&#39;s spend a few minutes on this one. There&#39;s two headlines I want to spend a few minutes on. This is one of them. Green Party of Canada members have started to vote on whether to remove Annamie Paul as party leader roughly a month after she said she&#39;d announced her resignation. Yes, the leadership review is underway, Green Party communications director said to CBC. Voting on Paul&#39;s leadership began yesterday and will end on November 25th, just ahead of their scheduled virtual general meeting. Corey, I mean, the saga keeps going. You had Annamie Paul saying she was done. She talked about the shards of broken glass that she had to walk on. You then had Elizabeth May go on CTV. You had a former leader of the Green Party go on CTV, effectively throwing potshots at Annamie Paul. But now we learn that she still hasn&#39;t resigned, still trying to confirm her exit package. Let&#39;s view this from the lens of, like, political parties and leadership, as we always have when we look at Green Party stories. stories. Unprecedented, yes, but any additional comments that you may have in terms of what the state of affairs for the Green Party is right now?</span>

Green Party is saying, we don&#39;t actually have the money to pay your legal fees right now we&#39;re struggling to do that and so in the meantime what they&#39;re doing is they&#39;re i guess running this process so they can formally remove her through a review i mean it&#39;s just it&#39;s just tasteless upon tasteless uh you know continually</span>

            <span class="text">And they have not done that. And so now they&#39;re trying to find leverage, I suppose, to not do that more efficiently. I mean, this is such a bad look on a Green Party that has already treated their leader like absolute dirt the entire way along. I mean, start the healing process here, fellows and ladies. It&#39;s time to start acting like a real political party that has some sort of moral backbone, make good with the past leader that you never made good with in the past, and move on with your lives. This is not a thing that you want to do. You don&#39;t want to continue this ugliness, even though, yes, you probably have a lot of time. Yes, this is going to be forgotten. gotten. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s just delaying another day, another day, another day, what the Green Party needs to do to start righting the ship at a time when the Green Party should be one of the most consequential movements within Canada. You start looking at some of the polling that came out from Abacus recently, on how Canadians perceive energy development, on how Canadians perceive the need to act on climate change. And then you look at where the Green Party is in the the polls and you think what the fuck like</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, what would you have advised if you were chatting with Facebook in the midst of this decision? I mean, clearly, both of you said the timing was wrong. Was there any other advice from what you saw today, the Zuckerberg video that came out with him introducing this, you know, almost like a home shopping network brand. I&#39;m curious what advice you would have given now having the benefit of hindsight from looking at this launch, this brand, and now the holding company that is Meta. Because one of the things that they did not do, I&#39;ll just also put this on the list, is they did not change the name of any of their core products, right? So the user functionality of Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram from a brand perspective did not change. But your advice, had you been in the room and been invited to chat with them?</span>

I mean, he&#39;s not someone people can relate to. He does not have the capacity to interact with other human beings properly. And he created, I think, an absolutely tragic video. Whereas I think that there are lots of staff, There are lots of people at Facebook that could become the new definition of the – like the team itself, the meta team, if you will, could have been an interesting brand to explore. What does it mean to be part of the meta universe? That actually is interesting. Making Mark Zuckerberg the star at the center of the meta universe just feels like it was pretty stupid. But really, he is persona non grata in just about every group, every organization. Maybe him and Bill Gates can hang out together, but that&#39;s about it.</span>

And, you know, I imagine Facebook would be one of those demanding clients that say, we got to do this. It&#39;s on our schedule. If you had the guardrails of that, what would you kind of advise them if they had to go today, if they wanted to have to go, your timeline is off the table, what are some of the things you would have said to them?</span>

Many thread lines, as we&#39;ve seen over the last couple of days, but I want to hit on a few of them. Corey, let&#39;s start with the cabinet makeup overall. We&#39;ll kind of give the general sort of thumbnail sketch that many are talking about. Melanie Jolie getting a huge upgrade to foreign affairs. Stephen Gilbeau going from heritage to environment. That&#39;s a story Corey, because of his activist past, certainly, on the Environments File. Jonathan Wilkinson leaving Environment, going to Natural Resources. And then you have a host of cabinet members, three of them, to be precise, that no longer are in cabinet. Two heavy hitters, Jim Carr, Mark Garneau, and Bartis Chagger as a third on that list, also out of cabinet. Corey, many storylines, including ones here in Alberta. Randy Bossineau from Edmonton getting the tourism ministry. But where do you want to start from what you saw as Justin Trudeau&#39;s 3.0 cabinet makeup? Many narratives around legacy, many around these are my best friends, I want to hang with them. What stood out to you when you saw the cabinet makeup?</span>

He gets the associate minister of finance. Randy Boissoneau is not a person who doesn&#39;t have credentials. Randy Boissoneau is not an intelligent, capable person. why do you think this ended with with that particular ministry and first of all congratulations to randy but secondly why tourism carter what do you think them if there was a message being sent by the pmo uh certainly in concert with let&#39;s just say who the environmental environment minister and natural resources minister what but in isolation let&#39;s talk about randy and what the message to alberta was with the the ministry he got i</span>

And then when Randy Bossineau gets there, essentially as the only candidate that can be put into cabinet, and I think that a case can be made that a slap in the face was made to Alberta on the national resources file and on the environment file. I mean, they switched jobs, right? Like this is an interesting scenario for the steep foreheads in the oil and gas towers in Calgary.</span>

But is there anything that you as a chief of staff or you as a prime minister&#39;s office or the prime minister or the deputy prime minister need to do to really like ensure that those that are kind of like hanging their heads are still a core part of caucus, that they&#39;re still along for the ride?

How would you handle this? And I&#39;m curious, Corey, how you would handle it from like a, this is less politics and obviously politics ingrained, but like more like people and like HR in a real sense.

So when they come and they say, why them and not me, you&#39;re able to say regional representation, diversity, better metrics on these things, stronger performer at these moments, be able to essentially say, I&#39;m watching you, and here&#39;s what I&#39;ve perceived, and this is why I&#39;ve picked them over you. Because those are the conversations that you don&#39;t want it to seem like it&#39;s just the PMO pals. You want to be able to say they&#39;ve proven their performance in these ways because the sense of it&#39;s just kind of arbitrary, that can be dangerous if – well, look, let&#39;s not kid ourselves. Trudeau&#39;s got a pretty strong lock on that leadership, but that gets dangerous in choppier leadership times, right? It&#39;s like they don&#39;t like me. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not in. I don&#39;t like them as a result, and that kind of mirroring of the emotion you perceive, that&#39;s dangerous. dangerous i liked steven&#39;s advice a bit about the what do you need it&#39;s just like any workplace you&#39;re right about the hr draw it&#39;s when somebody comes and says i want to be promoted any manager should be prepared to say okay well let&#39;s have that conversation let&#39;s talk about the gap between the person doing the job you want and your current performance here which is not to say that it&#39;s a gap in like quality of individual but it&#39;s your your demonstrated ability to do the role right Right.</span>

Maybe we go down the environment natural resources track. I&#39;m curious what you think of the appointment of Gilbeau, the activist now taking on the actor of the minister. Mr. It&#39;s quite interesting. I think it&#39;s something that many pundits and the political chattering class said would never happen.

Yeah. There&#39;s been the quips about it being the first NDP government in Canada. And there is – I mean, it&#39;s not that.

And it&#39;s you can talk about the specifics of both. And there&#39;s been a lot of rumors that Garneau is leaving cabinet or was not invited into cabinet because he&#39;s going to be taken on an ambassadorial position in France somewhere. Kind of strange considering an election was just six weeks ago and he got reelected. But my question is less about the specifics, but more about if you&#39;ve ever dealt with or have advice on how do you put statesmen to pastor?</span>

            <span class="text">How do you let these very senior people who have been bedrocks of your party, who&#39;ve been bedrocks of beyond the party, like have been quite literally statesmen? And I think Garneau, he could qualify as that in many ways, holding multiple portfolios, clearly having a very rich and textured career prior to politics. And then now we kind of learn that he isn&#39;t in cabinet. There&#39;s this two-step thing. I&#39;m kind of curious if you&#39;ve ever had to deal with or any insights or thoughts around how you do this. Dion actually had a very different treatment, as you saw, and as we all publicly saw from 2015 onwards, was kind of sent away and then sent packing in that order. But I&#39;m kind of curious around conversations of how do you, you know, set statesmen easy or statespeople easy when you&#39;re trying to send them a message about the next generation or about their future and frankly, the direction you&#39;re trying to head into? to yeah</span>

The two women that have been elevated in a significant Of course, Krista Freeland back, Melanie Jolie in foreign affairs, Anita Anand taking on defense. Your thoughts on both of those? And maybe I&#39;ll kind of put my spin on it, Carter. Tough positions. And of course, you know, elevating some of your top cabinet positions to be women, competent women, qualified women. But both departments in foreign affairs, Trudeau&#39;s fifth minister in the portfolio, not a very sunny waste time in foreign affairs for Canada. And then, of course, defense with all of the issues going on in there. So putting in two women, but maybe not necessarily setting up either one, I would argue, to necessarily succeed.

Don&#39;t you or do you feel like we&#39;re – once again, it&#39;s a different era in many ways and the leftward march is just part of it?</span>

And they were as enthusiastic really almost as Ralph Klein and Harris in Ontario. and and those those balance but that balance the budget era was the march to the right and now we see uh in part because the center and the right haven&#39;t grabbed on to to climate change haven&#39;t grabbed on to gender equity haven&#39;t grabbed on to some of these these big ideas um the right has given up that the center and the right has given up that the left is courting uh voters who are in in those spaces. And so you see a little bit of a switch. If I was the center-right candidate, the blue liberal, the red Tory of the Liberal Party, I&#39;d be trying to, again, I&#39;ll return to my earlier talking point. I do believe the Liberal Party is closer to a leadership, closer to their next leadership than they were to their last leadership. So I&#39;d be talking about trying to figure out who that candidate is that can carry the liberal brand as defined by their</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So this is a, you&#39;ve sort of touched on it, but this is a proud tradition of the liberals to have a left wing and a right wing. And historically, they&#39;ve swapped back and forth. And that goes way, way back, right? You had Turner on the right wing of the party. And then well, before that, you had the first Trudeau on the left wing, and then Turner on the right wing, and then Chrétien on the left wing, and then Martin on the right wing. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And it all sort of broke down in the 2000s for a bit with just everything sort of falling to shit. But even then, it was Dion on the left and then Ignatiev on the right. The trading did sort of seem to happen still there. And when those trades happen within the Liberal Party, can I tell you, Zane, as somebody who was quite active in the Liberal Party for many of those transitions, the purges are pretty ruthless and complete. right you&#39;re you&#39;re all of a sudden at a local board meeting and the entire board gets turned out by you know 50 young lawyers who show up and say we&#39;re the new board we&#39;re the paul martin board of calgary center right and that&#39;s just that&#39;s just sort of how the party rolls and so um it&#39;s an interesting question to me whether you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you can go too far with that and then all of a sudden those people who were turned out never come back they say i&#39;m going to go find a different party</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I would argue the risk of that is much lower with the current iteration of the conservative. Absolutely.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Absolutely. There&#39;s not any place to catch them.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. So in a funny way, I think that the liberals&#39; leftward slide is a direct result of the conservatives&#39; rightward slide. Because all of a sudden, their orbit, what they&#39;re catching before it becomes more palatable to go to conservatives, they can go a little bit more left. They can challenge a bit more to the NDP. That&#39;s how they can cobble their governments together. other in such a divided parliament as it is with such low percents allowing you to get within spitting distance of majority government so um we&#39;ll see that&#39;s the short answer the liberal party has a history of this but you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the trend is not destiny and it is quite possible that people will start to see themselves on the outs and maybe even if they&#39;re not voting conservative maybe they&#39;re not providing their efforts and their energy to the Liberal Party, and maybe that&#39;s ultimately what dooms the Liberal Party, not the risk of everybody in kind of the center fleeing to the Conservatives.</span>

And it was certainly fun when after World War Two, I&#39;m sure we had basically the only Navy left standing and we were like the third or fourth largest Navy in the world. And people thought Canada was cool in that sense but this more multilateral world&#39;s probably a more just world and we&#39;ve just got to sort of find our place in it but inherently that role is going to be less important in a in a world like that in terms of media but it&#39;s going to be more important in terms of you know the connections that your your department has so it&#39;s less about the person more about the department cory</span>
