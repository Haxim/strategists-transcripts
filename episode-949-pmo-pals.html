Let&#39;s spend a few minutes on this one. There&#39;s two headlines I want to spend a few minutes on. This is one of them. Green Party of Canada members have started to vote on whether to remove Annamie Paul as party leader roughly a month after she said she&#39;d announced her resignation. Yes, the leadership review is underway, Green Party communications director said to CBC. Voting on Paul&#39;s leadership began yesterday and will end on November 25th, just ahead of their scheduled virtual general meeting. Corey, I mean, the saga keeps going. You had Annamie Paul saying she was done. She talked about the shards of broken glass that she had to walk on. You then had Elizabeth May go on CTV. You had a former leader of the Green Party go on CTV, effectively throwing potshots at Annamie Paul. But now we learn that she still hasn&#39;t resigned, still trying to confirm her exit package. Let&#39;s view this from the lens of, like, political parties and leadership, as we always have when we look at Green Party stories. stories. Unprecedented, yes, but any additional comments that you may have in terms of what the state of affairs for the Green Party is right now?</div>

It&#39;s time to start acting like a real political party that has some sort of moral backbone, make good with the past leader that you never made good with in the past, and move on with your lives.

Was there any other advice from what you saw today, the Zuckerberg video that came out with him introducing this, you know, almost like a home shopping network brand. I&#39;m curious what advice you would have given now having the benefit of hindsight from looking at this launch, this brand, and now the holding company that is Meta. Because one of the things that they did not do, I&#39;ll just also put this on the list, is they did not change the name of any of their core products, right? So the user functionality of Facebook or WhatsApp or Instagram from a brand perspective did not change. But your advice, had you been in the room and been invited to chat with them?</div>

I mean, he&#39;s not someone people can relate to. He does not have the capacity to interact with other human beings properly. And he created, I think, an absolutely tragic video. Whereas I think that there are lots of staff, There are lots of people at Facebook that could become the new definition of the – like the team itself, the meta team, if you will, could have been an interesting brand to explore. What does it mean to be part of the meta universe? That actually is interesting. Making Mark Zuckerberg the star at the center of the meta universe just feels like it was pretty stupid. But really, he is persona non grata in just about every group, every organization. Maybe him and Bill Gates can hang out together, but that&#39;s about it.</div>

Many thread lines, as we&#39;ve seen over the last couple of days, but I want to hit on a few of them. Corey, let&#39;s start with the cabinet makeup overall. We&#39;ll kind of give the general sort of thumbnail sketch that many are talking about. Melanie Jolie getting a huge upgrade to foreign affairs. Stephen Gilbeau going from heritage to environment. That&#39;s a story Corey, because of his activist past, certainly, on the Environments File. Jonathan Wilkinson leaving Environment, going to Natural Resources. And then you have a host of cabinet members, three of them, to be precise, that no longer are in cabinet. Two heavy hitters, Jim Carr, Mark Garneau, and Bartis Chagger as a third on that list, also out of cabinet. Corey, many storylines, including ones here in Alberta. Randy Bossineau from Edmonton getting the tourism ministry. But where do you want to start from what you saw as Justin Trudeau&#39;s 3.0 cabinet makeup? Many narratives around legacy, many around these are my best friends, I want to hang with them. What stood out to you when you saw the cabinet makeup?</div>

He gets the associate minister of finance. Randy Boissoneau is not a person who doesn&#39;t have credentials. Randy Boissoneau is not an intelligent, capable person. why do you think this ended with with that particular ministry and first of all congratulations to randy but secondly why tourism carter what do you think them if there was a message being sent by the pmo uh certainly in concert with let&#39;s just say who the environmental environment minister and natural resources minister what but in isolation let&#39;s talk about randy and what the message to alberta was with the the ministry he got i</div>

And then when Randy Bossineau gets there, essentially as the only candidate that can be put into cabinet, and I think that a case can be made that a slap in the face was made to Alberta on the national resources file and on the environment file.

Is it happening? Is anything happening right now that you can do to make that case? Or you&#39;re having to wait later on, like 18 months at a 24-month cycle, so to speak, to actually make your case? I&#39;m kind of curious, because you&#39;re chief of staff to a former premier. You&#39;ve seen people jockeying. You&#39;ve seen different styles and modes of that jockeying.

            <div class="said">Yeah, well, it helps to have what I would call a coherent theory of cabinet, right? So when they come and they say, why them and not me, you&#39;re able to say regional representation, diversity, better metrics on these things, stronger performer at these moments, be able to essentially say, I&#39;m watching you, and here&#39;s what I&#39;ve perceived, and this is why I&#39;ve picked them over you. Because those are the conversations that you don&#39;t want it to seem like it&#39;s just the PMO pals. You want to be able to say they&#39;ve proven their performance in these ways because the sense of it&#39;s just kind of arbitrary, that can be dangerous if – well, look, let&#39;s not kid ourselves. Trudeau&#39;s got a pretty strong lock on that leadership, but that gets dangerous in choppier leadership times, right? It&#39;s like they don&#39;t like me. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not in. I don&#39;t like them as a result, and that kind of mirroring of the emotion you perceive, that&#39;s dangerous. dangerous i liked steven&#39;s advice a bit about the what do you need it&#39;s just like any workplace you&#39;re right about the hr draw it&#39;s when somebody comes and says i want to be promoted any manager should be prepared to say okay well let&#39;s have that conversation let&#39;s talk about the gap between the person doing the job you want and your current performance here which is not to say that it&#39;s a gap in like quality of individual but it&#39;s your your demonstrated ability to do the role right Right.</div>

There&#39;s the Wilkinson-Gilbeau track, which we should talk about on natural resources environment. There&#39;s also the track of Garneau and Carr being out. Which one do you want to pick on first? Maybe we go down the environment natural resources track. I&#39;m curious what you think of the appointment of Gilbeau, the activist now taking on the actor of the minister. Mr. It&#39;s quite interesting. I think it&#39;s something that many pundits and the political chattering class said would never happen. What do you think the signals for Trudeau and what he&#39;s trying to get done? And do you like the pick?</div>

            <div class="said">Yeah, that&#39;s that&#39;s interesting. So you&#39;re doing it for those reasons. Carter, I want to ask you about Garneau and Carr. And it&#39;s you can talk about the specifics of both. And there&#39;s been a lot of rumors that Garneau is leaving cabinet or was not invited into cabinet because he&#39;s going to be taken on an ambassadorial position in France somewhere. Kind of strange considering an election was just six weeks ago and he got reelected. But my question is less about the specifics, but more about if you&#39;ve ever dealt with or have advice on how do you put statesmen to pastor?</div>

            <div class="said">How do you let these very senior people who have been bedrocks of your party, who&#39;ve been bedrocks of beyond the party, like have been quite literally statesmen? And I think Garneau, he could qualify as that in many ways, holding multiple portfolios, clearly having a very rich and textured career prior to politics. And then now we kind of learn that he isn&#39;t in cabinet. There&#39;s this two-step thing. I&#39;m kind of curious if you&#39;ve ever had to deal with or any insights or thoughts around how you do this. Dion actually had a very different treatment, as you saw, and as we all publicly saw from 2015 onwards, was kind of sent away and then sent packing in that order. But I&#39;m kind of curious around conversations of how do you, you know, set statesmen easy or statespeople easy when you&#39;re trying to send them a message about the next generation or about their future and frankly, the direction you&#39;re trying to head into? to yeah</div>

Because at some point, someone&#39;s got to have to be on the other side of this party to say, by the way, we&#39;re still a little bit of, you know, Bay Street, fiscal conservatism, you know, those sort of flanks are still what we&#39;re all about in some ways.

Because all of a sudden, their orbit, what they&#39;re catching before it becomes more palatable to go to conservatives, they can go a little bit more left. They can challenge a bit more to the NDP. That&#39;s how they can cobble their governments together. other in such a divided parliament as it is with such low percents allowing you to get within spitting distance of majority government so um we&#39;ll see that&#39;s the short answer the liberal party has a history of this but you</div>
