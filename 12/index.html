Can Trudeau credit &#34;drama skills&#34; for his showing in the exchange with China&#39;s leader? Are televised addresses from provincial premiers a dying tactic?

Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan go deep into the troubles at Twitter, stepping in their time machine to go back to the heady day that was October 25 to give advice to soon-to-be-Twitter CEO Elon Musk. They use their powers of strategy and hindsight to build a plan that will remake Twitter in Elon&#39;s image - in a fashion that looks at least 5% competent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Okay - it probably didn&#39;t happen. But if it did happen, there would be some big-time strategic decisions to make. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the decisions the Alberta UCP government would have to make if they had accidentally appointed the wrong Dr. Joffe as Chief Medical Officer of Health.

Corey Hogan a̶n̶d̶ ̶S̶t̶e̶p̶h̶e̶n̶ ̶C̶a̶r̶t̶e̶r̶ discuss Garnett Genuis vs Dale Smith, the value of being a winner in QP, the risk the NDP lose the youth vote, Danielle Smith&#39;s recent endorsees and the last days of Jason Kenney&#39;s premiership. Can a campaign like &#34;Alberta is Calling&#34; hit the mark? Are youth taking a conservative turn? And is it really an ice cream cone if you don&#39;t put ice cream in it? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps the one other person on the show in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

Plus: Corey spends $450 on a badass shirt, but in his defence it was his exact style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about differing views of authenticity through the lens of the Prime Minister breaking into some Queen karaoke before the Queen&#39;s funeral. Why are Canadians having such different reactions to the PM&#39;s rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody? Has Danielle Smith locked up the UCP leadership? And when did the podcast start resorting to niche visual gags? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang talk about trends in political communications and ask: are they effective? Will they stay effective? And where is this all going?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss whether there&#39;s a crisis in political communications through the lense of three events this week: a text message (Poilievre), an email (Schulz) and a tweet (Jean). Is political communications just high pressure sales? Do the tactics campaigns invest in even work? And can they have help reinstate Donald Trump as King of America? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;Zain Velji is back in the chair, leading Stephen and Corey through a discussion about the consequences and strategic considerations around the Poilievre victory, the Green Party implosion and the death of Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about Pierre Poilievre&#39;s overwhelming victory in the Conservative Party of Canada leadership and what effect the new King will have on our body politic. Should the Liberals be concerned about Poilievre? Is now a time to reconsider our relationship with the crown? And is The Strategists&#39; soundboard the only thing less reliable than the Green Party of Canada? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

The titular characters try to hold the fort down in Zain&#39;s absence. The fort blows away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TOPICS: Quebec at the polls, Smith near the big job, Kenney in the closing days, LG on the hot-seat, Alberta Day forever in our hearts and on our minds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang run through the &#34;Strategy Scale&#34; and talk Danielle Smith&#39;s op-ed, some UCP leadership candidates attending a separatist forum, Pierre Poilievre&#39;s increasingly experimental videos and the Green Party putting a language filter on their leadership contest. Plus: Stephen Carter gets a ring light and Corey Hogan forgets to un-mute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter are run through the Strategy Scale and assess how politicians managed the events of the week. Was Danielle Smith&#39;s pro-sovereignty op-ed actually a retreat? Has Poilievre lost his video game? And is love of a CFL football team really enough to be considered a nation? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>

        <div class="desc">&lt;p&gt;The gang launch off of recent events in Canada and the United States to talk about profanity in politics. When does it work? When does it backfire? And why do we need to hear about Stephen Carter&#39;s nipples?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about swearing in politics - recent instances, its history - and what power it has in public discourse. Is deploying profanity an effective strategy? Can we expect to see even more of it in the future? And how long has Stephen Carter been sitting on that podcast review?

Plus: Kenney vs. Smith on the Alberta Sovereignty Act, Doug Ford&#39;s &#34;strong mayor&#34; system of municipal government and the strange death of the Alberta Liberal Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about constitutional crises, &#34;strong mayor&#34; systems and - inexplicably - the Alberta Liberal Party&#39;s inability to find a permanent leader. Could a Lieutenant Governor really disallow an &#34;Alberta Sovereignty Act&#34;? Will Doug Ford&#39;s municipal reforms result in better municipal government? And how many recalled Capri Suns could fit in the UK House of Lords? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div>
