Guys, are you guys ready? Are you guys ready to jump into this? We have so much to talk about. We&#39;re going to jump right into our first segment. Our first segment, getting high on your own supply and confidence agreement.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That is right, guys. We&#39;re going to talk about the budget. The big budget, it is here, Corey Hogan. It is around, it is hairy, and it is branded a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable. Yeah, can we talk about that off the top?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">on that. If you are into it, get started with the brand, and then I&#39;ll get people the specifics. I&#39;m sure some folks have already heard of the specifics, but Corey, a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable. That&#39;s the brand. Jump into it right away.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that the biggest inflation problem we have in this country is the title of budget documents. They used to just be called the budget. They used to not have these names, right? And then somewhere around the turn of the century, they</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they started putting in things like better finances, better lives. Canada&#39;s economic action plan was a little later under the Harper years,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but then they&#39;ve gotten crazy. Like 2015 was strong leadership, a balanced budget, low tax plan for jobs, growth, and security. Now we&#39;ve got a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable. There&#39;s no art in them anymore. They&#39;ve just become the most blunt, crass positionings that the government wants to put forward. It&#39;s crazy</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">crazy to me. Zane, do you have the ability to go back and play some of the type from our budget episode when we were doing the Alberta budget? I don&#39;t. And we talked about them as communications vehicles? I don&#39;t, but I</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">moving yeah move on carter jesus what are you doing why are you trying to make so i i will go back to i will go back to last week because you guys both had your own proposed branding for this because i forced you into this right knowing that we were gonna be given a brand and i don&#39;t know if i can call this a brand uh we&#39;ll be given a description i guess today today. Corey, your budget brand that you came up with was back to basics, right? You said lean into that back to basics branding, stuff it with your big programs that you want to do, but the back to basics makes sense. Carter, you had your one time fix sort of a mantra that you were kind of looking at making life more affordable was certainly part of your verbiage. But Corey, you want to jump in before I carry on here? Yeah,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, well, the reason why maybe something like that would</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">would work as opposed to a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable is the idea with branding a budget like this is is to answer the question when somebody says well what kind of budget is it and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and you know previously it would be like well it&#39;s an action economic action plan budget right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right or yeah better finances better lives even like no one&#39;s going to say that but it&#39;s like it&#39;s a plan for better finances is something you could understandably have somebody say back to basics sort of hits that test too like what&#39;s what&#39;s in the budget well it&#39;s back to basics it&#39;s a summary of the the document that gives you a feel and and provides that that sense that you&#39;re looking for in a branding sense the name that they&#39;ve provided here i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">i i am confused as to who it&#39;s for is it for the media like it&#39;s because it&#39;s on the cover the first thing they&#39;re going to say is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable i guess that&#39;s what&#39;s in this document is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">is it a plan for the one time in their life the average canadian is potentially going to hear this when they see it as like entitled a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable The government&#39;s budget, I mean, I don&#39;t actually think this is branding the budget. It&#39;s like a</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">a throwaway line. It&#39;s like a line in a speech you know they must clip because you&#39;ve called the budget that. But that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all it is in this case. And I think it&#39;s a real missed opportunity in terms of branding.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Well, let me just add some of the details and then Carter, I&#39;ll go to you, right? So this budget has a deficit that is at $52.8 billion projected for the 2022-2023 year. It introduces, of course, more spending. It is signaling an eye-popping 12-digit deficit coming to an end, you know, at the end of COVID. We&#39;re also looking at big spending on housing to try to help cool the housing market, a greener economy, a multi-billion dollar plan proposed for defense spending. spending. Carter, to go to Corey&#39;s point here, though, is</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">is there a cohesive story that you see in this budget? And could they have had a cohesive story? Because I almost want to go back to some of the stuff that you talk about quite often in your campaign consulting life with that 330-330 model that you&#39;ve introduced to us a while ago. I think that might be helpful to our listeners, where you look at a brand and a title, and some people might say, why are you guys spending such disproportionate amount of time trying to dissect what the title of a budget is, there&#39;s some merit behind spending disproportionate time around what the seven to eight or six words that you use at the top of any branding or deep dive policy document is. Is there not, Carter?</span>

So maybe I&#39;ll explain it first and then jump into what it is that we&#39;d be looking for from this budget. But the idea of 330-330 is that the first three stands for three seconds. So that&#39;s the first group of people that are going to be bringing in and understanding his budget. They will spend approximately three seconds looking at it. They&#39;ll get a tweet. They&#39;ll see something.</span>

            <span class="text">Then there&#39;s three minutes. Can I get people to engage for three minutes on this budget? You&#39;re going to get down to very, very small percentages of actual Canadians that are actually going to engage for three minutes. And then you get to the 30 minute idea. The 30 minute idea is, you know, the Trevor Tombs of the world who are, you know, digging in. He&#39;s an economist at the University of Calgary. He&#39;s digging in, and he&#39;s reading the budget. He&#39;s read all 280 pages already. He&#39;s dissected it. He&#39;s written three blog posts. That real intense understanding is going to be done by a very small group of people. So when you&#39;re doing a communication strategy, you want to try and get people from the three seconds to as deep in as they will go. So three-second headline, 30-second understanding, three-minute understanding. And those people who get to the 30-minute understanding are kind of a few and far between, but you&#39;re always trying to move them along. And I think that the challenge I have, and I think this is what Corey was trying to get to, is that that three-second piece, a plan to grow our economy and make life more affordable, is actually better summarized by simply saying, this is a budget about housing, climate,</span>

But this was still a big spend budget, less than people had expected.

I think if you&#39;re going to go to the trouble of naming a budget, you have to ask yourself why you do it.

I want to go deep dive on that with you guys in a sec. So keep that thought. Corey, let me just tease out a few more details here, right? So better news on the deficit front, like I mentioned, it&#39;s going to be half of what it was last year. They have their tax-free first home savings account. They&#39;re boosting the housing supply. They&#39;re setting aside billions to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They&#39;re looking at, of course, that defense spending that Carter talked about.</span>

            <span class="text">I want to pick up on that because Carter, Carter, when we were recording our election episodes, we talked about how the platforms for not just the liberals, but every political party were almost micro targeted, that there was no real through line, like they were trying to tell a story, but it was cosmetic. It was like, we&#39;ll give you 5 million here, we&#39;ll give you 8 bucks here, we&#39;ll give you 6 billion here, but will everyone get something? Everyone has something. And this budget to me kind of speaks that way. So the question I have for you, Carter, is as much as Corey was talking about on the front end of this segment where we&#39;ve climatized ourselves to having brands for our budgets that speak to the values. Have we climatized ourselves maybe back again or maybe in a new era in some ways to not having through lines, that it&#39;s fine, that it&#39;s fine to have bits and pieces and micro-targeted activities for every constituency group as part of a budget? You might say that that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been. I&#39;m just curious to get your reaction to that, because this one, more so than the last one and the one before, and certainly the one uh in the heart of covid um to me seems like exactly what cory&#39;s identifying which is a light touch on the through line and small micro targeted pieces for different groups you</span>

But before I do that, I want to ask you about something that&#39;s been intriguing me, which which is, you know, I asked you guys last time, and I even mentioned it this episode, the multiple narratives of the type of budget we could have expected today, right? Not the austerity, but the liberal version of austerity. Then the big spend budget. I think the big spend kind of took over the runway prior to today. And they, of course, landed in a spot that wasn&#39;t big spend or wasn&#39;t like blow the doors out historical big spend with the, you know, wasn&#39;t the orange budget that people expected. And certainly, you know, despite what Candice Bergen and others called it today. Um, what part do you think that was strategy, Carter, to set the expectations so high that they could land the plane, so to speak, at a different altitude and still be fine because expectations were much higher and perhaps even purposefully elevated?</span>

So I think that that&#39;s probably why it landed because it really didn&#39;t defy any expectations. I mean, no one was expecting a $20 billion deficit. No one was expecting a $100 billion deficit, but somewhere in between those two numbers, I think most</span>

Everybody is saying, oh, look, they&#39;re secure for the next three years. They&#39;re going to get to the election. But there was a moment where Singh said, yeah, this is good enough. This meets the deal, right? And it made me realize that at the very least, every fucking budget we&#39;re going to have a moment like that this is the first one they just decided a couple of weeks ago this one&#39;s easy they knew what the budget was going to have but there is going to be a moment with microphones in his face for each budget and each throne speech saying is this enough are the liberals holding on to their deal and so i want to cast back to the very long and very complex deal that was signed just weeks ago here and we</span>

I think Singh is a winner because he&#39;s kind of proven the formula, get things out of the liberals, get credit for the things liberals were going to do.

We don&#39;t have to name them. We don&#39;t have to be specific about them. I want to get deep into the practitionership of what organizations that look for stuff in a budget, how are they processing it, and what should they be doing thereafter? Both of you have been in roles that involve people saying, oh, shit, my thing wasn&#39;t there. My program wasn&#39;t there. I&#39;ve been spending eight months, six months, for example, if you&#39;re Carter, you know, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, they&#39;re like, where is this? We&#39;ve been looking for it for so long. They show up and they say, this wasn&#39;t there. What are they doing on</span>

            <span class="text">on the eve of a budget? And let&#39;s take it out from just the day, but the weeks and perhaps even just a few months thereafter, to position themselves to get back into the mix. How do special interests and advocacy groups Groups that have desires for programs and opportunities in a budget bounce back. Carter, I&#39;m going to go to you first with your chief of staff experience. What would you suggest to the groups in that category? What does today look like? And then let&#39;s go from there.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the budget is just the first of the spending bills, right? I mean, there&#39;s more spending that happens through the course of a year. It&#39;s not like the budget comes out and the government just throws up its hands and says, well, that&#39;s it. We&#39;re not going to spend any more money. And</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s also not that every nickel that&#39;s in the budget is already allocated. There&#39;s money in there. There are programs in there. I mean, I know that when the city of Calgary was looking at trying to find money from the federal government, it was relatively straightforward to go in and find all the different programs that are publicly available. You can just find all the publicly available information. You find out where you think you can fit into, and then you try and apply for that money. And it&#39;s actually remarkable how sometimes that money isn&#39;t applied for. So you can go and find dollars within these buckets if you just change your talking points a little bit, right? You change what you&#39;re talking about. You&#39;re changing how you&#39;re approaching things. Well, this doesn&#39;t entirely describe what we&#39;re doing perfectly. Well, change</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">change what you&#39;re doing. Change it so that it does describe what you&#39;re doing perfectly. So that&#39;s kind of my first step. The second, of course, is that more money gets allocated throughout the course of the year. If you need additional funds, if there&#39;s something that&#39;s really important to you, then go get it. Go and find those additional funds and those additional funds can still be put forward. I mean, you know, more money is being spent in a bunch of different areas, but it doesn&#39;t mean that more money won&#39;t be spent later in the year. Corey,</span>

Well, obviously, health you could go to. You could go to Indigenous relations. You could go to advanced education. You could maybe go to jobs, economy, and innovation to talk about the economic benefits of it. Maybe this health initiative has children. You could go to children&#39;s services.

We might just sort of think of it as at the budget, the last budget, there was this deal that was struck and we&#39;re now living with the consequences of that deal.
