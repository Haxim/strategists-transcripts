          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">uh certainly they&#39;ve stopped the bleeding some of the polls have them bouncing back to being three four three or four points behind um</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">um three or four points behind in this type of race with the vote efficiency of the liberals is uh really terrible um you need to be you need to be tied to even hope for a minority uh and even then you you should be three or four points ahead uh if you&#39;re going to get a minority uh the the truth of the matter is the conservative vote is it&#39;s not efficient. It has peaks and significant peaks and significant valleys. Without that efficiency, they&#39;re not going to find themselves in government. And Pierre Polyev, I think, knows it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And at the very least, they stopped the bleeding. But I think that everything hinges on the debates coming forward.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So I want to question that a bit. But I want to get your sense on how you think they&#39;ve stopped the bleeding. And then I want to give you two Two counterarguments to suggest why I don&#39;t think they have and why the week that could have been owned by them, because Carney did make quite</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">quite a few foot faults, so to speak, in his own way. He wasn&#39;t perfect on several questions, especially the unscripted ones regarding what&#39;s the whole list of things? Beijing, tax</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">tax havens, you know, he wasn&#39;t great on those questions. And those could and should and maybe in any other conventional campaign have become moments. but in your mind where did he where did they stop the bleeding and like where is it just a simple shift of the question i</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">i just think that they&#39;ve reached the base i think that this is the group of people that want a new government um when you look at the polling the question do you want a new government is still polling well above where the conservatives are right now i think that this is their base uh that they&#39;ve fallen down to and when they say stop the bleeding they&#39;re just simply not losing anymore this is this is the vote that they&#39;re going to get and it&#39;s a very very high vote. Stephen Harper, I think, was hitting around the same point. I think it&#39;s 37 to 39, depending on what you&#39;re looking at.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, the CBC News poll aggregator has them at 37 and a half, so right in the middle of what you&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">which is a very high historic number for these guys.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They don&#39;t play at the level, no one plays at 50%, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? So when you&#39;re When you&#39;re looking at historic data, 37</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">37 and a half or 39, I guess it depends on the aggregator you&#39;re looking at. You know, it looks like they&#39;re actually in a pretty decent shape. What isn&#39;t</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">isn&#39;t calculated into that is that there&#39;s virtually no more Green Party. There&#39;s virtually no more NDP. And when those votes start floating in the ether, all of a sudden it&#39;s possible for the Liberals to float above 40. even when the conservatives are floating in the high 30s.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">So you&#39;re saying that they found their base. I think you&#39;re right. I think the rallies this week proved that they clearly have their base. Their base is not fleeing. Their base is as active and mobilized and as wanting to vote for them as they did two years</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">my counter argument this week though is actually the rallies and i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the sideshow at the rallies which is the do you believe in the polls yeah</span>
