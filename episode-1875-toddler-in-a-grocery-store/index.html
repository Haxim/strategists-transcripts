        <p>Shannon Philips and Stephen Carter dive into the biggest story happening right now, the Drake/Kendrick/Jagmeet feud. Then they fill time with a few with some minor issues like the G7 and Pierre Poilievre's upcoming leadership review. How is Carney doing at the G7? What would be some strategies to help or hurt Poilievre's leadership prospects? And what is SZA? A band? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p>

We often talk about leadership campaigns, which are, of course, associated with your name and you ran for leadership. And we talked about the toxicity of leadership debts.

Quote, I think Mark has a more complex idea, but it&#39;s still very good. Unquote, Trump said of some sort of trade pitch that Carney has made to the Americans, a proposal that is yet to be made public.

And he is giving them what they want there and what they voted for. So I don&#39;t think there necessarily needs to be a tariff deal as long as as Trump is like saying like sort of nice mumbles like he already did.</div>

Because I don&#39;t think people quite get the extent to which that child tax benefit is a massive amount of money every month. month.
