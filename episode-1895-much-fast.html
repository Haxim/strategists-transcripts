Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</p><p></p></div>

Right. So he&#39;s doing things that are are wedgie and that are are trying to, like, find this group of voters or, like, create, you know, antagonism or grievance.

It&#39;s like they&#39;re not relying on what they historically have done to bring them credibility. They&#39;re relying on their ability to get constant attention day to day, which is a fundamentally different thing, to continue to build their and their party&#39;s credibility and we don&#39;t necessarily look for that in in candidate making and in a modern sort we probably should going forward and maybe some aren&#39;t doing it more than less but i&#39;m kind of curious to get your final reflections before i move on well</div>

So I&#39;ll let you event as you need to because we want to talk about the substance of these and we don&#39;t have to do it all today. But I&#39;m really curious in terms of as we assess this political moment, Shannon, we also have seen this political strategy playbook before played elsewhere. Smith is not doing something entirely novel, but she seems to be doing it at a pace that has worked in other places. So with that in mind, and not trying to put my finger on the scale,</div>

Do you drop notwithstanding, like I&#39;m trying to like triangulate all the shit from their perspective.
