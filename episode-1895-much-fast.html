It&#39;s not dissimilar to what we&#39;ve done in the past, but there&#39;s a lot going on in Alberta politics. There&#39;s a lot going on in Canadian politics. So today I&#39;m going to pitch you, and we&#39;ll see how many of these we can get through, a series of things that have happened in our Canadian politics broadly. Some of them might be acute to Alberta. Some of them may not. And I want you, on a purely strategic level, and I&#39;ll give you some release valve to talk about how you feel about these things and your sort of analysis in that sense. But on a political strategy angle, I want you to tell me, are you going to take what the person in question did? Is it going to be a take? I&#39;m going to take it at its face value. Am I going to tweak it or</span>

He&#39;s now kind of taken on the in-house role of the conservative Charlie Kirk mantra, going to university campuses and starting to try to ignite that base that the conservatives believe is there for them already. They kind of believe that these are their people, especially those men. And so his most recent salvo into this conversation is about ending liberal racism as an extension of his university tour.

So when I think of Donald Trump, when I think of the conservatives movement as it stands currently, it is stand in front of the mirror, find the negative that you see, and then accuse the other side of doing that thing.

It&#39;s like they&#39;re not relying on what they historically have done to bring them credibility. They&#39;re relying on their ability to get constant attention day to day, which is a fundamentally different thing, to continue to build their and their party&#39;s credibility and we don&#39;t necessarily look for that in in candidate making and in a modern sort we probably should going forward and maybe some aren&#39;t doing it more than less but i&#39;m kind of curious to get your final reflections before i move on well</span>

I think she&#39;s going to go and do as much as possible in the next. I mean, obviously, she&#39;s doing as much as possible before Christmas and into the year and we&#39;ll clean that up in the new year. and then at the end of uh 2026 in the fall that looks it looks and feels like that&#39;s when we&#39;ll see the election yeah that&#39;s when she&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">I think that, frankly, most politicians now are being advised and wisely advised to do much fast, to do as much as possible as fast as possible, much fast. That seems to be the winning formula, not to do slow. I mean, Carney&#39;s doing much faster. It&#39;s going very, very well for him. Trump is doing much faster. We could argue about his overall popularity reaching the lowest point that it has so far in the second term. But still, he&#39;s getting away with murder, almost literally. So when you do a lot and you do a lot fast, people miss the details. And I&#39;m not sure how many people even really picked up on this private versus public health care that aren&#39;t listening to our podcast.</span>

Because there were regional health authorities at the time and rural PCMLA&#39;s who bucked on him. She has neither thing.</span>

Do you drop notwithstanding, like I&#39;m trying to like triangulate all the shit from their perspective. Give me a sense of like, now that this is on the table, are you back to your sweet spot historically Historically, on health care, bringing corrupt care back in, privatization back in, dissolve the legislature, call an election on this question.

But I have lots of time for this one. This is a big, big opportunity, and it needs to be taken care of. And that&#39;s why I was taking Nahed Nenshi saying it&#39;s time to call an election.</span>
