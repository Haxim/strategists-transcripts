Do you feel like in normal times, a situation like this, if you&#39;re dealing with it in the White House and you&#39;re not Donald Trump&#39;s administration, are you removing your political hat because this is just so above politics? politics uh i just want to get give people a sense like how these things kind of work uh in in normal times uh because right now we&#39;ve got a president who&#39;s willing to combat willing to fight uh is probably relishing what&#39;s happening uh because he probably sees an upside with its distraction but in normal times are the political is the political hat off and you&#39;re dealing with this as a strict crisis well</span>

Oh, you know, there&#39;s a moment where there&#39;s riots in the street over the treatment of black men and women in the United States. Is this not the time to deal with this issue?

It becomes about politics in the small P sense where you are trying to navigate consensus and will and pull together a solution to a challenge here. And that involves reaching across the aisle, that involves bringing in stakeholders, and that involves just meeting the moment with its inverse.
