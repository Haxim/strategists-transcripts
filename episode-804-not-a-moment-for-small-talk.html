      <h1>Episode 804: Not a moment for small talk</h1>

      
        <div class="meta">June 2, 2020</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the killing of George Floyd and the wave of protests that have rippled across the United States. What is the proper response to a moment like this? Is this a moment that should be beyond politics? And what do convulsions in the United States mean to Canada? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

I mean, killing somebody by putting your knee on their neck is next level horrible. Then there is, of course, that anxiety. There&#39;s concern for what&#39;s going to happen next.
