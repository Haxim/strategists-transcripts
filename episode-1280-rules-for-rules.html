            <span class="text">there are draft rules floating around for the Alberta NDP leadership race. Some of us have seen these rules float around in our inboxes, WhatsApp, chats, many people talking about them. Buzzworthy draft rules.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">these rules are round. People are kicking them around, got different versions of them. They&#39;re interesting, but that&#39;s not what I necessarily want to talk about. And when I say that, I mean the substance of what we have seen in these draft rules. Because we know at some point the Alberta NDP will publish a set of rules. Everyone will be able to see them. They will We&#39;ll dictate things like when the leadership race is, when it is revealed, the membership cutoffs, the prerequisite sort of what they&#39;d call green lighting process, Carter, right? What requirements you need to have. All of that, we&#39;ll see the light of day. And so despite the fact that they are with a lot of us right now or some of us right now, what I want</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">want to discuss, Carter— Keep rubbing it in, Zane.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">It&#39;s just me sending it to myself. Okay. Carter, here&#39;s what I want to discuss, though. Okay.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Because I&#39;ll let the substance of those rules come out when they do. I want to discuss how the campaigns in this Alberta NDP leadership race, but even broadly, how campaigns or camps, because there is no real official campaign yet, and we could talk about that for the candidates that are running, how these camps need to navigate these rules. And what I mean by navigate is, quite simply, advocate for rules that are in their favor. Try to even the scales, try to ensure that certain things that are beneficial to them, they make a case for. And I want to work this through with you guys in terms of a, what I&#39;d call a, I&#39;ve done this before, but a bit of like a biblical rule book. Let&#39;s go with some rules that you want to consider. And then from there on in, let&#39;s add a bit of nuance to them with the situation that perhaps some of these campaigns or these camps might find at hand. Corey, does that sound good to you?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sounds super and and i think that maybe i&#39;ll even jump in and say the first thing</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">as you go through and it&#39;s almost like i&#39;m glad to do that</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that because carter has to go to sleep so yeah just get us going here cory the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">framework for the framework is you&#39;ve</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;ve got to know that every party is going to be a little bit different but the rules don&#39;t just come on a stone tablet from on high right like somebody has to write these rules and so the draft has to be drafted by somebody, it has to be approved by somebody, maybe a different somebody, likely a different somebody or a group of somebodies. And it&#39;s only then that they actually take effect within the organization and depending on your party constitution, all</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">all sorts of ways that might be managed, right? But ultimately, it all comes down to three questions if you&#39;re a leadership camp, and you&#39;re trying to determine your ability to change these rules, or you&#39;re trying to set these rules in an advantageous way for you. You need to understand who recommends the rules, You need to understand who decides the rules, and you need to understand who influences that decision. And so the who recommends, who decides, and who influences model is really how you can start thinking about how these rules actually get formalized at the end of the day. So let&#39;s give an example.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">If the party executive director or party secretary, in the case of the NDP or whatever, recommends the rules, then you know who&#39;s got first pen on it. There&#39;s going to be a significant anchoring effect to that. So you&#39;re going to want to try to address things there if possible.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">The decision might actually be made by a broader group. It might be, for example, a provincial council. So all of the delegates to a meeting, right? That might be the deciders.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And then you know, ultimately, who the voting base is. And this is the group that you actually need to set at</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">at the end of the day. But that group, especially on a decision like this, is going to be looking to people who can give them a bit of guidance, because</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">because in many cases,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they won&#39;t know what they&#39;re supposed to say. And so you&#39;ve got to look to who influences. And that might even be your own camp. That might be the other leadership camps. That might be the outgoing leader. That might be the party officers that are recommending the rules. That might be any number of individuals. individuals. But these are the major actors that determine who or what, I suppose I mean, the leadership rules will be in any contest. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And I appreciate that, Corey, because it also highlights that when we talk about advocacy for the rules, we&#39;re not talking necessarily about changing, advocating senselessly for,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">for, let&#39;s just, you know, let&#39;s get rid of the voting system. We want a delegated convention. Like, that&#39;s not what we&#39;re talking about here, right? What we&#39;re talking about largely, if you guys agree, is we have the draft rules. How do we kind of massage them in our favor? How do we kind of create a comma at the end that opens up a criteria a bit more? How do we create functions of that? And Carter, I guess the question I&#39;ll frame to you because Corey&#39;s given us a frame, and I do want to get to our list, but I&#39;d love to just tap on your expertise here because you&#39;ve run a few of these, Carter. Carter. Have camps that you have been a part of or</span>

Is this something that is already baked so most camps don&#39;t actually spend any time trying to mold it? Give me your take on this from your experience. Like, have you You spent considerable time and even political capital and even points for being super best friends, so to speak, and said, I don&#39;t give a shit about that, to say, I want to go in bulldozing on the rules.

I think that too many campaigns think, oh, well, we can&#39;t push back because we really want to run for leader. I&#39;ll tell you something. It&#39;s running for leader and losing sucks. Don&#39;t run for leader and lose. Run for leader and win, which means you have to run for leader with good sets of rules. Which</span>

It&#39;s that as a candidate, you do not say, I don&#39;t like these rules. They don&#39;t serve my interests. You always say, they</span>

You make it about the kind of party you want to have, whether that party is going to be open or closed, whether that party is going to be left or right, whether that that party is going to be up or down, whatever it is, you try to wrap it in something that is more motherhood and apple pie for your organization, whatever your organization will be. And that&#39;s really, that&#39;s one of two tools you have. And Carter talks about the other tool too, which is saying, I&#39;m not going to play ball. And there are actually gradients of that because really what you&#39;re saying is I am going to cast dispersions on your race. The most extreme manifestation is I&#39;m not going to play ball. I&#39;m not even going to run next time, but there are manifestations all the way down to, I&#39;m going to express concern, I&#39;m going to kind of mutter behind the background that I think that this is not great, and it&#39;s not in the best interest of the party. And that&#39;s a calculation that some candidates decide to make for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes just because they&#39;re petty assholes, right? Sometimes because they think that that&#39;s going to allow them to sort of manage the narratives around there, and maybe makes up up some of the advantage they lost with the bad rules.

            <span class="text">Coalitions, yes, they&#39;re fluid, they&#39;re dynamic, you can have multiple of them. Give me your yes and or, you know, reupholster what Carter&#39;s kind of put on the table in terms of how you decide whether to advocate alone or advocate together. Yeah.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Well, I think that when you talk about coalitions, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind that it&#39;s not just the camps. It&#39;s also going to be interested organizations throughout the party. Think labor, think environmental groups who might be</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">interested in strengthening or their own interests or weakening another organization&#39;s interests. So you&#39;ve got to think kind of broadly when you think about coalitions for leadership rules. And you&#39;ve got to think again, going back to the model I put on the table there, right? Who decides who, you know, who influences and there&#39;s a lot of influential groups in any political party that can help change out some of those rules there. One of the things about coalitions, which I think is implicit, but I want to make explicit, is that it&#39;s not everybody, right? It&#39;s like it&#39;ll be a couple of people against one and you&#39;ll pick people off issue by issue. Because when there&#39;s a coalition of all of the camps, like all of the camps, somebody is wrong, right? Now, it might be the party. It might be something that&#39;s just so bad that it just damages the organization to a degree that all of the campaigns are... Or just like an</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">more likely, it means one of the camps has read things wrong, and they think something will help them, and it will not help them. So one of the fascinating things that you&#39;ve got to keep in mind is that nobody has perfect information. Everybody&#39;s got a game plan. And these game plans are going to be in conflict, but there&#39;s a certain fog of war, and you don&#39;t necessarily know everybody else&#39;s game plan. So let&#39;s just continue the example where Stephen and I are paired up on the idea of cash memberships. We don&#39;t want cash memberships, right? Oh, no, no, I don&#39;t want cash memberships. Cash memberships would be a real problem for me. Real problem for you too, Stephen, right? right?</span>

And what I should be thinking about is, if we came to you and you&#39;re like, I don&#39;t want cash memberships either, then we got a problem, right? But I don&#39;t know his strategy. He doesn&#39;t know my strategy. I might be thinking that cash memberships are bad for me. I might be wrong because it might be that the cash memberships that you&#39;re selling, even though they&#39;re yours, yours would have otherwise come to me, right? So, like, you just don&#39;t know. And you&#39;re trying to make calculations and you&#39;re trying to suss people out as they&#39;re moving along here. And that&#39;s kind of the art of it. You know, it&#39;s not clear cut.

            <span class="text">Here&#39;s a question I have, and this one is in your line of taking something implicit and making it explicit. When you are advocating for the rules, are you simply doing it from the eye of fairness, or are you trying to screw your competitors over? And I I guess in a party that has a dynamic of, you know, friendliness, like we&#39;re together, the tone of that, I&#39;m just trying to understand how much of this is cutthroat winning and how much of this is leveling the playing field. And I&#39;m curious to get your perspective on what rules advocacy looks like for each of you, Corey. Do you want to start me off on maybe taking something that, at least to me, is a bit implicit and turning it explicit in terms of what this fight is for?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, let&#39;s be clear.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you will likely there&#39;s gonna be two types of people i&#39;ll start here actually some people will just want fairness right and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they will say oh you know as long as it&#39;s an even playing field for everybody what that is is so on the eye of the beholder though and i think realistically there are advantages baked in or out there and so like they may feel they&#39;re just trying to be fair</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">somebody else might think that they&#39;re not being fair right there are people out there who are saying how can i get an advantage and it might not be entirely duplicitous it might be i think think this is best for the party and i think it&#39;s best for me our interests align here yeah yeah</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but that&#39;s an important point because the minute you are seen as trying to do something that is best for you but not best for the party you&#39;re in a lot of trouble right and then people are going to start saying you&#39;re just looking out for yourself and this is a little too crass and that can really affect those equations in terms of who decides and who influences right and you&#39;re going to have people say they are trying to do something that&#39;s clearly not interest in the interest of the party this kind of diminishes our view of all of their other requests along the way it makes them all suspect so there&#39;s a certain amount of like strategy that has to go in on that level too you never want to go so far out on a ledge that you&#39;re showing yourself to be a bad actor</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">even better just don&#39;t be a bad actor but like that&#39;s that&#39;s the reality that you&#39;re trying to deal with as you&#39;re trying to calculate carter right now is looking carter do you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">you do do you just not give a fuck and you you do what steven carter does which is like if i can like how hard do you And be honest with me here. How hard do you go and what&#39;s your stopping point when you say, listen, this actually might be self-defeating at some point?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I think that the number one thing is to always phrase it in the best interest of the party. But, you know, you have to fight for that which is in your best interest. And if you don&#39;t, you will lose, right? So there&#39;s some things that won&#39;t matter, right? So it&#39;s not like we&#39;re fighting on everything. There&#39;s going to be a cost-benefit analysis. So, for example, I was talking about membership length. How long do we have to sell memberships? Well, if you stop selling memberships, if you say, I really, really want a three-and-a-half-month membership selling process, and then the partner comes back and says, well, we can only give you three months. Well, you&#39;re not actually cutting off the last two weeks. The last two weeks will still be there. So you&#39;re only cutting off the first two weeks.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So that&#39;s really a small give. But there&#39;s other things that are much bigger gives, right? So, for example, are we doing a preferential ballot or are we doing points by ridings? I would fight to the death if it was a point by riding situation and I knew I was going to lose a point by riding, right?</span>
          </div>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Corey. I got to say, Carter has twigged another important point here, which is you might go into these conversations with one strategy in mind, but you don&#39;t need to follow the same strategy if the rules come out different, right? So you&#39;re doing calculations sort of on the spot too of saying, all right, well, for our strategy, I would have preferred, I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t know, like an eight month campaign like Stephen Carter got in the Redford campaign, right? But we don&#39;t have that now. So now what&#39;s our strategy? What are we going to do differently here? And we&#39;re going to move along. And so, you know, there&#39;s also a place for kind of adaptability and flexibility, and it&#39;s by definition the earliest possible days. So very few things are so fully baked that you can&#39;t adjust. You obviously need to be making calculations in kind of a final sense as to whether you think you can do this at all as rules change, but you can often adapt to rules that you perceive as disadvantageous.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">this is helpful and i&#39;ve got a few rules on the board but i&#39;ll just kind of quickly add this carter which is cory mentioned there&#39;s two types of people i&#39;ll also kind of use that same framing which is there&#39;s two types of people when they read the rules they&#39;ll look at it differently there&#39;s a type of person like you i would say not to kind of you know overly simplify you as a and make you a character carter but you look at the rules and you say what are the biggest wins for me what do i need to 100 fundamentally change so i can fucking screw someone else over or outright win. And there&#39;s others that would look at it and with a slightly different tone saying, what is actually what do I need to raise the floor on sort of things for me, rather than say, I&#39;m going to take this as an advantage and like, make sure this is protected or whatnot, what do I need to do to raise the floor on? And I guess, to me, do you see any advantage Carter, to aligning with different camps on that sort of worldview of how to look at the rules? Or is that an area where you go alone, you say, if we are going for the win, We are going to find certain things in here that we want to 100% preserve, fight to the death for it, and find other things that we&#39;re going to put all our eggs in maybe one or two baskets, not 15 of them, so that we can kind of raise the floor. We&#39;re going to go with two things and everything else we don&#39;t care because our determining factors are these two things. Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, you&#39;ve put a couple of different concepts out there. I&#39;m going to deal with the first one first, and that is this idea of how do we view the rules? I look at the rules as this is what I can do up to this point, right? So if the rules, for example, dictated that city councillors are able to put out signs up until May and June advertising events and that&#39;s allowed,</span>

I don&#39;t look for the intention. I look for what the rule says, and then I find my intention around it. Because</span>

            <span class="text">complaint of mine is that we&#39;ve moved more to rules-based systems than principles-based systems, where really it should be more about the intent. But the reality is we have, and so people will look at the rules and they will use them as a roadmap for what they&#39;re allowed to do. That&#39;s the simple reality of rules in 2024, right? One of the things that I i think is interesting about your question about trying to raise the floor is i&#39;ll just go back to that fair is in the eye of the beholder like like</span>

How important is that, whether you call it, you know, cliche, the elevator pitch or the persuasive story of how we should view this race? How important is it that each camp have their own version of that right now? Or it&#39;s actually not that important because, you know, you&#39;re not going to convince anyone. Everyone&#39;s going to just, you know, battle their own and their true beliefs or their own right. Right. Like, have you actually won over your competitors with your version of how you see theory of the race or the world through the party&#39;s eyes and say what&#39;s most fair for the party, even though it&#39;s actually most advantageous for you, Carter?

            <span class="text">challenger candidate from the environmental movement because the rules were set up in such a fashion that that candidate was highly likely to beat David Eby. If they had set the rules up properly, if David Eby had set the rules and determined, you know, for example, a leadership process of who can run, how much money do you need to put on the table in advance? What is your nomination process? Do you have to get signatures from X number of people, whatever it might be, that who can run component, if it had been done properly, would have precluded the woman that was ultimately disqualified. And that would have been such a much better outcome if the rules had precluded it rather than having her disqualified at a later date when she was already nine-tenths of the way into the leadership. And Jason Kenney, when he came in and took over the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta, his move could have been disqualified. His move could have been disqualified qualified at a number of different spots. His move could have been beaten if</span>

            <span class="text">if we&#39;d run the right rules. And I remember talking to that rules committee and the president of the party, whose name escapes me right now, and begging them to change the rules and explaining and trying to explain to them the unintended consequences of the actions that they were taking.</span>

            <span class="text">The unintended consequence of the action that they were taking was that Jason Kenney was going to win that leadership in about 15 minutes. Danielle Smith, another one where the rules dictated the outcome. The rules dictate the outcome. So if we know that the rules dictate the outcome, then we have to fight and push back and change them all the time. Because there&#39;s all kinds of examples, especially in the who can run, how much money is it going to cost, and what&#39;s the nomination process. Those three things are kind of like the first set of rules that will dictate the outcome.</span>

Which kind of gets me, and I&#39;ll preview this for both you guys and the listener, which kind of gets me closer to one of my ultimate questions on here, which is the candidate&#39;s actual involvement. As we get into the how, are they involved? Are they not involved? Do they keep their powder dry? What does the camp do? What does the candidate do? That&#39;s where I&#39;m going. But Corey, talk to me about when we talked about adaptability and flexibility, how do you look premier-esque, leader-esque, ready for the gig, but then also have an off-ramp on if the rules aren&#39;t in my favor, I&#39;m out of here sort of thing?</span>

            <span class="text">the reality is, there are rules that will just outright preclude people. You could easily imagine a party saying you must have been a member for five years, right? I mean, I don&#39;t know any party that&#39;s done that. But then obviously, your participation is contingent on it. You could have a rule that says you need endorsements from at least 10% of caucus, and maybe you don&#39;t have them. Maybe you&#39;re an outsider. Well, then your participation, you might declare as being contingent on how the rules go, too. And I think what becomes an interesting question for me is that these</span>

            <span class="text">Generally, there is a chance that the party is going to say we want the leadership candidate there. I&#39;ve seen that before in a couple of different contexts where they&#39;ve either said they have to be there or strongly recommended it in addition to their campaign manager or their campaign staff, whoever it may be. that&#39;s not atypical but i do agree with steven in those situations you generally want to avoid that if possible and if it&#39;s not possible you you want to let the talking occur by your campaign representative only fully because this is the same reason why i&#39;ve seen parties want this is the same reason why as a candidate you should not want to be there which is they want you there so that they can put you on the hook for this in the spot and be like hey you agreed to it whereas a candidate campaign manager can say, I got to check with my candidate, right? Which gives you guys the time needed to actually think through the decision and the consequences as it&#39;s there. So if you are forced to be in the room, reserve the right to say, got to think about that one, right? That&#39;s something I would say right off the bat. If you don&#39;t need to be in the room, don&#39;t be in the room. That&#39;s kind of organization 101. You always want a point of escalation. Stephen touched on on this if your campaign manager goes off the rails or has to get elbows up you can kind of tut tut it or even in the strongest cases sort of disavow and and move on but you can&#39;t disavow yourself yeah right and you can&#39;t undo that error if that error gets made so especially when you&#39;re getting into the fine detail work that&#39;s not candidate work for many many reasons carter</span>

            <span class="text">carter cory says this is not even this is not candidate work both of you would agree with that both have agreed with that. Let me test another assumption. Is this even campaign manager work? And the reason I ask that is, do you want someone even more disposable, even more removed, especially if you&#39;re going to kind of be a bit of a bully about these rules, kind of be prickly about them, you know, get more than maybe your hand slapped? Do you want someone that you can get rid of or demote so that you actually don&#39;t lose your campaign manager before the race even starts? Or am I i just overthinking it in terms of like strategic pitfalls sort of thing carter you&#39;re</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re overthinking it a bit because this same committee this same committee that&#39;s informally forming now to form to talk about the rules is also going to be the same committee that talks about the rules for the debates or the same committee that talks about the rules for the victory night party or the same committee so you need to put people in place now it doesn&#39;t need to be the campaign manager but it It should be someone who has negotiated, for example, I mean, I don&#39;t know that the NDP is going to have a big event at the end of this, but they will for sure have debates. So whoever&#39;s going to do your debate negotiation, I mean, imagine what happens if there&#39;s a televised debate. Who&#39;s going to do that debate negotiation, right? So it should be someone who&#39;s comfortable in the situation of negotiating all of those details. so for example I didn&#39;t play that role my first campaign I had someone else play that role who had more experience but by the end of you know like my most recent leadership campaigns I&#39;m doing that role because I</span>

So we are going to close ranks. And to Carter&#39;s point, that&#39;s probably the start of the end of your campaign, either in slow motion or fast motion, because people will start to see you as an invading force, a hostile thing that needs antibodies to take it out, because you are putting your interests ahead of that of our beloved political party.</span>

Um, that would be changing the rules significantly. And I&#39;m not sure that, that the party would be open to that, but if that, that&#39;s what I would be doing for Sarah is saying, okay, well, how do we get it down to a,</span>

And sometimes one of the benefits of an innovative idea like that particularly on the floor if you&#39;re going to think like a provincial council or really any governing body is people are going to be thinking about it for the first time and if you can get them to a well that&#39;s really fucking interesting oh that could be really exciting space the organizations that don&#39;t want this or don&#39;t even know that they don&#39;t want this might not have time to react to it so you know there&#39;s something to be said for novelty it&#39;s like when you&#39;re playing monopoly and you start doing like three-way trades and and all sorts of crazy shit nobody can see like there&#39;s just too much motion you can&#39;t even tell what&#39;s going on</span>

I&#39;m not sure which one. But, you know, that would be an area that perhaps if I thought that I could, if I could have like a lot of activity outside of the cities in particular, where memberships might be lower, if I was in sort of the southern parts of Calgary, where there&#39;s not much of an NDP organization, five memberships, five votes might become 100 votes just like that. And this goes back to my point about, you can almost calculate some of these things in crass vote terms and if you&#39;ve got good enough information you can make calls like that and so i&#39;d be curious if i was kathleen ganley to sort of explore things like that in terms of approach i think that you would want to sort of wrap yourself in the idea of trying</span>

And I&#39;m doing that largely by subtraction, right? Like, if you think about where the other organizations are, you have to think about where your benefit might be as well. But I also believe that, and we&#39;ve talked about this in the past, like, if she&#39;s going to be the person who sort of opens the doors and expands the tent and has that as her theory, well, then of course, you want rules that allow for that, right? That allow more people to come in and get engaged with with the organization. And so that, to me, is not a very exciting or interesting answer. But that&#39;s probably the answer.
