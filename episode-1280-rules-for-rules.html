        <p>Using the Alberta NDP contest as a launching off point, the gang discusses how leadership rules are formed - and what leadership camps can and should do to shape them.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss how the rules for leadership contests are set and how candidate camps should think about them and approach them. How are rules set? Are campaigns trying to get advantage or "level the playing field"? And this far past Stephen Carter's bedtime, can we trust anything that he says? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

And what I mean by navigate is, quite simply, advocate for rules that are in their favor. Try to even the scales, try to ensure that certain things that are beneficial to them, they make a case for. And I want to work this through with you guys in terms of a, what I&#39;d call a, I&#39;ve done this before, but a bit of like a biblical rule book. Let&#39;s go with some rules that you want to consider. And then from there on in, let&#39;s add a bit of nuance to them with the situation that perhaps some of these campaigns or these camps might find at hand. Corey, does that sound good to you?</div>

But ultimately, it all comes down to three questions if you&#39;re a leadership camp, and you&#39;re trying to determine your ability to change these rules, or you&#39;re trying to set these rules in an advantageous way for you. You need to understand who recommends the rules, You need to understand who decides the rules, and you need to understand who influences that decision. And so the who recommends, who decides, and who influences model is really how you can start thinking about how these rules actually get formalized at the end of the day.

And there are actually gradients of that because really what you&#39;re saying is I am going to cast dispersions on your race. The most extreme manifestation is I&#39;m not going to play ball. I&#39;m not even going to run next time, but there are manifestations all the way down to, I&#39;m going to express concern, I&#39;m going to kind of mutter behind the background that I think that this is not great, and it&#39;s not in the best interest of the party. And that&#39;s a calculation that some candidates decide to make for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes just because they&#39;re petty assholes, right? Sometimes because they think that that&#39;s going to allow them to sort of manage the narratives around there, and maybe makes up up some of the advantage they lost with the bad rules.

          <div class="said">Yeah. Well, I think that when you talk about coalitions, you&#39;ve got to keep in mind that it&#39;s not just the camps. It&#39;s also going to be interested organizations throughout the party. Think labor, think environmental groups who might be</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">interested in strengthening or their own interests or weakening another organization&#39;s interests. So you&#39;ve got to think kind of broadly when you think about coalitions for leadership rules. And you&#39;ve got to think again, going back to the model I put on the table there, right? Who decides who, you know, who influences and there&#39;s a lot of influential groups in any political party that can help change out some of those rules there. One of the things about coalitions, which I think is implicit, but I want to make explicit, is that it&#39;s not everybody, right? It&#39;s like it&#39;ll be a couple of people against one and you&#39;ll pick people off issue by issue. Because when there&#39;s a coalition of all of the camps, like all of the camps, somebody is wrong, right? Now, it might be the party. It might be something that&#39;s just so bad that it just damages the organization to a degree that all of the campaigns are... Or just like an</div>

          <div class="said">more likely, it means one of the camps has read things wrong, and they think something will help them, and it will not help them. So one of the fascinating things that you&#39;ve got to keep in mind is that nobody has perfect information. Everybody&#39;s got a game plan. And these game plans are going to be in conflict, but there&#39;s a certain fog of war, and you don&#39;t necessarily know everybody else&#39;s game plan. So let&#39;s just continue the example where Stephen and I are paired up on the idea of cash memberships. We don&#39;t want cash memberships, right? Oh, no, no, I don&#39;t want cash memberships. Cash memberships would be a real problem for me. Real problem for you too, Stephen, right? right?</div>

          <div class="said">Here&#39;s a question I have, and this one is in your line of taking something implicit and making it explicit. When you are advocating for the rules, are you simply doing it from the eye of fairness, or are you trying to screw your competitors over? And I I guess in a party that has a dynamic of, you know, friendliness, like we&#39;re together, the tone of that, I&#39;m just trying to understand how much of this is cutthroat winning and how much of this is leveling the playing field. And I&#39;m curious to get your perspective on what rules advocacy looks like for each of you, Corey. Do you want to start me off on maybe taking something that, at least to me, is a bit implicit and turning it explicit in terms of what this fight is for?</div>

          <div class="said">Well, I think that the number one thing is to always phrase it in the best interest of the party. But, you know, you have to fight for that which is in your best interest. And if you don&#39;t, you will lose, right? So there&#39;s some things that won&#39;t matter, right? So it&#39;s not like we&#39;re fighting on everything. There&#39;s going to be a cost-benefit analysis. So, for example, I was talking about membership length. How long do we have to sell memberships? Well, if you stop selling memberships, if you say, I really, really want a three-and-a-half-month membership selling process, and then the partner comes back and says, well, we can only give you three months. Well, you&#39;re not actually cutting off the last two weeks. The last two weeks will still be there. So you&#39;re only cutting off the first two weeks.</div>

          <div class="said">So that&#39;s really a small give. But there&#39;s other things that are much bigger gives, right?

          <div class="said">Corey. I got to say, Carter has twigged another important point here, which is you might go into these conversations with one strategy in mind, but you don&#39;t need to follow the same strategy if the rules come out different, right? So you&#39;re doing calculations sort of on the spot too of saying, all right, well, for our strategy, I would have preferred, I</div>

          <div class="said">I don&#39;t know, like an eight month campaign like Stephen Carter got in the Redford campaign, right? But we don&#39;t have that now. So now what&#39;s our strategy? What are we going to do differently here? And we&#39;re going to move along. And so, you know, there&#39;s also a place for kind of adaptability and flexibility, and it&#39;s by definition the earliest possible days. So very few things are so fully baked that you can&#39;t adjust. You obviously need to be making calculations in kind of a final sense as to whether you think you can do this at all as rules change, but you can often adapt to rules that you perceive as disadvantageous.</div>

          <div class="said">this is helpful and i&#39;ve got a few rules on the board but i&#39;ll just kind of quickly add this carter which is cory mentioned there&#39;s two types of people i&#39;ll also kind of use that same framing which is there&#39;s two types of people when they read the rules they&#39;ll look at it differently there&#39;s a type of person like you i would say not to kind of you know overly simplify you as a and make you a character carter but you look at the rules and you say what are the biggest wins for me what do i need to 100 fundamentally change so i can fucking screw someone else over or outright win. And there&#39;s others that would look at it and with a slightly different tone saying, what is actually what do I need to raise the floor on sort of things for me, rather than say, I&#39;m going to take this as an advantage and like, make sure this is protected or whatnot, what do I need to do to raise the floor on? And I guess, to me, do you see any advantage Carter, to aligning with different camps on that sort of worldview of how to look at the rules? Or is that an area where you go alone, you say, if we are going for the win, We are going to find certain things in here that we want to 100% preserve, fight to the death for it, and find other things that we&#39;re going to put all our eggs in maybe one or two baskets, not 15 of them, so that we can kind of raise the floor. We&#39;re going to go with two things and everything else we don&#39;t care because our determining factors are these two things. Yeah,</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, I mean, you&#39;ve put a couple of different concepts out there. I&#39;m going to deal with the first one first, and that is this idea of how do we view the rules? I look at the rules as this is what I can do up to this point, right? So if the rules, for example, dictated that city councillors are able to put out signs up until May and June advertising events and that&#39;s allowed,</div>

How important is that, whether you call it, you know, cliche, the elevator pitch or the persuasive story of how we should view this race? How important is it that each camp have their own version of that right now? Or it&#39;s actually not that important because, you know, you&#39;re not going to convince anyone. Everyone&#39;s going to just, you know, battle their own and their true beliefs or their own right. Right.

If they had set the rules up properly, if David Eby had set the rules and determined, you know, for example, a leadership process of who can run, how much money do you need to put on the table in advance? What is your nomination process? Do you have to get signatures from X number of people, whatever it might be, that who can run component, if it had been done properly, would have precluded the woman that was ultimately disqualified. And that would have been such a much better outcome if the rules had precluded it rather than having her disqualified at a later date when she was already nine-tenths of the way into the leadership. And Jason Kenney, when he came in and took over the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta, his move could have been disqualified.

Danielle Smith, another one where the rules dictated the outcome. The rules dictate the outcome. So if we know that the rules dictate the outcome, then we have to fight and push back and change them all the time. Because there&#39;s all kinds of examples, especially in the who can run, how much money is it going to cost, and what&#39;s the nomination process.

Which kind of gets me, and I&#39;ll preview this for both you guys and the listener, which kind of gets me closer to one of my ultimate questions on here, which is the candidate&#39;s actual involvement. As we get into the how, are they involved? Are they not involved? Do they keep their powder dry? What does the camp do? What does the candidate do? That&#39;s where I&#39;m going. But Corey, talk to me about when we talked about adaptability and flexibility, how do you look premier-esque, leader-esque, ready for the gig, but then also have an off-ramp on if the rules aren&#39;t in my favor, I&#39;m out of here sort of thing?</div>

I mean, I don&#39;t know any party that&#39;s done that. But then obviously, your participation is contingent on it. You could have a rule that says you need endorsements from at least 10% of caucus, and maybe you don&#39;t have them. Maybe you&#39;re an outsider. Well, then your participation, you might declare as being contingent on how the rules go, too. And I think what becomes an interesting question for me is that these</div>

          <div class="said">Generally, there is a chance that the party is going to say we want the leadership candidate there. I&#39;ve seen that before in a couple of different contexts where they&#39;ve either said they have to be there or strongly recommended it in addition to their campaign manager or their campaign staff, whoever it may be. that&#39;s not atypical but i do agree with steven in those situations you generally want to avoid that if possible and if it&#39;s not possible you you want to let the talking occur by your campaign representative only fully because this is the same reason why i&#39;ve seen parties want this is the same reason why as a candidate you should not want to be there which is they want you there so that they can put you on the hook for this in the spot and be like hey you agreed to it whereas a candidate campaign manager can say, I got to check with my candidate, right? Which gives you guys the time needed to actually think through the decision and the consequences as it&#39;s there. So if you are forced to be in the room, reserve the right to say, got to think about that one, right? That&#39;s something I would say right off the bat. If you don&#39;t need to be in the room, don&#39;t be in the room. That&#39;s kind of organization 101. You always want a point of escalation. Stephen touched on on this if your campaign manager goes off the rails or has to get elbows up you can kind of tut tut it or even in the strongest cases sort of disavow and and move on but you can&#39;t disavow yourself yeah right and you can&#39;t undo that error if that error gets made so especially when you&#39;re getting into the fine detail work that&#39;s not candidate work for many many reasons carter</div>

Is this even campaign manager work? And the reason I ask that is, do you want someone even more disposable, even more removed, especially if you&#39;re going to kind of be a bit of a bully about these rules, kind of be prickly about them, you know, get more than maybe your hand slapped? Do you want someone that you can get rid of or demote so that you actually don&#39;t lose your campaign manager before the race even starts? Or am I i just overthinking it in terms of like strategic pitfalls sort of thing carter you&#39;re</div>

          <div class="said">you&#39;re overthinking it a bit because this same committee this same committee that&#39;s informally forming now to form to talk about the rules is also going to be the same committee that talks about the rules for the debates or the same committee that talks about the rules for the victory night party or the same committee so you need to put people in place now it doesn&#39;t need to be the campaign manager but it It should be someone who has negotiated, for example, I mean, I don&#39;t know that the NDP is going to have a big event at the end of this, but they will for sure have debates. So whoever&#39;s going to do your debate negotiation, I mean, imagine what happens if there&#39;s a televised debate. Who&#39;s going to do that debate negotiation, right? So it should be someone who&#39;s comfortable in the situation of negotiating all of those details. so for example I didn&#39;t play that role my first campaign I had someone else play that role who had more experience but by the end of you know like my most recent leadership campaigns I&#39;m doing that role because I</div>

So we are going to close ranks.

And sometimes one of the benefits of an innovative idea like that particularly on the floor if you&#39;re going to think like a provincial council or really any governing body is people are going to be thinking about it for the first time and if you can get them to a well that&#39;s really fucking interesting oh that could be really exciting space the organizations that don&#39;t want this or don&#39;t even know that they don&#39;t want this might not have time to react to it so you know there&#39;s something to be said for novelty it&#39;s like when you&#39;re playing monopoly and you start doing like three-way trades and and all sorts of crazy shit nobody can see like there&#39;s just too much motion you can&#39;t even tell what&#39;s going on</div>

I&#39;m not sure which one. But, you know, that would be an area that perhaps if I thought that I could, if I could have like a lot of activity outside of the cities in particular, where memberships might be lower, if I was in sort of the southern parts of Calgary, where there&#39;s not much of an NDP organization, five memberships, five votes might become 100 votes just like that. And this goes back to my point about, you can almost calculate some of these things in crass vote terms and if you&#39;ve got good enough information you can make calls like that and so i&#39;d be curious if i was kathleen ganley to sort of explore things like that in terms of approach i think that you would want to sort of wrap yourself in the idea of trying</div>

And I&#39;m doing that largely by subtraction, right? Like, if you think about where the other organizations are, you have to think about where your benefit might be as well. But I also believe that, and we&#39;ve talked about this in the past, like, if she&#39;s going to be the person who sort of opens the doors and expands the tent and has that as her theory, well, then of course, you want rules that allow for that, right? That allow more people to come in and get engaged with with the organization. And so that, to me, is not a very exciting or interesting answer. But that&#39;s probably the answer.

Well, there is a party executive, there is a party, you know, senior staff person, there is a full staff of individuals who have different ideas, perhaps, but what&#39;s in the party&#39;s best interest, and they are going to either suddenly or not affect this outcome based on their own anxieties and desires. desires.

Or are you saying we&#39;re trying to build a party for the next election?

And I think that if you are in a party office and you&#39;re sort of finding yourself making those decisions, you&#39;ve got to sort of almost sort of check yourself and intellectually ask, is this what you really want for your organization?
