I just thought it was interesting, because I think that there was a really good opportunity to basically do what you just did and say, until such time as he&#39;s proven guilty, we&#39;re not going to determine that Trump is, in fact, an insurrectionist. That could have, I think, been part of this ruling ruling uh quite easily and or part of a separate ruling um but in fact it was just ignored by the justices and uh in colorado at least uh trump is an insurrectionist so that stands even though they&#39;re allowing him on on the ballot wow</span>

            <span class="text">it seemed like the court would just slap it down and say, no, of course, the president of the United States is subject to the law. And the very fact that this is being heard, it&#39;s not even just that this might result in them agreeing that presidents are kings and above the law and that the rule of law is subordinate to the whims of the person in the office, which in its own right is, I think, very strange. But it&#39;s that even by them discussing it, even by them hearing arguments, they&#39;re pushing off the D.C. trial. And so now there&#39;s like no chance that&#39;s going to be resolved before the election, pretty much. Is that the understanding? Well,</span>
