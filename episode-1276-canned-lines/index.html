        <p>New Ontario Liberal leader Bonnie Crombie described attack ads aimed at her as showing a "lack of civility". She also claimed she hadn't seen them. Zain demands to know: why do politicians do this - and is there a better way?</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss why politicians stick to standard scripts when faced with attack ads - and whether there might be a better script available. Is a leader bemoaning their opponent's attack ads the safe bet - or counterproductive? When playing defence, how can you tell if you should be  limiting communication or going on the offensive? And what's with all the Sonny Weaver Sr. erasure going on? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line and encourages listeners to vote at TellDave.ca.</em></p></blockquote>

          <div class="said">i just started the segment i was already like done the title so thank you carter for chiming in cory hogan i want to talk about i want to talk about responses to attack ads first of all we&#39;ve talked about polling uh and for those new to the segment i introduce an item that we see happen often in our political universe it could be a line of messaging It could be a political tactic, it could be a strategy. And I question the premise, why the fuck do we still do this? Corey, there&#39;s two parts to this. Number one, as politicians, we&#39;ve talked about this from the polling perspective, politicians will often refuse to say that they look at polling, that they&#39;ve seen the recent polling, that they&#39;ve heard about the polling, that there is a poll out there. They seem to have a similar manner about attack ads or ads about them out there, so to speak, which seems even more inexcusable because attack ads don&#39;t take a lot of absorption. They&#39;re usually 15 to 30 seconds of shit about you. You probably want to know what people are saying about you. Corey, politicians usually refuse to say that they&#39;ve watched them. And then they always have opinions about them. Their opinions usually range from, I haven&#39;t seen them, but comma, you know, I want to run a positive campaign. I, you know, we need more and more civility. We need, you know, I&#39;m not here to get into the mud. I&#39;m here to kind of take the moral high ground. Corey, the question is, why the fuck do we still do this, knowing the new rules of politics? And let me show you our most recent example of both of those things, Corey. Bonnie Crombie. The Ontario PCs are running attack ads against her. We know that they are. They&#39;ve put money behind these attack ads. These spots seem relatively generic in terms of, you know, this is someone who&#39;s an insider, wants to cash in her paycheck. The content of them is kind of almost irrelevant to a certain degree, because we&#39;re not going into an ad analysis. That&#39;s not what I want to do here. But a response, Corey, highlights exactly the two things I&#39;m talking about. Number one, I haven&#39;t seen them. But number two, man, do I have opinions about them? And she goes down the path of civility and trying to be above the fray, etc. Corey, this is a tried and tested script. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an effective one. Why the fuck do we? Yeah,</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah, well, let&#39;s just start with the basic vibe around attack ads, because that is where this starts. And that&#39;s that you&#39;re supposed to not like them. politicians always tut tut the other other person&#39;s attack ads they&#39;ll always describe their own attack ads as not attack ads no i&#39;m just raising important contrasts important questions whatever the situation might be and so uh you know and that is somewhat rooted on this very shallow if you polled somebody i guess what i&#39;m trying to say is if you polled the electorate they would say they don&#39;t like attack ads doesn&#39;t</div>

          <div class="said">doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not effective we&#39;ve talked about this this a hundred times. And we&#39;ll talk about it a hundred more. So in some ways, the easiest answer to your question, Zane, is they say they don&#39;t like attack ads because they know voters don&#39;t like attack ads. And it&#39;s the easiest way that they can kind of align themselves with it and tut-tut and get like an easy point on them.</div>

          <div class="said">But to kind of expand on it a little bit and talk about what you were saying in terms of, you know, this notion, like they&#39;re supposed to have not seen this 15 second clip about themselves like yeah look if if that&#39;s your approach to life if if you live a life of active information avoidance to the point where you won&#39;t watch a 15 second hit on you about your job i mean you&#39;re not very good at your job and i don&#39;t really trust you to do anything you&#39;re probably the kind of person who doesn&#39;t open bank statements to come to your house too right so oh like i sort of agree like it&#39;s kind of a dumb thing for a politician to say but nobody&#39;s going to take them to task on it because who&#39;s going to stand up and you know only the person who put out the attack ad is going to stand up and say the attack ad&#39;s good and they&#39;re going to say it&#39;s good because it&#39;s not even an attack ad it&#39;s raising important questions it&#39;s bringing contrast for it&#39;s just her record it&#39;s not an attack ad right carter</div>

And I feel like we see that quite often, right? Where there&#39;s like a charge on the table, there&#39;s these attack ads, I haven&#39;t watched it. I&#39;m rejecting the premise of the fact that we can discuss the content of this attack ad, right? I&#39;m putting that aside. Rather, this is about civility. Versus actually saying that, you know, that concept of rejecting the premise should be used sparingly, and that there is political value about going at something directly, using Using that and saying, you know what, they said this about this attack. Fuck these. This is not true. Here&#39;s what could happen. I&#39;m kind of curious if that also plays into it, because, you know, the safe opportunity now seems to be one person said X.

But like I&#39;m not actually sure that&#39;s what your goal is in this situation, right? The goal is to kind of minimalize and move on. But why is the goal always to minimalize and move on or to neutralize? Why is that the goal? Because it&#39;s not your message box. Because you don&#39;t repeat the charge, right? Yeah, you never do. Carter&#39;s right. right it&#39;s not your message box and you&#39;re sitting there and all of a sudden you know it&#39;s like the classic like make them deny they&#39;re a pig fucker right would she have been better served by 30 minutes of her explaining how she wasn&#39;t in it for the money</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, how do you know – and this is related to what Cordy is talking about – how do you know if you have or are working with a politician that you can provide that runway to, that grace to? And we often kind of say, let X be X, right? Right. Like let, you know, West Wing, let Bartlett be Bartlett or let like, you know, let this person be who they are. How do you know who if you have that person that they can hit, so to speak? Like this is kind of like a question that that I think often there&#39;s a lot of regret in politics that I&#39;ve heard from politicians or political staffers being like, fuck, we control them too much. We didn&#39;t let them be who they are. We hear that regret all the time, like all the time. um how do you know if you&#39;ve got someone that you that you should allow to just do what they need to do even if it&#39;s one out of every where whatever is a miss well</div>
