        <p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the other parties in Alberta. Are the PCs bankrupt? What's the best path forward for Brian Jean? And is Greg Clark turning the Alberta Party into a bloodless technocracy? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>
