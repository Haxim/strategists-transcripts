And like every piece of merchandise, if you buy it, this is hard to believe for this particular one, Corey does lose money. The overhead on this $99 is actually quite significant for us. So Corey will lose money on this piece of merchandise as well. So please buy. Buy for your friends. Buy for your family. There&#39;s conceptual lunch as one of the prizes. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good prize or not, but it&#39;s conceptually available. Okay? You can play golf. Yeah. With your friends, bring eight. It doesn&#39;t have to be a foursome. It could be an eightsome in your mind when you play golf. I mean, just do it, right? It&#39;s available. It&#39;s ready. And I&#39;m excited. We hope your favorite podcast is better than Curse of Politics, better than anything CBC has ever produced. Right, Carter?</div>

            <div class="said">We&#39;re going to jump into Daniel Smith and Tyler Shandro. Corey, the Alberta government is taking steps to oppose federal firearms prohibition legislation and the potential seizure of thousands of assault-style weapons. Since May 2020, when the Trudeau government prohibited more than 1,500 different models of assault-style firearms from being used or sold in Canada, the Alberta Justice Minister has said that he is telling Albertans or suggesting that RCMP officers act as confiscation agents, and that they do not act upon those that have legally obtained these firearms. In fact, saying don&#39;t act on the federal guidance, don&#39;t act on the federal law in this particular case. Corey, I want to talk about the facts about the situation, and then I want to talk about the politics. There&#39;s a few key players here. There&#39;s Danielle Smith in the UCP. Of course, there&#39;s Tyler Shandro himself as Justice Minister, and there&#39;s, of course, the Trudeau government. But Corey, your initial take on this announcement being timed right now and its political upside for the UCP, Daniel Smith and Talish Andrew.</div>

If the feds took the bait, where would this be? And I&#39;m curious to hear your answer on this, because I think it&#39;s a really interesting question. If the feds said, fuck it, we can get a few political points for slagging Alberta a bit. We&#39;ll look strong to the rest of the country. We&#39;ll look like we&#39;re telling them to go fuck themselves with their sovereignty act. What ends up happening? Game that out for me. Where do the pieces on the board land in your mind?

But what that ultimately means, the risk there, Carter, seems to be that he may not run out the clock, right? That there might be some time left on the clock, and then he has to make a reactionary move versus saying, I&#39;ve got a red line, I will interject, but it&#39;s going to be on my terms. That seems to be the two, maybe not entirely distinct, but those seem to be the two lanes or the two doors that Trudeau has to pick at some point on this particular battle with Alberta and this premier is it not so</div>
