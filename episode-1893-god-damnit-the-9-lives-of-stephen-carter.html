We were able to do things that other campaigns couldn&#39;t do because we had ground game in 13 of the 14 wards. So we had our brochure distribution, I think, was better. I think our door knocking was better. I think our ability to do a ground game was better. And it actually showed itself in the councillor races, not in the mayor&#39;s race. Our councillors got about 25,000 more votes than the mayor&#39;s race got. So I think that we were able to capture people in a different way with the councillor races.
