            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter. Welcome to the show. Why do you think it takes me 10 minutes to ask a question? There&#39;s no advance notice, even for me. No idea where this thing is going, which is why today we have got the help of people much smarter than Stephen Carter. Yes, it&#39;s the patrons who have asked questions for our mailbag. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s going to work. We&#39;ve got a bunch of questions. We&#39;re not going to get through all of them. However, we&#39;ve got them in what, Corey, you&#39;d call what? Comment format on a post that we&#39;ve made on Patreon. So we&#39;re going to scroll through these comments. I&#39;m going to start us off with the questions that I find interesting, and then I&#39;ll let let you jump in. Which question do you want to go with, Corey, Carter? You can jump in. We&#39;ll do a round, Robin, until</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">until we wear out the clock. So maybe about three hours or so until we wear out this clock or until Steven gets less entertaining, which if we were keeping that metric, we would be done the podcast by now. Really upset.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">it on to our first segment. Our first segment, the mandated mailbag. Here we are, guys. Across the board, we&#39;ve got questions from our listeners. And there&#39;s so many intriguing ones, so many deep dive opportunities, so many that are just trying to ask for clarification. But Carter, I want to start with this. And it&#39;s a question you&#39;ve actually... It&#39;s actually a question right at the top of the list, but it&#39;s a question that I think is a softball that can really get you going, Stephen Carter, right? Because really get the blood pumping. Stephen Carter, there are so many political books in Canada. This person, Pat, wants to know what is your favorite, and I&#39;m going to add a part to it, and why.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I know you&#39;ve consumed a lot of the the political literature in this country. Some of it, you know, biographical, some of it autobiographical, some of it about the campaign life, some of it about the policy life. Tell me what your favorite political book is and why.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, I&#39;d love it to be something new because, you know, I like to read and I read some books last year, but it&#39;s nothing new. It is in fact old and it&#39;s not a single book. It is a pair of books, although I may add in a couple of honorable mentions. Actually, I will. I&#39;ll add in an honorable mention. Primary Colors by anonymous who turned out to be joe klein um is one of the most entertaining reads you can have doesn&#39;t teach you specifically about canadian politics so i have to pull it away uh from this contest but there are two books both by steve steve pakin of tvo fame uh they are the life and um the dark side the life we&#39;ve talked about these on the pod before i still think they&#39;re the the best books about canadian politics the life explains what it is like um why people are drawn into the arena of politics and it really shows how people can do the you know politics for the betterment of their society the betterment of each other i love that book and then there&#39;s the dark side and the dark side does a great job of outlining what happens to politicians after they&#39;re done because once politicians are done it is not a life of riches and it&#39;s not a life of of um you know high profile for some absolutely but for most they just go back to their lives that they had before and in fact are often dropped down um many levels uh because they are no longer the people that be you know people go to to ask for favors to ask for things in fact they become the forgotten uh the forgotten few uh which is why we see so many people trying to to hang on to a life of politics afterwards those two books anybody who&#39;s going to run any any person who&#39;s got someone someone in their life that&#39;s running, they need to read those two books. They are outstanding. Steve Bacon.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Corey, I know you have a tough time reading because most things come to you via osmosis or you make them up with a white man&#39;s confidence that we generally believe on this podcast. But should you consume a book on the politics, one might say, what would it be, Corey?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So there&#39;s a couple of books that I&#39;ve enjoyed over the years on Canadian politics. To be honest, it&#39;s something I read more when I was younger, when it was kind of an abstract fascination. It was this distant thing. I thought it was this really like cool, glamorous thing, you know, in some way, shape or form. And then I</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">I worked in it and I learned better. But there&#39;s one book that kind of bridges both reality and kind of that outsider looking in really, really fascinating. It&#39;s a book from 1988. It&#39;s called Reign of Error. It&#39;s by Greg Weston. And it&#39;s all about John Turner&#39;s leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">from him being the golden boy who was supposed to come in and just, you know, dominate to, of course, getting trounced in the 84 election. And then the leadership review after that and through. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s got a lot of vignettes, shall we say. And I was just looking on Amazon.ca right now, you can get a new copy from $72 or a used one from $12. That sounds,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s like, that&#39;s less than two flare airline flights, to be honest. So I&#39;d go for it. I&#39;d go for it. At least with that book, you can guarantee it&#39;s going to get there. Can</span>

            <span class="text">Yo, just learned. And let me tell you something, Carter. Yeah. In true Zane Velgey form, I&#39;m just going to copy what you guys said. So, the dark side, I&#39;m joking. Two books that I think are really interesting. The first one, How to Win an Election, an ancient guide for modern politics by Cicero. it&#39;s really interesting tells you how much has not changed around persuasion organizing some of the core principles and the second one which i&#39;m sure several people have heard of uh came out about five years ago now called victory lab by sasha eisenberg which talks about the deep dive into politics most practitioners have a decent sense of this but i would recommend his next book that he wrote i believe it&#39;s called the engagement which goes into a deep dive on um the the fight for gay marriage in the United States and the political tactics and strategies that were used to effectively, in a very short period of time, in the broader political sense, turn the tide of public opinion so quickly. So I would recommend, I guess those two or those three as my recommendations. Great</span>

            <span class="text">given that job up a long long time ago. And I think people have noticed. But Corey, I feel like your description, I have to say, of strategy and tactics and the difference between the two is actually one of the best I&#39;ve heard. I&#39;m not just pumping your tires. I think it&#39;s one of the best and clear-eyed I&#39;ve heard in this broader sort of communications marketing realm. So do you want to try to give that a go? And then we can kind of get into what I think is the fun part of that question around who nailed it on strategy and who kind of failed it on tactics.</span>

            <span class="text">yeah i mean now i&#39;m afraid i&#39;m going to give a different definition than what i gave last be consistent there&#39;s lots of definitions consistent strategy and tactics right and i tend to use the ones from the ghost framework of strategic planning which is goals objective strategy and tactics and strategies is generally at a high level how you approach your work and meet your objectives and tactics is at a detail level how you approach your work and and address your tactics so a strategy would be something like uh it is our strategy to always paint the opposition as tied to the federal ndp and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you know it&#39;s always laddering up towards your objectives it allows you to stay on course it allows you to shorthand and quickly decide how how you&#39;re going to act. And so it should be broad enough to be used in a variety of circumstances. And a tactic is just a tactic. It&#39;s a one-off thing, but it&#39;s in service of a strategy or</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="text">Carter, Corey&#39;s definition is good. His examples are good. You, for the longest time, for longer than both of us, in a rare moment of of sincerity, have kind of held this position as campaign strategists. In fact, I&#39;d argue you were one of the first in the country to kind of like do this job full time in like a real meaningful way, at least in the era of politics that Corey and I maybe have practiced in.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And you&#39;ve been very clear that you&#39;re a strategist that you don&#39;t, but you&#39;ve also jumped into the management, which has been a lot of tactics side. In your sort of framework of how you&#39;ve operated as a practitioner, expand</span>

            <span class="text">expand on Corey&#39;s definition here and help the listeners listeners understand, you know, how you&#39;ve kind of parsed these out, because there&#39;s a bit of a nuance to them. And often, even in our world, we have to kind of sometimes step back and be like, is that a strategy or a tactic in some ways? Yeah,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, I mean, I think that the big definer of a strategy versus an objective versus a tactic is the timeline of them, right? So the strategy is going to be in our world campaign long, right? So we do campaigns. So the strategies tend to be relatively short-lived uh the longest campaigns that we tend to see are about two years and those are the presidential campaigns or a leadership campaign so you would devise a series of strategies or a strategy that</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">that that encompasses that entire time frame and then like cory says what you want to see are tactics and and smaller objectives so the tactics will support the objectives um those tactics are going to be compared to the strategies all the time is this actually what we wanted. So one of the strategies might be to create a brand for</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">for the candidate that shows that they&#39;re approachable, or that they have knowledge, or that they are a specific type of person, then you would always make sure that every video you put out, make sure that they appear approachable, right? So the tactic of the video is then compared to the overarching strategy, did we make them look, you know, approachable? Or did we make them look knowledgeable? Or did Did we make them look like Pierre Palliev, which is neither approachable nor knowledgeable? So, I mean, each one of those things is a strategy that then governs the tactics. And, you know, for me, I&#39;ve always thought, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">you know, for me, I have a difficult time actually articulating what the tactics necessarily need to look like, right? I&#39;ll say, you know, we should do, we should make sure that we&#39;ve got a good solid ground game.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">And then for me, in my head, it&#39;s over. well you know and then there&#39;s a group of people who are really good at tactics and they will come in and they will break that into 300</span>

            <span class="text">to win that election, we believe we need to have 20,000 voters on a list for election day. That becomes your objective. The strategies then become how you get those 20,000 people on a list, right? Just to give you an example from a local campaign. So it might be, we&#39;re going to have, you know, door knocking, we&#39;re going to emphasize door to door contact, or a strategy might be, we&#39;re going to emphasize the phones, or we&#39;re going to emphasize the internet, but those are strategies. And then the tactics underneath are the specific ways you do that. So say your strategy was you&#39;re going to, you&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;re going to get in front of as many voters as possible. That&#39;s your strategy. Well, then your tactics would be door knocking. And we&#39;re going to do that via getting our volunteer people out every day, calling these people making it happen. But the thing I want to underline here, I mean, that&#39;s in some ways just background is you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you don&#39;t need to define something as a strategy to have a strategy. What we talk about a lot in strategic circles is the idea of intended strategy versus unintended strategy, or deliberate strategy versus emergent strategy, if you&#39;re going to be more charitable and the and it&#39;s like whatever you do the sum of it and how you&#39;ve acted could be defined as your strategy and what separates a good campaign from a bad campaign you know the whole ethos of this whole bloody show is if you&#39;re thoughtful about strategy you&#39;re going to have better outcomes right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right so we try to be deliberate about strategy we drop it if it&#39;s not working we want to be nimble we still want to be able to take those emergent strategies when and they happen. But ultimately, the idea is, we&#39;re</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">we&#39;re trying to get somewhere. And we&#39;re trying to define where we&#39;re getting. And we&#39;re trying to act intentionally towards getting towards that goal. So where, you know, more amateurish campaigns might end up is just saying, we want to win an election. And they just do a bunch of stuff. They just knock on a bunch of doors randomly.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">strategy. I mean, I can use a given example. Like we&#39;re doing voter contact for Kent Hare in 2015 or whatever, whatever the federal election was. Don&#39;t even remember because it&#39;s a long time ago now. But we&#39;re doing voter contact and the</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="text">you know, we said we&#39;re doing a voter contact campaign. We said that we would making sure that we went out and talked to as many people as possible. But the strategic choice, like when Corey talked about the numbers, you don&#39;t go to places that aren&#39;t going to vote for you. You go to the places that are most likely to vote for you. So that&#39;s a different operational choice than a strategic choice. The strategy is still higher. The operational piece comes in underneath it.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And, you know, in that example, Carter, your choice could have been, you know, your strategic choice could have been to say, we&#39;re actually going to run a persuasion campaign, that this is less about mobilization. We feel like our pathway has to be convincing at least a sliver of people that are currently either on the other side or inactive and persuade them to either vote or vote for us, right? And you could make that as a strategic choice, and everything you choose thereon after would tactically follow suit for that strategic choice you&#39;ve</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">you&#39;ve made. Yeah, so let me jump in there. Like, to win an election, you&#39;re going to need some number of votes. You&#39;re going to determine. It&#39;s all about math. And you may, you may, as part of your strategy, say, I&#39;m</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to try to play my two opponents off it. If it&#39;s a three-way race, try to keep them balanced, do the Doug Ford thing that can become part of your strategy, right? Never give somebody the role as main opponent, try to balance between it. You might be sitting there and saying, I need 20,000 votes. And I believe that everybody who&#39;s willing to vote for me right now sums up to 16,000. So I guess I better change 4,000 people&#39;s minds. That&#39;s going to be, you know, that&#39;s going to lead to certain strategic decisions as well. But the idea is this intentionality is the root of strategy. Now, there&#39;s a ton of different frameworks, though, and I don&#39;t want to suggest that there&#39;s only one. The idea is not that you call one thing a strategy and the other thing a tactic, and if you say otherwise, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Yes. It&#39;s that you&#39;re covering off all of these things as you go. Carter, finish this off.</span>

One strategy is to convert them to NDP voters. And a second strategy would be to ensure that they don&#39;t vote,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">right? Because they don&#39;t want to vote for you, the NDP, and they don&#39;t really want to vote for the UCP. And the only example that we&#39;ve seen of that is the 2012 Alberta election, which Stelmac ran against 12, I&#39;m sorry, 2007, 2008, somewhere we&#39;re in there. Stelmac versus Taft. 2008.</span>

And they do the things that would resonate with them. But almost by definition, if you&#39;re doing a campaign where you&#39;ve got to come to a different jurisdiction than the one you know well, you&#39;re winning in Edmonton, you&#39;re trying to win in Calgary, the things that win in Edmonton don&#39;t win in Calgary. If they did, you&#39;d already have Calgary, right? Right. I can see Carter desperately wants to get in here, but I&#39;m going to finish this thought. So you&#39;ve got to know, you know, have a certain humility to it and say, what can we learn? Let&#39;s do polling. Let&#39;s understand the accessible voter universe, not just our voters, not just the voters who will never vote for us. In fact, neither of those groups matter at all right now. Who are the movable people? Who are those people? David Coletta was identifying as kind of the hesitant UCP voters or the people who voted Rachel Notley in 2015 or the people who maybe are new to the province and haven&#39;t really decided what their provincial alignment is at this point. whatever you do that as however you define that and you probably in your polling want to be able to define it in kind of concentric circles out and you know have a theory of that then</span>

And in that book, he makes the case that people who have different value systems have very difficult times speaking to people of the other value system. He makes it very clear that the multiple value systems that we may all share are no better or no worse than the others. And I think that this is one of the problems that the NDP bring. The NDP brings in a really clear understanding of their own value system, but no understanding of how to communicate to people with different value systems and no no value placed on other people&#39;s values so they do not value when you differ in their opinion you they didn&#39;t they do not understand when you don&#39;t understand them and they want you to join not just if this is the same on the right wing as well this is the same with the wild rose and you and then the question that you were asking Zane is what have we seen the strategies that worked well I want to come back to it but bottom</span>

This one comes to us from Amanda. She&#39;s saying, I&#39;m interested behind the strategy of party-affiliated pundits on media and doing podcasts and talk shows. Why and how does the media use them? What shows do they try to book? What makes a good partisan pundit? I think that&#39;s really interesting. I can answer some part of that question. I&#39;ll throw it to you. I know during the election, this is a problem that many of the the national networks have with me in particular is that they can&#39;t place me in terms of what jersey color to wear. Because during the election, I believe the major networks have to assign a red, a blue and an orange at minimum and have to report that back that they got the same amount of air time. So that, you know, mushy progressive label that I generally wear doesn&#39;t usually work. So there are times during our election cycle where there is a mandate. But I want to throw this over to you guys. It&#39;s less about me, more about you guys. Corey, what makes a good one? How and best to use them? And why do they exist? That&#39;s the core of Amanda&#39;s question. I want to get you started on this one.</span>

Why do you only have conservatives? Why do you only have progressives? And so it becomes very easy for, you know, if you&#39;ve got to put on hours and hours of programming of political commentary a day to say, well, we&#39;re just balancing. We just balance it. We find 1-1-1, 1-1-1, throw in a green every now and then, throw in a block east every now and then, call it a day. Super easy, right? And it&#39;s somewhat inoculative, and it allows you to say we&#39;re doing kind of a balanced scan of all of these issues. And so I think that&#39;s why they do it. I mean, I don&#39;t actually work for one of these organizations. It would be amazing to ask Kathleen Petty a little bit, you know, behind the scenes, tell us exactly what goes into the composition here. but um what makes a good uh partisan pundit actually</span>

            <span class="text">some of the pundits that I respect the most, that I love being on with the most are folks, not just because we find common ground, but because they&#39;ve challenged their own sort of party quite often, whether it be an election or not. And I&#39;m thinking of folks like Tim Powers and others that I know we&#39;ve had an opportunity to, or Sean Spear, both conservatives who often disagree with modern conservatism. Ken Bozenkul being another one that I&#39;m throwing out three conservatives who&#39;ve kind of gone up against their party. But Cardinal, I&#39;ll pose the same question to you. Two, partisan</span>

            <span class="text">So their value to the party is that their talking points get out, right? So if you don&#39;t have a partisan pundit who gets your talking points out, then you&#39;ve missed being a part of that cycle. And every day is a new cycle, every day is a new topic, and you want someone putting forward your views.</span>

            <span class="text">Corey&#39;s point about what makes a good partisan pundit in his mind is someone who speaks their mind. Of course, that removes them from some of the party experiences, what the party feels like. I would argue that the best pundit is someone who looks like they&#39;re expressing their own mind while putting forth the party line.</span>

            <span class="text">What&#39;s the value to the party? The value to the party is talking points. The value to the party is reasonable people think the way that we think. So when we talk about Tim Powers, we&#39;re talking about a reasonable guy that everybody loves. Everybody loves Tim. He&#39;s saying that this is okay. It must be okay. Right? It must be okay. That&#39;s interesting.</span>

            <span class="text">interesting. You know, it&#39;s almost like if the party were to be, if the parties, and I kind of use this as a blanket statement, were to be more critical of themselves, their value should not necessarily be getting the talking points out, but lodging in the minds of the viewers, the sentiments, however it needs to be, that they care about, or the value systems that they care about, right? Which is that the talking points are just too literal and too linear versus, isn&#39;t it, the value systems? Would a political party, Carter, if you were working for the liberals and the war room in that morning at 9 a.m. sent an email out saying, this is what we want on the air, we&#39;ll let you figure out how to get there, Stephen Carter. Be witty, be funny, take a side door to it. Use your own words. Just make sure this sentiment is captured. Is that not better than repeat these talking points and make sure you get them in in the two minutes that you get of airtime on a 12 minute panel? Sure,</span>

            <span class="text">It doesn&#39;t matter. Let me return to that. Okay. I think that one of the things that I completely agree with Stephen on is that if you&#39;re going to be a pundit and a partisan pundit, you should feel like you&#39;re not a partisan pundit, right? It&#39;s that sense of reasonableness that you were talking about a minute ago there, Zane, where it&#39;s like, well, you know, normally I would agree with my friend here but i think in this case you know you want to get there in a way that seems organic uh so that people say oh that&#39;s a thoughtful way to do it no that doesn&#39;t seem like talking points that seems like a thoughtful person giving thoughtful commentary i i absolutely agree with that i don&#39;t do they matter oh man i don&#39;t know like who watches political shows without a without a team like without a thought in their head about it it&#39;s like genuinely</span>

            <span class="text">not and it&#39;s the same with twitter political twitter is not changing anybody&#39;s mind because everybody&#39;s already articulated their space and they are not undecided they are already decided they will not be changing their minds so the pundits on the shows are just putting out their points maybe they&#39;re trying to influence a media person maybe they&#39;re trying to influence something other than that or control a story or something like that. But most of the time, the stories aren&#39;t being controlled through these. It&#39;s just damage control. That&#39;s really all you&#39;re doing is just trying to make sure that shit doesn&#39;t get real. Because if shit gets real, you know, you the last thing you need is for this to be another story on the news, right?

Like, my sense is that it just doesn&#39;t work, right? It&#39;s why MSNBC is popular. It&#39;s why Fox News is popular.

            <span class="text">they have to be relatable they have to be bigger than life and that pushes them into positions it pushes them into um controversy and uh sometimes controversy is not bad especially when you&#39;re a leader of a uh of a large party right controversy that that stokes up your primary members is fantastic if it gets people on your side excited then controversy is great um you know daniel Smith with the Sovereignty Act, you know, she wins over a huge group of people by saying we&#39;re getting screwed over by Ottawa. It&#39;s the same line that Lougheed had. It&#39;s the same line that Romano had. It&#39;s the same line that, you know, every single premier that&#39;s successful is bringing that line and she&#39;s just brought a new flavor. So the controversy is, I think, part of the requirement of being the party leader. The only one who I think is relatively boring is Justin Trudeau, but he makes up for that with the celebrity side. He&#39;s still a celebrity. Nahed Nenshi was a celebrity. These people become something bigger than themselves, and that&#39;s what we want in the leaders that we elect.

We need to stop seesawing back and forth between extreme solutions or just absolutely obliterating the other side&#39;s policies when one side flips over and it goes into a new government.

It is right on the cusp. The NDP have an excellent candidate. They have the opportunity, I think, to shift. And frankly, without that riding, well, on all three of these ridings, the NDP has a struggle to form government in 2023. So Calgary-Glenmore, number one. Calgary-Acadia Acadia is number two. It was probably on the hold list for the UCP. I think the UCP think that they can win Acadia. It is currently where Justice Minister Tyler Shandro is</span>

And I&#39;d be very interested to see if there is any personal payback for for Tyler Shandro in Calgary, Acadia, because if that goes to the NDP, it was won by the NDP in 2015. But 2023 is a much different time, different vote totals. They have to get 50 percent plus one basically to win.</span>

There&#39;s one NDP riding in Lesser Slave Lake that probably can be one. It&#39;s currently UCP. That&#39;s it for outside of Calgary. Everything else needs to be one in Calgary. So when you&#39;re looking at three ridings that need to actually flip, and if they flip, because because the other thing is do you get 44 seats or do you get 50 seats and if you get 50 seats your government is just that much more stable you get 44 one person&#39;s crosses to be an independent and you&#39;re fucked so this is a this is a really to me it&#39;s really simple you got to win way more than expected in calgary and that&#39;s why acadia and fish creek are certainly interesting and you You have to get to at least the base, which means that Fish Creek or that Calgary Glenmore comes into play a little bit more.</span>

            <span class="text">to understand why we do like, what is it when we say we&#39;re going to do a voter identification campaign? And a voter identification campaign usually means going out and finding the people who have voted for you in the past and make or are planning to vote for you in the future, and then actually getting that vote out to the polls. That to me is the standard definition of a voter identification campaign. We use telephones, we use texts, we use emails, all</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">all those things. I think we&#39;re really used, you</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know, Sharae&#39;s campaign tried to use a voter identification campaign, but ultimately they were doing a momentum campaign that failed. And a momentum campaign is much different because the momentum campaign is trying to find people who are not necessarily talking to political operatives. They&#39;re the ones who don&#39;t answer the door when the doorbell rings, and it&#39;s either the Church of Latter-day Saints or whoever&#39;s ringing their doorbell, or the political people. And so they don&#39;t answer the phones, they don&#39;t answer the texts, they don&#39;t answer the doors,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">those people hear from others. So the way that the momentum campaign works is that old, what was it, Clairol campaign? I don&#39;t even remember. You tell two friends and they tell two friends and they tell two friends and you&#39;re getting momentum because you&#39;re being talked about outside of the traditional circle. And the best example I can come up with is Nahed Nenshi. In Nahed Nenshi&#39;s campaign in 2010, it was a textbook momentum campaign where his name meant more than voter identification. We had, I think, less than 6,000 people identified as voting for Nenshi, but we had 140,000 people ultimately cast their ballot for him. So that is the standard of a momentum campaign versus</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">versus the standard of a voter identification campaign. Now, why do I think there&#39;s problems in voter identification campaigns? People aren&#39;t answering the telephones. People aren&#39;t answering the doors. People don&#39;t answer their texts. If you can&#39;t talk to people and do the one-on-one contact from the campaign to</span>

          <div class="turn">

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And Carter, I&#39;m sure that has implications on your spend on a campaign as well, whether you&#39;re spending on conversion-based digital mediums to try to get emails on a list or you&#39;re spending to create what you&#39;d call mythology or brand or story with reach and frequency. So I suspect that one of the other sort of differences, whether implicit or to Corey&#39;s earlier point on strategy, whether you, you know, back yourself into it or deliberate about it is where you&#39;re putting your money in terms of any sort of advertising as well. Well,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, this is really where I mean, one of the hardest parts about working in the in this game right now is just trying to find a list with people&#39;s names on it. You know, who are you speaking to? I mean, there&#39;s a voter list in the provincial elections, but in municipal elections, the voter lists have been pulled. So you can&#39;t even do a voter identification game in the municipal. municipal. But if you&#39;re running a counselor campaign, certainly you can. You just go and door knock the 42,000 houses in your neighborhood and, you know, in that area that you&#39;re responding to. That is the epitome of a voter identification. So how much money you have will change how you spend it. You know, you can get people talking through the use of mass media and you can also get you know people talking through you know smaller activities smaller tactics we always used to target moms at the back in playgrounds moms in playgrounds I&#39;ve always thought is one of the most important areas that you can go to to get people talking about your campaign you know for years and years we always kind of made it out that the women were gossiping or in those say they&#39;re talking about important issues and they are those important issues are then then being decided amongst the group together. And that group can include men, it can include women, but the group at a school playground is demographically aligned, they are psychographically aligned, and they are geographically aligned, and they will therefore change their minds collectively. And I&#39;ll throw it over to young Mr. Hogan, who seems to have more to say. Corey, let&#39;s get you from the parking lot. What do you think, Corey?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">one of the things that I think needs to be underlined here is that, well, for a campaign like Mare, you may be put in a position where you&#39;re having to choose one or the other based on resource constraints. When you talk about a provincial campaign, when you talk about a federal campaign, they do both or they attempt to do both. Right. So we often talk about this in terms of air war and ground war. Right. So they are going to try to run that mass media campaign from Central. They&#39;re going to have the leaders tour. They&#39;re going to be trying to get on the news each night. They&#39;re going to be purchasing advertising. And that is one version. That is trying to build the momentum campaign. And you can see that happen. I mean, Rachel Notley did that in 2015 here in Alberta.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But they marry it with strong ground game. And the 2015 Liberals, I think, are the example here because that was still a party and an institution despite being in third for good chunks of that. And they had credible candidates on the ground. They had strong campaigns on the ground. They were raising a lot of money. And they went out and they identified their voters and they polled their voters on Election Day. So they did land and air. and</span>

Is he the right or best leader to keep the reins? I&#39;ll find the question here in a second, but get started on your thoughts on this against Pierre Polyev, because it&#39;s starting to gel at least a bit in terms of what the leadership slate looks like, Trudeau versus Polyev versus Singh versus May, in terms of the next election.</span>

And wait, could they just introduce this guy? And that&#39;s where the spirit of the question comes for me, is that people have seen a version of what Trudeau might be like in closed-door scenarios, or what he might be like as he governs the country, and there&#39;s at least a constituency of people that see that as a breath of fresh air, or if not an improvement, or even, to Carter&#39;s point, maybe not an improvement, but something different, something that might be more in line with where people&#39;s head is at. So that&#39;s where the spirit of the question comes for me, Corey, which is that there at least is a version on the table, a different Justin Trudeau. And is that reinvention holistically possible?

            <span class="text">Some people are just the person that they appear to be. Right? So if you&#39;re going to take Justin Trudeau... The thing with Justin Trudeau that always has driven me crazy is the thing that he appears to be is the is the high school drama teacher the the guy who always over emotes and always kind of reverts to the seriousness and when you saw that glimmer of hope in the testimony that he gave about the emergencies inquiry he emergencies act inquiry he looked and sounded different now can we make that his new persona i&#39;d love to try i think that if you were able to make that his new persona And to join in a little bit of what Corey said, put in this idea that there is a new Canada that is just within our grasp. If only we had four more years, if only we had four more years, here are the five things that we could do. And those five things are going to make sure, you know, we&#39;ve already done health care. We&#39;re already doing dental. We&#39;re already doing, you know, we&#39;re going to guarantee housing in</span>

You know, take a few months and have his hair go gray. I think that we want a gray-haired prime minister. I think that that would be good. So go for it.</span>

You know, we&#39;re talking about can he win and we&#39;re asked to sort of construct a path to victory and I guess I can do that. You know, I guess any of us can do that. We can just sort of draw it out.</span>

But you&#39;ve got to, this takes us, loops us right back to strategy, right? What are your goals? What are your objectives? That will determine your strategy. That will determine your tactics. And I just don&#39;t have a good enough line of sight. In some ways, he feels somewhat spent from a policy point of view, but</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, you make such a great point to finish us off here, because I don&#39;t know how many times you guys have been on a re-election campaign or a campaign or you&#39;re talking to friends that are on a re-election campaign, and you realize that despite the level of candidate quality, which is generally high, staff and leadership quality, which is generally high, that a lot of these campaigns miss out on the why we&#39;re doing this. the goals the objectives the strategy because it&#39;s like well fuck like re-election is up we&#39;ve got to run again and the why of what we&#39;re looking to accomplish uh usually turns out to be an expansion pack of what we&#39;ve already done uh more and better uh but you know and and and it&#39;s it&#39;s so fundamental and i think voters start to notice when you are starting to seek re-election just because not to tie in too many things from this episode just because it&#39;s the momentum thing to do too, because it&#39;s just like momentum pushes you to the next election. Okay, I guess we&#39;re running, and let&#39;s turn our eye to that, and okay, we&#39;re just going to tell them what we did and do more of it, versus actually saying, here&#39;s a clear-stated goal for Chapter 2. Here&#39;s a clear-stated goal for Chapter 3. Here&#39;s the story that we are now at this particular Act 1, Scene 3 of the story. We&#39;ve got a five-part sort of story we&#39;re here to tell you. We&#39;re at Part 2 of that story, right? And giving</span>

And Stephen Carter, there&#39;s only one question to rule them all. There&#39;s only one question I want to ask you. Stephen Carter, it&#39;s not on a scale of 1 to 10. It&#39;s not overrated, underrated. It is a fill-in-the-blanks on what Jean Charest should do next. Stephen Carter, lay it on us.</span>
