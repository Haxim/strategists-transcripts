What's the difference between strategy and tactics? Can "boring" politics make a return? What are the three most important ridings in Alberta's upcoming election? And, most importantly, what's Jean Charest's next move? Patreon subscribers, as always, pick the questions and keep everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote>

No idea where this thing is going, which is why today we have got the help of people much smarter than Stephen Carter. Yes, it&#39;s the patrons who have asked questions for our mailbag. Here&#39;s how it&#39;s going to work. We&#39;ve got a bunch of questions. We&#39;re not going to get through all of them. However, we&#39;ve got them in what, Corey, you&#39;d call what? Comment format on a post that we&#39;ve made on Patreon. So we&#39;re going to scroll through these comments. I&#39;m going to start us off with the questions that I find interesting, and then I&#39;ll let let you jump in. Which question do you want to go with, Corey, Carter? You can jump in.

And there&#39;s so many intriguing ones, so many deep dive opportunities, so many that are just trying to ask for clarification. But Carter, I want to start with this. And it&#39;s a question you&#39;ve actually... It&#39;s actually a question right at the top of the list, but it&#39;s a question that I think is a softball that can really get you going, Stephen Carter, right? Because really get the blood pumping. Stephen Carter, there are so many political books in Canada. This person, Pat, wants to know what is your favorite, and I&#39;m going to add a part to it, and why.</div>

It is in fact old and it&#39;s not a single book. It is a pair of books, although I may add in a couple of honorable mentions. Actually, I will. I&#39;ll add in an honorable mention. Primary Colors by anonymous who turned out to be joe klein um is one of the most entertaining reads you can have doesn&#39;t teach you specifically about canadian politics so i have to pull it away uh from this contest but there are two books both by steve steve pakin of tvo fame uh they are the life and um the dark side the life we&#39;ve talked about these on the pod before i still think they&#39;re the the best books about canadian politics the life explains what it is like um why people are drawn into the arena of politics and it really shows how people can do the you know politics for the betterment of their society the betterment of each other i love that book and then there&#39;s the dark side and the dark side does a great job of outlining what happens to politicians after they&#39;re done because once politicians are done it is not a life of riches and it&#39;s not a life of of um you know high profile for some absolutely but for most they just go back to their lives that they had before and in fact are often dropped down um many levels uh because they are no longer the people that be you know people go to to ask for favors to ask for things in fact they become the forgotten uh the forgotten few uh which is why we see so many people trying to to hang on to a life of politics afterwards those two books anybody who&#39;s going to run any any person who&#39;s got someone someone in their life that&#39;s running, they need to read those two books. They are outstanding. Steve Bacon.</div>

To be honest, it&#39;s something I read more when I was younger, when it was kind of an abstract fascination. It was this distant thing. I thought it was this really like cool, glamorous thing, you know, in some way, shape or form. And then I</div>

          <div class="said">I worked in it and I learned better. But there&#39;s one book that kind of bridges both reality and kind of that outsider looking in really, really fascinating. It&#39;s a book from 1988. It&#39;s called Reign of Error. It&#39;s by Greg Weston. And it&#39;s all about John Turner&#39;s leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada,</div>

Two books that I think are really interesting. The first one, How to Win an Election, an ancient guide for modern politics by Cicero. it&#39;s really interesting tells you how much has not changed around persuasion organizing some of the core principles and the second one which i&#39;m sure several people have heard of uh came out about five years ago now called victory lab by sasha eisenberg which talks about the deep dive into politics most practitioners have a decent sense of this but i would recommend his next book that he wrote i believe it&#39;s called the engagement which goes into a deep dive on um the the fight for gay marriage in the United States and the political tactics and strategies that were used to effectively, in a very short period of time, in the broader political sense, turn the tide of public opinion so quickly. So I would recommend, I guess those two or those three as my recommendations. Great</div>

So the strategy is going to be in our world campaign long, right? So we do campaigns. So the strategies tend to be relatively short-lived uh the longest campaigns that we tend to see are about two years and those are the presidential campaigns or a leadership campaign so you would devise a series of strategies or a strategy that</div>

Or did Did we make them look like Pierre Palliev, which is neither approachable nor knowledgeable? So, I mean, each one of those things is a strategy that then governs the tactics.

We feel like our pathway has to be convincing at least a sliver of people that are currently either on the other side or inactive and persuade them to either vote or vote for us, right?

You might be sitting there and saying, I need 20,000 votes. And I believe that everybody who&#39;s willing to vote for me right now sums up to 16,000. So I guess I better change 4,000 people&#39;s minds. That&#39;s going to be, you know, that&#39;s going to lead to certain strategic decisions as well. But the idea is this intentionality is the root of strategy. Now, there&#39;s a ton of different frameworks, though, and I don&#39;t want to suggest that there&#39;s only one. The idea is not that you call one thing a strategy and the other thing a tactic, and if you say otherwise, you&#39;re doing it wrong. Yes.

One strategy is to convert them to NDP voters. And a second strategy would be to ensure that they don&#39;t vote,</div>

If they did, you&#39;d already have Calgary, right? Right. I can see Carter desperately wants to get in here, but I&#39;m going to finish this thought. So you&#39;ve got to know, you know, have a certain humility to it and say, what can we learn? Let&#39;s do polling. Let&#39;s understand the accessible voter universe, not just our voters, not just the voters who will never vote for us. In fact, neither of those groups matter at all right now. Who are the movable people? Who are those people? David Coletta was identifying as kind of the hesitant UCP voters or the people who voted Rachel Notley in 2015 or the people who maybe are new to the province and haven&#39;t really decided what their provincial alignment is at this point. whatever you do that as however you define that and you probably in your polling want to be able to define it in kind of concentric circles out and you know have a theory of that then</div>

He makes it very clear that the multiple value systems that we may all share are no better or no worse than the others. And I think that this is one of the problems that the NDP bring. The NDP brings in a really clear understanding of their own value system, but no understanding of how to communicate to people with different value systems and no no value placed on other people&#39;s values so they do not value when you differ in their opinion you they didn&#39;t they do not understand when you don&#39;t understand them and they want you to join not just if this is the same on the right wing as well this is the same with the wild rose and you and then the question that you were asking Zane is what have we seen the strategies that worked well I want to come back to it but bottom</div>

          <div class="said">Oh, interesting. Okay, well, this one&#39;s a bit of philosophy and a bit of why this exists. And I think it&#39;s an interesting question. This one comes to us from Amanda. She&#39;s saying, I&#39;m interested behind the strategy of party-affiliated pundits on media and doing podcasts and talk shows. Why and how does the media use them? What shows do they try to book? What makes a good partisan pundit? I think that&#39;s really interesting. I can answer some part of that question. I&#39;ll throw it to you. I know during the election, this is a problem that many of the the national networks have with me in particular is that they can&#39;t place me in terms of what jersey color to wear. Because during the election, I believe the major networks have to assign a red, a blue and an orange at minimum and have to report that back that they got the same amount of air time. So that, you know, mushy progressive label that I generally wear doesn&#39;t usually work. So there are times during our election cycle where there is a mandate. But I want to throw this over to you guys. It&#39;s less about me, more about you guys. Corey, what makes a good one? How and best to use them? And why do they exist? That&#39;s the core of Amanda&#39;s question. I want to get you started on this one.</div>

Why do you only have conservatives? Why do you only have progressives? And so it becomes very easy for, you know, if you&#39;ve got to put on hours and hours of programming of political commentary a day to say, well, we&#39;re just balancing. We just balance it. We find 1-1-1, 1-1-1, throw in a green every now and then, throw in a block east every now and then, call it a day. Super easy, right? And it&#39;s somewhat inoculative, and it allows you to say we&#39;re doing kind of a balanced scan of all of these issues. And so I think that&#39;s why they do it. I mean, I don&#39;t actually work for one of these organizations.

Which is that the talking points are just too literal and too linear versus, isn&#39;t it, the value systems? Would a political party, Carter, if you were working for the liberals and the war room in that morning at 9 a.m. sent an email out saying, this is what we want on the air, we&#39;ll let you figure out how to get there, Stephen Carter. Be witty, be funny, take a side door to it. Use your own words. Just make sure this sentiment is captured. Is that not better than repeat these talking points and make sure you get them in in the two minutes that you get of airtime on a 12 minute panel? Sure,</div>

          <div class="said">they have to be relatable they have to be bigger than life and that pushes them into positions it pushes them into um controversy and uh sometimes controversy is not bad especially when you&#39;re a leader of a uh of a large party right controversy that that stokes up your primary members is fantastic if it gets people on your side excited then controversy is great um you know daniel Smith with the Sovereignty Act, you know, she wins over a huge group of people by saying we&#39;re getting screwed over by Ottawa. It&#39;s the same line that Lougheed had. It&#39;s the same line that Romano had. It&#39;s the same line that, you know, every single premier that&#39;s successful is bringing that line and she&#39;s just brought a new flavor. So the controversy is, I think, part of the requirement of being the party leader. The only one who I think is relatively boring is Justin Trudeau, but he makes up for that with the celebrity side. He&#39;s still a celebrity. Nahed Nenshi was a celebrity. These people become something bigger than themselves, and that&#39;s what we want in the leaders that we elect.

It is right on the cusp. The NDP have an excellent candidate. They have the opportunity, I think, to shift. And frankly, without that riding, well, on all three of these ridings, the NDP has a struggle to form government in 2023. So Calgary-Glenmore, number one. Calgary-Acadia Acadia is number two. It was probably on the hold list for the UCP. I think the UCP think that they can win Acadia. It is currently where Justice Minister Tyler Shandro is</div>

And I&#39;d be very interested to see if there is any personal payback for for Tyler Shandro in Calgary, Acadia, because if that goes to the NDP, it was won by the NDP in 2015. But 2023 is a much different time, different vote totals. They have to get 50 percent plus one basically to win.</div>

There&#39;s one NDP riding in Lesser Slave Lake that probably can be one. It&#39;s currently UCP. That&#39;s it for outside of Calgary. Everything else needs to be one in Calgary. So when you&#39;re looking at three ridings that need to actually flip, and if they flip, because because the other thing is do you get 44 seats or do you get 50 seats and if you get 50 seats your government is just that much more stable you get 44 one person&#39;s crosses to be an independent and you&#39;re fucked so this is a this is a really to me it&#39;s really simple you got to win way more than expected in calgary and that&#39;s why acadia and fish creek are certainly interesting and you You have to get to at least the base, which means that Fish Creek or that Calgary Glenmore comes into play a little bit more.</div>

          <div class="said">to understand why we do like, what is it when we say we&#39;re going to do a voter identification campaign? And a voter identification campaign usually means going out and finding the people who have voted for you in the past and make or are planning to vote for you in the future, and then actually getting that vote out to the polls. That to me is the standard definition of a voter identification campaign. We use telephones, we use texts, we use emails, all</div>

          </div>
          <div class="said">know, Sharae&#39;s campaign tried to use a voter identification campaign, but ultimately they were doing a momentum campaign that failed. And a momentum campaign is much different because the momentum campaign is trying to find people who are not necessarily talking to political operatives. They&#39;re the ones who don&#39;t answer the door when the doorbell rings, and it&#39;s either the Church of Latter-day Saints or whoever&#39;s ringing their doorbell, or the political people. And so they don&#39;t answer the phones, they don&#39;t answer the texts, they don&#39;t answer the doors,</div>

          <div class="said">those people hear from others. So the way that the momentum campaign works is that old, what was it, Clairol campaign? I don&#39;t even remember. You tell two friends and they tell two friends and they tell two friends and you&#39;re getting momentum because you&#39;re being talked about outside of the traditional circle. And the best example I can come up with is Nahed Nenshi. In Nahed Nenshi&#39;s campaign in 2010, it was a textbook momentum campaign where his name meant more than voter identification. We had, I think, less than 6,000 people identified as voting for Nenshi, but we had 140,000 people ultimately cast their ballot for him. So that is the standard of a momentum campaign versus</div>

So I suspect that one of the other sort of differences, whether implicit or to Corey&#39;s earlier point on strategy, whether you, you know, back yourself into it or deliberate about it is where you&#39;re putting your money in terms of any sort of advertising as well.

          <div class="said">Well, this is really where I mean, one of the hardest parts about working in the in this game right now is just trying to find a list with people&#39;s names on it. You know, who are you speaking to? I mean, there&#39;s a voter list in the provincial elections, but in municipal elections, the voter lists have been pulled. So you can&#39;t even do a voter identification game in the municipal. municipal. But if you&#39;re running a counselor campaign, certainly you can. You just go and door knock the 42,000 houses in your neighborhood and, you know, in that area that you&#39;re responding to. That is the epitome of a voter identification. So how much money you have will change how you spend it. You know, you can get people talking through the use of mass media and you can also get you know people talking through you know smaller activities smaller tactics we always used to target moms at the back in playgrounds moms in playgrounds I&#39;ve always thought is one of the most important areas that you can go to to get people talking about your campaign you know for years and years we always kind of made it out that the women were gossiping or in those say they&#39;re talking about important issues and they are those important issues are then then being decided amongst the group together. And that group can include men, it can include women, but the group at a school playground is demographically aligned, they are psychographically aligned, and they are geographically aligned, and they will therefore change their minds collectively. And I&#39;ll throw it over to young Mr. Hogan, who seems to have more to say. Corey, let&#39;s get you from the parking lot. What do you think, Corey?</div>

          <div class="said">one of the things that I think needs to be underlined here is that, well, for a campaign like Mare, you may be put in a position where you&#39;re having to choose one or the other based on resource constraints. When you talk about a provincial campaign, when you talk about a federal campaign, they do both or they attempt to do both. Right. So we often talk about this in terms of air war and ground war. Right. So they are going to try to run that mass media campaign from Central. They&#39;re going to have the leaders tour. They&#39;re going to be trying to get on the news each night. They&#39;re going to be purchasing advertising. And that is one version. That is trying to build the momentum campaign. And you can see that happen. I mean, Rachel Notley did that in 2015 here in Alberta.</div>

          <div class="said">But they marry it with strong ground game. And the 2015 Liberals, I think, are the example here because that was still a party and an institution despite being in third for good chunks of that. And they had credible candidates on the ground. They had strong campaigns on the ground. They were raising a lot of money. And they went out and they identified their voters and they polled their voters on Election Day. So they did land and air. and</div>

And wait, could they just introduce this guy? And that&#39;s where the spirit of the question comes for me, is that people have seen a version of what Trudeau might be like in closed-door scenarios, or what he might be like as he governs the country, and there&#39;s at least a constituency of people that see that as a breath of fresh air, or if not an improvement, or even, to Carter&#39;s point, maybe not an improvement, but something different, something that might be more in line with where people&#39;s head is at. So that&#39;s where the spirit of the question comes for me, Corey, which is that there at least is a version on the table, a different Justin Trudeau. And is that reinvention holistically possible?
