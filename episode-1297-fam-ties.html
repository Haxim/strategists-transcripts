        <div class="desc"><p>The gang do a deep dive into the Liberals' Gen Z problem and build a strategy for them to turn back Pierre Poilievre's strength with this demographic. Plus: Stephen Carter admits to never having heard of Family Matters and Zain Velji admits to never having heard of Family Ties.</p><blockquote><p><em>PATREON EXCLUSIVE. Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter do a strategy deep dive on how the Liberals can win - or win back - Millennial and Gen Z(ed) voters. Is younger demographic support for the Liberals destined to live or die on the issue of housing? Have the Liberals raised expectations on an issue they can't fix? And is it remotely plausible that Stephen has never heard of Steve Urkel? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

Let&#39;s start here with a bit of a deep dive. Why not? Trudeau is down with Gen Z and millennials, Carter. It&#39;s not looking good. In fact, we are seeing some polling that might be historic. It might not be historic. But Trudeau is not performing well with a group that liberals and progressive parties for a long time have counted to be in their corner. You&#39;re</div>

And you see that as part of Trudeau&#39;s ongoing pre-budget announcements. He&#39;s trying to appeal to this group. We discussed at length the credit score for rent, you know, which was definitely targeting at least certain folks of a certain vintage. But Carter, I think it&#39;s going to take more than one policy. I think it&#39;s going to take a whole strategy. And that&#39;s why this podcast exists, Carter.

Because there is a school of thought that Gen Z and millennials is not about what they actually want, but what they value, which is not always wanting something for themselves, but a broader sort of like, how you said it, how you did it, like the softer sort of approach. Or are we overthinking that? And, you know, progressives have perhaps for too long thought it&#39;s about value systems rather than actually giving people stuff.</div>

Oh, you know, I&#39;ve got to have a roommate, but only for another two years. Then we can start our family, me and my wife, right? Whatever it might be, you know, there are ways that you can bring forward the feeling of like getting this thing concluded before the thing is actually concluded. And I think in particular with housing, we have lots of models of these, you know, home sellers have been doing this forever, right? To make you feel really excited about the thing. you put a little bit of money down the big hit comes later the complexity comes later the pain comes later but the feeling like you&#39;ve really figured it out can be made pretty quick much quicker than the house carter thoughts on that yeah</div>

Like they can&#39;t just be like, yeah, we&#39;re building more houses in a vague sense. It&#39;s got to be no, okay, we&#39;re figuring out your specific pain point here right and maybe at the end of the day your circumstances change you don&#39;t want that house anymore the market shifts whatever it may be but the real block that the liberals have right now if you&#39;re a voter who literally cannot get shelter right</div>

I&#39;m talking about their needs in the most generic sense. Would you be selling plan and effort, or would you be selling track record of doing something in that domain? Let&#39;s say we found out what they need is X, Y, and Z. Would you say we are the right folks with the plan or would you be selling the track record for the couple of things you&#39;ve done in that particular domain? Oh, utilities, well, we did X, Y, and Z on utilities versus going forward, here&#39;s what we can do on utilities. It&#39;s a more comprehensive plan. How would you, and is there any difference how you&#39;d communicate with this group versus any other group? I guess this is what I&#39;m trying to get at. So number one, pick a lane between effort and track record and number two, any nuance or difference between this particular group and how you as a strategist would think about it?</div>

And those people who were impacted may remember. They probably don&#39;t. But if you want to actually succeed, you have to tell them that you&#39;re going to do something new. One of the big complaints I have with government is we don&#39;t kill enough programs. I think that we should kill way more programs so we can announce new programs. Because new programs are the only way that you&#39;re going to win people over. And old programs,</div>

But if you are not worried about winning on it, and if you don&#39;t have a self-destructive political ego, the easiest solution would have been to say, yes, we are going to do exactly what Pierre Polyev says.

Like in some definitions of millennial, you can be 45 and a millennial, right? So are you really a millennial? You know, I don&#39;t know, right? And for those reasons, like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s such imprecise language. People are driven by so many other things. Like you really have to ask yourself, like one of the things you will both recall that we often used to do in our old job at Hill and Knowlton is we would do like massive surveys on these issues and then we would survey them on all sorts of other things you know demographics geographics psychographics i used to tell people i would ask them if they were left-handed if i thought i could sell ads to people who were left-handed right like it was all about how you got in front of them but from there we would then do a recursive partitioning and we would try to find the variables that mattered right</div>
