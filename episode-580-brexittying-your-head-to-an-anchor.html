Is there anything the remain campaign could have done differently? And isn't "emergency podcast" a contradiction in terms?

But fast forward to the past month or so, and it was starting to look like an increasingly tight race. So for most of the year, it looked like Leave side, so the two sides are known as Remain and Leave. It looked like Leave was put to bed. It looked like Remain had a healthy Leave.</div>

          <div class="said">But then they started to see a real tightening of the pulse. Then Leave pulled ahead. Now, in the past week, Leave sort of, it looked like the tide had sort of hit its high watermark and it was pulling back. And everybody says, hey, you know, when you have a referendum like this, status quo, People break status quo at the last minute. So</div>
