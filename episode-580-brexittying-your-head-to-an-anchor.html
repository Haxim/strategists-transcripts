            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that wasn&#39;t really a big deal. So when Cameron, the Prime Minister of England, was running, he promised that he would hold a referendum on being in or out of the European Union, sort</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">sort of as a sop to the far right, UKIP, the UK Independence Party, and the right of the Conservative Party, who</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">who were becoming increasingly Eurosceptic, shall we say. Now, when he made that promise, Europe</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Europe wasn&#39;t the shit show that we know today with Greece and Italy and Spain and all of that. And it&#39;s safe to say Britain&#39;s became increasingly</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">increasingly skeptical. And I think around 2013, people started thinking, well, we might have a real problem here. I&#39;m playing a bit fast and loose with the dates. But fast forward to the past month or so, and it was starting to look like an increasingly tight race. So for most of the year, it looked like Leave side, so the two sides are known as Remain and Leave. It looked like Leave was put to bed. It looked like Remain had a healthy Leave.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But then they started to see a real tightening of the pulse. Then Leave pulled ahead. Now, in the past week, Leave sort of, it looked like the tide had sort of hit its high watermark and it was pulling back. And everybody says, hey, you know, when you have a referendum like this, status quo, People break status quo at the last minute. So</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So I think it&#39;s safe to say, and certainly the markets and the betting shops that the UK is famous for, all of them sort of thought that they were going to vote narrowly to stay in the European Union.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">That didn&#39;t fucking happen. They just called it in the past bit officially, although it&#39;s been clear for most of the night now. Leave has won. The UK is leaving the European Union. Now, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it is not really like if we voted to leave NAFTA. I think people know that, but let&#39;s just state it clear. To many Britons, this is</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">voting to break up a nascent nation. Like the European project, as it&#39;s widely known, just walking away from it is a big fucking deal. And the last time the UK had an opportunity to sort of give its opinion broadly through a referendum, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it was in 75. And it was very different then, of course. There was no European anthem. There was no European flag. all</span>

In many ways, London being used as sort of a metonym for the financial industry in the UK was more exposed than the United States even to some of that stuff. But the pound did not hit these lows.
