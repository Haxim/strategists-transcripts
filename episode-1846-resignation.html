Maybe Elizabeth May wins the election in like the upset of the century. I don&#39;t care.

Before I do that, let&#39;s talk about the liberals, as I mentioned. Carter, the candidates are already sort of popping up, dropping off. Dom LeBlanc, let&#39;s start there. He&#39;s not going to do it. Is that a big loss for the liberals? Or is he, Zane? Well, okay, so... No, keep asking. Keep asking your simple questions, and then I&#39;ll give you the good</span>

            <span class="text">good answer. Well, there is rumors that there&#39;s a group of folks inside the caucus trying to convince him even harder now to do it. Maybe that&#39;s strategic. Maybe that&#39;s devised, Carter. On the face of it, Donald LeBlanc not running, is that a loss for the liberals in this leadership race? Or do they have enough?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">No, I think that it is a loss. I think that there needed to be at least three or four strong candidates. And as you start to reduce the number of candidates that are going to be running in your race, it really hurts the party in general. not because in part because there&#39;s it is a short race um if you have five candidates all out there pushing memberships you&#39;re going to grow the base of the of the party more than when you only have two candidates out there pushing memberships um candidates do better than mps uh candidates do better than ministers so losing dominic leblanc is a a blow and uh i would say it&#39;s a blow again again directly caused by justin trudeau having to move his finance minister in the last two weeks go</span>

But each of those provincial organizations were wings of the original Liberal Party. Now, over the years, you know, Quebec, Alberta, Ontario, most of the provinces, but not all of the provinces, defederated, and their provincial, like, political parties separated from the federal party. And you ended up with a weird grab bag where in a province like Alberta, where there was an Alberta Liberal Party that was official opposition, they weren&#39;t associated with the federal Liberal Party.

            <span class="text">cory talked about political wastelands there&#39;s massive political wastelands where you can now get 15 people who will run the general election for you right now you have a guy maybe Maybe if you&#39;re lucky. And this is the way that you build a party is through a leadership race. And this idea that you want to have as few candidates as possible and a shorter period of time to actually sign up new members or supporters is ridiculous. You want those two things to be the entry to be as low as possible and the membership length as long as possible. Over to you, Corey, to correct me on anything that I&#39;ve said that you disagree with.</span>

I&#39;m going to summarize. So March 24th is the drop dead. He&#39;s saying March 15, 10 days or so. A month before that is the membership cutoff and a low-ish fee. Carter, do you have a number in mind? Is like 150 your number? 150. Okay, sure. So Carter&#39;s saying- If</span>

The premiers have already planned a trip in February where they&#39;re going to work their networks of Congress people and senators and other legislators to talk about this, and I believe government officials as well.

            <span class="text">Corey, I&#39;m not trying to drive you to a specific conclusion, but you could look at the premiers, you could look at Pierre Polyev, you could look at any of his leadership contestants in the Liberal Party. Same question to you, who stands the most to gain from what Justin Trudeau leaves behind in this short-term leadership vacuum that he does leave?</span>
