            <span class="text">want to go back to the winning of the majority of the states. sure he won the majority of the states that is true undeniable but he didn&#39;t he he won the majority of the delegates by a very small margin i think it&#39;s 20 actual delegates yeah that he has over top of ted cruz out of super tuesday so you had to you know cruz and rubio together got more more delegates than trump did on tuesday this is why their talk of the brokered convention is starting to be is starting to be heard because trump is not walking away with this hillary Hillary Clinton, as per my prediction, has basically secured the Super Tuesday nomination. No, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on. Let&#39;s go even a step further</span>

            <span class="text">Interesting. But I think that all three of these candidates have very different support bases. And because of that, you can see like you&#39;re not going to see Kasich supporters flooding to Rubio or Rubio flooding to Kasich. And no one&#39;s flooding to Crips. But because each of these pockets of support is distinct. I think each one of these candidates staying in is actually good for Trump. Unfortunately, we&#39;ve never had an election like this.

Now it seems like a desperate attempt to get more voices, and like Carter just mentioned on the tail end of his comments, potentially more candidates, whether they&#39;re in the race right now or not, to enter this field.

That which he said before the campaign obviously isn&#39;t true. And that which he says today tends to be politically expedient.

And ultimately, I feel that his best-case scenario is that he leaves as a prime minister who did nothing with 60% approval. I don&#39;t want that prime minister. I don&#39;t.

Basically, they are playing straight into the opposition&#39;s hands by, and so Brian Jean loses his mind, Brad Wall loses his mind because Quebec is going to do an injunction. They allow these words to get in their way, and they don&#39;t look at the underlying meaning of the word. This injunction does not change anything. This injunction does not force TransCanada into a process that is in any way going to shape the outcome of the national energy board process uh this needs to be recognized and it cannot be overreacted to and this is the problem is that brian gene and brad wall brad wall is going into election if anybody thinks this isn&#39;t about an election ploy brad wall uh wants to win this election he will win this election and then who knows maybe he throws his hat in the leadership for the conservatives yeah</span>
