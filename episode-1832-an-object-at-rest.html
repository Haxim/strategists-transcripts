            <span class="text">Corey, how would you help the rebellion become real again this week? And Carter&#39;s right, like to be charitable to this group, it was a Wednesday of last week, a week hasn&#39;t even passed, but it seems like it was a lead balloon in some ways. And maybe I&#39;m over-exaggerating and call me out on that if you feel like I am, but it It was not what it promised to be, especially given the run-up, right? The run-up of the hype machine on it was like all cameras on PNP and CTV were pointing towards this caucus meeting for the palace intrigue and the outcome of it, and then felt like a lead balloon. How would you help make it real this week, Corey? Carter&#39;s got his 20 public. Look, is</span>

So that&#39;s tough to orchestrate, but that is something that could be floating out there if the liberal party starts looking at it and saying, fuck, we don&#39;t have enough money to run this campaign.

I got to have something to talk about. Today, I got to say something. And it is often just the most random, stupid ass grab bag of things that you would ever possibly imagine. Like I remember the Alberta liberal campaign in 2008, which I wasn&#39;t- Like we all do. Yeah, which I wasn&#39;t deeply involved in. I was helping out on a couple of local campaigns, but the liberals held a rally on the Saturday day before the vote and they announced some sort of new farm policy and it&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s your closing argument that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to go with but the reality is they were doing a very conventional thing which is say something it&#39;s news people talk about us that&#39;s reminding people about us but that&#39;s not great like that&#39;s not great calm strategy and what pierre polyev understands is that you can have your cake and eat it too here you can make announcements if if those announcements ladder up into broader themes, you get the piece that becomes the news hook, but you don&#39;t get the cacophony. Instead, you get the symphony. You get this sense that it&#39;s all building towards something that&#39;s very logical. And so he has a couple of buckets, right? Axe the tax, build the homes, right? You see them in those little slogans in the YouTube six second ads that he&#39;s running all over Canada right now.</span>
