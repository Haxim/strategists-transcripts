I got to have something to talk about. Today, I got to say something. And it is often just the most random, stupid ass grab bag of things that you would ever possibly imagine. Like I remember the Alberta liberal campaign in 2008, which I wasn&#39;t- Like we all do. Yeah, which I wasn&#39;t deeply involved in. I was helping out on a couple of local campaigns, but the liberals held a rally on the Saturday day before the vote and they announced some sort of new farm policy and it&#39;s like that&#39;s that&#39;s your closing argument that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to go with but the reality is they were doing a very conventional thing which is say something it&#39;s news people talk about us that&#39;s reminding people about us but that&#39;s not great like that&#39;s not great calm strategy and what pierre polyev understands is that you can have your cake and eat it too here you can make announcements if if those announcements ladder up into broader themes, you get the piece that becomes the news hook, but you don&#39;t get the cacophony. Instead, you get the symphony. You get this sense that it&#39;s all building towards something that&#39;s very logical. And so he has a couple of buckets, right? Axe the tax, build the homes, right? You see them in those little slogans in the YouTube six second ads that he&#39;s running all over Canada right now.</div>

So where am I supposed to get my information? If I&#39;m a less engaged voter, where does information come from? Social networks barely exist in the fashion that they used to.
