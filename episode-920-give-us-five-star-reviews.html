        <div class="meta">March 1, 2021</div>
      

      
        <div class="desc"><p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about leader brand - how it's established, how it's applied and how it fits in with political tactics. How do you keep your brand current to what the public wants? Should Erin O'Toole be on TikTok? And most importantly, what's going on with vaccines in Canada this week and why does it make Corey so angry? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

They take the victory lap before the race is even done. There seems to be an element of that, which is perhaps the reason why I keep bringing this topic up, is not necessarily to track the vaccine numbers, but to track the political promise versus the political reality. In this case, it seems like a good news story with one vaccine approved, a second one perhaps coming online. Any advice you&#39;d have to the Trudeau government around their victory lap or how they message around the vaccination schedules and the vaccination timelines going forward, knowing that it&#39;s probably better news than it looked like, even based on their promise schedule that they had for March and September?</div>

So you just made one of the points earlier that it&#39;s now incumbent upon the government to talk about get whichever vaccines available to you. We still don&#39;t know how they&#39;re going to use AstraZeneca, for example. Are they going to use it under 65, as has been speculated by some professionals, etc.? What do you think the vaccine communication priority right now is for the government? Is it to take whatever vaccine you you can get? And where does this kind of stand in the sort of arc of communications for vaccine adoption that we&#39;ve been talking about iteratively on this podcast and this country, which is now like the two things I compare constantly, thanks to Corey, over the course of the last couple of months?

I think the government is taking the exact right line on the best vaccine is the one that you can get. And I think that the vaccination struggle right now is just making sure that the The vaccines are in people&#39;s arms, as many as possible, but also kind of going back to our vaccine hesitancy group, forgetting about the anti-vaxxers. Anti-vaxxers are anti-vaxxers. Don&#39;t even worry about them. But the vaccine hesitant group needs to hear all the stories of how well this is working and how everybody who&#39;s got this has got a positive outcome. The thing that I would like to start seeing discussed is a conversation. I&#39;m not saying this is the right thing, but a conversation about will we have vaccine passports?

And has the last couple of years changed what the red lines are in the political atmosphere? So, Carter, let&#39;s just start here. As we go into, I shouldn&#39;t say a full deep dive, but what are some branding principles that when you&#39;re talking to a candidate, you&#39;re discussing with them and saying, this is how you want to brand yourself. These are some of the larger sort of elements to consider when putting your, I was going to say personality, but maybe you can kind of even jump on this, your persona out online for the Canadian public. What are some broad principles? We&#39;ll start there, and then I want to have a more deeper conversation about each of the leaders as they brand themselves heading into election season.</div>

          <div class="said">let&#39;s talk about the first first, because that&#39;s what my advice would be to absolutely anybody. Before you decide through which channels you want to convey your message, you need to understand what your message is. And when you&#39;re setting your own brand, now, it would be nice to say everybody&#39;s brand should just be authentically who they are, right? But as a politician, you need to lean into certain elements of your personality more than others, depending on what the moment calls for. You&#39;ve really got to start with three pieces, right you have to start with what you actually are and i mean that less about what you feel you are in your core but how you&#39;re perceived by the public you need to keep in mind what your opponents are to the public and you need to keep in mind what the public actually wants their politicians to be and it&#39;s the marriage of the three where you&#39;re going to determine where your best political brand is so i like to do focus groups and polling early on in a cycle to try Try to determine that. Polling looks a lot like for each of the major candidates out there. Here&#39;s a list of attributes, some good, some bad. Which ones do you think apply to candidate X? That&#39;s usually after unprompted, asking them to fill out a couple of lines or maybe a paragraph about what they think of the candidate, if they have any thoughts whatsoever.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">And from there, you get a pretty good understanding of what, if anything, people think of you and what, if anything, people think of your political opponents. And so you&#39;ve got a couple of the big pieces. Then the other piece is what are people actually looking for? And that becomes a matter of simply saying, what do you need in a leader right now? You</div>

          <div class="said">somewhat distance from the other two questions or else you&#39;ll find partisans just trying to align their answers all together. other and then ultimately do some focus groups especially useful to do focus groups if your candidate&#39;s not particularly well known because you can start to probe on things and ask about opinions that are there or not there but ultimately out of all of this zane what you are trying to do is you are going to try to find the thing that the public cares about that you do better than the other guy and ideally that your opponent is weak on as well because that&#39;s a way you can set up quite a good contrast but you have to be careful not to jump into something that you do do well, but your opponent does better. You have to be careful not to jump into something you do well, but the public doesn&#39;t give a shit about. And by having all of that information at hand, it allows you to have the informed conversation that you can then drive further into focus groups, testing these things out, further focus groups, further polling.</div>

          <div class="said">Excellent answer. I love where you were with those three buckets. Can we talk about platforms a bit more as we kind of extend beyond that? Because I think there&#39;s some interesting questions that that kind of emerge with that you know and and carter one question i have for you is relating to not just branding yourself but branding yourself when you&#39;re already kind of known like to cory&#39;s principles how do you if you&#39;re justin trudeau heading into your third election cycle consider your political brand can is there any way you can move it is there any way you can shift it or are you just doing small iterative tweaks to to what the canadian public already knows about you like if there&#39;s new platforms developed or new message opportunities how do you take advantage of them or do you have to rebrand do you i&#39;m trying to understand as what this exercise may look like for a brand that we know trudeau versus two brands that we kind of don&#39;t know even though jagmeet had a cycle you know last round he&#39;s still having much more flexibility and i say otula has got the greatest amount of flexibility to his uh to his advantage. So I want to talk about what the differences in those two streams looks like between an established brand, what they can do and how they can pivot and leverage some of these platforms and opportunities versus, let&#39;s say, less established brands like Sing and O&#39;Toole.</div>

Now, they&#39;re going to pick different lanes, so to speak. You know, Corey, one of the pieces of advice you guys constantly have that I constantly, you know, repeat without attribution, which is why I&#39;m here, I&#39;ve said this many times, is you can never use the playbook from last time for the next time, right? And that probably implies to the incumbent as well, right? Like, they bring a certain set of skills to the table, but to just run the race of 19 or 15 is not what you can bring again to the table, whether that be in 21 or 22. So what exactly are you kind of considering? Maybe I&#39;ll start with the Trudeau question first for how do you kind of rebrand or have a focal pivot for someone who&#39;s already well known in the public?</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, and you can&#39;t run the same campaign as last time because you&#39;re never on the same battlefield. The tactics have changed so much over time. It&#39;s just it&#39;s a bit politically suicidal to do that. And if you end up winning, that is accidental. It&#39;s not because of any great strategy, if that&#39;s what your play is. so if you&#39;re justin trudeau and you&#39;ve got an established brand and you are now running against two leaders who are not particularly established there&#39;s a couple of interesting nuances that brings into it here ultimately the advice does come down to what steven&#39;s advice is which is just emphasize different parts of your brand put something else in the window you uh you may have been a fresh face in 2015 that&#39;s not you anymore right</div>

And so you need to keep your eyes on your brand and you&#39;ve got to figure out what you can actually put forward. Carter said something that&#39;s interesting that I think is worth underlining about the difference between what a perception of the candidate&#39;s brand is and the candidate&#39;s actual attributes. And I&#39;ll use Jason Kenney as an example. In the 2019 election, he was going around in a blue pickup truck saying, get her done. That</div>

But I think there&#39;s always a certain hazard there. Now, when you are talking about an opponent, when you&#39;re setting your brand up, and you&#39;re trying to pick the brand elements that you want to emphasize, and it&#39;s against opponents who are pretty ill defined, and I think Aaron O&#39;Toole offers a great example here.</div>

Yes, we should go on this ground because you are so good at this. And Aaron O&#39;Toole, what a dummy that guy is, and what a knuckle-dragger he is. And you all of a sudden are playing like this phony version of you against this phony version of them, and you can run yourself into a lot of trouble. So rooting yourself in data, I think, is more important as an incumbent than it is as a new candidate, where you might have a bit more of a feel from the outside, but you can lose touch pretty quickly when your environment is 24 Sussex Drive or, you know, Rideau Cottage, I guess, right now. And it&#39;s important that you get yourself out of that bubble every possible way you can. And that doesn&#39;t mean talking to a bunch of people in your orbit.

And obviously it worked because that&#39;s who Albertans elected. elected the problem is you have to run again in four years and so if you&#39;re not the person that you put in the window if you&#39;re not the person that is actually uh</div>

Stephen Carter, one of the big questions that I always get when I have people asking me for advice if they&#39;re running a campaign for a candidate is, can staff manage platforms, or do leaders have to be? And I&#39;m curious, the rules have been written on this, but they&#39;re flexible, right? And like in a 2021 world, if the account is in the name of the person, should they be running it or is it OK for staff to run it? Do you feel like the rules have changed?

I think Twitter is managed by the individual because it is so reactionary and it is so dangerous. You definitely don&#39;t want to be the staffer who posts, you know, fuck my life.

          <div class="said">Yeah, I think as people become more savvy about social media networks they are much more forgiving for staff managing it because there&#39;s just an appreciation that people see behind the curtain you can&#39;t play the wizard of oz anymore and so if you&#39;re a candidate who&#39;s always got a bunch of on-point tweets and is going back when you&#39;re say for example in the house of commons or the legislature people are going to know that it&#39;s your staff anyway so most most of the ones that i i think do a good job say you know it&#39;s managed by x and staff allows that kind of plausible liability on both accounts and moves on.</div>

          <div class="said">Corey, I&#39;m going to stick with you. You know, one of your points that you made earlier was, and tell me if I am paraphrasing this incorrectly, but you said that you want to ultimately do things where you have a disproportionate advantage towards, right, as a candidate, especially amongst others. What does that mean around tactics on platforms? Like, if you feel like your team is not Jagmeet Singh and as good as him on TikTok, using that as an example, and you&#39;re a team O&#39;Toole, do you just bypass it? And what does that kind of mean as it relates to that advice extending out to platforms and where your voice is? And, and maybe the heart of that question is, are there some table stakes in a 2021 campaign environment that you have to be on, uh, regardless of how good you might be versus the other guys in the race, quote unquote.</div>

            </span>
          </div>
          <div class="said">Yeah. Well, so let&#39;s zoom out a tiny bit for a minute. And there&#39;s another reason why Jagmeet Singh&#39;s on TikTok. And that is because the demographic he&#39;s after is on TikTok. I don&#39;t think Aaron O&#39;Toole being on TikTok makes any fucking sense. Totally. And so there&#39;s a certain reality, and it all ties into the strategy, right? So when you&#39;re looking at the tactics you want to use, it&#39;s not just what you&#39;re good at, but it&#39;s also how is it going to connect with the audiences you are trying to get. And that&#39;s an important point, Zane. I think so many people think, yeah, they would be a sparkling personality on X, but X is not where the fish are. They&#39;re fishing in a pond that is totally barren for them. And it&#39;s something that political parties need to keep in mind.</div>

          <div class="said">It&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s only left-wing parties that tend to use these things, because that&#39;s not the case. I think we all know that Trump just cleaned the Democrats&#39; clocks in a lot of online environments in 2016 and probably again in 2020. But you do need to know that there&#39;s a product market fit because otherwise, why are you wasting your time there? Does anybody want to see you on this particular channel? And that&#39;s important to keep in mind as you&#39;re building out these strategies. So would I recommend Aaron O&#39;Toole be on TikTok? Probably not. I haven&#39;t seen his strategy. I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s up to. Would I recommend Justin Trudeau be on TikTok?</div>

          <div class="said">Maybe. Maybe. Depends on if those are demos that he&#39;s intending to play for this particular election. But Jagmeet Singh makes perfect sense. It makes absolute sense. You look at the demographics that the NDP are pulling right now. You look at NDP support amongst 18 to 24-year-olds, for example, which, as we&#39;ve talked about, that can be a lot of young energy for a campaign. Makes a lot of sense.</div>

          <div class="said">Carter, same question to you around table stakes for platforms. Is there such a thing as table stakes for which platforms you have to be on in a 2021 environment? Or do you think it&#39;s all dictated by the strategy and it&#39;s all flexible, that if you have a candidate, I&#39;m making this up, and they could be like, you know what, Facebook and Twitter aren&#39;t for us. I don&#39;t know who that candidate is, but the heart of my question is, are there table stakes for platforms that you have to be on in this in this 2021 world facebook</div>

And therefore, the advertising on it is also outstanding. So you can do a bunch of advertising tie-ins and promos around good posts and things like that. I think those are table stakes.

          <div class="said">That work never ends. You should be doing that work on an ongoing basis, watching how your brand evolves, and you should be willing to adjust if that makes sense. Now, obviously, the closer you get to an election, the more collateral that&#39;s built, the more the platform is constructed. You&#39;ve got to consider the change costs there. But you also need to know that even if it&#39;s incredibly difficult for you to do, but it&#39;s an absolute mandatory because of the way things have changed when you start tracking all of your brand,</div>

          <div class="said">Corey&#39;s question about where Where does the audience live? Where is the audience going to get their information from? That is fantastic. And that is the open question for me. I actually don&#39;t know the answer to that right now because there seems to be a very huge sub-segment of the population that isn&#39;t getting their information from sources that we can track at all, right? Like they may answer surveys that they&#39;re getting their information from Facebook or they&#39;re getting their information on television or they&#39;re getting their information on newspapers. papers but when you look at the survey information and then compare it back to the actual viewer numbers it doesn&#39;t make sense there&#39;s a there&#39;s a disconnect and i suspect that what&#39;s happening is that people are getting information i call it through osmosis is not really they get information through their social networks and how do you manage their social networks which social networks are you actually trying to influence uh so if you&#39;re trying to influence the group of people who are sharing like there&#39;s a there&#39;s a great left-wing uh tiktok community uh in alberta they are are putting up excellent content it is very watchable it is uh entertaining if you want them go get them or better yet just get them to to talk on your behalf i i just think um</div>

So the question I have for you, policy conventions for political parties, overrated or underrated in your mind?</div>

Now, that&#39;s not to say this one couldn&#39;t be a giant embarrassment for Aaron O&#39;Toole based on what he&#39;s trying to do and how he&#39;s trying to moderate the Conservative Party, because it does seem like there&#39;s going to be a significant social conservative contingent that may do</div>

          <div class="said">Yeah, parties have a lot of weight. I don&#39;t know how the CPC handles all of this stuff, but parties have a lot of way to manage that chaos. Generally speaking, the two major tools are, one, the fact that voting is done in such a way that prioritization comes out of it. And what ends up at the top of that list is almost always, on purpose, motherhood statements, the things that get 80-20 votes, 90-10 votes, because all of a sudden that delta, that&#39;s what determines your prioritization in the policy book. So you can say, yeah, we accepted the top 10 policies, right? The other thing they have is the order that things are actually addressed in the room, whether there&#39;s time for it or not, right? So if something going into it is lower on the priority list, you may never actually get to controversial policy 525. Right. And it got to 525 because the leader&#39;s office decided to pull some strings and make that the case. Or they held that vote at the same time that there&#39;s an equally crazy social conservative vote in three other places. This is what you would do, at least in physical location. And everybody&#39;s going to have to split their way to do that. So you&#39;re less likely to have one of those votes rushed and more likely to have the general flavor of a more moderate convention carry it.</div>
