        <p>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter talk about the BC election through the lens of the BC leader's debate and the Saskatchewan election through the lens of Zain recording from a Regina hotel - before the return of the notorious "Fine, Fabulous, or F**ked". Did John Horgan do what he needed to do? Are there cautionary tales to learn from the BC and Saskatchewan elections? And should Stephen Carter rants come with parental warnings? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p>

          <div class="said">This is true. This is true. OK, let&#39;s move it on to our first segment, a little west and a little east. Guys, I want to talk about not just the B.C. election in B.C., but I also want to talk about the election to the east of us in Saskatchewan. And I want to talk about both of them because there&#39;s some similarities, some interesting similarities. But let&#39;s start here with B.C. and let&#39;s start with debate night, Hogan, because I know all three of us watched it. But I know you are very keen to give us a summary of your thoughts first. And I know Carter said, listen, I want to react because I&#39;ve got so much information about this debate that I actually want to go second and I want to react to what Hogan says. So, Hogan, you know, John Horgan is 18 points up heading into this debate. Andrew Wilkinson, who&#39;s a leader of the B.C. liberals, had to make a big play to try to gain some ground and perhaps gain some name recognition and relevancy. Let&#39;s start here. Did he do it tonight?</div>

Subsidies for fossil fuel are $6 billion. PST reduction would create a $6 billion hole in revenue. That&#39;s really neat. It&#39;s neat how everything is $6 billion in BC. I also learned that Wilkinson is not a man I want want to be in a room with for 90 minutes um this is not necessarily any shot against the man personally but uh his presence at the debate i found uh drifted between uh grading and you know another word for grading there was no drift he had monotony in his voice the entire way through and um and for all of those reasons i think horgan did exactly what he needed to do now obviously well</div>

We&#39;ve talked on our other podcast about political Hail Marys. Tonight was the only televised leaders debate for him. We didn&#39;t see any version of a Hail Mary.

But before I do that, Corey&#39;s tweaked on something. You know, what do you kind of make of the large lead that a candidate has and what that could say to turnout? out. You know, often we see, you know, large leads leading to a lot of supporters potentially staying at home, or at least that second concentric circle, which is supportive, registers themselves on the public opinion polls, but decides whatever 18 point lead, my vote doesn&#39;t matter. What concern do you have right now with that being the case for for John Horgan in this BC election?</div>

There&#39;s been an amazing pickup on the number of people who&#39;ve asked for mail-in ballots. I think it was 20,000 in the last election. It&#39;s 500,000 in this election. What about the people who didn&#39;t request a mail-in ballot, right? What about those people? Will they actually go to the polls? What if we see an uptick in the number of COVID cases as a result of Thanksgiving weekend? Everybody went home to their own Trump-like super spreader event, and then they go back out to their workplaces, and all of a sudden, everything&#39;s starting to pick up a little bit, and there&#39;s more COVID, and there&#39;s more fear, and now people don&#39;t go out to vote. I think that that&#39;s reasonable. I also think that it is reasonable that the people who are selecting or asking for mail-in ballots are not necessarily 100% representative.

And you&#39;ve also got the political dynamic here in Saskatchewan that BC shares, which is the official, quote unquote, federal version of the conservatives and the liberals in each province have formed not a net new party, what in Saskatchewan they have, the Saskatchewan Party, kind of housing and encasing both Fed libs and Fed conservatives in one party.

And no better way to explain it other than to just get right into it. And Stephen, I&#39;m going to start with you. Jason Kenney today said he&#39;s firing 11,000 AHS workers as part of a reduction, no frontline workers, including nurses or doctors, but custodial staff, janitorial staff, et cetera, as part of AHS will be let go in the midst of this pandemic. So if you&#39;re Jason Kenney, is this fine, fabulous or fucked?</div>

          <div class="said">I think it&#39;s fucked. I mean, first of all, this idea that custodians aren&#39;t in some fashion frontline services, that receptionists aren&#39;t frontline services just because the work isn&#39;t done by a doctor or a nurse doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not something that is front facing. Have you ever been to a hospital? Do you want to see a a dirty hospital does anybody want to walk down the hall when the when when the hospital hasn&#39;t been cleaned now they say they&#39;re going to outsource it which is fine whatever gonna hand it off to a private company all that basically means is that you&#39;re going to try and get around union union deals and pay less money um that&#39;s not great for our economy right now you&#39;re going to take let&#39;s say 20 of of someone&#39;s earnings off the table these people aren&#39;t making a lot lot of money in the beginning, and now they&#39;re going to have less money.

          <div class="said">And so 11,000 people in the province of Alberta in the next year are going to have less money to spend, and that&#39;s going to hurt our economy.

There&#39;s the recommendations as to how transformation can happen in the healthcare system. him. I am sympathetic to the argument that healthcare is quite expensive in Alberta. I actually am.

But let&#39;s go to something more calming and something more green. The Green Party. Let&#39;s talk about Annamie Paul. And there&#39;s two things I want to talk about. This is a double-barrel question, and I know you can handle it. Two things that she has done strategically. The first one is that she has asked the federal NDP to not run a candidate in the by-election she&#39;s now running in in Toronto Centre. That&#39;s been part one. And part two is that she&#39;s asked that because of the surging COVID rates, especially in Toronto Centre, that the by-election be delayed. So from her perspective, two answers, two questions, fine, fabulous or fuck. So from her perspective, the Green Party perspective, Carter, over to you on both of those questions. What do you think?</div>

          <div class="said">You can ask the NDP not to run against you, but there is absolutely no precedent for the leader. You know, like if this was a green seat, you could almost make the case that if Anna May Paul was stepping forward to win the seat of an MP who stepped down. But that precedent hasn&#39;t been recognized forever, and it certainly does not exist for the fifth place party in the House. So you can ask for it, but don&#39;t get all tied up in a knot when it isn&#39;t granted to you by the other parties. In terms of delaying the by-election, there is no delay of the by-election that&#39;s going to occur. I mean, yes, the pandemic is certainly ramping up in Toronto more so than it is in British Columbia. But B.C., Saskatchewan, New Brunswick have held elections. A by-election, it&#39;s</div>

On the second one about the delay of the election, I think that I&#39;m a little more measured, and I go like a fine slash fine fucked. I just don&#39;t think, generally speaking, it&#39;s a good idea to cast dispersions on campaigns, especially at this moment we&#39;re in right now, right? right? It&#39;s got to be safe. There&#39;s no question about that. You know, health standards have to be adhered to. But the idea that you would do anything that would make an election seem less legitimate if it proceeded at this moment, does not sit well with me philosophically.
