We were going for light and comedic, and then you just went dark and not comedic there by bringing the government of Alberta.

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">well, I don&#39;t even know what to call it, the Alberta&#39;s trans policy proposal. We&#39;re going to be jumping into that with our first segment. We&#39;re going to call this one, two, three, Corey, and here&#39;s how it&#39;s going to work. We&#39;re going to spend the entire episode on this one particular topic, and the one in that topic is I&#39;m going to get your top-line reaction, one question to that. The two in the topic, Stephen Carter, is I&#39;ve got two questions on strategy that have been swirling around kind of in the media orbit, but I think we would be doing a disservice to our listening audience if we didn&#39;t actually address the strategy questions to it. And then the three is I&#39;m going to put you guys in 15-minute timed scenarios, one after another after another, you guys work together, where you are going to address how to react to this plan for this, strategize for this, for three very different groups. And so it&#39;s the one, two, three. And Corey, at the top, I mean, we can give folks a bit of an understanding in terms of what Danielle Smith has done and what she has announced. But the framing of her package, so to speak, or her video, which came out yesterday and we recorded on a Thursday, required parental notification consent for students age 15 and under who wanted to change their names or pronouns at school, while for teens 16 and 17, the parents would be informed but not need to consent. It would ban top and bottom gender-affirming surgeries for all Albertans ages 17 and under, and ban hormone therapy for gender reassignment purposes for those 15 and under, unless their treatment has already begun. gun. It would require parental notification, an opt-in requirement would teachers intend to teach about LGBTQ S-plus issues such as gender and sexual identity, and it would implement restrictions around transgender women participating in women&#39;s sports citing quote-unquote safety while suggesting expanded co-ed or gender-neutral league for trans athletes as an alternative. Corey, this was not just one thing. This was not just a parental rights, you know, suite of policies. This was far reaching. This was wide. This was extensive. We&#39;ll talk about the comms in a second. But Corey, your initial reaction when you absorbed outside</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">outside of the comms, the policy and what was being proposed by the Premier of Alberta?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Well, it was a lot, right? It was a lot in a lot of contexts. It was a lot in that I think everybody was getting ready for pronoun policy and everybody was getting ready for the parental notification policy. And certainly that&#39;s been teased for quite a bit. But it was many more policies than that. It became quite a suite of things. and uh it was a lot in that it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot like it it is quite um quite i&#39;ll just say i feels like an attack on transgendered people in alberta because as much as the framing that was teased out beforehand was parental rights the reality is most of the list you&#39;ve just listed is not about parental rights not at all it is it is in many cases actually removing parental rights Right. For example, if you want to talk about hormone therapy, right, no longer a choice a parent makes with a doctor and the child. Now it&#39;s a choice the government has made for them. So, you know, there&#39;s not consistency on that front. If you&#39;re looking for consistency in this suite, it&#39;s consistency in that it wants to make it difficult to be transgendered in the province of Alberta. And I think that&#39;s, that&#39;s</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s a lot. That&#39;s, that&#39;s pretty damning. And that&#39;s, I think, it</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">it feels like even more than what the UCP base was looking for. So it&#39;ll be interesting as we get into this here. But I mean, quite</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">quite a battery and a lot of conversation online as to whether it&#39;s, you know, more than some American jurisdiction. Certainly people think this is as far as anybody&#39;s ever gone in Canada on these matters.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

And those people are often amongst the most disadvantaged and most discriminated against on the country, you know, in the country, in the province, for sure. And so that&#39;s pretty wild, too. Like, it&#39;s quite a wild use of government power to create blanket rules for cases that are almost, by definition, you know, edge cases, right?</span>

You know, maybe they&#39;ll run into some weird speed bumps on the sports stuff. Maybe they&#39;ll run into the absolute logistical nightmare that is sending to the ministry, all of the content that has to do in any way, shape or form with a human sexuality. And by the way, the kind of the conflation of like sex and gender, like sexuality and, you know, the study of sex and gender, I think is a very intentional move to, to, to make it seem like it&#39;s all about sex.

If parents were responding rationally with responsibility, then maybe we could talk about parental rights. But I&#39;ll tell you something. We are not going to talk about parental rights in this country. Not on my watch. Not without talking about parental responsibilities. So if your kid winds up on the street, I want you fucking charged. I want you charged with neglect. I want you charged. And God damn it. one of the things that she did is she talked about strengthening up those cpa the child protective services rules she this is why i thought it was a masterful conversation or masterful communication she was able to put out um the push and pull on on a number of different things and say oh don&#39;t don&#39;t worry about that we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get them after the kid is dead we&#39;ll</span>

            <span class="text">contest this is a contest for the ndp leadership. You can join the NDP. You&#39;ve probably already made decisions on these particular matters, and you&#39;re probably quite supportive of transgender rights. So as much as I said, it was like 60-20. Guess what? Guess where the NDP membership base is from? It&#39;s the 20. This is going to fire people up. This is actually going to probably sell them more memberships. It&#39;s not going to be very difficult for the NDP leadership contestants to take that particular position, nor should it be, frankly. But it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a general election just around on the corner where you have to worry about those gen pop numbers. And this is an opportunity for them to remind themselves why they&#39;re all on the same team. And this is an opportunity for them to build their team with people who are going to be very animated on this particular issue. So like, I can&#39;t even imagine an NDP leadership candidate being remotely squeamish about this or remotely hedge about this. And I can&#39;t see how it would cause them any consternation whatsoever. whatsoever like they all know exactly who they are on this and there&#39;s just no problem before</span>

There is no obvious catalyst for this at this particular moment. What is the thing that has occurred where the government says oh february 1st middle of a school year time to act right like wouldn&#39;t you normally bring in policies that affect kind of notification and consideration like that at the i don&#39;t know end of a school year or if you there&#39;s legislation that&#39;s required wouldn&#39;t you do that i don&#39;t know when the legislation or the legislature is sitting why february it wasn&#39;t february 1st it was january 31st this all went down why what what is special about that what is magical about that you can create like fake reasons why but you can&#39;t create real ones, there is nothing that would recommend January 31st being the day you bring in a policy like this.

Like they&#39;re working with the base. The base all agrees, right? So they can field test a bunch of different arguments. They can go out there and they can champion this issue in a lot of different ways. It&#39;s not as though anybody is going to hedge on it and say, oh, Danielle Smith&#39;s got a point.

This is Thursday night. Each one of these groups is probably having conversations, whether it be on WhatsApp or iMessage, maybe doing a Zoom call, maybe even meeting in person, talking about what they need to do about this issue. You are going to help us in all three of those cases, but only for 15 minutes. So your level of expertise, your pithiness, how crisp you are, how sharp you are, that&#39;s all going to matter as we try to come out for the best strategy and the best strategies for these groups. Here&#39;s the three groups, okay? And I&#39;ll let you guys have some say in this. You can pick which one we do first. Stephen Carter, one group that we&#39;re going to address tonight is</span>

How do they need to think about things tonight as this moves forward? These are only policies. This is not legislation. They expect some sort of fight back from many groups. What do they need to think of? They are group number one. Carter, group number two. We&#39;ve already kind of loosely addressed them, especially through Corey&#39;s last comments. You&#39;re an NDP leadership camp.</span>

            <span class="text">How are you thinking about this tonight? What are you thinking about? How are you thinking about doing it? Are you even thinking about drawing daylight on this issue between your leadership contenders? We&#39;ll discuss that. That&#39;s group number two. And Carter, group number three, you&#39;re a nonprofit, nonprofit charity maybe, who advocates for trans youth, LGBTQ plus S people. You have a $50,000 budget that a donor has put on your radar tonight and said, you know, maybe this can get you started on a campaign. Can you do something with this?

I&#39;m not even going to list them out for you. Give us one element of strategy, Corey. You build on it. We&#39;ll try to go back and forth. I will try to help mold questions along the way, maybe ask questions. And then at the 15-minute mark, we&#39;ll summarize and we&#39;ll move on. We&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">So the first strategic question that most people will be asking in the leadership camp is does this help us or hurt us and let us dispense with that question relatively quickly this helps you because you&#39;re trying to reach a very very small group of people you&#39;re not trying to reach a huge large number of uh people in the leadership um i would imagine the total number of ndp members will be around 50 000 maybe 55 or 60 000 if they&#39;re doing really really well. So where do you find, you</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I would have come out with a strong statement the first moment you can on the perverse nature of this policy. And I pick it apart piece by piece. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily go after every all 11 pieces because I think that that might be too much. But I would be digging in on the parental rights and the risk to children. And you can pick any number of different talking points. But once you address that first strategic question, does this help us or hurt us? You got to choose help. And I&#39;ll give one example. We chose AISH. Why did we choose AISH when Alison Redford was running? Because there&#39;s 60,000 people who get AISH in the province of Alberta, and there are six people that care about each one of those 60,000 people. Now, in this particular case it&#39;s not just the trans children it&#39;s chance it&#39;s trans activists it&#39;s trans people it&#39;s it&#39;s lgbtq it is a huge population base that if you can be the first mover and</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">if you were the Calgary Candidate, this is less of a natural fit for you. This is not sort of working for you in the same particular way. right if you&#39;re Sarah Hoffman and your brand is like we are going to be so true to our values a little bit more of a natural fit right if you&#39;re a Racky Pancholi and it&#39;s you know I am going to be the candidate that grows this party and makes this party as inclusive as can be and like expands it yeah this is pretty natural fit for you too right which is again not to say that somebody is going to be on a different side of this issue but it allows you kind of to to tell your story while doing the things that you want to do and you feel you need to do anyhow here. So maybe I&#39;ll just leave it there. But my first thought is, it&#39;s not a wedge. And so it is going to change a little bit how you kind of look at it. But I do ultimately agree it is an animating issue.</span>

Although again, like this is one of those things that sort of tips into kind of like the principles and the morals of the party. And so we, you know, you got to be careful that you&#39;re not being too calculating about it too. You&#39;ve got to not, you&#39;ve got to put your ambition second to the stance on this particular one um because that is so important to the party and that goes to steven&#39;s</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah. Like, so what is strength in this particular situation is people are going to say, holy ever loving fuck, look at this government. And oh my God, we&#39;re on the mat again, where we being kind of some broadly defined progressivism in Alberta.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">can best champion here who can best stand up for us here and then there are flavors of that and this is why i say it goes back to brand two there are going to be people who say it&#39;s the person who brings the most brimstone the most righteous indignation you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">know just absolutely destroys danielle smith for her for her moral grounds on this and there are going to be people who say the strongest means they are actually able to move the meter on this they have managed to persuade albertans who were at first supportive of this that these are bad ideas and so they&#39;ve They&#39;ve shown that they can actually talk to people and bring them into the tent, and they can articulate an argument that moves the dial in some way, shape, or form, or they show a certain thoughtfulness, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">These are different flavors of strongest, but the point of it is you are going to need to define it in a way that works for your brand, and you&#39;re going to need to make sure that that is sort of how the issue is addressed, and, you know, people will make their judgments based on who they are and what they believe. But that&#39;s what we mean when we say strongest. And, you know, in some ways, fire and brimstone is kind of the most satisfying, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">oh, you really, really punched her in the gut there with that particular comment about how shitty she is because of these things that she&#39;s brought in. There will be a huge audience for that.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">But I think overall, this leadership race is about what gets the NDP to the next step, right? Like, what&#39;s going to get them the equivalent of those 6,000 votes that they lost by?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Won&#39;t be the same votes, won&#39;t happen in the same way.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so I think there&#39;ll be also a big audience of people saying like, okay, well, we got a tough one. So who can show that they can lead Albertans on this and actually shape opinion in Alberta and maybe move opinion polls on this particular matter? And what does that look like? Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">anything on launch? If not, I&#39;ve got a question for you on strategy related to how do you communicate here in</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">in a empathetic, compassionate way, but still want to transact with people with an NDP membership? Bridge that divide for me or bridge that gap. And you may say there isn&#39;t one, but either on launch and then talk to me about how you go from authentic,</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Yeah, so I think that brand needs to be the primary focus on the launch. And I don&#39;t think anybody wants to build their entire brand around this issue. I think this is a great issue to sell memberships. I don&#39;t think this is a great issue to define your brand on. You could define your brand as children, right? We defined our brand for Redford. Everybody knows this. Mother of young daughter, daughter of aging parents, right? That was the definition of the brand. Obviously, this would fit into that brand. but that&#39;s where the launch needs to go the launch needs to fit into the brand of the overall candidate not this not any any sort of fake fight uh just to get attention uh and that&#39;s what you know politics is it&#39;s it&#39;s pro-wrestling a lot right um sometimes pro-wrestling with consequences um but nonetheless it&#39;s still a lot of theater uh by bad actors so that i don&#39;t think the launch A bunch needs to fit into that. And I&#39;ve cleverly forgotten the second half of your question.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">I think it&#39;s a two-step process. You know, if you&#39;re a leadership candidate and you&#39;re not running a petition site on this, I don&#39;t think that you&#39;re worth your salt. and then you flip it over and start looking back and emailing those people and bringing them down your engagement ladder until or your membership funnel whichever metaphor</span>

            <span class="text">well i think if you&#39;re take back alberta if you&#39;re david parker the first thing you need to determine is what you&#39;re trying to do at this particular moment. Seems right now what they&#39;re trying to do is take a victory lap, because they&#39;re not even seeming to try to push things further. As I said, this is even further than a lot of the policy recommendations that had come out of the UCP policy convention went. But David Parker right now is going just nuts online. He had a tweet that I pulled up here as after you announced he would would be one of our subjects you&#39;re welcome yes</span>

            <span class="text">i think he needs to think about what he wants and if all he wants is to take a victory lap uh that&#39;s one thing but But if he actually wants to push this further, make Take Back Alberta more mainstream, push the agenda even less mainstream, you know, whatever that definition is, that&#39;s step one. Because if you don&#39;t know where you&#39;re going, you&#39;re going to end up somewhere else. And right now, he&#39;s just online being a dick. And he&#39;s not being a dick for a purpose. And, you know, quite often, he&#39;s a dick for a purpose. Right now, it just seems to be, like, high on what happened, not thinking about the broader strategic considerations.</span>

I think that there will be red hats for sale this summer that we can all hop on or maybe they&#39;ll be blue because we&#39;re Alberta. But nonetheless, all of this to say that this is a guy who&#39;s currently re rejigging all of Alberta politics and he has the power currently and right now he hasn&#39;t overreached. so while you&#39;ve got the power if you&#39;re david parker you&#39;ve got to figure out how to best apply that power how to get it to the next level how to get it to the next level and that&#39;s why things like um you know abortion rights uh you know women&#39;s rights other you know other things that that have been perceived to be off limits um this trans rights discussion opens the door to all of them specifically you know especially abortion so we could be seeing an awful lot of of david parker&#39;s next things coming much much sooner because you don&#39;t want to give up that power over danielle smith cory</span>

            <span class="text">a right-wing political group yeah you&#39;re totally right so you know i think if we want to think about what david parker wants one of the things might be actually consolidating some of his support within take back alberta a movement that you know he you know doesn&#39;t always have the firmest grip on and you know there&#39;s is also conversations about how much of a firm grip Take Back Alberta has on UCP politics or whether it&#39;s more like, you know, common causes intersecting and, you know, everybody&#39;s worried about the supporters that back both, right? There&#39;s many kind of questions here, but there might be some kind of consolidation that&#39;s possible there as moving forward. The other thing I will say is, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s very possible to me that they got more than they asked for on this particular matter because Daniel Smith&#39;s about to disappoint their base in another way right so if</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">that&#39;s the case then cory do you not take the victory lap as strongly and as aggressively as you can because you don&#39;t know if another one&#39;s coming or do you try to like extend this victory and thin it out over a longer period of time because you don&#39;t know if there&#39;s another one coming i</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">two schools of thought there right one is again it depends on your goals like if if you&#39;re trying to show your effectiveness, then yeah, you just sort of take the victory lap. But if you are a true cause politician, if you are actually trying to change the government in big, strong ways, well, then you&#39;ve got to, you&#39;ve got to sort of look at this, assess this and say, if this is what&#39;s happening, I want to make sure it doesn&#39;t happen. So you&#39;ve got to kind of put people on notice. You&#39;ve got to remind people of how popular this particular motion was. If it ends up being like it&#39;s super early days and a lot of the commentary, including ourselves have obviously come very scathingly down upon this. And we&#39;ll sort of see how it lands, but I suspect it&#39;ll still land popular. That&#39;s my gut. That&#39;s my instinct. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">And so maybe you say, see, Albertans actually want a right-wing approach to things. See? And then, you know, put that pressure on it to make sure that it&#39;s not so easy to walk away and make clear that you don&#39;t feel sated. Like this is not enough for me. You know, what&#39;s enough is that we actually have a consistent distant right-wing vision in Alberta, or whatever. Carter,</span>

How much of that, I guess is the right way to phrase it, is that of a strategic consideration for someone like TBA to be like, look, you delivered and we made it as frictionless as possible for you to do something difficult, come again, sort of thing. How would you kind of put that in its strategic framework? Do you even think that&#39;s not a consideration here?</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah, this is a hostage taking, Zane. This isn&#39;t some sort of equal negotiation. She is concerned that the board is going to call a leadership review that she can&#39;t win. That is why, because this isn&#39;t the Danielle Smith that I know. Corey and I have talked about her in the past. I, you know, I would have considered her a friend. I don&#39;t any longer in no small part because of what&#39;s happening right now. But this is I think that this is a true, simple power play. and david is going to look at this and and take back alberta is going to look at this and say we&#39;ve got power now what should we do with it next and and that&#39;s why i&#39;ve been very focused on the next achievement not just how this one unfolds but what are we going to do next because it&#39;s never going to be enough for these people what danielle does not realize what i think i realize about this is that she&#39;s trying to placate the right because the last time she tried to move to the center, she got killed.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

That is the definition of who they are. And I think that that&#39;s not going to change just because they want to make it less painful for Danielle to bring in really unpopular. Keep in mind, they think this is very popular and the numbers maybe support them on that. But they&#39;re</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, do you agree with that? I mean, I&#39;ve seen enough hostage movies to know that even if it is a hostage scenario, shoot the hostage in the face. But before you do that, you sometimes give them a nice meal every now and then. Do they play nice for a bit? Do they celebrate? Do they give her some level of adulation? Or are you with Carter here, that this is is the only way to keep this going is to keep us tight of a grip and the threat as active as we believe it to be?</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">Probably a combination of both. Probably public adulation, private threats is the short version of it, right? Because you do want to sort of not create an environment where people say, oh, fuck it, no matter what we do, these guys are at our throats, so we don&#39;t need to listen to them anymore. It&#39;s actually a lesson I think Alberta needs to learn. A certain and responsiveness to events is kind of essential if</span>

The nonprofit charity that&#39;s got a $50,000 donation, they need to launch something by Monday. The donors asked for that to happen. Can we get something? And of course, it&#39;s not a hard deadline. They&#39;re giving them some time to think about it. But they&#39;re maybe hundling their folks today and tonight saying, listen, we&#39;ve got this. This is an existential threat, this policy. You know, it&#39;s probably going to be a session coming up. Not this particular one, but one down the road. Do we have to contend with this? What do we do? Do we spend all the money now? Do we spend it later? What do we do? How do we think about it? What&#39;s our strategy? Stephen Carter, I&#39;ve got 15 minutes on the clock.

You know, know we don&#39;t want to make this about the entire transgender issue we want to make this about children and protecting children we want to make sure that people are reminded that uh responsibility comes with rights um you know that that this is a tremendous opportunity to re uh re-engage parents on what it is and how they they should be parenting um i think that there&#39;s all kinds of different ways to do it and i think that the number one thing that i would recommend that they do is test a number of things um you know all too often we run out with the messaging that we think appeals to us um just because a message appeals to to you and me and to well probably not cory because he disagrees with everything but just his nature yeah</span>

Carter&#39;s talking about separating the issues into chunks, media relations, digital advertising, advocacy petitions, growing a database, growing a list, getting yourself ready for at least a mid-haul. Maybe it&#39;s going to be a long haul. You don&#39;t really know in terms of how long you&#39;re going to have to sustain an effort or a campaign like this.

We&#39;ve talked about this in a lot of other contexts, but you have to be aware of novel novel concepts, right? A lot of Alberta hasn&#39;t thought about this before. It is, of course, been in the kind of the national conversation for a bit now, but not in any kind of robust way. And here it is here in Alberta in a significant way. Now, go find out what people actually think and go find out what it takes to make them think differently. Learn that quickly and then do a lot of that before opinions get ossified. And everyone&#39;s just decided, well, I&#39;ve always thought this was a good idea. I have for six months now, 12 months now, whatever it is. Certainly, Certainly, you do not want to wait for this to take hold as conventional wisdom. So you&#39;ve got to know what you&#39;re working with, and you&#39;ve got to get the data to do that. And for fucking sure, be aware that if you are in a group that is a small nonprofit that fights on these issues, your views are almost certainly not going to be mainstream on this particular matter. And so you do need to be able to open your ears and hear those arguments and not just immediately call somebody a TERF or whatnot if you&#39;re looking to change opinion, but actually say, okay, well, let&#39;s talk a bit about that and let&#39;s sort of understand and bring up some of the stats that Stephen Carter did in these focus groups. Like, well, are you aware, like X percent on the street and so on and so forth, or X percent of, you know, youth on the street are transgender. And just get people to sort of understand the issue with a little bit more nuance and compassion and complexity. And once you&#39;ve landed that message, then you take that message, whatever you&#39;ve determined is the thing that is most likely to work. and you</span>

I&#39;m interested in finding people that already agree with certain premises, not necessarily all of my premises. You know, that&#39;s one of the interesting things about doing this the way that Danielle Smith did it. I can probably find two or three of those elements that go to a audience that I can find them and get them to believe and buy into what I&#39;m saying. I don&#39;t have to get them to buy into all 11 different items. I can get them to buy into a small subset of them. And so because of that, I can change the mechanism or change the numbers. 70% may feel one way, but because I&#39;m able to dig in, I can get the 70% going the other way. And that&#39;s, you know, gay marriage is one of those things. They gave up on, you know, the, the, the LGBT community really dug in on gay marriage and it made, and they made a very simple argument.

            <span class="text">yeah i mean just don&#39;t communicate to yourself you know we we were talking earlier about communicating, you know, the NDP leadership candidates could communicate to their small groups. That&#39;s not your job when you&#39;re the nonprofit, you&#39;re not just going to be talking to your own existing membership, you have to reach outside of that membership and have a bigger play. Because this is a super important issue and making sure that you&#39;ve got a bigger coalition is ultimately going to pay off later. To Corey&#39;s point, I&#39;m not I&#39;m I&#39;m still not necessarily convinced I&#39;m doing a big splashy thing that makes big impact. But I do like the idea of it. Figuring out who you can talk to, figuring out the bigger and bolder audience is ultimately going to pay significant dividends.</span>

            <span class="text">I&#39;m going to repeat because it&#39;s so important. You are not talking to yourself, right? A group, especially at a moment like this, where you are feeling some, as I&#39;d say to my kids, some big feelings, right? You got to remember what you&#39;re trying to do here, which is either some version of incrementalism or some version of really reframing things. But either way, you&#39;re already with you. You&#39;re talking about people that by definition are not. And so you&#39;ve got to find some arguments that work for them.</span>
