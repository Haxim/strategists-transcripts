            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and somebody&#39;s gonna be our best work yes well and and the interesting thing is of course the republicans have said because this is an election year uh there can be no replacement let&#39;s have the election first and then let&#39;s have the replacement and on its face that&#39;s not the craziest idea we&#39;re not for the fact that he&#39;s only you know obama&#39;s got a year left of governing i mean it&#39;s not like this guy dropped dead in october yeah right before the election and there have been been cases in the past where justices have been appointed in the year, you know, right before an election. And in fact, there was even an interim appointment of a justice apparently before an election year that was then ratified by the Senate after the election. I think Eisenhower did that crazy stuff. But the</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">the problem becomes if you&#39;re the Democrats, how do you walk that line? What do you do? How do you just get the justice who was one of the most conservative justices in, you know, in recent american history replaced with somebody more moderate uh what&#39;s the plan and and i guess that remains to be seen it&#39;s very fascinating to me because of course the republicans have said now they are going to just not even vote on it they&#39;re not even going to allow it to come up for for discussion and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">and they control the senate so i guess they could do that but this is amazing so you talk about i think it&#39;s really appropriate that this is on the death of scalia that we&#39;re having these big constitutional arguments it&#39;s really good because of course he was the big uh you know constructionist this is how the constitution is and this is how the constitution shall be it&#39;s pretty clear to me from this event and events like this that the constitution was written by people who were under the very mistaken assumption that uh the people trying to govern the country were going to try to govern the country and not be dicks to each other like this is a a really big problem they</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">they could just say nope we&#39;re not going to uh we&#39;re not going to have a vote on this so you&#39;re not going to get to have your appointment and you know the whole constitution is written on this crazy notion that everybody&#39;s just going to try to make it work and that is just not the case today cory cory hogan says that the constitution was created pre</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">carter oh cory forgets that you know there&#39;s like vice presidents in the united states have been killed in duels i mean this is the you</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">know he&#39;s kind of got this idea that everything worked It&#39;s worked really well in the past and it doesn&#39;t now. You know what? It is pretty bad now. I mean the Republicans are trying to make it so the executive office can only govern when there is a Republican in the executive office. But it&#39;s been so long really since that&#39;s been the case. I mean you go</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">go back eight years now all the way back to Bush and you&#39;re like, wow, that was so long ago. One of the things – this reminds me of the executive orders argument, right? Right. Like we don&#39;t want an executive order issued by Obama because, you know, you&#39;re ignoring Congress. But if it&#39;s an executive order issued by Bush or Reagan or, you know, any of the other Republicans, it&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s OK with us. The point of the exercise of an election is to replace the government every four years. Now, this is not a uniquely American thing. We will see governments begin. Again, you know, the conservatives in the province of Alberta started screaming that there was no mandate for the New Democrats to do what they did three minutes after the New Democrats were elected.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">They&#39;re doing the same thing with the liberals.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">The reality is that sometimes the losers are just whiners. The difference here is that the Senate does, in fact, control the whiny chamber. So they get to choose who&#39;s actually going, you know, whether or not there will be a vote on this. If they do not bring this to a vote, if they do not confirm Obama&#39;s nominee, this is going to be an election issue. So as a strategist, I&#39;m sitting here on the side of this thinking, if I&#39;m a Democrat, I want Obama to select a moderate Democrat or a moderate judge and</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">then have the Republicans not confirm him because I will beat the Republicans about the head with that for the remainder of the election season.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">it&#39;s not like in Canada where the Supreme Court justices don&#39;t matter. In the United States, they do matter, and they are a get-out-the-vote issue. Especially</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>
            <span class="text">Especially with these five to four decisions that we&#39;ve been seeing recently. Okay, so that sets the table for us. Corey Hogan says the Constitution was pre-asshole. Stephen Carter says that losers are usually whiners. Corey, I want to go to that same answer that Carter gave me about the Democrats. What should they do? Do you agree with that strategy around the moderate? Hopefully, if Clinton wins, you get it more progressive. whatever that means but you bash them with it in the middle oh why have we already jumped to clinton winning who knows but</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">SPEAKER_02</span>

          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">really depends on where you&#39;re sitting in the democratic party uh if obama nominates a moderate and you&#39;re bernie sanders that&#39;s a bit awkward for you because right now you&#39;re in this who can love obama more uh thing with hillary clinton uh</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">uh but if they reject it then you get to be able to say look they wouldn&#39;t even you talk about needing to to meet them in the middle hillary he tried to be as moderate as possible we&#39;ve got to fight these guys and we&#39;ve got to push the boundaries of our arguments so that could work right</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">right uh if you&#39;re hillary clinton and a moderate gets rejected the challenge you&#39;re going to have is you&#39;re trying to sell moderation as a virtue and if moderation looks like such a failed strategy what do you do so it&#39;s fraught with peril for both sides i do agree it will be an election issue i do think that there&#39;s maybe more opportunity here for sanders though because a you could really show the failure of the clinton approach clinton is supposed to be able to reach across the aisle and work on things and b there</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">that i think that probably the pressure will get onto uh you know mcconnell to uh to actually bring this thing to a vote at a certain point and if bernie actually starts to march people on washington do all those things he claimed could change washington and something that was going to happen anyways happens as a result he can sort of claim that his approach actually has merit carter</span>

Yeah, because you like Bernie. No, because Hillary Clinton is talking about moderation and being able to reach across the aisle and work with people.

And he gets to introduce legislation and pass it with the same group of people. He doesn&#39;t have to worry about an obstructionist Senate or a House of Representatives that will delay things. So in the United States, that first 100 days is viewed as essentially the grace period. You put every major initiative in there and you try and push it through. And generally speaking, it works. Now, the House, the Republicans are becoming more and more, well, objectionable. But generally, the first 100 days is your honeymoon. Corey,</span>

            <span class="text">Corey, why do we care about the 100 days? It goes back to FDR. This is where the phrase originated. And he introduced and passed most of the alphabet laws that we know that created things like the Tennessee Valley Authority, the modern welfare state in the United States. In 100 days, you got to keep in mind, this guy had four terms. But those 100 days probably rivaled as much as any single term he had after that as far as activity. And because of that, there&#39;s become this nostalgia and this kind of legend of the 100 days. And every single president that&#39;s come since, Stephen&#39;s exactly right, has been measured on that yardstick. Right. And it&#39;s true. True.</span>

            <span class="text">that extended honeymoon period? Look, if you want to measure it by whether or not the honeymoon continues, it went great. The guy is really popular. If you want to measure it on accomplishments, I think you have to give him lower marks here. You obviously have some of the bigger promises that were broken, such as the Syrian refugees. They were all going to be here by December. Everybody remembers that. That didn&#39;t happen. happened there was the uh the budget the the notion that we were going to introduce this tax hike on the rich that would pay for a tax decrease on the middle class and it would be revenue neutral that obviously didn&#39;t happen the neb process was going to be overhauled and everything sent back to the beginning they just sort of amended it played around the edges we&#39;re going to stop bombing isis okay but we probably didn&#39;t mean we were then going to send troops in on the ground you know there was there was quite a few things that i would have issues with yeah</span>

And I&#39;d like to get your opinion on the trade-off that you have actually composed yourself.

And it is, in my opinion, where governments live or die because it is easy to bring in big signature pieces of legislation. But that&#39;s not where most governance happens. It&#39;s dealing with the things that come at you and it&#39;s moving along those smaller things that are easy to put on the wayside. So if I&#39;m talking, you know, next 100 days, next 200 days, next 300 days, I think what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m very methodically moving through every single item that is in those mandate letters, every single thing that was in our platform that I can deliver and point back to. And I&#39;m looking to paper up some of those things that happened before. So, look, you&#39;ve got a problem with how we moved on the Syrian refugees. Well, but in the end, we brought in X percent more or something along those lines. I&#39;m trying to make right what was wrong and I&#39;m trying to make sure that the ball is moving and then we don&#39;t get stuck mired in the middle of the pacific so to speak just sort of casting about waiting for the next wind to move us and that that&#39;s</span>

So when you send somebody from your organization, the fact you once said under oath, I&#39;m not a journalist to me is not good enough.
