        <div class="desc"><p>Stephen Carter and Corey Hogan talk about the death of Scalia and the birth of Trudeau's government. Will stopping Obama's nominee backfire on the GOP? Is Justin Trudeau breaking too many promises? And if Ezra Levant knocked on your door, would YOU answer? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line. <a href="https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/8265001" target="_blank">Get Thursday episodes, access to hundreds of old episodes, and bonus content on Patreon</a></p></div>

And in fact, there was even an interim appointment of a justice apparently before an election year that was then ratified by the Senate after the election. I think Eisenhower did that crazy stuff.

One of the things – this reminds me of the executive orders argument, right? Right. Like we don&#39;t want an executive order issued by Obama because, you know, you&#39;re ignoring Congress.

Some obvious ones that have been talked about in the media, of course, already are people that the Republicans have already approved with votes of 97 to 0 or whatnot on very similar level courts, making it very tough to say that this is not somebody we would – You know, if I was Hillary Clinton, I would go so far as to have somebody who is an out and out moderate, not necessarily even a liberal, because that at least you can point to as as taking a situation that looked dire or perhaps impossible and moving it into something else through compromise.

In 100 days, you got to keep in mind, this guy had four terms. But those 100 days probably rivaled as much as any single term he had after that as far as activity. And because of that, there&#39;s become this nostalgia and this kind of legend of the 100 days.

          <div class="said">that extended honeymoon period? Look, if you want to measure it by whether or not the honeymoon continues, it went great. The guy is really popular. If you want to measure it on accomplishments, I think you have to give him lower marks here. You obviously have some of the bigger promises that were broken, such as the Syrian refugees. They were all going to be here by December. Everybody remembers that. That didn&#39;t happen. happened there was the uh the budget the the notion that we were going to introduce this tax hike on the rich that would pay for a tax decrease on the middle class and it would be revenue neutral that obviously didn&#39;t happen the neb process was going to be overhauled and everything sent back to the beginning they just sort of amended it played around the edges we&#39;re going to stop bombing isis okay but we probably didn&#39;t mean we were then going to send troops in on the ground you know there was there was quite a few things that i would have issues with yeah</div>

And it is, in my opinion, where governments live or die because it is easy to bring in big signature pieces of legislation. But that&#39;s not where most governance happens. It&#39;s dealing with the things that come at you and it&#39;s moving along those smaller things that are easy to put on the wayside. So if I&#39;m talking, you know, next 100 days, next 200 days, next 300 days, I think what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m very methodically moving through every single item that is in those mandate letters, every single thing that was in our platform that I can deliver and point back to. And I&#39;m looking to paper up some of those things that happened before. So, look, you&#39;ve got a problem with how we moved on the Syrian refugees. Well, but in the end, we brought in X percent more or something along those lines. I&#39;m trying to make right what was wrong and I&#39;m trying to make sure that the ball is moving and then we don&#39;t get stuck mired in the middle of the pacific so to speak just sort of casting about waiting for the next wind to move us and that that&#39;s</div>

Our provincial NDP government has said no to Ezra Levent&#39;s news organization called the Rebel effectively because Ezra Levent himself has said under oath at some point in time that no, he is not a journalist.

It&#39;s all Monsanto&#39;s fault. Well this took a rant Jesus Christ. You know what What is journalism today, right? We have fake journalism sites like La Paine and The Onion where people, honest to God, comment on them and post them as though they&#39;re real articles because they can&#39;t tell the difference.
