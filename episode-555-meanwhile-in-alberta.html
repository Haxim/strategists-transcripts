Now, there may be supplementary bills to come, but this does tell us at least what the plan is for the next year, where the spending priorities are. I think we can already expect a few things that will change as far as royalties and environment just based on Joe Cici, the finance minister&#39;s comments today. But this tells us a lot about the government, its approach to governing, and what the hell the next 12 months, 24 months, 36 months and beyond are going to be like. Carter,</div>
