          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">yeah they were surprised by what an ndp government posed in their budget but let&#39;s let&#39;s chat about that let&#39;s get into it our first segment no you didn&#39;t get it because it&#39;s got the word dead yeah see that was just channeling the twitterati right there let&#39;s</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">let&#39;s let&#39;s talk about this budget but before we get there steven carter You were chief of staff to a certain premier, unnamed premier. She who must not be named. Yeah, she who must not be named. Oh, no, I think we gave it away.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">This is true. Technically. Yeah, and you weren&#39;t in Edmonton for the budget today, so we&#39;ll figure, pretty easy to figure out which one. Nonetheless,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Nonetheless, tell us what goes into making a budget and why should we frankly care? I mean, even myself, quite interested in politics, found it quite difficult, unlike the two of you, to get very excited today. Is this the government&#39;s strategic plan going forward, number one? But number two, why should we be excited today?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Well, legislation starts off with all these good intentions and all these types of things. But legislation is only brought to life by the people who do it.</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">So budgets pay for the people. People don&#39;t generally do things for free for government. government so what is in the budget is actually what is going to happen so you can actually see from the budget how much priority you&#39;re putting onto something right and this you know so are we increasing health care even though we pass a bill about this bill about human services or a bill about child protection all those bills need to be funded and they are all funded from one document and that&#39;s what makes budgets so much fun cory</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">cory why does this matter what he&#39;s exactly right i I mean, money is what really drives politics. This is the money bill. Now, there may be supplementary bills to come, but this does tell us at least what the plan is for the next year, where the spending priorities are. I think we can already expect a few things that will change as far as royalties and environment just based on Joe Cici, the finance minister&#39;s comments today. But this tells us a lot about the government, its approach to governing, and what the hell the next 12 months, 24 months, 36 months and beyond are going to be like. Carter,</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, I want to leverage your inside experience working on putting a budget together. What goes into it? I mean, we know there&#39;s many stakeholders internally and externally, but what fundamentally goes into building this budget on the inside? side well</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">brings to the budgeting process what they want right right so they they will likely have been given some marching orders early right from uh from the deputy minister of executive council okay</span>

And then almost as an afterthought, they went, oh, by the way, the deficit will be $6.1 billion. So there but for the volatility of our oil revenue, you, this would be a balanced budget.
