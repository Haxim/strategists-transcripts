Carney&#39;s quick pre-election cabinet had 24, which there was some criticism there. What is the right number?

            <span class="text">is the amount of senior people that are new in the senior ministries. So not even within the 30, but the subset of the 30, the top 10, the top five of those people are new. OK, he&#39;s playing a different type of ballgame. That&#39;s my take. Carter,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">Carter, I do. I do like this idea of having a junior set of ministers and a senior set of ministers was something that I toyed with in in Alberta. We never got around to it because I was there for 15 or 20 minutes. but what we were looking at is putting in place a uh like i would have loved to have had uh one minister who is responsible for health care with two or three different junior ministers working with them one minister responsible for education two or three junior junior ministers working with them one person responsible for finance etc etc and you&#39;d only really have about six or eight senior ministers and those senior ministers would then form kind of an operations committee that would be able to break down some of the silos that exist in government. One of the reasons we created a human services super ministry with Hancock was that we wanted to break down the privacy rules. People who are in human services are often in different realms of human services all at the same time. But you couldn&#39;t necessarily get communication to go across those silos of government departments because of privacy concerns. But if you made it all one department, then all the information could flow theoretically much smoother. And I think that the problem was you create the super ministry and then it&#39;s too big and too wieldy for one person to be the primary minister of. So if Mark Carney is doing that, where he&#39;s creating super ministries with junior ministers who are then supportive of that or regionally specifically supportive of that, then I can wrap my head around it because I think that that&#39;ll be a really good thing.</span>

If this is the model you are following, 10 at the senior level and then a shit ton at the more junior level. And I think we should read it that way. Even if they want to present it to us as 30 and then 10, let&#39;s find the top 10. Like, yeah, like we already know what the top 10 are going to be. They might be mapped slightly differently and they might use different words for what they mean. But there&#39;s</span>

You don&#39;t have to assign them, frankly, an ADM or ADM or any real resources, these ministers of state. But you can maximize on their talent. You can kind of, you know, maximize on the fact that you want them around, but you don&#39;t really know where you want to put them. that kind of have this utility player element to them, even if they may be given a portfolio, and</span>

            <span class="text">and you kind of let them test the ground for whether they advance themselves into the ministerial portfolio. Let&#39;s also not forget, there&#39;s another thing that we don&#39;t know but are assuming, which is that this 30 is paired with this 10 that might have an additional 30 or 40 parliamentary secretaries behind it. So this could be of a 170, hundred and seventy give it 168 171 we&#39;ll find it in a couple of days anywhere between there that many seats of a caucus might have 80 people 70 to 80 people holding positions of which 40 of them will be called honorable is</span>

And he turned me around on it. The way he turned me around on it is that idle hands make the devil&#39;s work, however the saying goes. And these idle hands in government are particularly nasty. So you want to be able to share out as many titles as you possibly can and make as many people work for you as you possibly can. There is no way in a 170, 168 person caucus, that you can give everybody a job. But if you can give a solid, almost majority of people a job, and don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re talking about parliamentary secretaries, but there&#39;s still whips, there&#39;s still positions in the party, there&#39;s still caucus chairs, there are so many jobs that are going to be handed out that by the end of it, you&#39;re going to be looking at 120 out of 160 people with a special job.

They want to be part of the core 10. They&#39;re going to want a track for someone in the PMO to say, how do I become the next whatever minister?

You know, I&#39;m just making television up. You see what I&#39;m trying to say, though, right? It makes the person ask, what&#39;s not part of it? I thought everything was part of the one word.

I&#39;m also curious myself personally in this acute sort of moment with Carney, if the Secretary of State will lean more towards the specific skill sets that these junior ministers bring to the table and or areas of acute pain or pressure. So how much do they double up on the economic files or particular types of files that need conditions. So like a subsector of housing on the funding track, a subsector of finance, a subsector of part of his build plan. And how much are</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">are they trying to address and signal priority? And how much are they trying to take advantage of someone&#39;s unique skill set that might be occupying the role? The interesting thing with the junior ministries and the state ministries, especially how they&#39;ve been used in in the UK and other commonwealths is they often are not assigned either a full department or any department at all. They&#39;re relatively agile and they can often speak to the skillset of the person holding that particular office at that particular time. Because when you blow it up, there&#39;s really nothing you&#39;re blowing up other than a role and a couple of staff. There&#39;s no ministry or there&#39;s no department behind it. And so you can have these sort of utility players who speak to a particular particular moment in time or skill set that they bring i&#39;m going to be looking for that tomorrow being like oh that makes sense for that person uh</span>

Or if he&#39;s got like no flowery language and he&#39;s got these really specific topics, just run with it. You&#39;re in charge of this. This is your job. Like talk to me, Carter, you&#39;ve you&#39;ve been involved in mandate letters, I&#39;m sure, in your roles as chiefs of staff. What&#39;s the what&#39;s the good mandate letter strategy? strategy?</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>
            <span class="text">A great mandate letter strategy is to have a very clear mandate letter with three or four items that need to be achieved in the next year or two. And those mandates are clear and understandable. Unfortunately, in federal politics, I think it&#39;s a little bit harder sometimes. We&#39;re picking on the department, you know, the Minister of Transport. So I&#39;ll just continue to pick on the Minister of Transport. I mean, do we even know what the issues in transportation are going to be? Do we know what issues might pop up? I like the mandate letter because it tells the minister what they have free reign on, but I&#39;m afraid of the mandate letter because anything not included in that mandate letter is often seen as off limits. And I would much refer that the mandate letter says, these are our three priorities, but you go ahead and be the minister of this department. You should be the actual minister of the department instead of the prime minister&#39;s office being the de facto minister of the department. And I think Zane was kind of, you know, alluding to that a little bit earlier in the conversation. You know, when the prime minister&#39;s office is the ministry of everything, then these mandate letters become much less meaningful because really each one of them could be, come and see us before you do anything important.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Carter</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I think there is. I think there is. I mean, like, there&#39;s the baseline question of whether they&#39;re public or not, right? Because they don&#39;t have to be public. They don&#39;t have to be, yeah.</span>

            <span class="text">And so I really like what Carter&#39;s doing. And it also plays into a notion that our friend Corey Hogan has brought up on the show multiple which is often people in government and in politics, like govern and politic, like psychopaths, right? Like you wouldn&#39;t see this in the workplace. You wouldn&#39;t in any sort of normal, non-toxic workplace, see a boss hand you an aggressive sort of letter that&#39;s one-sided and then never speak to you ever again, which is by the way, kind of the relationship that even the most senior ministers have with one&#39;s prime minister.</span>

And I think that from the middle of the second term on, sure, there&#39;s some stars. I think of Hannah Wilson, who worked with Chrystia Freeland, who ran the Calgary Center campaign of Lindsay Lunau. I mean, she&#39;s a once</span>

I think that her opportunity lies outside of government. And I think the government&#39;s opportunity lies outside of Hannah. And that&#39;s not a slight. That is a that is a testimony to her skill and her ability. But at the same time, it&#39;s an opportunity for change. This can&#39;t be the extension of the Trudeau government. It must be the beginning of the Carney government.</span>
