And they have tried to make sure that she has her own power base. One of the things that I was saying on West of Center a couple of weeks ago was I didn&#39;t think she was really in jeopardy because I hadn&#39;t talked to Stephen yet.

But it&#39;s clear that she wants to placate these, placate might not even be the right word. she is she is doing politics she is getting groups together and they&#39;re getting support behind her that that is politics and she&#39;s decided that she wants to do that in a big way and she has perhaps rightly assessed that the risk to premier is if they&#39;re with the ucp and the pc party in alberta is the call is from inside the house right and and so she has said i&#39;m not just going to get them to get me the the premiership i know that i need to maintain their support to maintain that premiership in the long haul. And so she&#39;s governing accordingly, right? So there&#39;s two ways to read it. And I guess I read it in that she has shown that she herself is in charge, right? She is the power broker who&#39;s making those decisions. She is building those coalitions.

            <span class="text">when you see a poll and you see, hey, 19 times out of 20, it&#39;s supposed to be within 3%, right? Yes. Two things about that. One thing I will always tell people is it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s equally likely to be 3% off and not off at all. It&#39;s a curve. So you should assume that it&#39;s as close to this, but the probability goes down. But that one time out of 20, it&#39;s going to be more than 3% off, right? It&#39;s going to be more than three points off. It&#39;s going to be further outside of that. And if you start going into like one in a hundred, it&#39;s going to be a lot more than that, but we&#39;re not seeing that. Instead, we&#39;re seeing pollsters all very, very close perpetually. A couple of points difference, max. Harris up one, Trump up one. Trump up one, Harris up one. even you know this is what people are getting and the odds of that are basically zero you know they are zero that pollsters would all be coming independently to such close numbers and the suspicion is that pollsters are looking at the numbers and they&#39;re trying to play it safe because a modern pollster is not doing what we call a purely probabilistic sample they are not just getting a thousand random people and saying whatever those people are wherever they live within this jurisdiction we just assume that they are a random sample that just because that&#39;s not how the world works now it&#39;s harder to get a hold of certain demographics so every pollster does something called waiting which is where they say okay well we wanted 30 young people and we only got 20. so every young person&#39;s opinion will essentially wait for 1.5 and we wanted to have</span>

            <span class="text">500 people over the age of 50 and we ended up with 700 so we&#39;re going to wait them down So those opinions are worth less. And so this is what every pollster does and they wait by different things. And one of the things that the polling industry did after their miss in 2016 where they didn&#39;t see Donald Trump&#39;s victory coming is they said, well, how did we miss this? And they went and they looked at their models and they decided where they didn&#39;t consider</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">consider enough was education. education we talked a little bit about this on the last one right</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">so then they rebuilt their models and they asked demographics about education and then that helped find those um you know rust belt voters that were all breaking for trump in a way but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">but you know the problem with that is you&#39;re fitting it always to the last election and you&#39;re always fixing towards the last election and you miss the changes in the current election you miss the changes in you know what&#39;s the important uh demographic that you should be looking at. You miss the changes on who&#39;s a likely voter. There&#39;s a lot of reason right now to believe that&#39;s what&#39;s happening. I&#39;ve talked for a minute on this fucker. Maybe I&#39;ll stop and get Carter&#39;s reaction here, but I do want to tell the H&amp;K story about our own- No, no, no. The floor is yours. Keep going. I</span>

Oh, everyone else has Harris only up by one. I&#39;m going to look pretty dumb if Donald Trump ends up winning this thing because he often overperforms his polls and it&#39;s actually Trump plus two. I&#39;d rather my poll set plus one. So, what might I be missing? So,</span>

            <span class="speaker">Corey</span>
            <span class="text">So, then they go back into their analysis and they look at what they&#39;re cutting it against and and they will say yeah okay well you know this sample&#39;s looking a little shaky maybe i need to shore it up maybe i need to go ask 500 more people so they might run up their sample more to see if that changes things they might actually change their demographic weighting most pollsters will try not to do that in the middle of like an election but it&#39;s very possible and they they end up getting a result that&#39;s the same and they do that out of fear more than um malfeasance I guess that&#39;s the thing I would say.

Donald Trump is not exuding strength right now. If you wanted probably the, and I mentioned this last episode too, one of the stronger stronger pieces of evidence that Trump is likely to lose. It&#39;s that Trump is acting as though he&#39;s likely to lose. The way he&#39;s acting does not look strong. He</span>

            <span class="text">But there&#39;s also this added element. We talked about this from the Patreon episode where Elon Musk and others have been delegated to take on the GOTV canvassing operation, and those operations have been pushing early voting a bit as well. We don&#39;t know how aggressively on the throttle they&#39;ve been pushing for early voting, but But we know it&#39;s not the bastardization of early voting that happened in 2020, where they talked about it as being fraudulent and otherwise. Trump&#39;s kind of backed off that rhetoric a bit. So if you can also think about early voting being part of the Republican mix, and so if that&#39;s the case, the point becomes even stronger for Harris that Republicans are not just sitting out early voting. Some of them have encouraged friends, family, and others to go vote early, and you still see this massive gender split. But I do want to go to you on this, Carter, because you talked about male voters being reliable. Tell me more.</span>
