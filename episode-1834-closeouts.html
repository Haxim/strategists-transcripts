        <div class="desc"><p>One election is over (the Alberta UCP leadership review) and one's just around the corner (as if you don't know). The gang assembles.</p><blockquote><p><em>Corey Hogan and Stephen Carter discuss the strategic possibilities of Danielle Smith's overwhelming endorsement at her leadership review before turning their attention to the final hours of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. Does the result mean Danielle Smith has a strengthened hand, one less excuse when things go wrong, or both? Is Harris' last-minute positivity strategy the wrong antidote to continued Trump rage? And is Stephen's latest prediction a dark sign of the apocalypse or a noble act of community service? Zain Velji, as always, picks the questions and keeps everybody in line.</em></p></blockquote></div>

That&#39;s just not going to be available to her at the same time. And while this is not the biggest component of that story it&#39;s a component of that story she has total control of her party you can&#39;t you can&#39;t as an albertan look at it and say well she&#39;s just trying to maintain the good will of the right in order to govern that&#39;s no longer a story that anybody should or could believe at this point but i think if you&#39;re looking at it as the alberta ndp you also have to be pretty you</div>

          <div class="said">when you see a poll and you see, hey, 19 times out of 20, it&#39;s supposed to be within 3%, right? Yes. Two things about that. One thing I will always tell people is it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s equally likely to be 3% off and not off at all. It&#39;s a curve. So you should assume that it&#39;s as close to this, but the probability goes down. But that one time out of 20, it&#39;s going to be more than 3% off, right? It&#39;s going to be more than three points off. It&#39;s going to be further outside of that. And if you start going into like one in a hundred, it&#39;s going to be a lot more than that, but we&#39;re not seeing that. Instead, we&#39;re seeing pollsters all very, very close perpetually. A couple of points difference, max. Harris up one, Trump up one. Trump up one, Harris up one. even you know this is what people are getting and the odds of that are basically zero you know they are zero that pollsters would all be coming independently to such close numbers and the suspicion is that pollsters are looking at the numbers and they&#39;re trying to play it safe because a modern pollster is not doing what we call a purely probabilistic sample they are not just getting a thousand random people and saying whatever those people are wherever they live within this jurisdiction we just assume that they are a random sample that just because that&#39;s not how the world works now it&#39;s harder to get a hold of certain demographics so every pollster does something called waiting which is where they say okay well we wanted 30 young people and we only got 20. so every young person&#39;s opinion will essentially wait for 1.5 and we wanted to have</div>

          <div class="said">500 people over the age of 50 and we ended up with 700 so we&#39;re going to wait them down So those opinions are worth less. And so this is what every pollster does and they wait by different things. And one of the things that the polling industry did after their miss in 2016 where they didn&#39;t see Donald Trump&#39;s victory coming is they said, well, how did we miss this? And they went and they looked at their models and they decided where they didn&#39;t consider</div>

Oh, everyone else has Harris only up by one. I&#39;m going to look pretty dumb if Donald Trump ends up winning this thing because he often overperforms his polls and it&#39;s actually Trump plus two.

We talked about this from the Patreon episode where Elon Musk and others have been delegated to take on the GOTV canvassing operation, and those operations have been pushing early voting a bit as well. We don&#39;t know how aggressively on the throttle they&#39;ve been pushing for early voting, but But we know it&#39;s not the bastardization of early voting that happened in 2020, where they talked about it as being fraudulent and otherwise. Trump&#39;s kind of backed off that rhetoric a bit. So if you can also think about early voting being part of the Republican mix, and so if that&#39;s the case, the point becomes even stronger for Harris that Republicans are not just sitting out early voting. Some of them have encouraged friends, family, and others to go vote early, and you still see this massive gender split. But I do want to go to you on this, Carter, because you talked about male voters being reliable. Tell me more.</div>
