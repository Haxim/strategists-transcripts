            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">can say that tell us what you really think it&#39;s good yeah a pig is a highly respected animal in my culture we don&#39;t we don&#39;t eat them uh we don&#39;t go near them um wait okay i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m making a good point or not listen carter i mean annalise i think it&#39;s an interesting sort of ad campaign the timing is fast there&#39;s so many things that fucking interesting interest me about this campaign that i find fascinating um but let me maybe start here which is how</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">really it&#39;s possible that the conservatives are running an a campaign for three million dollars we can talk about the money because i think the buy is interesting um but</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">but they literally have not faced any defining of Pierre Polyev by Justin Trudeau, at least through paid media and the liberals. So they find themselves this very frictionless lane to do something that they have to do, right? And we could quibble about the creative and I&#39;ll get into it if you want me to and give you my thoughts on it. But I think the most fascinating thing is that Pierre Polyev has been the leader for a long time. Before he became the leader, they knew he was going to become the leader. And now he has this opportunity after months of developing his own creative, after months of actually being a total unhinged prick to the general public, after having many faults of his own, he gets this golden opportunity to define himself. The most interesting thing to me beyond</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">beyond the advertising campaign is that, that the liberal inaction, the liberal sort of you know inability or lack of resources or lack of imagination or lack of urgency the liberal lack has allowed this moment to happen uh where he now gets to spend i think at minimum three million dollars to start redefining himself is actually the most flabbergasting part of this for me okay</span>

Didn&#39;t she give that great speech at his victory for the leadership? I mean, all of this we</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s early. Because I think one of the things you need to do with an ad campaign like this is not convert people right away, but is soften the terrain. And</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">And as much as it&#39;s about softening his image, the whole purpose of the campaign is to soften the terrain so he becomes more acceptable. And I think the big challenge for the liberals, when you look at the current polls, where the gap that used to be a deadlock or a relative deadlock, regardless of which poll you&#39;d look at, has now widened a bit. The liberals have really maybe one, if not two strategies. And I&#39;m not going to be the first to say this.</span>

            <span class="text">They are positioned right now to lose. If they keep Justin Trudeau, they&#39;re positioned to lose. So one of the things they have to do is make Pierre Pierre Polyev, largely unacceptable, just void him as saying, you know, there&#39;s some good things, but like this one or two things that makes this guy impossible to support. Impossible. That&#39;s the bar. That&#39;s actually quite literally the bar. And by giving them the summer&#39;s months to start the softening campaign, his image and the ground, to give them the $3 million runway to do that with, I think, a pretty solid ad, allows them to tell this chapter of the story now now until a more aggressive, assertive, cost of living chapter reintroduce that whenever they need to. And so I think this is a perfect time because this is not an ad to convert people. This is an ad about reach and frequency. This is about getting a lot of repetition, hearing Anita Polyev&#39;s voice over and over for the first two seconds, which I thought were brilliant because it starts with a rhetorical question, who is Pierre Polyev? And then she goes on to to answer that question. This is about reaching frequency and there&#39;s no better time to do it than the summer months in many ways where you have platforms like YouTube and other places where you&#39;re just going to hear that message. Who&#39;s Pierre Polyev? Who&#39;s Pierre Polyev? She&#39;s going to propose the question. She&#39;s going to answer the question in 15, 30s and one minute length videos. I think this is a very smart strategy and a very timely strategy. What annoys the fuck out of me is that it was a very predictable strategy that there is there&#39;s absolutely no retort to carter yeah</span>

            <span class="text">Yeah. So this is going to be an intensive burst. So the liberals are maybe lucky in that regard, that this is not a $15 million campaign. Now, it easily could be. If Polyev and team seem like this is paying dividends, that it&#39;s starting to get out into to the culture that people are starting to soften on, and they&#39;ll focus group this mid-cycle of the campaign. They will have online studies and recall tests as any good ad maker would. But the opportunity that the liberals have here is to respond to it exactly on their terms. They should have done this earlier. The opportunity still exists for them to do it. I do want to pick up on a couple of points Carter made, if I&#39;m not interrupting you, Carter, because that&#39;s the the last thing i&#39;d want to do where where that&#39;s the last thing i want to do on</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">like there is almost like a method acting persona that pierre polyev will have to adapt if this campaign is successful he&#39;s gonna going to have to keep it up. And what he&#39;s going to have to keep up is this duality. What I liked that they weren&#39;t selling about Pierre Poliev is that he&#39;s this nice guy and that he&#39;s been misinterpreted. No, actually, what they&#39;re selling is he is this prick, right, in the chamber, but he&#39;s also this family man that you don&#39;t get a side of. And I thought that was smart because it still lets him be him in one lane while still having this duality. But Carter&#39;s not wrong. He&#39;s going to have to make sure that that other side of him, we&#39;re not going to get to see his family life presents itself in public life. How does he do that? You&#39;re going to have to engineer opportunities for him to do that at rallies, at one-on-one events, at other videos that they record, in these quasi-viral moments that they try to engineer, where you see that softer side. And you saw a few of those during the leadership campaign, like that moment I recall is the one where he was lifting his wife on his shoulders after a stump speech or some sort of rally event in Toronto. That was a human moment. But Carter&#39;s right. They&#39;re going to have to continue to engineer this. Where I think this ad also succeeds is two other points. Number one, it&#39;s really this concept that it doesn&#39;t try to re-engineer what a political introduction ad looks like. And Carter, I don&#39;t know how many times you&#39;ve been in this situation where you&#39;re with a client or you&#39;re in a room with fellow politicos and they&#39;re asking for what an intro ad should look like, and you give them a pretty good rundown of what an ad should look like, what components it should have. And the answer always is, well, haven&#39;t we seen that before? And the answer back by a good ad maker is, that&#39;s the fucking point, right?</span>
          </div>
        
          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">right? There is something familiar about this. The fact that they&#39;re going for effective versus novel is a big lesson that I use in my work when I create ads, right? And we&#39;ve had the opportunity to talk about that before on the show is you&#39;re trying to actually not win awards here. You&#39;re trying to persuade people with something that sounds, looks, and feels familiar. They have fallen for this before. This has worked 50 times before. And that&#39;s the point. And often, it&#39;s those that try to win awards that go with something novel or hyper-creative or clever, which appeases us as the creatives, but isn&#39;t targeted to the audience. So one of the things I love about this ad is that I predicted it, we predicted it, and that&#39;s exactly the point. Yeah.</span>

          <div class="turn">
            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">fully. He has to have moments of this person because they&#39;re not selling this guy. They&#39;re selling this as one of his multitudes, right? And so I think he can continue to be a version of him and still soften the ground with paid, Carter. We&#39;ve seen politicians who we&#39;ve built brands for that are complete fucking pricks, that are complete losers sometimes, that are not the intellectual heavyweights, that are not the charisma sort of folks that we feel like that the brand we have constructed for them. I don&#39;t see how this is any different. People have to to see flashes of this. They don&#39;t have to see this. Now, does he have to stay in that character a bit? Yes, which is where I kind of agree with that sort of method. He has to always kind of bring it back to that. He always has to make it part of his persona, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re trying to reinvent him. I thought this is why I think it was done really smartly with the pairing of the other ads where he can kind of be a bit navel gazey with one where he has the puzzle pieces and then he could be a complete prick on the carbon tax. He&#39;s got other modalities. He&#39;s with carter is that he has to become this person because i don&#39;t think that&#39;s the the case yeah you</span>

            <span class="text">brand for the moment. And I still argue it is a great brand for Canadian politics. It enables a whole bunch of things. And if I were running a leadership campaign or any other campaign, I would re-look at it again if the right candidate came forward. But the problem that we had is that it really wasn&#39;t of interest to Alison. It wasn&#39;t who Alison was. Alison&#39;s husband, Glenn, did tremendous amount of work raising their daughter. He was the, I would say, primary caregiver. Alison had had an international career. career. She really, I think, understood the international relations model and arguably would have made a better prime minister than she would have made a premier. But we built a brand for her. We constructed the brand. We put her in the brand. The brand worked. It was unbelievable. But then at some point, she fell out of the brand. She was unable to sustain the brand position that was constructed for her because at the end of the day, it wasn&#39;t in her character to hold that brand position. So, you know, having lost that and, and Zane, there can be criticism. There could be a criticism that says, you know, you shouldn&#39;t try and put, you shouldn&#39;t try and build a brand around something that people aren&#39;t, but we&#39;re selling things here. And one of the things we have to sell is the person that we are working for. And selling that person sometimes means crafting the product that people want rather than the product that we have. have um and i would argue that if you know rachel notley uh had some opportunities to be crafted in a little bit different fashion but she probably rebelled against those she probably rebelled against those pieces and as a result maybe she wasn&#39;t able to win but</span>

            <span class="text">it&#39;s interesting, because you&#39;ve seen throughout history that you can almost classify on the top line, a brand for certain candidates. And there&#39;s a school of thinking. And I think this one applied from the United States applied specifically to to Democrats. They said, Democrats were either one of these three Ps. They were preachers, they were professors, or they were pugilists, right? And you could choose a lane. And you could go back and dissect any Democratic primary, and you&#39;d find your preachers, your Cory Booker types. You&#39;d find your professors, your Barack Obamas, which was interesting because he was a professorial, but he also had a bit of preacher in him, right, when he needed to be from the stage. And you&#39;d have your professor types, right? Right. You&#39;ve had your Bernie. You didn&#39;t have the Riz, as the kids would say, but he had the goods. Right. And Elizabeth Warren, I think, is a great example. Right. In our recent memory, she was literally quite literally a professor before she became a senator in that sense. So you almost had this breakdown. And I think you see a similar breakdown in conservative politics. Right. And I think Pierre, if he&#39;s picking a lane, is picking that pugilist lane. Like I&#39;d almost classify appear as pugilist partner parent right like this is the brand that they&#39;re trying and it&#39;s not as poetic as carter&#39;s like what was that carter that she had for allison i thought that was really nice uh mother of</span>

What he isn&#39;t going for is partner-parent. He&#39;s not going for two things, right? He&#39;s going for that third thing. And I think as long as he can keep elements of those two, I think he&#39;s fine. When you look at brands that don&#39;t fit, Carter&#39;s absolutely right. And I think part of it is how much load are you putting on each of these three, if I&#39;m using this as an example. How much load are you putting to say, listen, people already know you as X, and X is a liability. Pugilist is a liability. We need you to be these other two things. And I think where this fails is when you&#39;re trying to actually rebrand, but you say rebrand, but you actually mean change, right? Like when you say rebrand, but internally you actually mean we need to change this fucking person.</span>

            <span class="speaker">Zain</span>
            <span class="text">That&#39;s when it fails. And Carter, I kind of point back not to be reductive to the examples where they failed for you, but in some ways, yes, they were those things. Allison was that brand that you put for her, but it was an inch deep. It was an inch deep. She didn&#39;t want to be it. And it was just one of the things she could have been that day. And it was not something she had pure conviction to. And I think where the brand fails is where you actually want to change from someone, and you&#39;re hoping that the rebrand changes them. And that&#39;s a huge trap in politics, that we do a rebrand, and that we&#39;re actually not just trying to present externally, that we&#39;re hoping that some cognitive dissonance will take this rebrand, they&#39;ll internalize, they&#39;ll say, I need to be this person and they&#39;ll do it. And often that&#39;s an issue of political staffers and political strategists not being able to speak truth to power saying you actually need fundamental changes here, not just a rebrand, because that&#39;s how we&#39;re selling it externally. What you need to do internally is this.</span>

And what I mean by that, we haven&#39;t seen the 30-second version of the Aneta Polyev one. We haven&#39;t seen the 15-second version of the Aneta Polyev one, right? One question I have for them is as much as I like the one-minute one, and it may sound like I love it. I&#39;m not endeared by it. I think it&#39;s smart. I think it&#39;s the right thing to do. I think it&#39;s effective. But can it be effective in 15-second bursts? And why I think that is such an important tactical question in today&#39;s politics is that the 15-second unskippable ad is the ad, is the ad. We think of political ads as ones or thirties or even two-minute things that people watch rarely, right? This is not an ad in the leadership for the base. This is an ad for everyday Canadians who do not know who Pierre Polyev is, Carter, and trying to get a reach and frequency and repetition over and over and over. And here that&#39;s problem, answer, problem, answer. Can they do it as emotionally? Can they do it with that same connective tissue in 15 seconds is a question I have for them.

            <span class="text">most of the UCP&#39;s content did not hit the 15 second. They did 30s of almost everything. If they were longer, they didn&#39;t do 15s. And so I&#39;m not convinced there is a 15 that exists, but if there is, I would die to see it. Because can they create an emotional resonance like the one minute does in 15? It goes back to that Lincoln quote or that misattributed quote, right? Sorry, I didn&#39;t write a shorter letter, right? I wrote you this long one because that was easier instead. Same with ads, right? Can you tell that same resonant story in six or 15? If you can, you&#39;re at the top of your game. I&#39;m really curious what happens there. But to your question of why 3 million isn&#39;t a lot, if you look at where if you assume they&#39;re targeting, because I haven&#39;t been able to see the Facebook library just yet, and you can&#39;t see it on YouTube. If you&#39;re assuming there&#39;s a TV buy, if you&#39;re assuming that there&#39;s a digital buy, if you assume these products are going where the election is going to be won, Lower Mainland, 905, and Quebec, you see that there&#39;s a French language version for all of them. $3 million doesn&#39;t get you very far, especially if you&#39;re adding traditional media to it, which has a lot of spillage. And by traditional, I mean television. So I think this is going to be maybe a two, three-week campaign, maybe a month if they&#39;re miserly with their money and i think to me if they&#39;re smart and this is working and they&#39;ve got their own kpis for judging what working means this is a initial three million dollar campaign that actually has a much larger spend uh if some of these pieces are working yeah</span>

These minor tactical decisions, as Carter will attest to, matter. And when you&#39;re trying to get a very simple message out there, who&#39;s this guy?

I mean, he didn&#39;t win the last two by-elections. He has issues that are dogging him, and this is going to be one of those issues. The fact that he&#39;s able to stand up there and say, I would do anything to build houses, the next words out of someone&#39;s mouth just simply means, yeah, but you know what? I think that I could build houses without giving billions of dollars to my friends. I think I&#39;d be able to do that. why does building houses include giving billions of dollars to your friends it shouldn&#39;t that shouldn&#39;t have to be baked in to get houses built in the province of alb in the province of of uh ontario you</span>

And the adversary in that particular case was from the Liberals&#39; own caucus shortly, you know, the former minister. But nonetheless, I mean, if if if you can solve this with a simple staffing change, then solve it with a simple staffing change. If you can&#39;t solve this with a simple staffing change, then be prepared to go to go, you know, go to the next level. And that&#39;s going to require more input and more discussion from the premier&#39;s office on how to manage this. And that&#39;s what the liberals and that&#39;s what the NDP should be working for, making sure that this thing isn&#39;t solved by one sacrificial lamb from one office.</span>
